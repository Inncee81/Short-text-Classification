is this offensive to you please help ok so my mother and i don't see eye to eye she is a staunch southern baptist and i am a goddess loving dianic anyway her and i tend to get along and i love my mom sometimes she will talk to me about god and i let her i understand where she is coming from in her worry for my soul and we have good discussions and she helps me however sometimes she will say very offensive things normally i just let them roll like her views on stem cell research gay marriage etc well today don't ask me how we got to this point but she said that the gay lifestyle was being promoted to children and i was like what are you talking about it's not like they sell lesbian bratz dolls and she explained how she saw a book in b n about mommy and mommy explaining same sex parenting it was probably one of those for kids with two mommies i told her i didn't want to talk about it and then she said that the kids are better off with god then with a gay couple thoughts i didn't want to talk about it because there is no changing i love my mom but there is no point arguing about it sometimes her and i have to agree to disagree and i am not an adolescent lol i am with a family of my own and i didn't tell her she was wrong i told her i disagreed i loved how many of the answers went to bashing me or my mom or christians in general this wasn't what i was trying to get after it was a question i just wanted to see how others responded to check my own feelings on it all when i left the conversation with my mom i told her to ask my dad what he thought about her statement and she called me back just now and said she was sorry she meant with god but didn't think about the killing part she ammended her statement to say that they should be in shelters i am totally on your side i don't understand the christian rights evangelicals preoccupation with homosexuals as if homosexuality is being shoved in everyones faces same sex couples are still a minority and those with kids are an even smaller number and what does she mean by better off with god meaning better off dead that is crazy it would be better for a child to have loving same sex parents rather than a dysfunctional heterosexual one it is just another example of how some people use religion to condone their own prejudices my grandmother is a devout catholic but she is still open minded and nonjudmental all you can do is let your mom know that you two will just have to agree to disagree there's no changing a person's mind when it comes to religion Sexual orientation Homosexuality and Christianity Laura Schlessinger Reparative therapy Homosexuality Homophobia Ex-gay Same-sex marriage Marriage Little Britain James Dobson Religion and sexual orientation Transsexuality North American Man/Boy Love Association Religion and sexuality Human sexual behavior Sex education Feminism Biology and sexual orientation Evil Infantilism Cindy Sheehan Married... with Children Christianity Societal attitudes towards homosexuality Ten Commandments Pedophilia Baptist Abortion debate Rick Santorum Family First Party Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Heterosexuality Criticism of Mormonism Theory of conduct Christian right Cult Children of God Autism Love Homosexuality and Judaism Rent (musical) Social rule Gay Shaggy dog story Bisexuality Anglican views of homosexuality Joke Friends Sharon Tate Separation of church and state Federal Marriage Amendment Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Homosexuality in China A Course In Miracles South Park Homosexuality and Bah__'__ Faith The Marshall Mathers LP Intelligent design John the Baptist Aesthetic Realism Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints EastEnders Lawrence v.
