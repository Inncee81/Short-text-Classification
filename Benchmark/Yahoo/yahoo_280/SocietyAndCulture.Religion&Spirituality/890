hindus and prayer i saw this answer posted on another question regarding drinking milk from cows yes we are allowed to drink cow milk it's not considered part of cow's body as in meat or non veg the cow's compared to a mother who provides milk to toddlers and that's why you'll see us pray to cows do hindus pray to cows and what is the significance of praying to a cow what are hindu beliefs about god the only reason that the cow is considered sacred is because of its symbolic value the cow is an animal that provides us with milk and because of this along with it's peaceful nature it is perceived as being akin to the symbol of a mother the cow is not a hindu deity that hindus worship you may have come across many stupid insults against hindus as being cow worshipers it is only sacred due to its symbolic value hinduism like all asian religions buddhism confucianism taoism shintoism is obsessed with symbolism for example a certain animal symbolizes a certain concept a certain color symbolizes a certain concept while a certain season symbolizes a certain concept eg the cow is sacred because it symbolizes motherhood the bull symbolizes virility black symbolizes power etc hinduism isn't like the abrhamic religions in the sense that it does not have a single founder but it is a primoridal religion that has existed for over thousands and thousands of years and has evovled over time incorporating many philosophies and many different belief systems also the real name of hinduism actually is not hinduism but it is sanathan dharma which in sanscrit means eternal religion because islam christianity and judaism are much younger religions than hinduism and have founders they may on the surface appear more coherent and comprehensive than hinduism hinduism may appear slightly complicated but that is because like i say it is a religion that has evolved over years and does not have a founder there needs to be a greater deal of study discussion debate and the production of hindu scholarship by hindu scholars academics leaders and representatives from the different hindu sects this not only needs to take place between hindus but also between hinduism and its afiiliates sikhism jainism and buddhism this will allow hindus and non hindus to understand hinduism better i have always defined hinduism as an umbrella religion which has many different sub religions within it rather than as a single religion in terms of the god that we follow many have point blank argued that hinduism should be considered an polytheistic religion because we have many deities such an assessment is misleading hinduism is actually more of a monotheistic religion than the people of the book moslems christians and jews appreciate because at the heart of the hindu definition of god is that of the brahman an all encompassing almighty moreover the hindu holy books such as the vedas upanishads and purannas clearly state that there is only one god the three best websites are www hinduism co za www hinduwisdon info www sanatansociety org ignore any ignorant hindu who tells you that hinduism worships cows many are ignorant about their own religion the problem is that hinduism in terms of its content is bigger than all the abrahamic religions put together i don't mean this in a bad way what i mean is that hinduism is a massive religion and it can thus get easy to get lost with muslims jews and christians they have one main bible each and thus they know exactly what to read whereas hindus have main bibles moreover each hindu bible is actually bigger than the holy bible used by christians they are all as important as each other this sheer size of hinduism alone discourages many hindus especially young hindus from taking an interest in their religion and as that ignorant hindu demonstrated they say absurd comments in none of these does it say that we are required to worship cows check out my question that i posted a while ago http answers yahoo com question index ylt aipmz utv iuv s vqfy apty ix qid aatnibi Dharma Avatar Ten Commandments Tantra Polytheism The nature of God in Western theology Human Religious conversion Guru Jewish principles of faith Devil Karma in Hinduism Karma Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Major world religions Vegetarianism and religion Max Weber Brahman Predestination Jainism Status of religious freedom in Malaysia Sathya Sai Baba Ramakrishna Apostasy Vedanta Ayyavazhi Taoism Religious perspectives on Jesus Fasting Prophet Satanism A Course In Miracles Holy Spirit Jewish views of religious pluralism Neofascism and religion Rastafari movement Bhagavad Gita Vishnu sahasranama Indian caste system Angel Mormonism and Judaism Goddess God and gender Hell Pharisees Trimurti Creationism Existence of God Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Evolutionary creationism Jesus Lingam Soul
