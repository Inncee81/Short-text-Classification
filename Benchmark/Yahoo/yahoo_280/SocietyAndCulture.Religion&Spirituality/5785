muslims if your religion is so peaceful then why do the jihadists feel justified by the qur'an the fact that they are using the qur'an and the islamic teachings as backing for their holy war suggests that islam is not as peaceful as you might be suggesting can't you just admit that there are some non peaceful passages in the qur'an and for the record i'm not anti muslim i do understand the difference between a jihadist and a moderate muslim but why do we never see any news headlines of muslims standing against the jihadists buttercup way to go to dodge giving an actual answer to the question but christianity did 'such and such' proud to be a muslimah you realize that the ayat you quoted says essentially to kill anyone until they convert to islam from the death book the koran let those who would exchange the life of this world for the hereafter fight of the cause of allah whoever fights for the cause of allah whether he dies or triumphs on him we shall bestow a rich recompense allah has purchased from the faithful their lives and worldly goods and in return has promised them the garden they will fight for the cause of allah they will slay and be slain believers make war on the infidels who dwell around you when you meet the unbelievers in the battlefield strike off their heads and when you have laid them low bind your captives firmly muhammad is allah s apostle those who follow him are ruthless to the unbelievers but merciful to one another prophet make war on the unbelievers and the hypocrites and deal sternly with them hell shall be their home evil their fate unbelievers are those who declare god is the messiah the son of mary believers take neither jews nor the christians for your friends they are friends with one another say people of the book is it not that you hate us only because we believe in allah and in what has been revealed to us and what was formerly revealed and because most of you are evil doers say shall i tell you who will receive a worse reward from allah those whom allah has cursed and with whom he has been angry transforming them into apes and swine and those who serve the devil unbelievers are those that say god is the messiah the son of mary unbelievers are those that say god is one of three say unbelievers i do not worship what you worship no do you worship what i worship i shall never worship what you worship nor will you ever worship what i worship you have your own religion and i have mine and when you journey in the earth there is no blame on you if you shorten the prayer if you fear that those who disbelieve will cause you distress surely the unbelievers are your open enemy the true believers are those that have faith in allah and his apostle and never doubt and who fight with their wealth and with their persons in the cause of allah such are those whose faith is true o you who believe do not take for intimate friends from among others than your own people they do not fall short of inflicting loss upon you they love what distresses you vehement hatred has already appeared from out of their mouths and what their breast conceal is greater still indeed we have made the communications clear to you if you will understand o you who believe do not make friends with a people with whom allah is wroth angry indeed they despair of the hereafter as the unbelievers despair of those in tombs islamic plan of salvation so when you meet in battle those who disbelieve then smite the necks until when you have overcome them then make them prisoners and afterwards either set them free as a favor or let them ransom themselves until the war terminates that shall be so and if allah had pleased he would certainly have exacted what is due from them but that he may try some of you by means of others and as for those who are slain in the way of allah he will by no means allow their deeds to perish he will guide them and improve their condition and cause them to enter the garden which he has made known to them say to the desert arabs who stayed behind you shall be called upon to fight a mighty nation unless they embrace islam if you prove obedient allah will reward you well but if you run away as you have done before this he will inflict on you a stern chastisement it shall be no offense for the blind the lame and the sick to stay behind he that obeys allah and his apostle shall be admitted to gardens watered by running streams but he that turns and flees shall be sternly painfully punished by him believers do not betray allah and the apostle nor knowingly betray your trust know that your worldly goods and your children are but a temptation and that allah s recompense is great whoever desires this world s life and its finery we will pay them in full their deeds therein and they shall not be made to suffer loss in respect of them these are they for whom there is nothing but fire in the hereafter and what they wrought in it shall go for nothing and vain is what they do wealth and children are an adornment of the life of this world and the everabiding the good works are better with your lord in reward and better in expectation the life of this world is but a sport and a diversion it is the life to come that is the true life and know that whatever thing you gain a fifth of it is for allah and for the apostle and for the near of kin and the orphans and the needy and the wayfarer if you believe in allah and in that which we revealed to our servant on the day of distinction the day on which the two parties met and allah has power over all things whatever allah has restored to his apostle from the people of the towns it is for allah and for the apostle and for the near of kin and the orphans and the needy and the wayfarer so that it may not be a think taken by turns among the rich of you accept it and from whatever he forbids you keep back and be careful of your duty to allah surely allah is severe in retributing evil o you who believe when you consult the apostle then offer something in charity before your consultation that is better for you and purer but if you do not find then surely allah is forgiving merciful terrorism how many were the populations we utterly destroyed because of their inequities setting up their place with other peoples and there are some people who say we believe in allah and the last day and they are not at all believers they desire to deceive allah and those who believe and they deceive only themselves and they do not perceive there is a disease in their hearts so allah added to their disease and they shall have a painful chastisement because they lied surely those who act in opposition to allah and his apostle shall be laid down prostrate as those before them were laid down prostrate and indeed we have revealed clear communication and unbelievers shall have a abasing chastisement a humiliating penalty surely the tree of zaqqum is the food of the sinful like dregs of oil it shall boil in their bellies like the boiling of hot water seize him then drag him down into the middle of the hell then pour above his head of the torment of the boiling water and as to those who disbelieve in and reject my communications they are the inmates of the fire in it they shall abide and when there came to them a book from allah verifying that which they have and aforetime they used to pray for victory against those who disbelieve but when there came to them prophet that which they did not recognize they disbelieved in him so allah s curse is on the unbelievers evil is that for which they have sold their souls that they should deny what allah has revealed out of envy that allah should send down of his grace on whomsoever of his servants he pleases so they have made themselves deserving of wrath upon wrath and there is a disgraceful punishment for the unbelievers the punishment of those who wage war against allah and his apostle and serve to make mischief in the land is only this that they should be murdered or crucified or their hands and their feet should be cut off on opposite sides or they should be imprisoned this shall be as a disgrace for them in this world and in the hereafter they shall have a grievous chastisement on the day when heat will be produced out of the wealth in the fire of hell and wit it will be branded their foreheads their sides and their backs this is the treasure that ye buried hoarded for yourselves taste ye then the treasures that ye buried hoarded if you could see when the angels take the souls of the unbelievers to death how they smite their faces and backs saying taste the penalty of the blazing fire allah explains that non muslims will never be allowed to understand the koran and when you recite the quran we place between you and those who do not believe in the hereafter a hidden barrier and we have placed coverings on their hearts and a heaviness in their ears lest they understand it and when you mention your lord alone in the quran they turn their backs in aversion we know best what they listen to when they listen to you and when they take counsel secretly when the unjust say you follow only a man deprived of reason see what they liken you to so they have gone astray and cannot find their way
