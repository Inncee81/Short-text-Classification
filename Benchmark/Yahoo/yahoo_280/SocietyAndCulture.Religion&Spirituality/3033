is it really true that islam is the fastest growing religion right now i know that muslims would definitely so say does anyone have any independant statistics to support it actually i am in the process of writing a book about this subject however to give you a quick answer i can tell you why it appears to some that it is true ever since its establishment people converted to islam by two types of forced entry a with the sword and arm twisting for those living under the domination of an islamic rule b by marriage the ancestors of most muslims in arabia today though they might not admit it were forced to convert or else for those who are going to accuse me of making it up i recommend they read about the history of islam especially during their prophet's time read about their ghazwat as for modern days forced conversion continues in places like indonesia in egypt it is done in a wicked way where some clerics of the mosques pay young men money to date and impregnate christian young girls and then force them to convert after promising them marriage to spare them the shame however of conversion takes place through marriage a muslim woman cannot marry a non muslim unless he converts this is most prominent in the western world where the western man who is mostly someone who is indifferent about his relationship with god and is willing to convert for the woman's sake i look right and left and see this sad situation knowing well that these converts belong neither here not there another very important reason is the fact that islam does not permit muslims to leave their faith and if they do they are considered apostates and deserve to be killed for that reason when a muslim leaves his religion or converts to another they do that in secret they keep their muslim name for fear for their lives i know that in the arab world huge numbers of people and sometimes families are converting to christianities without the knowledge of their own brothers or sisters they are forced to pray in underground churches they even pretend to fast in ramadan thus these conversions remain unknown and unaccounted for oh and i must not forget the fact that while the christian world for example is taking control of the number of children it has muslims multiply like crazy and their families double in size every five years my own estimate based on my own observation being an arab surrounded by muslim friends and neighbors these are only a few reasons though i didn't give you the statistics you needed i can tell you that for the above reasons you cannot rely on any statistics besides i must add that i know about many christian converts to islam including my own husband who after a year or two or even ten years woke up terrified after realizing that they left the true god to follow a religion whose peace and love can be found only in the minds of its followers Sharia Muhammad Religious conversion Islam Christianity Nation of Islam Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Status of religious freedom in Malaysia Ramadan Status of religious freedom in Sudan Women in Islam Religion Eid ul-Fitr Muslim ibn Aqeel Islamic calendar Alawite Dhimmi Fundamentalism Bosniaks Polygamy Religion in Israel John the Baptist Five Pillars of Islam Abrahamic religion Ali Islam as a political movement Islamism Eastern Orthodox Church Apostasy in Islam Saint Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Status of religious freedom in Saudi Arabia Sunni Islam Yusuf al-Qaradawi Religious pluralism Mirza Ghulam Ahmad God Judaism Islam and anti-Semitism Islamic philosophy Islam in France Persecution of Christians Mary, the mother of Jesus Fasting Suleiman the Magnificent Religion and sexuality A Course In Miracles Assyrian people Creationism Separation of church and state Druze Status of religious freedom in Iran End times Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi Sheikh Abdullah Caliph Osama bin Laden Divorce Book of Isaiah Islam in the United States Who is a Jew?
