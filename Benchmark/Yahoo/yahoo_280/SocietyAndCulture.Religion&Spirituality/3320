do churches teach about holiness anymore many churches have left this doctrine because they feel that it is nessacary anymore i disagree holiness to me is very very important we have to remember that paul said without holiness none shall see the lord and it also says be holy for i am holy i pray that their are many more churches that teach this doctrine because it is needed in the church especially today no not really some churches are just there to make people comfortable like instead just tell the truth speaking word some just sugar code alot of stuff that needs to be said that includes dress etc bringing basely stuff of world inside church instead being different and being a example my home church is nondeminatianal i am now apostolic my home church there is alot of stuff there that do that you would see in your high school or in the street and it shouldnt be like that i not down talking my church my love my church but i am not the one that goes that doesnt what see that is not right especially with the youth i am not trying to get off subjust yeah i hope you understand what i am saying god bless Roman Catholic Church Eastern Orthodox Church Sola fide Christianity Church of Christ Opus Dei Trinity Holy Spirit Pentecostalism Papal Infallibility Eucharist Ten Commandments Book of Isaiah Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Charismatic Pope John Paul II Religious Society of Friends John Wesley Pope Benedict XVI Mary, the mother of Jesus Adam-God theory Catholicism John Howard Yoder Blessed Virgin Mary Salvation Book of Mormon Great Apostasy Coptic Christianity Apostolic Succession William M.
