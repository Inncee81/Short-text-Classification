why can't gravitationalists accept the truth don't gravitationalists realize they're basing their entire belief system on a false theory the theory of gravity is a tool used by lucifer to lure good people away from god scientific theories are supposed to agree with predictions gravity does not agree with the prediction of the ascension in revelation therefore it is a bad theory gravity teaches us that things fall down when we know plenty of things don't fall down such as helium balloons planes and missiles intelligent falling teaches us the reason that some things fall and others rise is because of the pull of god's love and satan's evil god's love pulls things upward toward heaven and satan pulls them down toward the pit of fire the reason most things fall is because most people believe in the theory of gravity so satan's pull is stronger we need to demand that the theory of intelligent falling is placed in physics textbooks as an alternative to the flawed theory of gravity who's with me agree is there anywhere i can send money to start a fund i think we need an intelligent falling museum Gravity Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Scientific method Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Evil Religion Devil Intelligent design Causality Mass General relativity Science Creationism Hell Big Bang Resurrection of Jesus Angel Satan Black hole Evolutionary creationism Physics God Paradise Lost Fundamental interaction Modern geocentrism Determinism Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Theory Criticism of Mormonism Planetary orbit Book of Revelation Freemasonry Creation-evolution controversy Soul Reincarnation Philosophy of science Christian eschatology Planet Albert Einstein Equivalence principle Prophet Existence of God Physical cosmology Origin belief Demon Time travel Moon Gospel of Thomas Original sin Human End times Satanism Cosmological argument Epistemology Incarnations of Immortality Richard Feynman Fermi paradox Rapture Dark energy Meaning of life Lucifer Theodicy Quantum mechanics Scientific skepticism String theory Etheric plane Supernova Goodness and value theory Christianity and anti-Semitism Predestination Loop quantum gravity Tide Age of Enlightenment History of creationism Young Earth creationism Microeconomics Astronomy Religious pluralism Center for Science and Culture The Amber Spyglass Modified Newtonian dynamics Non-standard cosmology Logic Urantia Antichrist Anti-gravity Truth Arthur Stanley Eddington Quantum gravity
