if god is real if god is real why are there so many different religions saying different things different beliefs occur when a person or group of people don't want to believe a certain thing a good example of this is to look at the different christian churches the catholics believe in saints baptists don't lutherans don't believe that the eucharist is converted into the body and blood of jesus judaism is similar to christianity however jewish believers deny the belief that jesus was the messiah judaism believes that the messiah has yet to come a first time as for muslims they follow similar terms as christians however they believe mohammad was sent by god not jesus if you look at the foundations of all the early religions you'll find that they are almost identical thus there must have been some starting point it is in the minor details that people have become separated thanks for asking such a question and not just closing your mind so often people use the question that you asked as their proof that god cannot exist without taking the time to look at the roots of religions hopefully i was ale to clear things up for you and if you ever want to talk about it or if you have any questions regarding anything similar feel free to drop me a line at my email joseph poma yahoo com i'm no reigion buff i probably won't be able to answer all of your questions but i'm sure i can help with anything else peace and god bless joe also one last thing a lot of times we find ourselves asking the questions how can god exist however we should also take the time to ask the questions how can god not exist think about it the earth and everything in it the stars and the skies and humans everything is created but from what evolutionists talk about the big bang theory but they always fail to address the issue about what initiated the big bang if two small atoms did collide to create everything then were did those two atoms come from get it like i said feel free to drop me a line if you wanna talk Christianity God Religious conversion Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Messianic Judaism Roman Catholic Church The nature of God in Western theology Eucharist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Creationism Trinity Prophet Abrahamic religion Origin belief Baptism Jesus Infant baptism A Course In Miracles Predestination Christian denomination Resurrection of Jesus Catholicism Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Original sin Fundamentalism Saint Religious perspectives on Jesus Mary, the mother of Jesus Supernatural Paul of Tarsus Jewish principles of faith Evolutionary creationism Religious pluralism Messiah Christian views of Jesus Baptist Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Christian eschatology Angel Religion Bible and reincarnation Jewish views of religious pluralism Sola fide Holy Spirit Christian-Jewish reconciliation Chosen people Historicity of Jesus Separation of church and state Philosophy of religion Reincarnation Church of Christ, Scientist Clergy Mormonism and Judaism Judaism Immortality Islamic philosophy Christ Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Christian Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Theodicy Prayer Protestantism Soul Idolatry Sabbath Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Book of Mormon Qiyamah Criticism of Mormonism Dispensationalism Christian Identity Great Apostasy Mormonism Existence of God Divine grace Free will Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Young Earth creationism Jewish eschatology John the Baptist Eastern Orthodox Church Evil Gospel of Thomas Rastafari movement Homosexuality and Christianity Nontrinitarianism Opus Dei Salvation
