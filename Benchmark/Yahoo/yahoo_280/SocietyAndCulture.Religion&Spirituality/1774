atheists how come you don't believe in god i'm not trying to insult you i just want to understand your point of view here's what i'm getting at you say that god does not exist but how can you be so sure wouldn't it make more sense for you to be an agnostic instead most people cannot say with certainty that god exists unless they have supernatural faith or received divine revelation much in the same way that most people cannot say with certainty that god does not exist how can you be certain that he does not exist when you just don't know all answers except nasty ones would be greatly appreciated take care look at the cosmos look at the earth look at all of creation and ponder its complexity it is painfully obvious that the universe was designed to support life everything is in perfect sync perfect if you look at an atom a strand of dna a tree a dog etc you see that something had to have created it the chances of it all happening by chance is almost impossible i have carefully read all the comments that preceded me and those people echo my own thninking very well i do have something to add ever since mankind developed into a thinking being he was afraid of everything of being eaten alive by predators of being killed by rival tribes of the sun failing to come up next morning and provide light and warmth of being hungry to the point of starvation of various illnesses of the volcanoes earthquakes typhoons and so on he needed a protector a father figure so throughout history mankind has desperately wanted a god the answer was to invent one looking through the history of man there has always been a god or a goddess with time these imagined gods have been put aside as we learn more about our planet and our universe and come to understand that the weather is a natural phenomenon and not the result of malevolent or benevolent entities recall that none of these gods have been visible none of them have been audible any intervention in the lives of mankind is attributed by the believer and not actually anything to do with reality it is therefore a case of applying intelligence to the conundrum what is more likely a wizard who is everywhere at the same time or nothing at all other than the mindless faith in such an entity by the indoctrinated achieving maturity usually means that childish preoccupations are set aside in favour of the harsh reality of this one and only life that you will get as with santa so it is with any god if you are of a certain age it was in my case you should begin to question religion it took me three years to see the light and i was when i told myself that i was an atheist it took another three years before i could 'come out of the closet' best thing i did the freedom from archaic religion is highly recommended for modern man and woman in essence your question is a lengthy version of pascal's' wager which convinces no one yet is put forward by the religious folk time after time after time as if it is the answer to their justification of their belief it isn't at all all atheists will dismiss it as infantile at best there may be some more answers that appear while i have been writing this so i can't guarantee that i agree with any later additions reality is there for your taking it really does make sense religion does the opposite Intelligent design Theodicy Creationism Simone Weil Evolutionary creationism Agnosticism The nature of God in Western theology Animism Justification (theology) Evolutionism Fundamentalism History of creationism Soul Mythology Philosophical skepticism Pascal's Wager God Emperor of Dune Gnosticism Socrates Al-Ghazali Friedrich Schleiermacher Ontological argument Urantia Creation-evolution controversy Free will Devil Biblical inerrancy Charles Darwin's views on religion David Hume Meaning of life Christian eschatology Theory of conduct Victor Cousin Jewish principles of faith Trinity Reconstructionist Judaism Original sin Discworld gods Satanism Atomism A Course In Miracles Creation science The relationship between religion and science Demon Deity Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Divine grace Theology Bertrand Russell Predestination Reincarnation The Origin of Species Religious pluralism God and gender Moral objectivism Buddhism William A.
