if someone gained enough mass could they exert their own gravitational pull actually anyone with any sort of mass whatsoever generates a gravitational pull but if for some freaky unknown reason a person got to the density of a planet then yes they would have a strong gravitational pull Gravity Mass Tide Black hole Spacecraft propulsion Gravitational slingshot Gravitational radiation Planetary orbit Gravitational lens General relativity Roche limit Schwarzschild metric Gee Equivalence principle Fundamental interaction Moon Binary star Space elevator Compact star Nuclear fusion Gravitomagnetism Solar system Weight Force Planet X Neutron star Newton's laws of motion Supernova Tests of general relativity Extrasolar planet Tidal acceleration Planet Coriolis field Modern geocentrism Precession Big Crunch Big Bang Weightlessness Kepler's laws of planetary motion Arthur Stanley Eddington Speed of gravity Amalthea (moon) Center of mass Dyson sphere Tether propulsion Astrodynamics Gravitational redshift Gravitational singularity Saturn Gravitational collapse Electric field Anti-gravity Near-Earth asteroid Standard Model Mass shadow generator Modified Newtonian dynamics Sun Planetary nebula Solar sail Gravitational constant Internal ballistics Lagrangian point Energy Comet Stress-energy tensor Frame-dragging Stargate (device) Semi-major axis Orbital period Percival Lowell Schwarzschild radius Massive compact halo object Oblate Kilogram Exact solutions in general relativity Water (molecule) Neutron Causality Bene Gesserit Celestial mechanics Einstein-Cartan theory Planck units Mercury (planet) Dark matter Classical theories of gravitation Time travel Year Mathematics of general relativity Coulomb's law Pluto Gravimetry Jedi Exile Timeline of gravitational physics and relativity John Couch Adams Principle of relativity Protostar Aikido Graviton
