christian how did you become a christian person church etc ever since i was young my parents took me to sunday school and church however going there had never really cleared up my understanding of who this god was it was like uh huh the bible eh that is soooo cool not i never really got it and just went to church every sunday bored as heck but then as i started entering jr high and beginning to face the typical difficulties of becoming a teenager i turned to god for some answers for some reason i had hit rock bottom in my life and up to taht point i could feel that something wasn't complete as corny as that sounds no matter how good things seemed to be going on in my life i was the top student in my class had lots of friends had a loving family was stable financially etc i just felt that there could be more i guess you could say something beyond me lol so it was the summer right before i headed to gr that i went to manitou lake bible camp it was just like any other camp cabin games cafetaria and activites like repelling climbing archery crafts swimming canoeing sports hiking horseback you got the point the only difference was the worshipping which was completely new to me we would open up the morning to a quick prayer and some singing and then in the evening right before a night game we would have a little sermon it wasn't long or dragged out like the old church i normally went to but it was fun invigorating and insightful there were no pressures no judgment no nothing just information that got us all thinking then one night the speaker told us that we could make a decision that could change our lives forever after telling us about jesus and his sacrifice on the cross i remember him saying that we can accept jesus' gift that he gave us when he died that gift being eternal life and the ultimate relationship with god so afterwards later that night in my cabin my counsellor and me had a long talk about what the speaker had said she my counsellor asked me do you admit that you have done some things in your life that you aren't proud of and i replied yes then she asked do you want a relationship with god not a silent and scared relationship but a genuine friendship with god and i replied very much so and that's when she told me that i could have a friendship with god by simply admitting to him and to myself that i was not perfect that i have done some things im not happy of such as lying backstabbing stealing judging and feeling hate towards certain people she told me that i can choose to repent which meant that i would do my best to turn my life around and not make the same mistakes again so right then and there i confessed my sins and accepted jesus into my heart with my counsellor there to support me the moment i truly realized that i had god in my life was the moment i felt so relieved it was as if this big weight of guilt sadness confusion and insecurity had been lifted off for once i was passionate and motivated by something and i felt compelled to live life as it was meant to be it was so like awesome knowing that i had this infinite force called god there for me does that make sense lol plus everything that i had been soo clueless about church had made sense and it was an awesome feeling to know that i was serving god for all the right reasons and not because i was told to i chose for myself that this was the way that i wanted to live my life it's been years since then that i have accepted jesus into my life and became a christian i hope that this was not too long or cheesy of an answer but i genuinely hope that this will help you out A Course In Miracles Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sola fide Sin Religion One Tree Hill (TV series) Merit Original sin Justification (theology) Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Baptism Infant baptism Rich Mullins The Amber Spyglass EastEnders Mass (liturgy) Theodicy Christian eschatology Theory of conduct Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses God Philipp Melanchthon Religious pluralism Jon Secada Christianity Friedrich Schleiermacher Social rule Trinity Roman Catholic Church John Wesley Shaggy dog story The nature of God in Western theology Religious Society of Friends Ex-gay Repentance God Emperor of Dune Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Eucharist Sacrifice Heaven Summa Theologiae Articles of Religion (Methodist) Predestination John Howard Yoder Free will Resurrection of Jesus Charles Grandison Finney Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Idolatry Martin Luther S__ren Kierkegaard Mahatma Gandhi Urantia Origin belief Immortality Opus Dei Catechism Gospel of Thomas Sabbath Socrates Homosexuality and Christianity Book of Isaiah Scientology beliefs and practices Meaning of life Abrahamic religion W.I.T.C.H.
