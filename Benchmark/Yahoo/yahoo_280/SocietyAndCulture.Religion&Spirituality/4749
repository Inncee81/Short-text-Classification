christians did your god choose to be male or did men choose it for him pagans everyone what are your thoughts it was definitely chosen by men who wanted to take power away from women the some ones who made the goddess into a whore they actually refereed to her as the great whore women into jezebels mary magdalene a prostitute they also made sure to remove her book from the bible women are not allowed to preach and it was believed that the only women who made it into heaven were nuns eve was the worlds downfall and any educated or strong woman was a succubus or witch and was put to death women were not entitled to an education it was a sin for them to know how to read and they were considered chattel there is a story about when they first converted the celts to christianity they came over from rome and were appalled to see that they had not only women priests but had even made one into a bishop my mom told me about how not that long ago after a woman gave birth she was to go to the church she had to follow after the priest while he walked away towards the alter and she had to try to grab at the hem of his robe finally when he reached the alter whe could grab the hem of his robe and this meant that she was forgiven having a child was a sin because of the sex but only for the woman i believe they feared women because of the years of goddess religions and that women being able to bear children were in a power position anyone who says that this is just a coincidence is telling themselves a lie edit blessings and love to you Eastern Orthodox Church Roman Catholic Church Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Priesthood (Mormonism) John Wesley Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Salvation The Da Vinci Code Christianity Mary, the mother of Jesus Genesis Religion and sexuality Heaven Catholicism The Amber Spyglass Sacrifice Divine grace A Course In Miracles Church of Christ Sin Homosexuality and Christianity Nun Paul of Tarsus Sabbath Christian views of women Mary Magdalene C.
