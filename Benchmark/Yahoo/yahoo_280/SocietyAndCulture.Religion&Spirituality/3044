muslim women are beneath muslim men do you agree i will prove it to you if you check sura in the quran it says the following men are managers of the affairs of women for that god has preferred in bounty one of them over another and for that they have expended of their property this surah clearly tells us men are above women so how can muslim women say they are equal to men also just a note if anyone mentions a hadith prophets sayings saying the prophet said man is equal to woman please let me know becuase a hadith should not contradict the quran quran stands by itself if a hadith contradicts the quran the hadith is considered to be invalid also the quran does says respect your parents don't use the argument saying the prophet said mother is most important person in the world mother is a parent a man can beat his wife and his daughter but not his mother so once again on what basis do western muslimah considers themselves equal to men when it is clearly forbidden in the quran i would prefer western muslim women answer this question becuase muslims believe the quran is direct message from allah and is not tainted by the culture thinking that existed at that time period for some people accused me for taking this surah out of context so here is the rest of the surah righteous women are therefore obedient guarding the secret for god's guarding and those you fear may be rebellious admonish banish them to their couches and beat them if they then obey you look not for any way against them god is all high all great also saying muslim women are treated equal to muslim men in america is not a valid argument because the women enjoy these rights because of our secular government shariah does not support this most muslim women gracefully live their lives beneath muslim men as you say they are born and raised to believe that this is the way they should act that this is the right way they see nothing wrong with their own culture they think western culture is corrupt and women are abused here seen as sexual objects it's really striking how different cultures can be even when they have so many of the same problems Apostasy in Islam Qur'an Sharia Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Virgin Mary in Islam Muhammad Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Salah Aisha Abrahamic religion Sunni Islam John the Baptist Jizya Ten Commandments Fundamentalism Hadith Qur'an alone Prophets of Islam Polygamy Abraham Sufism Religious conversion Prophet Mary, the mother of Jesus Noah Angels in Islam Nikah Mut'ah Marriage Qiyamah Women as imams Islam and anti-Semitism Succession to Muhammad Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions United Submitters International Sex segregation Zia-ul-Haq's Islamization Separation of church and state Gospel of Barnabas Maria al-Qibtiyya Hijab Shi'a Islam Historical persecution by Muslims Abd al-Rahman ibn Sakhr Muhammad's marriages Simone Weil Domestic violence Homosexuality and Islam God Abortion debate Dhul-Qarnayn Liberal movements within Islam Nation of Islam Sexual orientation Ramadan Muslim ibn Aqeel Same-sex marriage Sunnah Islam as a political movement Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Basra Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Hizb ut-Tahrir Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi Talaq (Nikah) Ali Theodicy Maimonides Religion and sexuality Adam and Eve Islamic view of marriage Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Socrates Religious pluralism Opus Dei Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Arab-Israeli conflict Spanking Property (ownership right) Feminism Caliph Sin Phaedo Twelvers Islamic fundamentalism
