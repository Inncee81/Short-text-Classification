what one thing have you learned from posters here that has a different faith from you negative or positive i have never met or spoke with a muslim before but i have learned on this site that islam has some very similar biblical beliefs as jews and christians buddhists and pagans seems the less hostile i assume because thier beleifs have always had to remain in the background from monotheistic ones i believe in messianic judaism could be wrong but the jewish posters here say little and maybe because they are more secular atheists well we definetly have our battles but i think somewhere in thier life they feel god has let them down questioning if he ever exsisted in the first place and the story goes and as a christian the christian posters imo are the most passionate about thier faith but i think believing in jesus christ brings that out in any body like having the bestest friend on the planet that you will stick up for no matter what how about you i have learned the non believers are somewhat hostile maybe not hostile forgive me but aggitated with what is holy i like your analogy of the bestfriend i love him god so much i wish i could win them all over it does get depressing in the y a sometimes but i know its all in due season there is a time for everything God Christianity Ten Commandments Jesus Abrahamic religion Religious pluralism Atheism Sin Religious perspectives on Jesus Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Messianic Judaism Jewish principles of faith Predestination Judaism Jewish views of religious pluralism Nation of Islam Apostasy Resurrection of Jesus Fundamentalism Pharisees Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Baptism History of Christianity Religious conversion Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Heresy Sabbath Hell Temple in Jerusalem Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Prophet Christian denomination Eastern Orthodox Church Monotheism Origin belief Mary, the mother of Jesus Soul Messiah Idolatry in Christianity God and gender Abraham Christmas Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Witchcraft Christian eschatology Salvation Great Apostasy Chosen people Separation of church and state Christianity and anti-Semitism Historicity of Jesus Maimonides Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Miracle Paul of Tarsus Jew Samaritan Christian apologetics Christian Zionism Prayer Dispensationalism Apologetics Angel Supernatural Zohar Afterlife Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Religious Society of Friends Jerusalem Holy Spirit Saint Christian Muhammad Islam Bible and reincarnation Islam and Judaism Religion in Israel Christ Biblical canon Martin Luther Judeo-Christian Nontrinitarianism Church of Christ
