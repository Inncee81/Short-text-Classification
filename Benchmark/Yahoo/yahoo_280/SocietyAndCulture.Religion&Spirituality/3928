if a chimp is taught via sign language pre taught to believe in god and jesus will it get to go to heaven this is hypothetical assuming that one believes in a god and heaven in the first place folks rote chanting that the aforementioned don't exist need not tell me as i already know but to return to the point assuming that communication can be reliably established with a chimpanzee as has been done several times in the past and it can be effectively converted to christianity does the chimp in question get a ticket to heaven or not if not why how not some of the speciesist responses you have been getting here are just sick beyond belief are all humans born with a chronic superiority complex or is it something they learn in life in any case the answer to your bizarre little question depends entirely on who you're directing it to it would have to be one of the christian denominations as otherwise the part about jesus is irrelevant but past that there is no telling so your answer is insufficient data but the speciesism is sickening anyhow Heaven Creationism God Human Roman Catholic Church Trinity Infant baptism Free will Meaning of life Resurrection of Jesus Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Soul A Course In Miracles Mormonism Sola fide Afterlife Religion Judaism New Testament Salvation Eastern Orthodox Church Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Reincarnation Franz Boas Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Chimpanzee Christian views of Jesus Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Christian eschatology Cognitive bias Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Abrahamic religion Jesus Biblical inerrancy Divine grace Hell Justification (theology) Messianic Judaism Atheism Purgatory Young Earth creationism Fermi paradox Christian denomination Fundamentalism Mary, the mother of Jesus End times Sermon on the Mount Sin Religious perspectives on Jesus Cultural and historical background of Jesus Temple (Mormonism) Christian Prayer C.
