creationism in schools i just read a post from someone replying to the big bang question and it confuses me if schools are going to teach these theories then they need to offer several and make the statement that these are just theories and that no one really knows which is accurate i have nothing against being taught evolution and big bang and creation as long as the teachers do pick one and say it is the only correct choice variety is good and learning them all is good by the way i believe in creation why in the world would a teacher teach the kids a variety of theories and then pick one theory and tell the kids it is the only correct choice i don't believe in teaching students creationism the way christians would have us teach it but why teach kids the alternatives at all if you are going to tell the kids that there is only one correct choice i believe in the separation of church and state but i also believe in teaching kids how theories work change and progress thanks for the responses he must have made a typo that made no sense whatsoever this is garbage because in science a theory has a specific scientific meaning just like work and color and charm mean different things in science than in the mundane world a theory actually already has a lot of evidence behind them evolution is a theory creationism is a body of nonsense promoted by religious people trying to use the trappings of science and not letting their lack of degrees get in the way because they simply make fake degrees for themselves from diploma mills http www talkorigins org faqs credentials html science is not a democracy if you don't have brains you don't get to vote teach the kids what the scientists have truly found out there is no disagreement or quibbling on the bedrock of evolution only in its finer points none of this quibbling or uncertainty about evolution lends any support for creationism as a whole creationism is still at the starting line no evidence yet like a dead horse not expected to win the horse race plus creationism gives no practical technological results i would dearly love to have a create o wave oven and just dial up my food with enough electricity but the creationists never seem to develop useful spin offs to their way of thinking to truly teach the controversy in schools which is the latest initiative of those creationist losers would mean you would have to give a wise general expos of frauds and hucksters in general and apply those same principles to sniffing out creationists for what they are and while the christians are at it they can explain how noah sailed all the way to australia to pack two kangaroos on his ark and when his boat foundered on mount ararat explain how the kangaroos got back to australia and left no babies anywhere else if they can't explain that creationism fails this is not my line i credit this to a guy named solari umbra yes i know it's bad manners to write in all capitals it looks like shouting well i want to shout at those ptl dummkopfs Creation science Creation-evolution controversy Teach the Controversy Intelligent design movement Intelligent design Creationism Young Earth creationism Scientific method God Origin belief Modern geocentrism Meaning of life Democracy Education in Portugal Bah__'__ Faith and Science Pseudoscience A Course In Miracles Quantum mechanics Flood geology Answers in Genesis Creation and evolution in public education GED Atomism Human Reiki Atheism Noah's Ark Neuro-linguistic programming Science Church of Christ, Scientist Philosophy of science Of Pandas and People Phillip E.
