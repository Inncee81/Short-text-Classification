what are we missing out on it makes sense that if people feel peace and fulfillment in their religion then it must contain something good my question is largely rhetorical we gain inner conviction that our own beliefs are right because we live according to those beliefs and this brings us peace and joy what are we missing out on by researching other religions in a shallow or intellectual way without putting it into practice in our lives we just won't know until we start the search christiani what a great new take on an old scripture but so true gnostic ahhh she sighs peacefully and with relief yoda that is so true my foundation came from being a member of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints from there i can keep adding beautiful additions to my spiritual home upon that firm foundation which is faith in jesus christ your house is looking very beautiful right now i wonder where you got your foundation materials innerpeacemom thank you for expressing your feelings it gives me new insight to ponder upon cosmiccoyote amen it's even easy to miss out on the benefit of our current faith when we first begin we find something real we experience a significant truth that we need as individuals we seek advise from our spiritual leaders and are frequently told to do things like read scriptures repeat prayers or do certain rituals as specified by the faith that we had our experience in after enough time our truth as proven by our experience is forgotten because we are constantly told that other things are more important as specified by the dogma in time our faith becomes a shadow of something half remembered and not the full life affirming experience that it started as i have never met a single theist that isn t on fire for their faith when they first discover their faith i ve never met a long time theist that has grown in faith unless they remember and re experience the first love and fundamental life truth that brought them inspiration in the first place something the apostle paul called the first love while in the glow of this first love one may find other sources of inspiration in other faiths easily enough while tempted to state many examples of foreign faiths favorably influencing one another i know the details could cause arguments suffice it to say that the will of god has been ever present in all people and when the common factors are exposed we ll see that the most faithful of people from all civilizations always affirmed that god was both love and loving never failing to instruct humans to be the same if you are strong in faith and know the fundamental truth of god and can see through the lies of common religion without resentment then you may experience the spiritual journeys offered by all faiths and from these experiences find delight and reinforcement of gods initial message in your life http www youtube com watch v uh jvctsoy blessed be Religious Society of Friends Roman Catholic Church Church of Christ Trinity A Course In Miracles Atheism Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Eucharist Fundamentalism Church of Christ, Scientist Gospel of Thomas Biblical inerrancy Existence of God Community of Christ Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions New Testament Homosexuality and Christianity Eastern Orthodox Church Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Urantia Criticism of Mormonism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Sabbath Philipp Melanchthon Baptism Mary, the mother of Jesus John Wycliffe Great Apostasy Holy Spirit Sola fide Mass (liturgy) Mormonism and Christianity Past teachings of Prem Rawat Ten Commandments Soul John Howard Yoder Simone Weil Summa Theologiae Justification (theology) Religious pluralism Jewish principles of faith Paul of Tarsus Prayer Christian-Jewish reconciliation Anthroposophy History of the Latter Day Saint movement Religious conversion Divine grace Evolutionary creationism Resurrection of Jesus George Fox Judaism Charles Darwin's views on religion InterFaith Origen Evil John Wesley Biblical canon Meaning of life C.
