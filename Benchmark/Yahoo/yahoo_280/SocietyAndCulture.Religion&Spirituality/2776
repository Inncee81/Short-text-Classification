why should i follow the religion you don't today i got spammed by a christian liar not all christians are liars not all liars are christian but this was a deliberate lie on her part often quite often christians complain that non christians hold them to a higher standard but i am seriously asking why on earth non christians would be interested in following a religion that christians clearly struggle to follow i am not interested in changing religion but i can say most assuredly that i am deaf to the sales pitch of people who don't seem to be buying what they are selling themselves seriously if you can't be bothered to follow your religion and you're the type who thinks i should follow your religion don't you think that you should follow it first why should i buy something when the salesman clearly wouldn't oh come now if christians hold themselves to their own standards they aren't expected to be perfect but they are expected to try to not be a blatant unrepentant sinner i mean i've been shopping for a new mattress and the salesmen will say i have this exact model and i sleep like a log i know the salesman is not right because at least some nights he probably wakes up and in uncomfortable but at least he believes in his mattress of course unlike a new religion i'm shopping for a new mattress i don't expect christians to be perfect but biblically literate would be a start or um believing in christ or um something like that christians complain that non christians hold them to a higher standard we hold them to their own standards i asked a question about why christians are materialistic when they should be feeding the hungry many of the answers accused me of not feeding the hungry well guess what i'm not the one who is claiming to follow the teachings of christ you are Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Religion Mattress Sin A Course In Miracles Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Heaven Church of Christ, Scientist Lie Sola fide Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Christian Identity Idolatry Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Christian anarchism Ontological argument Roman Catholic Church Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Fundamentalism Opus Dei Charles Darwin's views on religion Theodicy Trinity Hell Evil Christian eschatology Biblical inerrancy Criticism of Mormonism Creation-evolution controversy End times Jesus Theory of conduct Prophet Abrahamic religion Historicity of Jesus Intelligent design movement Gospel of Thomas Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Charles Grandison Finney Urantia Soul Church of Christ Supernatural Christian views of Jesus Antichrist John Wesley Christian denomination Jewish principles of faith God and gender Jehovah's Witnesses Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Restorationism Mormonism Creationism Anthroposophy Pharisees Satanism Karl Marx Second Coming Salvation Predestination Nation of Islam Sin City Esotericism Human nature Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Protestantism Religious conversion Messiah Millennialism Spiritism Legalism (theology) Sacrifice Answers in Genesis Mind control Moses Nontrinitarianism Mortification of the flesh The Catcher in the Rye Satan Shunning Charles Taze Russell Biblical canon Justification (theology) Qiyamah Book of Revelation Christian philosophy Religious pluralism Creation science Documentary hypothesis Twelve-step program Simone Weil Anti-Mormonism Wheel of Fortune Cindy Sheehan
