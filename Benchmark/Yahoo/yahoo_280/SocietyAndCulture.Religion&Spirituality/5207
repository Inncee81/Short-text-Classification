hey quick question for christians what's the higher position in church a deacon or an elder i know they are all servants of god and that position doesn't matter i am writing a book and i needed to know for my book thanks all while there will be some variances from faith to faith i think it fair to say that in most protestant denominations the elders would lead the congregation in matters both spiritual and the more pragmatic the decision makers if you will and that deacons are more like helpers who tend to the more day to day tasks of a congregation the bible might seem to give the greater authority to the elder but that is not necessarily the same as higher Baptist Bishop Ordination of women Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Church of Scotland Holy Orders Clergy Deacon Roman Catholic Church United Methodist Church Organizational structure of Jehovah's Witnesses Priesthood (Mormonism) Seventh-day Adventist Church Blacks and Mormonism Heresy New Testament Eastern Orthodox Church Elder (religious) Minister of religion Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Presbyterianism Community of Christ Mass (liturgy) Great Apostasy Homosexuality and Christianity Christian denomination Jehovah's Witnesses Eucharist Uniting Church in Australia History of the Latter Day Saint movement Disciples of Christ Unitarian Universalism Priest Christian Biblical inerrancy Congregationalist church governance Methodism Apostolic Succession Reformed Baptist Infant baptism Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite) Baptism Christianity Mormonism and Christianity Presbyterian church governance Church of God of Prophecy Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Presbyterian Church of Australia Religion Protestantism Religious Society of Friends Restorationism New Apostolic Church Philipp Melanchthon United Church of Christ Pentecostalism Ten Commandments Second Vatican Council History of the English Bible Liberal Christianity Evangelical Lutheran Church in America Abrahamic religion Pope Calvinism Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Book of Revelation Predestination Reformed churches Anabaptist Feet washing Meaning of life Church of Christ, Scientist Trinity Creation-evolution controversy Divine grace First Council of Nicaea History of Christianity Judaism Martin Luther 1689 Baptist Confession of Faith Evangelicalism Opus Dei Book of Mormon Iglesia ni Cristo Expository preaching Bible Evolutionary creationism Biblical canon Salvation President of the Church (Mormonism) Revivalism Metropolitan Community Church Vestments controversy John Wesley Religious pluralism Christian views of women
