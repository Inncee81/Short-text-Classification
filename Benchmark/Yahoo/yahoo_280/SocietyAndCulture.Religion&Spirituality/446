psychics out there please just read this does anyone one on here have psychic abilities when i was little i was very odd quiet scared was afraid of men if my mom would leave me in the car to get gas i would shake and cry i used to have very bad thoughts when i was little age five even about sexual things not sex but other things this really isn't the place to get into full detail about it but i just really need some help i feel like something happened to me when i was very very young and i want to know what i have depression and am in counseling and stuff but i just need someone to be able to tell me what happened to me when i was very little sweetie i am not going to go into a psychic reading especially not with something like this but if i may offer advice sometimes we want to know why we are who we are and what has made us this way when really we should be looking to the future and being all we should be i dont agree with counselling that wants to drag up your past i am all for cbt cognitive behaviour therapy and other therapies that help you go forward and this is my advice to you learn to let go and have a wonderful life make your future happen xxx Cognitive therapy Ex-gay Transsexuality Psychotherapy Milton H.
