are certain gods transexual or even polysexual i've been asking as i'm sure others have exactly how is it that the christian god could have a son without a wife i know there are a couple ways to think about this first that there was no jesus before god impregnated mary the virgin and that would make sense but it would also make this god no different from any of the other gods that impregnated virgins and other young women back then most christians don't accept that the more popular way is to say that jesus had always been there this is the view commonly accepted by most christians but this is problematic because if jesus was always there along with god then how can jesus be god's son wouldn't that make him another god if jesus came along later who impregnated god did god impregnate himself what type of sexual do you classify this type of god as tranny bi asexual polysexual i figure it can't be asexual becuase that would mean that jesus could have kids spontaneously sprout off of him too so dont you love it you note the ridiculousness of religion and believers say that you need help if only they could see themselves clearly Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Mary, the mother of Jesus Roman Catholic Church Jesus Isa Eastern Orthodox Church Marriage Immaculate Conception Sin Religious perspectives on Jesus Holy Spirit Christianity Asexuality Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Religion and sexuality God Antichrist Paul of Tarsus Virgin Mary in Islam Religion History of sex Fundamentalism Urantia Christian denomination Salvation Adam-God theory Catholicism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Christian view of marriage Saint James the Just A Course In Miracles Cultural and historical background of Jesus God and gender Christian views of Jesus Predestination Perpetual virginity of Mary Icon Resurrection of Jesus Supernatural Liberal Christianity Evil Mormon Great Apostasy Unification Church Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Love Idolatry Horus Prophet Baptism Eucharist New Testament view on Jesus' life Book of Revelation Christian anarchism Historicity of Jesus Witchcraft Evangelicalism Book of Isaiah Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Mary Magdalene Satanism Jehovah's Witnesses Nontrinitarianism Neopaganism Dionysus Birth control Theotokos Original sin Blessed Virgin Mary Trinity Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Yeshu Miracle Biblical inerrancy Book of Mormon Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Race of Jesus Virgin Angel Names and titles of Jesus Justification (theology) Homosexuality and Christianity Moses Transsexuality Resurrection Christian views of women Church of Christ Homosexuality John the Baptist Baptist Gospel of John Nudity Incarnation The Two Babylons Religious conversion Mortification of the flesh
