have you noticed the christian allegory pro christianity in the harry potter books have you ever noticed that harry potter acts as a christian allegory in many ways for example the phoenix is often used as a symbol for christ as it is the resurrection bird and it is the phoenix that gives harry the strength to defeat the serpent in so many instances also moving on to the final book harry makes the ultimate sacrifice of his life to save the lives of countless others from ultimate evil only to be resurrected as a sort of his reward for his sacrificial nature hmm does it remind you of someone the themes of sacrificial love the lion of gryffindor harry s parents sacrifice and redemption are seen throughout the series living righteously in a world filled with evil and darkness is one of the major concepts of the book i am unsure of rowling s motivations for echoing christianity in her books or whether they were intentional or not but i definitely don t see it as anti christianity perhaps it was to appease the christian readers it is a fictional book made enchanting and exciting by the addition of magical overlays seems hardly to be promoting anything negative we ve been seeing magic in children s literature dating back to the the century ever since the grimm brothers wrote cinderella or more appropriately called ashiepattle it s a moral teaching done only in harmless fun quote from c s lewis do you think i am trying to weave a spell perhaps i am but remember your fairy tales spells are used for breaking enchantments as well as for inducing them and you and i have need of the strongest spells that can be found to wake us from the evil enchantment of worldliness which has been laid upon us for nearly a hundred years c s lewis the weight of glory i would reccomend you all to actually pick up a book and read it before you make such assertions ryoma i realize he didn't die but i have no idea what you're trying to tell me in your response i was talking about the sacrifice and resurrection as it parallels christianity not that the last piece of voldermort's soul died when harry defeated him kclightman if what you say is true then even better as christianity promises a salvation an eternal life at the end of our earthly life and i also agree that jesus wasn't the only one to ever die for someone else in his case countless people but we do see him as a major sacrificial figure in reality that is echoed from time to time in other books such as the chronicles of narnia which is admittedly christian allegory according to consensus it is a theme therefore greatly represented by christianity as the pillars of that faith stand upon such an ideology i do have to disagree that christianity is about complete obedience and submission jesus is ever forgiving of our sins and does not condemn us for our everyday misgivings mistakes we have been told our humanity will bring forth faults as we are imperfect and perfection is not expected a big part of christianity is redemption and free will not total submission and christianity does not outline being saved from one's own creator but being saved from worldliness and giving into material temptations and people aren't seen as helpless we have complete free will to do as we please although we acknowledge a higher power it in now way discredits our own personal strength why must it be assumed that one cannot exist with the other i am disappointed in the many misguided ideas about christianity and i agree many of the themes in harry potter are classic to children's literature which are often compared to christianity i never made an absolutist claim here as people are assuming but merely indicated the several parallels i saw in the book with christianity and if you read my question i indicated that i have no idea whether it was intentional or not but that it doesn't seem very anti christ to me and as a liberal minded person i like to think that reading a harmless and fun book of fiction will not make me evil that's all and thanks to whoever gave a thumbs up to the guy who called me a dumbass very mature thank you we were just talking about this last night i love the harry potter books for the excitement and adventure and all the other stuff going on i appreciate that i'm sure different people get something different out of it but i do like being reminded of the stories i learned a long time ago i don't agree with the witchcraft wizardry but it's sure exciting huh i think some christians make such a big deal out of it but a lot have never taken the time to read the books if you're going to be out in the culture you need to be a little bit a part of the culture if rowling is a christian she's doing a great job of subtly getting the good news of christ
