the god lugh for me can you please tell me more about lugh i am feeling a strong connection to him for a while now and cant quite pinpoint why perhaps i thought your interpretations will help thank you everyone ariel the god lugh was worshipped in ireland as a deity of the sun this connection with the sun may explain his name it means shining one and it also may account for the attributes that he displayed he was handsome perpetually youthful and had a tremendous energy and vitality this energy manifests itself especially in the number of skills he had according to legend mastered in fact there was a tale that related lugh's myriad abilities at arts and crafts as told in the battle of magh tuiredh the god travelled to tara and arrived during a tremendous feast for the royal court lugh was greeted at the door by the keeper of the gate and was immediately asked what talent he had for it was a tradition there that only those who had a special or unique ability could enter the palace the god offered his reply i am a wright in response the gate keeper said we already have a wright your services are not needed here still lugh not to be so easily dismissed continued i am a smith again the guard retorted that the court had a smith that was quite adequate but the god was not to be dissuaded in short order he noted that he was also a champion a harper a hero a poet an historian a sorcerer and a craftsman to this list the gate keeper merely nodded his head and stated matter of factly that all of these various trades were represented in the court by other members of the tuatha de danaan ah but you do have an individual who possesses all of these skills simultaneously was lugh's clever and inspired reply the guard was forced to admit his defeat and so lugh was allowed to enter and join the festivities according to celtic mythology lugh was the son of cian and ethlinn after the god nuada was killed in the second battle of magh tuiredh lugh became the leader of the tuatha de danaan the term for the gods and goddesses who descended from the goddess danu blessings Mythological Cycle Irish mythology Lebor Gab__la __renn Fomorians Cath Maige Tuireadh Brian Christianization Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an M__rr__gan Fire Emblem Nuada Japanese mythology Mythology Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War Ethniu Kain (Legacy of Kain) Greek mythology Odin Welsh mythology Lugus Roman mythology Vishnu Norse mythology The Keeper of Traken Tamriel Ayyavazhi mythology Neopaganism Zhao Yun Lancelot Book of Esther Horus Moses Religion Lammas Isis Iliad Maya mythology Shinto The Dagda Supernatural Deity God God Emperor of Dune Apollo Devil Muslim ibn Aqeel Hecate Aphrodite British monarchy Smartism Ulster Cycle Bhakti The Death Gate Cycle Tara (Buddhism) Freyr Historical basis for King Arthur Saint George El (god) Trimurti Wars of the Roses Easter Dionysus Goddess Mal__si e Madhe District Vlad III Dracula A Course In Miracles Animism Ten Commandments Megatron Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Ariel Sharon Tales of Symphonia Hathor Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Shaggy dog story Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Arjuna Milesians (Irish) Set (mythology) Alaga__sia Past teachings of Prem Rawat Socrates Wicca
