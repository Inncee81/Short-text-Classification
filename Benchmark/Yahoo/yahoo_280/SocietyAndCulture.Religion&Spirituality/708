religion and sexuality ok i want mature answers here no homophobic crap right if your sexuality detemines whether you are ahem 'holy' or a 'sinner' then why does the bible say that you shouldn't judge if god was to judge in the end then why do some not all christians judge others quotes bibles and act like they are god i don't want 'opinions' i want a good definition of how you will answer this even if you sit on the fence i want an educated intelligent well thought of answer even if i don't agree with you i will chose you as best answer because this isn't about my actual opinion i want somebody to disagree with the bible or agree with it but with a well backed up answer and really good points if you write me a long essay that doesn't mean to say i will give you best answer like i said even if it goes against my opinion if it is well backed up i will give you best answer and feedback with my opinion good luck we religious folk are very good at saying who isn't allowed into heaven with us if you scan the history of the church in britain alone it reeks of it i like to let god be the one to do decide who is worthy and who isn't over zealous religious people kick gays because they are an easy target it gets very unpleasant sometimes when these ratbags who claim to know jesus christ behave in such a way i am very glad that a number of the churches have ceased to use aggressive confrontational language on this matter and the time is nigh for religious people to remember the compassion shown by christ to all around him ultimately god is the one who lets people into heaven and we can rant all we like i think when the time comes for the sheep to be seperated from the goats there will be a fair few surprises and a fair few hate mongers exposed for what they really are deciding if my neighbour is a filthy heathen is not for me it is enough of a challenge for me to stay true to the principles of the gospel there are considerable beams in my own eye the speck in my neighbours eye is between him and the almighty all of us every single last one of us is a sinner and falls short of what god requires one is perfectly entitled to ones own view but to bang on about it at the expense of gay people human beings with feelings has nothing to do with the love of god whatsoever we should spend more time demonstrating the gospel in action and less time spitting out bile about our fellow creatures of god God Salvation Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Theory of conduct Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Ten Commandments Theodicy Church of Christ Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Charles Grandison Finney Christian anarchism Sin Trinity A Course In Miracles Roman Catholic Church Original sin Biblical inerrancy Justification (theology) John Howard Yoder Predestination Divine grace Hell Homosexuality and Christianity Liberal Christianity Merit Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Westboro Baptist Church (Topeka) Religion Apocrypha Infant baptism Summa Theologiae Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Teach the Controversy Meaning of life Religion and sexual orientation Jehovah's Witnesses Holy Spirit Idolatry Acts of the Apostles Resurrection of Jesus Origin belief Sabbath Fundamentalism Church of Christ, Scientist Baptism Christian views of Jesus Charles Darwin's views on religion Gospel of Thomas Second Vatican Council The nature of God in Western theology Creationism Calvinism Creation-evolution controversy Priesthood (Mormonism) Marriage Angel Same-sex marriage Paul of Tarsus Atheism Eastern Orthodox Church Monotheism Separation of church and state Goodness and value theory Judas Iscariot New Testament Religious pluralism Free will Book of Mormon Intelligent design movement Abrahamic religion Christian eschatology Blacks and Mormonism Religious conversion Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Historical persecution by Christians John the Baptist Urantia Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Rich Mullins Nontrinitarianism Homosexuality and Judaism Criticisms of Christianity Love Mormonism Human Satanism Satan Religious Society of Friends Legalism (theology) End times Repentance
