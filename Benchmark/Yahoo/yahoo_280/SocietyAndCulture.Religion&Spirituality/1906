i always thought that when god gets up to judge those left behind have no chance to salvation now after watching those left behind movies i am sort of confused can anyone tell me what the deal really is on those left behind after the rapture some bible interpreters believe that there will be no second chance for salvation after the rapture however there is no place in the bible which says this or even hints to it there will be many people who come to christ during the tribulation the jewish witnesses revelation are believers if no one can come to christ during the tribulation then why are people being beheaded for their faith revelation i see no passage of scripture which argues against people having a second chance after the rapture i do see passages which indicate the opposite a variation of this argument is that those who have heard the gospel and rejected it before the rapture cannot be saved but those who had not heard the gospel before the rapture can be saved i do not find biblical justification for this view granted most who were hard hearted to the gospel before the rapture will likely be even more hardened after the rapture the antichrist will deceive many matthew many will believe the lies thessalonians at the same time i find no scriptural evidence that those who rejected the gospel before the rapture have no opportunity for salvation after the rapture recommended resource the rapture who will face the tribulation by tim lahaye End times Rapture Tribulation Book of Revelation Christian eschatology Antichrist New Testament Left Behind Salvation Christianity Bible Baptism Resurrection of Jesus Jesus Sola fide Gospel of Thomas Authorship of the Pauline epistles Preterism Paul of Tarsus Book of Mormon Ten Commandments Sabbath Trinity Jehovah's Witnesses Prophet Divine grace Charles Taze Russell Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Gospel Religious perspectives on Jesus Apocrypha Gospel of Barnabas Great Apostasy Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Perseverance of the saints Martin Luther Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod Abrahamic religion Historicity of Jesus Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Pascal's Wager Devil Priesthood (Mormonism) Gospel of Mark Infant baptism Christian Zionism Post Tribulation Rapture Bible prophecy Herbert W.
