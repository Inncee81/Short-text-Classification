why is the undefined such a great threat to so many instead of desiring and accepting barriers and parameters on everything wouldn't it be much more enjoyable to leave things undefined half formed does our existence require anything more cosmically undefined love we are free we are multidimensional many are afraid of what is undefined they require structure neatly tied packages of their black white concepts they believe god must be an isolated being who creates at arm's length from some outside substance that he dug up somewhere perhaps from a bottle in an old cupboard then decides his creations are wicked as if he has no control over such things but this idea is slowly dying as more people come to realize there is so much more to us and it need not necessarally be defined certainly not in such childish one dimensional terms in our terms even those no longer in physical reality have ego they still need to develop learn what they are as their old beliefs drop away like falling leaves as long as we remember the barriers are of our own construction are there because we still find it very hard to function without some sense of form we can more freely express our freedom as our new abilities are unwrapped on this eternal morning maybe i get a little poetic but that's me our existence requires nothing we already are everything we are one self dreaming he is many every living thing every rock every cell every blade of grass and the eternal formlessness that created and creates it all the idea that we cannot have good without evil is erroneous this is not balance but chaos the seat of ego's calamity it is part of our clinging to form to opposite and calling it balance nothing opposes good nothing opposes god therefore nothing opposes us we are by god free let us no longer bind our beautiful truth with concepts that limit our reception of that truth Theodicy Friedrich Schleiermacher Predestination A Course In Miracles Simone Weil Summa Theologiae Immortality Buddhism Phaedo Religion Atheism Creationism Reincarnation Meaning of life The nature of God in Western theology Supernatural Merit Human Evil Determinism Brahman ALGOL 68 Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Intelligent design John Wycliffe Derivative Kain (Legacy of Kain) Force (Star Wars) Jewish principles of faith Incarnations of Immortality Reality Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Liberalism Idolatry S__ren Kierkegaard Infinity Karma C syntax Pointer Existence of God The Death Gate Cycle Objectivist philosophy Creation-evolution controversy Christian eschatology Vishnu sahasranama Transactional analysis Scientific method Vishnu Human nature Alcoholics Anonymous Copyright Numerology Cultural relativism Out-of-body experience Hell Occam's Razor Sexual orientation Gnosticism DNA Lisp programming language Rudolf Hermann Lotze Reinhold Niebuhr Soul Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Maimonides Hinduism Sola fide Objective-C Moral objectivism Pantheism Urantia Separation of church and state Explosive material Divine grace Slavoj __i__ek Evolutionism Anthroposophy New Age Richard Allen (reverend) Propaganda Alignment (role-playing games) Ken Wilber Demon Strategic management Culture Religious pluralism Philo
