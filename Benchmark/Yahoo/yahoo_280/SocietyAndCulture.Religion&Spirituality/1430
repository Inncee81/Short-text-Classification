what would jesus really do this is a serious question so please answer it as such he was born as a human with all the feelings hormones and disires he was a man how did he go all that time without having sex or at least masterbating well what i am asking is did jesus ever have sex or spank his monkey i don't know how else to put it he probably did to some extent have sex masturbate but i would imagine he did it far less than most people afterall everyone has a different level of sex drive people like jesus and myself happen to have very low sex drives which seems to result in some greater degree of higher thought function shrugs but honestly i don't know what context you are asking in what would jesus do in what circumstance whatever it is it would probably be pacifistic for the most part at least toward those he considered fellow or neighbour though possibly quite opposed to those he didn't so consider in his ignorance of the times Human sexual behavior Prostate cancer Sexual orientation The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Abortion debate Sex Androgen insensitivity syndrome Child sexuality Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Sexual differentiation Homosexuality and transgender Puberty Sadism and masochism Gender identity Human sexuality Same-sex marriage Theory of conduct Resurrection of Jesus Growth hormone treatment Predestination Transsexuality Gender role Motivation Religion Justification (theology) Biology and sexual orientation Oral sex The nature of God in Western theology Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Objectivist philosophy Social rule Patriotism Theodicy Philosophy of language Altruism Goodness and value theory Socrates Soul Dragons (Pern) Alfred Kinsey Cybersex Strap-on dildo John Howard Yoder Meaning of life Friedrich Schleiermacher Asexuality Nudity Hypoglycemia Tide God Children of God Scientology beliefs and practices Anal sex Incest Legal aspects of transsexualism Evil Sex education Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Origin belief Narcissism Heterosexuality Sexual abstinence Murder Ghastly's Ghastly Comic Fundamentalism Sexual intercourse Sant Thakar Singh Historicity of Jesus Orgasm Neighbours Determinism Rudolf Steiner Free will Social justice Ontological argument Feminism Religion and sexuality AIDS Breast Serial killer Supernatural The Smoking Room Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Growth hormone Microeconomics History of intersex surgery Transgender Charles Darwin's views on religion Sodom and Gomorrah A Course In Miracles Birth control Opus Dei Horus Historical Jesus What would Jesus do?
