for muslims only i have a question at what age should you start training your daughters to be proper wives i ask because i have a year old daughter who i am starting to give more household responsibilities to i don't have her do everything but i do have her help change the younger babies help feed them help with house chores etc i already set the example of proper covering respecting my husband etc my question is about household responsibilities i don't want to wait too late until she's too old and then she has a problem with doing all of these things by herself when she gets married and her and her husband have problems as i want her to marry a muslim brother inshallah this matter is subjective it depends on the culture and also upbringing generally it is normal for muslims society in south east asia such as indonesia and malaysia to teach their daughters household responsibilities at the age of years old but they do it gradually step by step they don't force a year old to do everything like a year old daughter would do as their capabilities are different i believe the most important thing is to look at your daughter 's capability and teach or train her gradually step by step Women in Islam Southeast Asia Status of religious freedom in Malaysia Malaysia Family Indonesia Origin belief Emperor Guangwu of Han Mary, the mother of Jesus Yusuf al-Qaradawi Buddhism Marriage Order of succession Sharia Adam and Eve Predestination Divorce Muhammad Wang Mang Confucius Les Aspin Social rule Arabic alphabet Martial art French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Islamic world Malay people Heir Apparent Association of Southeast Asian Nations Creationism Hindu Caliph Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Lee Kuan Yew Non-resident Indian and Person of Indian Origin Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh Religion Imperial Household of Japan Khadijah bint Khuwaylid Danish Folkeskole Education Polygamy History of India Privilege of Peerage Subud Louise of Hesse Abortion debate Emperor Yuan of Han Infantilism Rais massacre Transcontinental nation Jennifer Lopez Theory of conduct Incest Daniel Pipes Melisende of Jerusalem Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Proposals for a Palestinian state Philosophy of language House of Bourbon Emperor Xuan of Han Theodicy National Kidney Foundation Singapore Current teachings of Prem Rawat New Testament Islam in Bangladesh Islam Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Education in Malaysia Meaning of life History of philosophy British Royal Family Religious conversion Jacobo Arenas Nation of Islam War on Terrorism Religion and sexuality Shrimp farm Scientology beliefs and practices Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Africa Hijab Color Foreign relations of Australia Alcoholics Anonymous Separation of church and state Noah Past teachings of Prem Rawat High school Vernon Schillinger History of Singapore Childbirth Economic relations of Japan Family name Atomism Nikah Mut'ah Maria Hertogh riots Islam and Judaism Rod Stewart Ten Commandments Melanie Wilkes
