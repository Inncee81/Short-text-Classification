christian mothers of teenage sons i know this is a very specific question but please spare me a rant my boyfriends mother is christian he is an atheist and i am a satanist i have neither spoken to nor met his mother and she now has her entire household blaming me for damning him to hell he is not interested in becoming a satanist and i have nor had the intention of converting him to anything that already isnt however his mother and i dont see eye to eye she refers to me as the enemy and has made blatant attacks on my character and has also sent her friends and members of her family to investigate my personality and the like is there any sort of advice that you can offer for my situation i would appreciate any knowledge that can be of use i forgot to mention that not only does she not speak english but i'm not allowed in her house it's natural for a mother to be protective of her son and be speculative of her little boy's girlfriend especially her personality and motives however in this case i believe the mother is stepping over the line from skepticism to bigotry sort of my suggestion is try to actually meet this woman so you two will no longer know each other just by your respective labels Recurring South Park characters Plame affair Resurrection of Jesus Little Britain Dissociative identity disorder Incarnations of Immortality Infantilism Satanic ritual abuse Archie Comics Bonus Stage Satanism Son Goku (Dragon Ball) South Park Church of Christ Avenue Q Boston Public Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sub-Zero Prince Edmund (Blackadder) C.
