for christians who know the bible well will you please answer this question according to isaiah the messiah is supposed to be a descendent of king david yet jesus' mother mary is of the house of levi not david that means that jesus cannot possibly be the messiah referenced in the old testament what is your opinion on this if you try to say that his stepfather joseph's lineage is good enough then here is the actual passage then a shoot will grow from the stump of jesse king david's father and a branch from his roots will bear fruit i am sorry but the new testament is quite explicit about the fact that jesus absolutely did not come from joseph's or any other man's stump the only human being he was related to was mary johnny appleseed your statement means absolutely nothing without posting the lineage right along with it i have a feeling i shouldn't hold my breath waiting for you to do that i am assuming that it will also be backed up with bible verses right if not then please do not waste your time sdw luke sdw since elizabeth is mary's kin and there is no other kin or lineage established for mary any where else in the bible the only house she can be reasonably connected to is the house of levi there are those who poo poo this and if you are one of these then please tell what house she was from so we can establish once and for all how christians can legitimately associate yeshua of nazareth with the messiah of the old testament liveforjesus please tell me what bible version you are getting this from because i have yet to come across a version that has the nerve to say that the luke lineage definitely comes from mary it says in clear writing that it is joseph s lineage even in your quote kenny p do i really have to tell you what they say about assuming things even world class scholars should know better than that especially when it comes to the supposed word of god mosa a you've got your scriptures a bit messed up but i know which ones you're talking about so it's o k for my reply please see what i said to liveforjesus above sdw i see that you have not yet responded to my challenge i guess i'm just going to have to check back in ten minutes sdw your ten minutes is up and you still haven't replied how does it feel to be on someone else's random time schedule don't like it then please don't do it to other people i've got a heart conditon for god's sake and i do not function well when i'm being timed you've got a cool avatar though and that is the only reason why i'm forgiving you p liveforjesus i meant the same thing as you did the lineage of jesus found in the book of luke but i'm actually the one who was unclear not you thanks for being a sweetie about it what i wanted to understand was what bible you read that said that heli was mary's father i just read the king james and holman versions and both of them say that heli was joseph's father i know you've already written a lot for this question but if you get a chance to tell me your bible version i'd appreciate it thanks kenny p i'm not exactly sure how i proved christianity with my rebuttal to your answer i in fact showed that christian biblical scholars will assume whatever they need to in the effort to connect yeshuah of nazareth to the messiah of the old testament if you're going to assume things about the bible for no other reason than to help support the validity of the christian religion then don't be surprised if people roll their eyes at you by the way if you have any reference to a logical reason why we should assume that heli is mary's father then please list it otherwise please don't give me the whole son can mean the same as son in law rubbish if that were the case then why not assume the lineage in matthew refers to mary instead of the one in luke but of course it would not help the christian faith to assume such a thing since that would call down the curse of king solomon's line upon jesus which would nullify any claim that he has to being the messiah thanks pixie pixieprincess hi for some the concept of a virgin birth can be difficult to comprehend or accept i do understand your apprehensiveness here this is a very long study but let me put it to you in short i will check back to see if you have any comments that i can make clear for you according to the bible it had become impossible for a legitimate and qualified messiah to have an earthly father due to the spiritual downfall of king solomon and his descendants as a result the messiah could only have a heavenly father genesis records abraham's reaction then abraham fell upon his face and laughed and said in his heart shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old and shall sarah that is ninety years old bear but just as god promised sarah had a son and they named him isaac moreover it was through this miraculous birth between a hundred year old man and a ninety year old woman that almighty god established his everlasting covenant with abraham isaac and jacob in like manner it would be through another miraculous birth that god would establish his new and everlasting covenant with all of mankind through the virgin birth of his only begotten son jesus of nazareth his later descendent that had a spiritual downfall to long to get into this but joseph was a direct descendant of the royal line of david through solomon he was also a descendant of jeconiah matthew tells you more but i will cut it down for space sake verse and zerubbabel verse since jeremiah declares that all of jeconiah's descendants were disqualified from claiming the throne of david as king joseph was also disqualified most importantly if jesus were the biological offspring of joseph he would also be declared ineligible to claim the throne of david because he would fall under the very same curse the bible provides the lineage of heli mary's father in luke as follows and jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age being as was supposed the son of joseph which was the son of heli which was the son of melea which was the son of menan which was the son of mattatha which was the son of nathan which was the son of david god's eternal promise to david was fulfilled through heli's genealogy since he was mary's father joseph was considered to be his son in law as a result mary was a descendent of david but not from david through solomon she descended from david through nathan because of the sins of solomon and his descendants we not only eliminate him from the paternal line to the messiah because of the virgin birth but also from the maternal line through heli finally it becomes clear that the messiah would be both the son of god paternally and the son of david through heli mary's father luke records the words that the angel said to mary but the angel said to her do not be afraid mary you have found favor with god you will be with child and give birth to a son and you are to give him the name jesus he will be great and will be called the son of the most high the lord god will give him the throne of his father david and he will reign over the house of jacob forever his kingdom will never end how will this be mary asked the angel since i am a virgin the angel answered the holy spirit will come upon you and the power of the most high will overshadow you so the holy one to be born will be called a the son of god the promise was fulfilled as well as a curse lifted as always seek learn discover love your sister in christ response i just woke up let me get my books brb i re read your remark no this is a reading out of luke silly never did i say she or he came from luke told you this is along study it is the bloodline that dates back to the old testament it is in the book of luke also here is the other spot but their is a period but it is hard to see it i didn't do a space but hey it was am for me next time i will be sure to use my space bar i think this is were you read it see father luke see the period then i write that this records the words that the angel said to mary i should have said in the book of luke but i felt it was clear sorry about that was sleepy u u zzzz thank you luke chapter it is the short cut i gave because of it being so long but it is in luke chapter verse if you want to read the whole thing i cut it for space sake never did i say she was in the blood line of luke also it does not matter what bible you read when it comes to the linage this is one part that actually read pretty much the same thing and it is the undisputed some will put the word son or just the names this the bloodline is the only thing that is written that pretty much reads the same in all western written bibles but it is all the same no change in the line sorry if you misunderstood the reference hope this clears it up for you
