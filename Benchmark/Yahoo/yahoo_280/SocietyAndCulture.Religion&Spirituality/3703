since god had hurled satan out of heaven to earth because of his dis obdience how long had satan been on earth before creation in the garden and some food for thought could satan created dinasours on earth and since it was not part of god's plan he destroyed the diansours with a meteor might sound far fethced but satan was on earth doing something don't you think there is no such concept in judaism as satan being hurled out of heaven rebelling against god or having any intent to take over god's kingdom since christians believe this story comes from the jewish torah what they call the old testament it is important that they realise that this does not come from there whatsoever and these concepts have never existed in judaism the church took a bunch of unrelated verses from the torah put them together and came up with this idea it has no validity no actual coherent scriptural basis and is irrelevant to judaism in judaism there is an angel of god named ha satan which means the satan which translates to the adversary this does not mean and never has meant the adversary of god this angel does not do anything against god's will it obeys god every second of every day and nothing else god sends it to test mankind and thus it is mankind who sees this angel as an adversary it is not that this angel is an adversary to god another function of this angel is that when we die this angel brings our book of life before god and acts as a sort of prosecuting attorney bringing our deeds good and bad before god in order for them to be judged so if you would like to believe in the concept that satan is an angel who rebelled against god and was thrown out of heaven and is after the souls of every human being on the earth please go right ahead but understand that you are believing something that does not come from judaism if you've learned from your religion that this concept does come from judaism you've been given incorrect information more than likely not on purpose as the idea that this concept comes from judaism has been taught by the church for so long that most christians do not even realise that it isn't accurate it is not from judaism why the church created such a concept you'd have to investigate why would it want to create the idea that there is an evil angel who rebelled against our creator and is now after your soul where must you go to save your soul from this evil being that the church has created now you begin to see underlying motives for such a story being created by the church investigate further on your own if you're interested source me jewish torah talmud etc Jewish principles of faith Sin Abrahamic religion God Satanism Heaven Judaism Hell Prophet Fallen angel Jews as a chosen people Demon Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Michael (archangel) Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Soul Christian eschatology Creationism Kabbalah Christianity Torah Divine grace Mormonism and Judaism Religion Adam and Eve End times Bible Jewish views of religious pluralism Trinity Fundamentalism Genesis Resurrection of Jesus Zoroastrianism Evil Abraham Salvation Origin belief Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Predestination Creation according to Genesis Dispensationalism Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Ten Commandments Jewish eschatology Religious pluralism Islam Paradise Lost Korban Maimonides Moses Atheism Halakha Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Philo Jesus Rosh Hashanah Messiah Messianic Judaism Sabbath Religious perspectives on Jesus Meaning of life Monotheism Jewish Messiah Evolutionary creationism Norman Lamm Names of God in Judaism Apocalyptic literature Heresy Gospel of Thomas Kuzari Mormonism Theodicy Israel ben Eliezer Amidah Gnosticism Cultural and historical background of Jesus Guide for the Perplexed God and gender Demonology Lucifer Revelation Torah im Derech Eretz Urantia Jacob Neusner Purgatory Simone Weil
