what do i say to my son when the time comes i live in a small town that is very religious there is literally a church for every people i am an atheist although i have respect for other people's beliefs i know that my son will be influenced and hear about god often what do i say when he asks me about god and what i think i don't want to say anything that will make him think that christians are bad or that we should hate them the main thing is that i want him to think for himself i don't care if he grows up and wants to be a priest or a minister as long as he made that decision for himself but if he chooses to not believe in god i am afriad that he will make pretend that he does just to fit in with others i don't necessarily want him to believe exactly what i believe i want him to think for himself and ask questions what are good ways to explain other religions to him what are good ways to explain to him that i do not believe in god all i want is for him to be a good person that is all i ask i also think that sometimes religion can be a little overwhelming for children of young ages i went to catholic school and some of the things that they told me scared the hell out of me so did the pictures of jesus nailed to a cross do you think that it is appropriate to show tell children in catholic school starting in the first grade we were shown very graphic movies about jesus' death around easter time every year i don't want people to tell my son about this the only preschools that they have here are in churches should i send him anyway has anyone sent their child to one i don't want to force my beliefs on him just like i don't want anyone else to you be honest with him and tell him that everyone believes what makes sense to them you know your sons capabilities and understanding and how to word it my middle one she was when she really started asking although until then just thought that everyone was christian as it was the most common belief in her school now she doesn't know what to believe so i try to answer her questions honestly and encourage respect for others beliefs it is perhaps a little different here in the uk and children aren't teased for their beliefs but children understand a lot more than we give them credit for you sound like a great mum and i am sure you will do just fine when the time comes to explain xx Religion God Roman Catholic Church Atheism Predestination Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Theology Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Fundamentalism Christianity Trinity Theory of conduct Creationism The nature of God in Western theology Sin Infant baptism Evangelicalism Eastern Orthodox Church Judaism Liberal Christianity Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Soul Religious pluralism Religious Society of Friends Salvation Baptism Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Heaven Separation of church and state Baptist Resurrection of Jesus Mary, the mother of Jesus Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Christian anarchism Catholicism Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints A Course In Miracles Church of Christ Idolatry Scientology beliefs and practices Messianic Judaism Supernatural Ten Commandments Abrahamic religion Catechism Biblical inerrancy Saint History of Christianity Protestantism Minister of religion Hell Names and titles of Jesus John Howard Yoder Origin belief Evil Sola fide Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Moses Existence of God Evolutionary creationism Nontrinitarianism Christian eschatology Jewish principles of faith Nation of Islam Chosen people Rich Mullins Angel Charles Darwin's views on religion Witchcraft Philosophical skepticism Genesis Cultural and historical background of Jesus Free will Animism Sabbath Alan Campbell (pastor) Jesus Avenue Q Exorcism Church of Christ, Scientist Meaning of life Teach the Controversy Christian right Eucharist John the Baptist Cult Great Apostasy Christian denomination Apologetics Dualism (philosophy of mind)
