if religions that don't believe they have a responsibility to spread god's message to other's then what is the purpose of having religion at all if a religion feels that everyone has a right to follow god anyway they feel is good for thier path then what is the purpose of practicing thier own faith if god is about truth how many truths does god have or many according to human beings isn't this idol worship accepting people for what they believe is one thing but saying that thier faith is true so is your's and his and thier's then there is no truth thoughts there is something called universal truth that goes beyond and even encompases religions the problem most religious people have is that they view everything through their religion world view and fail to see the universal truth behind all religions this is not to say that all religions historically accurate or that everything they teach is true it just means that god had the foresight to place divine truth into every culture through the medium of religion mythology all of the moral stories and teachings in one religions are usually in all of the other religions in one form or another these stories and teachings are most likely from the same source god people once they recieve revelation from god because of their pride like to say things like this is the word of god then this quickly becomes this is the only word of god and you must accept it once they have gotten to this stage they have already begun to believe the lies of satan lies that split mankind into competing groups and turns us against each other it is a sad thing people need to recognize the universal truth that is present in all traditions and religions Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Religion Religious pluralism Religious Society of Friends Satanism God Prophet Ten Commandments Fundamentalism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Idolatry Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Monotheism Religion and mythology Roman Catholic Church Islam Existence of God Christianity Urantia Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Theology Jewish principles of faith Atheism Revelation A Course In Miracles Mormonism Mythology Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Religious conversion Devil Sant Mat Jesus Taoism Theodicy Buddhism Chosen people New Testament Eastern philosophy Philosophy of religion John Howard Yoder Resurrection of Jesus Zoroastrianism Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Creationism Spiritism Satan Summa Theologiae Divine grace Opus Dei Philo Gospel of Thomas Abrahamic religion Predestination Book of Mormon The nature of God in Western theology Origin belief Magic (paranormal) Ayyavazhi Evolutionary creationism Sin Jewish views of religious pluralism Salvation Sikhism Second Vatican Council Neopaganism Rastafari movement InterFaith Bah__'__ Faith God and gender Gautama Buddha Christian-Jewish reconciliation Friedrich Schleiermacher Advaita Vedanta Ethics in religion Wicca Heresy Demon New Age Development of religion Sacrifice Dharma Past teachings of Prem Rawat Holy Spirit Ethics Hell Ascetical theology Church of Christ, Scientist Religious perspectives on Jesus Church of Christ Angel
