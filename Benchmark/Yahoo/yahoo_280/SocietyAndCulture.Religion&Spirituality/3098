vampires malicious or misunderstood you decide look inside for information on choices before making it vampirism is considered sad to those who look at it properly and i agree very much so it is a dreadful curse to be involved in for the disgusting humans who crave to become vampires i pity them all for they are clearly insane having the choice they did not have and then choosing all wrong to be condemned to eternal darkness no matter the kindness in their hearts tell me and i am speaking hypothetically of course but let us say claudia was is real and you are god and are judging people to see if they should be allowed in heaven or sent to hell claudia has finally died killed by a vampire hunter you see the remnants of the goodness in her heart know that she struggled so hard to choose the right path but she is a monster who is there that does believe in vampires and those who do believe them to be evil though they are neither demon nor ghastly spirits but they possess the qualities of both drinking from the living to survive themselves but let continued claudia was is real and you are god and are judging people to see if they should be allowed in heaven or sent to hell claudia has finally died killed by a vampire hunter you see the remnants of the goodness in her heart know that she struggled so hard to choose the right path but she is a monster who is there that does believe in vampires and those who do believe them to be evil though they are neither demon nor ghastly spirits but they possess the qualities of both drinking from the living to survive themselves but let us say that claudia did not kill when she drank that she found a way around it but she still did feed would you allow her in heaven or cast her away with the murderers and homicidals humans are a prejudiced race and will never see eye to eye with the night angels you cannot tell me you would allow her to pass through the golden gates even if she had tried because no matter how badly she wants to be good you cannot reverse the effects of the terrible change it is one thing to ask to become an n a but to be forced into it having you soul stolen does it make you evil to not kill yourself i have to ask would you hate someone if you figured out they were a vampire if you were god and came face to face with a particular night angel who struggled so hard to go against what she was would you let her through into your kingdom i think not for despite what you may think now to be in that situation triggers the knee jerk reaction of sending her away but and once more i am speaking theoretically if i was claudia and we were good friends would you send me away when you learned i was a beast even if i did not choose to be that beast think hard on that you call it sad but what would you do in that situation for those who do not know i am claudia and i do not think that i am evil i was handed a way of life no forced to take it but i try to be good no one wants to be a killer you see but am i really just being blind am i bad after all despite my attempts at civility is it a wasted attempt the question is are vampires evil well from my understanding of vampires i wouldn't have to do either technically u r neither blessed nor damned but cursed to suffer with something so sad u are cursed with immortality and u must forever be a night angel u must live forever and watch those who accept u die until u are released from your curse with a stake through your heart and if you have a heart you have a soul which means you can choose from right and wrong which means i would not be able to condemn you to darkness only you through your choices and actions could Hell Pitaten Angel Demon YuYu Hakusho Vampire Immortality Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Theory of
