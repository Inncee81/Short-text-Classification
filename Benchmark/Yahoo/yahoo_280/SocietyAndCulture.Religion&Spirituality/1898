what do you think of this experience i had with god at church i was going to this church in edmonton big chruch i was so excited for some reason to enter into this church and worship i always am by the way but this day was different like my heart was pounding for it i entered into this pentacostal chruch and a propheicey was comeing down the whole church is silent of course and this spirit falls on me and everything is white and i am holy my heart is in this unspeakable joy beating with laughter and happyness then i lied while i was in this spirit and it left and i felt so down i was like unto god i can not be perfect so when you make me perfect come back to me and bring that unspeakable joy back ever sense that day my heart has been crying for rightousness and holiness and to be perfect like the father is perfect are there any scriptures that talk about this unspeakable joy that people have a supernatural joy that only the holy spirit can give i personally am in love with psalm surely you have granted him eternal blessings and made him glad with the joy of your presence i really think this is the best scripture to describe your feeling of perfection in his eyes and this is my opinion because i think the joy that you speak of is his favor upon you and his favor is the ultimate cause of joy because it is the greatest of all blessings i know there are other scriptures that can help you out but like i said that is my favorite one since i'm sure you'll desire more do a word study on joy god bless Holy Spirit Eastern Orthodox Church Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Christian eschatology God and gender Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Sabbath Book of Isaiah God Mortification of the flesh Mass (liturgy) Roman Catholic Church Sola fide Bhajan Pentecostalism Mary, the mother of Jesus Religion Charismatic John Wesley Sant Thakar Singh Baptism Merit Blessed Virgin Mary Salvation Papal Infallibility Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Church of Christ Church of Christ, Scientist Religious Society of Friends Athanasian Creed Original sin Justification (theology) Ten Commandments Confession Christianity Jon Secada Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Endowment (Mormonism) Book of Mormon Summa Theologiae Nontrinitarianism Heaven Psalms A Course In Miracles Eucharist Abrahamic religion Angel Articles of Religion (Methodist) Divine grace Amidah Opus Dei Alan Campbell (pastor) Saint Existence of God Hell Mormonism and Christianity Predestination Protestantism Free will Homosexuality and Christianity Mission (Christian) Origen Funeral of Pope John Paul II Contrition Indulgence Past teachings of Prem Rawat Catholicism Great Apostasy Binitarianism Demon Canonization Exorcism Second Vatican Council Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Toronto blessing Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Idolatry John the Baptist Eternal Father, Strong to Save John Howard Yoder Philipp Melanchthon Christian mysticism Jewish Messiah The nature of God in Western theology Christian and Missionary Alliance Christian views of Jesus Community of Christ Zoroastrianism Mormonism Duties of the Heart Th__r__se de Lisieux Sacrifice Simone Weil Virgin Mary in Islam
