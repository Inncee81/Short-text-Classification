could someone who is a buddhist please tell me more about buddhism i an curious about buddhism the belief systems what it involves and pretty much how it works i would appreciate if someone who is a buddhist could tell me about it thanks what is buddhism buddhism is a religion to about million people around the world the word comes from 'budhi' 'to awaken' it has its origins about years ago when siddhartha gotama known as the buddha was himself awakened enlightened at the age of why is buddhism becoming popular buddhism is becoming popular in western countries for a number of reasons the first good reason is buddhism has answers to many of the problems in modern materialistic societies it also includes for those who are interested a deep understanding of the human mind and natural therapies which prominent psychologists around the world are now discovering to be both very advanced and effective who was the buddha siddhartha gotama was born into a royal family in lumbini now located in nepal in bc at he realised that wealth and luxury did not guarantee happiness so he explored the different teachings religions and philosophies of the day to find the key to human happiness after six years of study and meditation he finally found 'the middle path' and was enlightened after enlightenment the buddha spent the rest of his life teaching the principles of buddhism called the dhamma or truth until his death at the age of was the buddha a god he was not nor did he claim to be he was a man who taught a path to enlightenment from his own experience do buddhists worship idols buddhists sometimes pay respect to images of the buddha not in worship nor to ask for favours a statue of the buddha with hands rested gently in its lap and a compassionate smile reminds us to strive to develop peace and love within ourselves bowing to the statue is an expression of gratitude for the teaching are other religions wrong buddhism is also a belief system which is tolerant of all other beliefs or religions buddhism agrees with the moral teachings of other religions but buddhism goes further by providing a long term purpose within our existence through wisdom and true understanding real buddhism is very tolerant and not concerned with labels like 'christian' 'moslem' 'hindu' or 'buddhist' that is why there have never been any wars fought in the name of buddhism that is why buddhists do not preach and try to convert only explain if an explanation is sought buddhist teachings can be understood and tested by anyone buddhism teaches that the solutions to our problems are within ourselves not outside the buddha asked all his followers not to take his word as true but rather to test the teachings for themselves ln this way each person decides for themselves and takes responsibility for their own actions and understanding this makes buddhism less of a fixed package of beliefs which is to be accepted in its entirety and more of a teaching which each person learns and uses in their own way http www buddhanet net Philosophy Faith in Buddhism Mantra Jainism Theravada Vajrayana Buddha B.
