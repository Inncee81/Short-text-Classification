the forbidden fruit of eden so we know that the forbidden fruit was not an apple it would be more historically accurate for it to be a fig or pomegranate the actual question s if it was a sin to eat this fruit then why is it not now did the church ever have a rule about it i understand that it was a metaphor for the knowledge of cultivationing plants and animals i didn't ask if it was true or if it was a metaphor what i asked was has the church ever had a ruling about the consumption of a fruit do to the story of adam and eve the cultivation of the fruit was used by god to test the obedience to his laws his ruler ship since we haven't been forbidden it it either is because the fruit does not exist any longer or more likely because once disobedience had occurred the fruit lost its value as a symbol of obedience Original sin Adam and Eve Garden of Eden Tree of Knowledge Paradise Lost Satan Sola fide Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Kashrut Ishmael (novel) Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Genesis Articles of Religion (Methodist) Fruit Religious pluralism Banana Vegetarianism and religion Vegetarianism Creationism Sin Theosis Divine grace Endowment (Mormonism) The Fall of Man Tree of Life Charles Grandison Finney Church of Christ Eucharist Adam-God theory Pomegranate Infant baptism Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Abrahamic religion Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Baptism Children of Eden Covenant Theology Predestination Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Free will Fruitarianism Tomato Two Treatises of Government Sharia Ten Commandments Kosher foods Simone Weil Grimke Sisters Christian anarchism Theodicy Gnosticism Noah's Ark Religion and sexuality Young Earth creationism Entheogen Justification (theology) Demon Names of God in Judaism Fallen angel Rule of St Benedict Quince Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Summa Theologiae Confucianism 613 mitzvot Mary, the mother of Jesus Leviathan (book) Evolutionary creationism Criticism of Mormonism God Philosophy of science John Wycliffe Holy Spirit The Magician's Nephew Halakha Salvation Potato Christian eschatology Frugivore Fruit tree propagation Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Sacrifice Irenaeus Christianity Johnny Appleseed Dionysus Roman Catholic Church Martin Luther Atlantis Vitamin C Women in Islam Urantia Cultural and historical background of Jesus Characters of The Sandman Buddhism Jewish principles of faith Biblical inerrancy Pharisees
