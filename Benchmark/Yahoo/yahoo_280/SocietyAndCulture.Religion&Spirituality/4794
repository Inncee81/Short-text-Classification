is christianity a life filled with angst i believe right now but if salvation ultimately rests on my final thoughts regarding the subject before my death and whether i truly believe or not should i be worried about the years ahead well along with having salvation and doing the will of the lord does come trials and tribulations it's not going to be a easy road to travel but also with salvation comes the love of jesus and in that there is peace and joy but honestly we aren't here for our own fulfillment jesus wants us to witness and tell about the goodness of him he also wants all of his children to live in heaven with him one day and knowing that you will is more than enough to keep you head strong so consider the outcome of everything would you rather have riches on earth that only are temporary or riches in heaven that last forever and if you know the truth now don't wait another day to except jesus into your heart because we're not promised tomorrow Christian eschatology Book of Isaiah Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Holy Spirit Book of Mormon Salvation Heaven Dispensationalism Sermon on the Mount Ten Commandments Eastern Orthodox Church Rich Mullins Christianity End times Tribulation Baptism Qiyamah Predestination Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Trinity Divine grace Herbert W.
