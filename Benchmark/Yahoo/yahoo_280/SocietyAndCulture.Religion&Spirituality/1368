what ideas could you come up with as to why we are referred to as sheep in the bible read below in heartlight today it talks about jesus as the good shepherd and as i was doing some research in history sheep were extremely valuable sheep were kept for their milk meat and especially their wool if you think about this years ago the sheep were like so many resources to the people so they could survive it made their food and clothing and so much and milk so when jesus calls us sheep please see it in this loving light instead of we don't all have to follow like sheep as used in a negative connotation in our modern world i do think chrisitans should follow jesus but i see here that when he calls us sheep it means we are very very very valuable to him a new insight to me today and are you shepherding any young ones in the lord regardless of their earthly age he needs you as shepherds but remember shepherds will lay down their lives for their sheep shepherds are not at all it's all about me just the opposite not only were sheep valuable but they need a shepherd as they are easily mislead just like us to protect us from false shepperd's that would devour our souls to send them to a very dim dark godless eternity god gave us a wonderful savior shepherd jesus he protects us and guides us and trust me we need every bit of help he has to offer whether we think so or not it is not all about me it is all about him my little sheep are grown now and raising a flocks of their own good day to you my brother in christ Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Gospel of Thomas Sola fide Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Domestic sheep Limited atonement John Howard Yoder Shepherd Book of Isaiah Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Book of Mormon Salvation A Course In Miracles Edgar Cayce Ten Commandments John the Baptist Soul Christian eschatology Christianity Sheep husbandry Alan Campbell (pastor) Justification (theology) Creationism Five points of Calvinism Sabbath Church of Christ Rapture Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses The Pilgrim's Progress Abrahamic religion Livestock Angel Dog 613 mitzvot Hell Dispensationalism Summa Theologiae Animal husbandry Paul of Tarsus Resurrection of Jesus Emanuel Swedenborg Trinity Sin Wool Urantia Sheep Divine grace Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Rich Mullins Merit Afterlife Church of Christ, Scientist David Prophet George Fox Korban Mary, the mother of Jesus Sacrifice History of the Latter Day Saint movement Christian views of Jesus Historicity of Jesus Apostle God Religion Evangelicalism Saint Fundamentalism Chronology of Jesus Didache Holy Spirit Rule of St Benedict Images of Jesus Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Secret Gospel of Mark Religious Society of Friends Religious conversion Great Apostasy Binitarianism Blacks and Mormonism Demon Religious perspectives on Jesus Adam-God theory Domestic goat Anti-Mormonism The Shepherd of Hermas God and gender Last Judgment Roman Catholic Church Ayyavazhi mythology Gray Wolf Gospel of Barnabas Sermon on the Mount Criticism of Mormonism
