if jesus did come back down to earth do you think anyone would believe it was him plenty of people in the past have claimed to be jesus all of them dismissed as crazy and blasphemous if jesus really did come down do you think he would be thought of as anything more than a hoax or a magician similarly if the end of the world did come do you think there would be a wave of people claiming to be jesus and taking responsibility for the end of the earth kitty i hardly think the question is non sensical hypothetical yes this is question to be answered by those from that point of view therefore is valid whether the question applies to some and not others does not determine nonsensicalness i should also point out that i'm an atheist and you should stop jumping to nonsensical conclusions actually it is not biblical for jesus to come back to earth in the second coming revelation and i looked and behold a white cloud and upon the cloud one sat like unto the son of nan having on he head a golden crown thessalonians then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them the resurrected saints in the clouds to meet the lord in the air note god's saints will meet the lord in the air jesus does not touch the earth at his second coming so he will not appear on the earth as many believe his second coming will be a sky apperance not an earth appearance what solemn warning does jesus give about his second coming matthew for many shall come in my name saying i am christ and shall decieve many matthew for there shall arise false christs and false prophets and shall shew great signs and wonders insomuch that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect if they shall say unto you behold he is in the secret chambers believe it not Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Jesus Antichrist Christian eschatology Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Prophet Baptism Resurrection of Jesus Ten Commandments Biblical inerrancy Soul Second Coming Priesthood (Mormonism) Angel Book of Mormon Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Religion Dispensationalism Adam-God theory God Christianity History of the Latter Day Saint movement Isa Abrahamic religion Mary, the mother of Jesus Tribulation Creationism Holy Spirit Nation of Islam Religious perspectives on Jesus Pope Slow Train Coming Eastern Orthodox Church Curse and mark of Cain Apocrypha Devil Noah Apostle Paul of Tarsus Blacks and Mormonism Sola fide Race of Jesus Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Messiah Trinity Eucharist Binitarianism Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Restoration (Mormonism) Hell A Course In Miracles Temple (Mormonism) Linguistics and the Book of Mormon Authorship of the Pauline epistles Gospel of John Christian views of Jesus Names and titles of Jesus Salvation Jehovah's Witnesses Saint Peter Sabbath Christian apologetics Historicity of Jesus Mormonism Herbert W.
