atheists isn't accepting only what we can consciously concretely rationalize limiting of life and experience it seems to me that this would lead to a limited and reductionist view of life that leaves out mystery and possibility i'm not denying the value of knowledge or rational thought or intellect just because i choose not to give those things ultimate meaning doesn't mean i deny their importance actually for me it is expanding life and experience when you take the time to learn the rules theories and regulations of things that can't be verified you limit your exposure to what is actually there in other words the more time i spend imagining things the less time i get to spend experiencing real life the world is filled with all types of different people places and things to see touch smell hear and tast as well as learn about why would i waste my time imagining things when i could just as easily learn about something real even ideas are good to learn about they help you to better understand others and give you insight into your own thoughts and thought processes for me the known universe is the ultimate playground and laboratory there's so much to learn and experience and pass on i can't think of a reason to look beyond it then again it also helps that i already know the answer to the ultimate question is but seriously intellectual thought on what is real is a very spiritually fulfilling experience for me i can look at the past and put philosophies in context with the cultures and civilizations that spawned them learning what went into making a religion is much more fulfilling than the religion itself you can never get true answers from learning a religion but you can definitely find out the truth behind the religion please don't feel offended by my answer it isn't a knock on you or your beliefs i just wanted to share my thoughts on the question you asked have a great day The nature of God in Western theology Supernatural Philosophy of language Socrates Human Goodness and value theory God Atheism Simone Weil Jiddu Krishnamurti Existence of God Predestination Al-Ghazali Reality Philosophy David Hume A Course In Miracles Jewish principles of faith Existentialism Creationism S__ren Kierkegaard Problem of universals Traumatic incident reduction Victor Cousin Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Theodicy Rudolf Steiner Epistemology Moral objectivism Agnosticism Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Philosophical skepticism Alcoholics Anonymous Jewish philosophy Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Immanuel Kant Ontological argument Consciousness Frankfurt School Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel Theology Coercion Anthroposophy Artificial consciousness Summa Theologiae Cultural relativism Free will Sigmund Freud Deconstruction Scientific method Michel Henry Neuro-linguistic programming Mysticism Scientology beliefs and practices Psychology of religion Ken Wilber Carl Jung Philosophy of science Moral relativism Karl Marx Religious Society of Friends Donald Davidson (philosopher) Francis Crick Social psychology Alchemy Atomism Franz Boas Rudolf Hermann Lotze Reincarnation Origin belief Bernard Williams Postmodernism Current teachings of Prem Rawat Philosophy of religion Noam Chomsky Hinduism Logic Metaphysics Social rule Critique of Pure Reason Buddhism Prayer Mythology Microeconomics Fundamentalism Human nature Anselm of Canterbury Science Extreme Programming Philosophy of mind
