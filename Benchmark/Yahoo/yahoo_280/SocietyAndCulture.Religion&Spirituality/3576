how do you get into general conference lds i've never been to general conference in person and my cousin was saying she would also like to go so i stated thinking why not i suppose i coud ask the bishop but why not ask ya'll anybody know generally each stake gets a certain amount of tickets sometimes the stake pres allocates these to the bishops in the stake sometimes he gives them to members himself i would recommend asking your bishop for some i have gone with friends and we would stand on the corner outside the conference center and asked people for extra tickets i've gotten in almost everytime that way there is also a standby line that you can get into if you are from another country you can talk to someone i don't know who i've never done it and most likely be able to get into a couple sessions Priesthood (Mormonism) Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints General conference (Mormonism) Succession crisis (Mormonism) Bishop Bishop (Mormonism) Jan Hus Social rule Excommunication Blonde on Blonde Stake (Mormonism) William Marks (Mormonism) Government of Maryland Friends Quorums of the Seventy Kasparov versus The World Live 8 LDS Conference Center Linked list Betting (poker) Temple (Mormonism) Criticism of Mormonism High priest (Mormonism) Church of the United Brethren in Christ International Olympic Committee Theory of conduct Community of Christ African Methodist Episcopal Church Supply and demand Doctrine and Covenants League of Nations Whose Line Is It Anyway?
