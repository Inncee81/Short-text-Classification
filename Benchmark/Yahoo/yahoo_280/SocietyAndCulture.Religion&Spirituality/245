is your god omniscient or omnipotent a god can't be all knowing and all powerful it contradicts itself if you don't think so then ask yourself if god can change its future mind if your god is all knowing then it already knows what's going to take place therefore it would not have the power to change its future mind my logic makes perfect sense ok say if you have an all knowing god that can see the future that god already knows everything that is going to take place and will never be able to have the power to change its future mind since once again it already knows what is going to happen at the time it predicted everything now if god changed its future mind then god is not omniscient since it did not forsee itself changing its future mind hope this helps it definitely is a paradox the problem here is that god knows everything that has happened and everything that will happen its knowledge cannot be wrong there is not a single event that it has not foresaw given that it created the universe the way it did do we have free will consider that when god made the universe it could see every possible result of what it was doing which means it could not create something without knowing what the results would be and without knowing how it would be affected and effect the things around it this argument does not imply that god does not exist it leaves us with three results two of which have to be wrong god created everything with full knowledge and we have no free will to change it god does not have full knowledge god did not make the universe or there is no god you can't be omniscient and know everything everyone will do and say they have freewill you can't be omnipotent and not do anything to help good people out of their suffering without being evil atheist Free will Problem of evil Omnipotence Predestination Theodicy Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Existence of God God Paradox Time travel Cosmological argument Omniscience Summa Theologiae Open Theism Miracle Problem of Hell Supernatural Christian eschatology Epistemology Falsifiability Transcendental argument for the existence of God Agnosticism Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Creationism Hellenic philosophy and Christianity Simone Weil Atheism Religion Newcomb's paradox Karma Intelligent design Determinism A Course In Miracles Friedrich Schleiermacher Duties of the Heart David Hume Teleological argument Immanuel Kant Holocaust theology Original sin Paradise Lost Evolutionary creationism Metaphysics Philosophy of religion Islamic philosophy Omnipresence Divine command theory G__del's incompleteness theorem Urantia Maimonides Al-Ghazali Argument from morality Guide for the Perplexed Socrates Theory Strong atheism Karma in Hinduism Predestination paradox Omnipotence paradox Philosophy of mathematics Qualia Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Presuppositional apologetics Philosophical skepticism Belief Scientific method Idealism English grammar Legacy of Kain S__ren Kierkegaard Bertrand Russell Gnosticism Kuzari Debugging Dualism (philosophy of mind) Human nature Karl Popper Antony Flew Phaedo Logic Deism Moral objectivism Atomism Conscience Philosophy of science Thomism Purgatory Truth
