why do my fellow christians uphold the ten commandments but reject the part about the seventh day sabbath sabbath according to the holy bible is the seventh day of the week which is saturday and not sunday the ten commandments were not given exclusively to the jewish people they were given to be upheld by the nations of the world for generations to come jesus never made any changes in the ten commandments therefore why is there this obvious departure from god's sabbath given to mankind at creation and then reiterated in god's moral law god himself wrote the ten commandments with his own fingers exodus genesis exodus luke acts acts luke matthew john luke hebrews james revelation remember the sabbath day to keep it holy there are some people who keep sunday as a celebration of jesus's resurrection he never commanded us to worship in honor of his resurrection just as the communion service symbolizes his death cor baptism symbolizes his resurrection rom the symbol of jesus' resurrection is not worship on the day of the sun adopted into christianity from pagan rome's sun worship but a beautiful ceremony of baptism as a symbol of a new life transformed by the wonder working power of the holy spirit there are people who misinterpret the scriptures that describe the disciples worshiping on the sabbath when in truth they really were only gathering on saturday night after the sabbath was over the reason this meeting is mentioned in this narrative is because paul was leaviing the next day and worked a mighty miracle in raising eutychus from the dead it is clear that the meeting is a night meeting it is the dark part of the first day of the week acts in bible times the dark part of the day preceded the light part gen the sabbath was observed from friday night sunset to saturday night sundown lev mk if this meeting is on the dark part of the first day of the week it is in fact a saturday night meeting paul has met with the believers all sabbath he will depart the next day sunday so the meeting continues late into saturday night the next day sunday paul travels by foot to assos then sailed to mitylene the new english bible reading of acts also confirms this as a saturday night meeting with paul traveling on sunday if paul considered sunday sacred in honor of the resurrection why would he spend the entire day traveling and not worshipping the record indicates that paul was a sabbath keeper see acts i agree with you that it is hard to understand why christians will honor nine of the ten commandments but not all especially one that was created before jews came into existence at creation god created the earth in six days and on the seventh he hallowed that day for rest and worship it is a hour period out of the week from sundown friday and sundown saturday to honor god worship him and rest from the work we've done throughout the week and spend it with our creator that's not asking too much i don't know if you are a seventh day baptist or a seventh day adventist i am the latter and i'm proud of it Christian views of Jesus Infant baptism Gospel Sunday History of Christianity Idolatry Binitarianism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Book of Mormon Paul of Tarsus Chronology of Jesus Pharisees Divine grace Historicity of Jesus Roman Catholic Church New Testament view on Jesus' life True Jesus Church Angel Day-Age Creationism Judaism Great Apostasy Gospel of John Alan Campbell (pastor) Gospel of Mark Moses Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Young Earth creationism Soul Salvation Creationism John the Baptist Acts of the Apostles Justification (theology) Creation according to Genesis End times Rosh Hashanah Tabernacle Noahide Laws Book of Isaiah Canonical hours Church of Christ, Scientist Baptist Liturgical year Justin Martyr Book of Revelation Fasting Satan Religious Society of Friends Original sin Priesthood (Mormonism) Jehovah's Witnesses Origen Vespers Historical Jesus Religious perspectives on Jesus Apocalyptic literature Herbert W.
