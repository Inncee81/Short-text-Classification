christians how do you ignore the unknowns of religion i was raised in a christian family but for many years now i've asked theological questions which have stumped parents friends even pastors what's confuses me almost more than the lack of clarity is how those people can all carry on ignoring it while many people like to pretend you can find all the answers in the bible the reality is that there are several areas of the religion which are left rather vague perhaps they are purposely unclear but that doesn't sate my curiosity how are you as a christian able to ignore these unclear parts of the faith and not wonder or ask questions i don't want to specify the parts as that would distract from what i'm asking the only answers i've gotten from others have been along the lines of i trust god or i just don't think about it how can someone not think about it alright there's been some confusion since i didn't want to state any specific parts so i've set up a different question for one it is located here http answers yahoo com question index ylt ap gtkxs i hakq m qcm sy ix qid aa ngee so let me ask this what kind of church were you raised in i began in southern baptist then to another southern baptist after a move for my parents to attend seminary another move led to a baptist evangelical then pentecostal then to evangelical people ignore hard questions because they are well hard to think about some don't like to challenge their current beliefs because it causes great inner turmoil and maybe doubt i believe in christ i too see unanswered questions that doesn't shake my faith to question to ponder to wonder to seek this does not change my faith whether or not religions of the world want to admit this no religion has all the answers here on earth i liken the truth to a large all encompassing circle like a venn diagram with all the religions like smaller circles in various parts of the large circle of truth some religion circles are completely inside the truth circle contains truth but not all the truth others are partly inside partly outside contains part truth part falsehoods still other religion circles are completely outside the circle of truth yes there is so much more to know even in the scriptures jesus mentioned how there was more to tell but people could not bear it now and in his father's mansion there were many rooms who's to say which room we are in or will be in maybe all the other rooms are completely different i wonder i ponder but i don't seek answers from those who don't know no one on earth really knows all keep wondering and seeking pray to god for answers this is the only way the truth will come to you you will feel a rightness about things in your heart and mind but do know that you aren't meant to know all things on this earthly plane some things will reveal themselves in the right time and place in the meantime better to spend your time asking yourself what can i do with the information i do know and accept how can it make me live a purposeful life before i move onto the other side hope always Christianity Religion Baptist Fundamentalism Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints God Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Theology Church of Christ Pentecostalism Eastern Orthodox Church Roman Catholic Church Sola fide Criticism of Mormonism Religious conversion Great Apostasy Meaning of life Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Trinity Sabbath Holy Spirit Church of Christ, Scientist Liberal Christianity Evangelicalism John Wycliffe The nature of God in Western theology A Course In Miracles Urantia John Howard Yoder Religious pluralism Soul Mary, the mother of Jesus Salvation Charles Darwin's views on religion Book of Mormon Presuppositional apologetics Mormonism and Christianity Opus Dei Existence of God Biblical inerrancy Biblical canon Protestantism Homosexuality and Christianity Catechism Eucharist Historicity of Jesus Infant baptism Calvinism Christianity and anti-Semitism Baptism Angel William M.
