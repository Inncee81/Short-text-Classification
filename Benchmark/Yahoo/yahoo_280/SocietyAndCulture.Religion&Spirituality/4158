who is the anti christ martin luther was not the first person to claim that the pope is the anti christ john wycliffe came to the same conclusion some years before luther did unlike luther wycliffe had everything to loose and nothing to gain from proclaiming this but he did it anyway because that is what he believed let us examine the facts what is the beast the anti christ it is a religious power that rises out of europe after the fall of rome and of the tribes of the fallen empire are taken out that acts as sovereign nation it has much wealth and wants to change the laws of god and the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise and another shall rise after them and he shall be diverse from the first and he shall subdue three kings and he shall speak great words against the most high and shall wear out the saints of the most high and think to change times and laws and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time daniel kjv the history of europe settles the matter there were kingdoms that formed directly after the fall of rome after three kingdoms were taken out the vandals lombards and huns the bishop of rome rose to power and formed what we now know as the roman catholic church and this position is now known as the pope with this power the pope has changed god's times and laws many christians no longer observe the sabbath god's time and god s law because the pope has instituted sunday worship the roman catechism even has a different set of ten commandments in it than the bible's it is also obvious that this kingdom represented by the little horn is different from all the others the vatican is a nation that has great wealth the little horn wares an expensive crown earlier in daniel chapter but is very small like a little horn among big ones and is wholly ruled by a religious leader unlike any other nation in europe today the vatican is a nation because the usa has an ambassador to the vatican there are even more clues to point to the papal system as being the anti christ and i saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death and his deadly wound was healed and all the world wondered after the beast revelation kjv the pope was taken out of power and made prisoner wounded in by napoleon but the pope was miraculously healed from his deadly wound in by premier mussolini if italy who gave the pope all his power back the whole world has wondered after the pope just look at everyone that attended the funeral of the late john paul ii leaders of almost every nation in the world also we find this of the anti christ and there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months and he opened his mouth in blasphemy against god to blaspheme his name and his tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven revelation kjv what is blasphemy the act of claiming for oneself the attributes and rights of god american heritage dictionary does the pope blaspheme against this background of love towards holy church 'the pillar and bulwark of the truth' tim we readily understand the devotion of saint francis of assisi for 'the lord pope' the daughterly outspokenness of saint catherine of siena towards the one whom she called 'sweet christ on earth' pope john paul ii apostolic exhortation vita consecrata on the consecrated life and its mission in the church and in the world march the pope is of so great dignity and so exalted that he is not a mere man but as it were god and the vicar of god ferraris ecclesiastical dictionary all names which in the scriptures are applied to christ by virtue of which it is established that he is over the church all the same names are applied to the pope on the authority of the councils book chapter the pope and god are the same so he has all power in heaven and earth pope pius v quoted in barclay chapter xxvii p cities petrus bertanous to believe that our lord god the pope has not the power to decree as he is decreed is to be deemed heretical the gloss extravagantes o f pope john xxii inter tit xiv cap iv ad callem sexti decretalium paris i would say he dose the pope also claimes to be able to forgive sins the bible clearly says that this is blasphamy why doth this man thus speak blasphemies who can forgive sins but god only mark kjv i think the papal system matches up with the anti christ too much to be a coincidence Jubilee (Christian) Hell Sign of contradiction Vatican City Soul Christian views of women Calvinism Biblical inerrancy Henry VIII of England Roman Catholicism's links with political authorities Justification (theology) Protestantism Blasphemy Society of Jesus
