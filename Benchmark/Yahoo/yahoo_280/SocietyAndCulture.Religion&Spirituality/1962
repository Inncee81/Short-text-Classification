since some christians are so quick to judge other religions as being wrong how do you as a christian feel about differing sects of christianity that do not believe the same example some sects believe in the gift of speaking in tongues pentecostal evangelism etc while others baptists etc do not believe in this gift would you then say they are not really christians since they do not believe something that is clearly written in the bible btw i am christian so please no assuming i am being judgemental of anyone b this world would be a much better place if there were more like you who chose not to judge others personally everyone has to believe in something no matter what or who i believe in god but don't attend church due to the fact that most of the ones there are not true to what they say they are i don't criticize anyone for what they believe i only know what's in my heart and what i believe i truly wish most people thought the way i do i am so not a judge mental person rather it being race or religion i really has no effect on me what so ever and i will raise my kids to be the same way Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Pentecostalism Baptist Holy Spirit Religious conversion Protestantism Church of Christ Christianity Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Fundamentalism Baptism Charismatic Opus Dei Christian denomination Sabbath Glossolalia Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Evangelicalism Abrahamic religion Church of Christ, Scientist Restorationism Religion Bible and reincarnation George Fox Christian and Missionary Alliance Salvation Homosexuality and Christianity Eucharist Calvinism Predestination History of Christianity Unification Church Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Prophet Divine grace Fundamentalist Christianity History of the Latter Day Saint movement Ten Commandments William M.
