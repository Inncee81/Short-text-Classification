why did the judeo christian god not reveal himself to man before bce the peoples of the area had religions over a thousand years prior to this and abraham was a resident of the babylonian city of ur if god has always been and is the same god from every religion just known by different names how could he make the transition from polytheistic and paganistic to monotheistic the sumerians believed that the supreme god was anu but the creators of men were enki and enlil that humans were an experiment of genetic engineering how does one translate these gods to yahweh adonai elohim without corrupting the truth how do we truly know which story is correct and which are fabrications why aren't the previous dieties from older religions mentioned in the later religions of the bible why does god give no explanation as to why he's taken so many forms this is a serious question i'm not trying to make any points be offensive overgeneralize or be fecetious thanks for your answers each civilization believes that they are the chosen one of their god the story of adam and eve is found in texts from the sumerians babylonians from before the formation of judaism adam and eve is not a solely jewish christian muslim story it has origins in other religions jed i'm sorry but i disagree with you these stories can be found on cunieform tablets the oldest known writings in the world i didn't write that essay if you'd like to read essays that i have written check my blog if you read the details of my question i state that this is a serious question if you aren't going to answer why bother even talking you didn't impart any knowledge or understanding you haven't changed my views on anything you've just wasted both our time thanks i have always wondered the same thing muslims and christians both harbor a belief that they believe in the one true god and have the one true religion and that everyone esle is false however when islam and christianity are viewed in the wider context of human civilisation they are young religions that arose relatively recently muslims and christians will have everyone believe that civilisation was barbaric before these religions were born and it was they who civilised however the civilisations that they destroyed in an endeavour to convert them to islam were actually more sophisticated than what they become after example babylonia byzantine vedic india zoroastrian persia etc etc etc if it is true that the god which the muslims and christians believe is the only one true god then pray can they kindly explain why such a god made his presence visible only recently and why he kept humanity in the dark for so long Idolatry Creationism Tetragrammaton Devil Angel Religious pluralism Monotheism Names of God in Judaism Abraham Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Ten Commandments Origin belief Trinity Atheism Moses Henotheism Satan Zoroastrianism Evolutionary creationism Christianity Prayer Religious conversion Hinduism Fundamentalism Prophet Magic (paranormal) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Jewish principles of faith Jew Demon God and gender Hebrew calendar Jesus Predestination Documentary hypothesis Sin Jewish views of religious pluralism Mythology Nation of Islam Jerusalem Theodicy Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Samaritan Existence of God Kabbalah Allah Bible Resurrection of Jesus Noahide Laws Jewish philosophy Satanism Yeshu Book of Isaiah Deluge (mythology) God the Father Muhammad Miracle Chosen people Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) History of Christianity Human Islamic philosophy Khazars Adam and Eve Infant baptism Hell Genesis Criticism of Islam Babylonia Criticism of Mormonism Polytheism Great Apostasy Creation according to Genesis Nontrinitarianism Jacob Neusner The nature of God in Western theology Cultural and historical background of Jesus Evil Pharisees Creation-evolution controversy Neopaganism Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Holy Spirit Reincarnation Noah Young Earth creationism Meaning of life
