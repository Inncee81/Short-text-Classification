do you speak in tounges i do yes this is one of the central ways we can enter into the work of the holy spirit the holy spirit is moving in ways we cannot comprehend with our flesh even if our flesh is somewhat submitted to the lord jesus when we speak in tongues we begin to sense the presence of god in a palpable way and we are able to minister to others from the love of god not just from the thoughts of our minds or hearts furthermore the holy spirit is our counselor and comforter speaking in tongues or or prayer language however you want to define it was never meant to be some rare thing to do it was the tangible gift given at pentacost for all believers somehow a dispensationalist spirit has lead many people to believe that it's some strange bizarre or heretical thing to do when in reality it's as clear as day in scripture so i would encourage you to keep praying in tongues not for the sake of praying in tongues but because by this form of prayer you know the love of the father more accurately because the spirit is praying through you and revealing all things to you god bless you Holy Spirit Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints God and gender Christian eschatology Roman Catholic Church God Eucharist Trinity Ten Commandments Eastern Orthodox Church Sola fide Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Charismatic Religious Society of Friends Salvation Sabbath Second Vatican Council Glossolalia Priesthood (Mormonism) Abrahamic religion Church of Christ, Scientist Mass (liturgy) Baptism A Course In Miracles Community of Christ Binitarianism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Christianity Book of Isaiah Theology Prayer Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite) Protestantism Book of Mormon Bhajan Mortification of the flesh Mary, the mother of Jesus Saint Amidah Idolatry in Christianity Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Angel Prayer in Christianity Articles of Religion (Methodist) Didache Soul Godhead (Mormonism) Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Justification (theology) Rule of St Benedict Catholicism Mormonism and Judaism Christian views of Jesus William M.
