how can one say the bible is fact since there are so many copies around i recently translated some french poetry to english and noticed that much was lost in the translation you loose meanings and intent at last someone after my own heart i've said this about the bible for years what translation are you reading years ago i was in a bible study group and had bought an interllinear bible that's where the english is printed right above the original language and translated word for word granted it 's not the 'prettiest' way to read the bible but as close as we're ever gonna get others in the group teased me about having 'my version' of the bible as they were in love with the king james i told them there are no 'thee' and 'thou' in the original languages and if you were really believing that it was god's word then why not try to at least familiarize yourself with the original although choppy wording best example the term ' young girl' and 'virgin' are virtually the same enough said by the way i quit that group after about a year and consider myself spiritual but not religious i feel that organized religion is not a good thing and that all churches etc should have to pay taxes Bible History of the English Bible Thou Vulgate Religious Society of Friends Douai Bible Linguistics and the Book of Mormon Love God and gender Creationism Early Modern English Book of Mormon Puritan Church of Christ, Scientist Alan Campbell (pastor) Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Mary, the mother of Jesus Rastafari movement Holy Spirit Names of God in Judaism Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Prayer Fundamentalism Idolatry A Course In Miracles Trinity God Aramaic of Jesus Jehovah's Witnesses Tetragrammaton Matthew 5 New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures Metrical psalter Immanuel Church of Christ Sabbath Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Witchcraft Qur'an Bible translations Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity King-James-Only Movement Apocrypha Revised Standard Version Translation Psalms Biblical canon Creation according to Genesis Local churches Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Minister of religion Sin Evangelicalism Christian anarchism English Standard Version Theology Sant Mat Arab New King James Version Dispensationalism Biblical inerrancy Evil Hell O Canada Salvation Nazarene Joseph Smith, Jr. Paganism Golden Legend Yehuda Halevi Gospel of Thomas William Tyndale Revised Version Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible Christian-Jewish reconciliation Virgin Mary in Islam New Testament Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Status of religious freedom in France Philo Literature Christian views on witchcraft New Revised Standard Version Biblical studies Separation of church and state in the United States Book of Isaiah Tithe Christianity Great Bible Supernatural Charismatic Moses Geneva Bible
