do you believe in miracles read this and tell me about yours the old church in the weeds a wonderful story just two little boys walking down a dusty lane they came upon this old white house with broken window panes the paint was faded the shine was gone the grass had grown so high still they made their little feet go see what was inside they opened up the squeaky door and then it came to light this must have been an old church house once upon a time dirty dusty wooden pews a pulpit that still stood a bible lay upon it though the pages weren't too good an offering plate and song books too were lying on the floor they must have left this old church fast the day they closed these doors and over in the corner a piano was still there it must have played a pretty tune but i guess nobody cared so little bill looked up at tommy and tommy looked at bill why don't we clean this old church up and get these old pews filled they took a rag and wiped the dust to try to make things shine and then they took the offering plate and put in it their last dime they took a broom and swept the floor and picked up broken glass they got it all so nice and neat and then they mowed the grass they lifted the old church sign and stood it by a tree right down by that old dirt road where everyone could see they ran back home to find daddy gone but their momma was inside just to find her hurt again where daddy had made her cry don't cry momma wipe those tears little bill and tommy smiled cause we have a big surprise for you just down the road a mile hand in hand they tugged at her until they made her run what is it bill oh tommy just what have you two kids done and then they came upon the house once hidden by the weeds and there it stood a country church just like it used to be but what is it mother what's with your tears we thought this would bring you joy yes but hush kids now and listen close my two sweet precious boys they both got quiet and stood real still for the words they heard so true was daddy praying in the church with his head bowed on the pew forgive me lord forgive me lord though i'm not worthy of your love shine down on this sinner man sweet salvation from above for i've been out in the world you know living my life all wrong until i came upon this church the place where i belong i never noticed it before all those times i passed it up i guess i wasn't looking lord or maybe i was drunk bless oh lord yes bless oh lord the one who made me see this little church that used to hide behind all those tall weeds and then he raised his head and stood with his hands high in the air to find two dirty tear faced boys with momma standing there they ran up to him hugged him tight as their tears fell on the floor don't worry kids i'm not the dad the one you've known before things are different for us now so keep on those pretty smiles and let's go gather people in to walk down these church aisles then bill looked up at tommy and tommy looked at bill come on brother let's get to work to get these old pews filled for we need no special blessing for cleaning up this church cause god gave us back our daddy and that's more than gold is worth sunday morning pews all filled and smiles on every face especially two little country boys the ones who found this place though it was hid back in the weeds and so far out of sight nothing's ever hard to find if you're walking toward god's light john we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship with one another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanses us from all sin won't you please share this with people you want to be blessed have a happy day very cute yes i believe in miracles and i have several i could name the most important one is when god's light filled my am bedroom when i was first called into the service of the lord after a horrifying dream that showed me exactly where i was headed without him i'm a stubborn soul and this was probably the only way to get me to god each of my children are miracles and the love i feel for my husband of one year is also a miracle never thought i could love anyone and for a long time i didn't god performs miracles every day whether we're watching or not and especially when people ask him for one Sin City Cliff Richard Humphrey Bogart EastEnders Paul Is Dead Muslim ibn Aqeel Sola fide Episodes of Lost (Season 1)
