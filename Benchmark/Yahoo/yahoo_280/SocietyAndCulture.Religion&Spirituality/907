atheists question on taking oath this is not supposed to be an offensive question or anything i am merely curious so in the us there is a separation of church and state in court or even in politics taking oath into office one must vow swear upon the bible if christian if muslim though there are controversies one is of course allowed to vow upon the holy al qur'an so with that said and if the same applies to everyone do atheists also have that right as they should if you're an atheist could you please tell me if anything like that has ever happened personally to you or anyone you know and if there were any controversies regarding it theists can answer too if you have any personal opinion have you ever been in court or if you're involved with goverment political issues and you're an atheist were you given the right to not vow upon anything i didn't actually have to put my hand on a bible there was no bible at all i just had to raise my hand and say the crap they make you repeat but it was in family court so i don't know if that makes a difference in the end it doesn't matter if there is a bible or if you believe in it all that matters is you are making an oath to tell the truth if you go back on that then you will have to pay the consequences good question Atheism God Freemasonry Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Supernatural Christianity Oath Theodicy Eastern Orthodox Church Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Religion Plame affair Sin Intelligent design Religious conversion Fundamentalism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Notary public Agnosticism Slander and libel The nature of God in Western theology Predestination Creationism Creation-evolution controversy Soul Merit Existence of God Teach the Controversy Infant baptism Strong atheism Apostasy Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 7 Origin belief Abington School District v.
