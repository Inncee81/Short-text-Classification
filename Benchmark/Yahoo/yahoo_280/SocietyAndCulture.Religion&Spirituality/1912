what should gods place in society be personally i think any religion that teaches it is or has a special relationship to god based on race or nationality implies the inferiority of other person s races and religions as such i think it should be investigated as a possible hate crime when a religion or a religious leader claims to be the sole spokesman of god or the only way to salvation i believe this too is a coded form of ear mongering and should be looked at as a possible hate crime by suggesting that they have the only path they imply others are inferior bad or have invalid beliefs aka supremacist any book or group or religion that in any fashion advocates the killing or harming persons based on sexual orientation worship of other gods belief in witchcraft use or the practice of divination should be banned as inciting hate and advocating and or condoning persons to commit a crime any and all gods can have a place in society but it is time for society to put god in his place on issues of crime and not allow any book and or group to teach that they are better than or soley representitive of a god at no time can we allow books that advocates for or allows or condones the murder and harm to persons based on hate i agree god should be relegated to history books that explain how humans used to kill one another disagreeing about the will of a mythical being eventually that will happen if the religious don't succeed in getting their hands on nuclear weapons first Religion Hate group Trinity Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Homophobia Ten Commandments Religious pluralism Evil Religion and sexual orientation Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Taoism Christianity Separation of church and state Roman Catholic Church Church of Christ Religious conversion Hate speech Freedom of speech Racism Theology Cult Divine grace Homosexuality and Christianity Infant baptism Witchcraft Catholicism Sin Human Fundamentalism Predestination Urantia Nation of Islam Religion and sexuality Sharia Salvation Capital punishment Sexual orientation Christian anarchism Hate crime Chosen people Historical persecution by Muslims Jehovah's Witnesses Scientology beliefs and practices Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Satanism Creation science Mythology Noahide Laws Meaning of life Baptist Baptism Evangelicalism Creationism Guru Cultural and historical background of Jesus Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses God Opposition to cults and new religious movements Abortion debate Neopaganism Wicca Jewish principles of faith Religious Society of Friends Plame affair Zoophilia Morality Children of God Sacrifice Black supremacy Resurrection of Jesus Christianity and anti-Semitism Consensual crime Homosexuality Shinto Historical persecution by Christians Human sexual behavior Confucius Creation-evolution controversy Islam Existence of God Abrahamic religion Spiritism Heresy Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Judaism Alcoholics Anonymous Protestantism Theory of conduct Witch trial Criticism of Islam Christian-Jewish reconciliation Christian Identity History of the British constitution
