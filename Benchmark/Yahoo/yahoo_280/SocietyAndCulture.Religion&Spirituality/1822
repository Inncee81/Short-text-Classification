pagan wiccans if there was no pagan wiccans if there was no after life would you still believe in your faith as an athirst i haven't recalled an after life which has been described to me by a wiccan as a place to reflect on your previous life so is this just a fairy tale or is it just i am not receptive of this notion so i am somehow blocking any possibility of my previous encounters hi doug you might like to read a book called 'journey of souls' or 'the soul' can't remember it has nothing to do with religion pagan but it was written by a hypnotherapist who had hundreds of clients who under hypnosis reported the same thing happening to them when they died in previous lives very interesting the more you investigate this subject the more open to it you'll become and in answer to your first question after life has nothing to do with what i know about in my pagan ways in which i live whether i turn to dust go to heaven hell busch gardens or summerland is of absolutely no consequence we do not live this life in 'hopes of' nor 'fear of' we live it in each and every precious magical moment of life itself and in respect of all that sustains touches and moves us in life we chose not to waste this gift of life by living in the past guilt nor fearing the future life only exist in the now lovely question thank you blessed be Wicca Afterlife Magic (paranormal) Hypnosis Simone Weil A Course In Miracles Milton H.
