either you have free will or god knows all things they both cannot be if god knows all then he knew when making you that you would chose to eat a chocolate cupcake on your th birthday in a sense he created you to do that this being said if god knows everything about every decision you will make then free will is an illusion you are just carrying out your destiny rather than actually making choices that you choose on the flip side if free will is real then god does not know the future he does not know which cupcake you will pick only you do if this is true then all of the supposed biblical predictions are false how can god predict things if he doesn't know what will happen take your pick either your bible is false or you are a puppet with no free will this logic might confuse you but when in doubt you can always use the well god has a pretty good idea of what you will do cop out fireball i don't expect you to understand what i am talking about please go back to eating crayons and glue sticks or whatever you do some of your points would be good other than the fact that i didn't create my own dog or myself nor do i pretend to know for a fact when things will occur ok pastorart if you have a degree in logic please diagram my steps of logic and tell me where i am being illogical please if you are unwilling to do so then perhaps your argument is merely ad hominom that's right but i've tried to convince them of this dozens of times and they don't get it if god knows you will eat pizza tonight can you choose to eat steak no you can't if you can then god is not omniscient if you say that god knows what you will freely choose that does not consider the fact that god supposedly knew you would eat pizza even before creating you if he creates a being which will eat pizza tonight then you have no choice but to do so Theodicy Free will Predestination God Ontological argument Biblical inerrancy David Hume The nature of God in Western theology Paradox Determinism Christian eschatology Miracle Causality Humphrey Bogart Existence of God Theory of conduct Logic Epistemology Problem of evil Philosophical skepticism Intelligent design Scientific method Goodness and value theory Creationism Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Resurrection of Jesus A Course In Miracles Religion Summa Theologiae Microeconomics Trinity Bayesian inference God Emperor of Dune Modal logic Cosmological argument Vacuous truth Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Open Theism G__del's incompleteness theorem Noam Chomsky Economics Dispensationalism Presuppositional apologetics Coercion Alcoholics Anonymous Omniscience Omnipotence Propaganda Cyberspace Probability Truth Paul Is Dead Debugging Creation-evolution controversy Human nature Buddhism Kuzari Meaning of life Supernatural Fallacy English grammar Religious pluralism Immanuel Kant Theory Original sin S__ren Kierkegaard Gambler's fallacy Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Book of Revelation Karma Church of Christ, Scientist Discordianism Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Metaphysics Mythology Problem of Hell History of philosophy Alan Campbell (pastor) John Titor Strong atheism Teleological argument Bertrand Russell Divine grace Simone Weil Axiom of choice Deconstruction Monty Hall problem Dualism (philosophy of mind) Sheaf (mathematics) Entropy Fundamentalism Calvin and Hobbes Pascal's Wager
