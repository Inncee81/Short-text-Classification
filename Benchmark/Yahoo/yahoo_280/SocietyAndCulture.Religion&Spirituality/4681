exposing the myth that christianity is not an aggressive religion let's suppose i call myself christian warrior a warrior is a person habitually engaged in warfare now let's also suppose that i freely admit that i am at war we'll ignore the fact that i'm at war with an imaginary being called satan since we don't want to attract the attention of mental health services so what do we have someone called christian warrior a self proclaimed christian habitually engaged in war type 'christian warrior' in the ya search field if you don't believe me you couldn't make this stuff up unless you were writing the bible if this type of thinking was not so sad it would be laughable people can write what ever definition of a word seems to fit their way of thinking or understanding people who are not of the faith just do not get it and maybe they never will there are as many ways to be a warrior in christ as there are christians i am a christian warrior i have never fired a gun hit a person or done a violent act in my life i use prayer as my sword just as the bible directs me to do so again i say what ever helps you sleep at night and works to make your life ok then so be it god bless Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Opus Dei God Angel Theology Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Predestination Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Christianity Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Evil Sin Evangelicalism Eastern Orthodox Church Divine grace Zoroastrianism Baptism Satanism Abraham Christian eschatology Sexual orientation Religion A Course In Miracles Church of Christ, Scientist Jesus Mythology Miracle Exorcism Hell Urantia Summa Theologiae Religious Society of Friends Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Holy Spirit Jehovah's Witnesses Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Biblical inerrancy The nature of God in Western theology Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Catechism Prophet Roman Catholic Church Religious conversion Fasting Pacifism Sola fide Antichrist Prayer Devil Intelligent design Soul Jews as a chosen people Abrahamic religion Salvation Free will John the Baptist Trinity Prayer in Christianity Saint Dispensationalism Reinhold Niebuhr Satan Protestantism Martin Luther Justification (theology) Mormonism and Christianity Mass (liturgy) Eucharist Indulgence Church of Christ Liberal Christianity Infant baptism Homosexuality and Christianity Altruism Ten Commandments Charles Darwin's views on religion Saint Peter Miyamoto Musashi Militant Christianity and anti-Semitism Charles Grandison Finney Christian apologetics Supernatural Great Apostasy George Fox Original sin Theodicy Anti-Mormonism Religious pluralism Community of Christ
