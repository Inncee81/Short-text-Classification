have you ever read through the entire bible what did you gain from the experience i have read the entire bible twice in my life the scope of the readings helped me to see the diversity as well as the cultural context of the various biblical writers as they confronted religious issues during their era the readings in the new testament gave me a deeper appreciation of the life and teachings of jesus the temptations of christ his miracles on behalf of others parables and the last scenes of his life are particularly inspiring i have a deep appreciation for the life of christ indeed he is our savior he is our hope he is the desire of ages john praise the lord i am so encouraged by just reading that you've laboured and took the time to read the whole bible twice i have read through the new testament and have completed genesis song of songs proverbs esther exodos and a few others in the past i have studied individual book as such read through them from the old and new testament but i have felt a strong need to read the word with unveiled eyes and started again reading chapters of the old each night before i sleep and one from the new i pray that more of our brothers and sisters would fight for this that we will not be defrauded by satan in any way to stay away from knowing and reading the word the truth sets us free it sanctifies and sets us apart for the lord the truth inoculates us from all the lies hallelujah ty for your words of encouragement already today i echo your words brother christ is our savior our hope and hallelujah the desire of ages and all the nations Bible New Testament A Course In Miracles God Christian eschatology Jesus Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Church of Christ Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Resurrection of Jesus Biblical canon Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Abrahamic religion John Howard Yoder Book of Isaiah Mary, the mother of Jesus Opus Dei Dispensationalism Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Salvation Gospel of Thomas Holy Spirit Sola fide Apocrypha Apocalyptic literature Old Testament Divine grace Michael Card Roman Catholic Church King James Version of the Bible Mormonism and Christianity Cultural and historical background of Jesus Prophet Mary Magdalene Gospel of John Merit Genesis Biblical inerrancy Ten Commandments Mormonism Liberal Christianity Christian views of Jesus Judas Iscariot Soul Tithe Theology Baptist Joseph of Arimathea Religion Satan Sin Alan Campbell (pastor) John the Baptist Pharisees Canonical hours God and gender Urantia Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology John Wesley Baptism The Pilgrim's Progress Christianity Apologetics Rastafari movement Charles Taze Russell Angel Historicity of Jesus Religious perspectives on Jesus Bible prophecy The Last Temptation of Christ Repentance Rule of St Benedict Protestantism Matthew 4 Fundamentalism Rapture Idolatry in Christianity Icon The Bible and history Gospel Christian-Jewish reconciliation Tetragrammaton Psalms Philo Gospel of Mark Creation according to Genesis Homosexuality and Christianity Apostle
