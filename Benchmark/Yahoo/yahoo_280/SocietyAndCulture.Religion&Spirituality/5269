emmaus road what is your view of the bible story concerning the emmaus road this is for me one of the stories that is so uplifting jesus comes to these two men because he understands their grief and pain over his death so he explains to them that it was not in vain and that everything that happened was what was supposed to happen jesus gave them the chance to vent and to let out all their sadness jesus then reveals himself to give them greater joy that he is risen and alive it seems that jesus will walk with us when we are sad and distraught will listen to all our details even though he already knows and will reveal himself to give us joy and comfort Resurrection of Jesus Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an New Testament view on Jesus' life Happiness Christian views of Jesus Moses Mortification of the flesh Jewish Messiah C.
