anyone up for a challenge what's the longest this section can go without a heated debate debates are fine but no heated debates i agree with you that debates are fine only on ocassion though sometimes if the debates get heated there seems to be more response to the debate some of the things said in heated debates sometimes give one an eye opener to an answer that make sense its when it gets out of hand that causes me not to want to follow the conversations nor want to respond i guess one who is heated up in the debate wants to prove a point that they are right and everyone else wrong but it sure would be a challenge to to see how long this section can go without a debate you're on but how will one keep track if a person is following through on this contest you suggest Abortion debate Family Feud Theory of conduct Philosophy of language The Apprentice 2 Transcendental argument for the existence of God Socrates Fox hunting Presuppositional apologetics Internet troll Scrabble (game show) Same-sex marriage in Canada Reach for the Top Epistemology Chain Reaction (game show) Kasparov versus The World Debate Social rule Utilitarianism Creation-evolution controversy Royal Assent U.S. presidential election, 2004 Creationism Plame affair Canadian Senate Speaker of the British House of Commons U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Autism Democracy Objectivist philosophy Problem of universals Teach the Controversy Pyramid (game show) Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change God Emperor of Dune Meaning of life Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Prayer Lincoln-Douglas Debate Athletics at the 1896 Summer Olympics Whose Line Is It Anyway?
