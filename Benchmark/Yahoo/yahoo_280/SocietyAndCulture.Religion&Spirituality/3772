why dose god give us the holy spirit ephesianes the holy spirit is a promise the holy spirit is a seal the holy spirit is a guarantee answer after the gift of salvation through jesus christ of all the other gifts given to mankind by god there is none greater than the presence of the holy spirit the spirit has many functions roles and activities first he does a work in the hearts of all people everywhere jesus told the disciples that he would send the spirit into the world to convict the world concerning sin and concerning righteousness and concerning judgment john everyone has a god consciousness whether they admit it or not because the spirit applies the truths of god to men s own minds as to convince them by fair and sufficient arguments that they are sinners responding to that conviction brings men to salvation once we are saved and belong to god the spirit takes up residence in our hearts forever sealing us with the confirming certifying and assuring pledge of our eternal state as his children jesus said he would send the spirit to us to be our helper comforter and guide and i will pray the father and he will give you another helper that he may abide with you forever john the greek word translated here helper means one who is called alongside and has the idea of someone who encourages and exhorts abiding has to do with his permanent residence in the hearts of believers romans corinthians jesus gave the spirit as a compensation for his absence to perform the functions toward us which he would have done if he had remained personally with us among those functions is that of revealer of truth the spirit s presence within us enables us to understand and interpret the word jesus told his disciples when he the spirit of truth has come he will guide you into all truth john he reveals to our minds the whole counsel of god as it relates to worship doctrine and christian living he is the ultimate guide going before leading the way removing obstructions opening the understanding and making all things plain and clear he leads in the way we should go in all spiritual things without such a guide we would be apt to fall into error a crucial part of the truth he reveals is that jesus is who he said he is john corinthians the spirit convinces us of christ s deity and sonship his incarnation his being the messiah his sufferings and death his resurrection and ascension his exaltation at the right hand of god and his role as the judge of all he gives glory to christ in all things john another of his roles is that of gift giver first corinthians describes the spiritual gifts given to believers in order that we may function as the body of christ on earth all these gifts both great and small are given by the spirit so that we may be his ambassadors to the world showing forth his grace and glorifying him the spirit also functions as fruit producer in our lives when he indwells us he begins the work of harvesting his fruit in our lives love joy peace long suffering kindness goodness faith meekness and self control galatians these are not works of our flesh which is incapable of producing such fruit but they are products of the spirit s presence in our lives the knowledge that the holy spirit of god has taken up residence in our lives that he performs all these miraculous functions that he dwells with us forever and will never leave or forsake us is cause for great joy and comfort thank god for this precious gift the holy spirit and his work in our lives recommended resource the holy spirit by charles ryrie Israel ben Eliezer Messiah Christian and Missionary Alliance Church of Christ, Scientist Salvation Army Athanasian Creed God and gender History of Christianity George Fox Christian apologetics Papal Infallibility End times Biblical inerrancy Purgatory Saint Epistle to the Romans Jewish eschatology Protestantism Prevenient grace Simone Weil Christian
