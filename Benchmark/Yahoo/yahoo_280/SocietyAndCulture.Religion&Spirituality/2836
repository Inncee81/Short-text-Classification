thank you for showing me the light i will only be supplicant to your christian god from now on show me how to find jesus so that i can avoid having my account suspended how do i go about doing this done georgia peach i think methinks sarcasm does not come across the internet very well man is a sinner isaiah all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one to his own way and the lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all john jesus answered and said unto him verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god romans as it is written there is none righteous no not one romans for all have sinned and come short of the glory of god there is a price on our sin eternal death in hell romans for the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ our lord romans wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin and so death passed upon all men for that all have sinned nd thessalonians in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not god and that obey not the gospel of our lord jesus christ revelation and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire revelation but the fearful and unbelieving and the abominable and murderers and whoremongers and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death jesus paid that price by dying on the cross and shedding his blood romans but god commendeth his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners christ died for us john for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life st timothy this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation that christ jesus came into the world to save sinners of whom i am chief st peter forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers but with the precious blood of christ by faith in jesus christ alone we can be saved salvation is not found in a religion or good works but in a person the lord jesus christ john jesus said unto her i am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live john jesus saith unto him i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me john and this is the will of him that sent me that every one which seeth the son and believeth on him may have everlasting life and i will raise him up at the last day acts to open their eyes and to turn them from darkness to light and from the power of satan unto god that they may receive forgiveness of sins and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me romans for whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved st corinthians for other foundation can no man lay than that is laid which is jesus christ galatians for ye are all the children of god by faith in christ jesus here is how you call upon the lord do you admit that you are a sinner under the condemnation of god do you admit that you deserve to burn in hell do you believe jesus is the son of god god in the flesh who died upon the cross and shed his precious blood to pay for your sins if you are willing to admit your sinfulness and would like for god to save your soul just ask him dear jesus i admit that i am a sinner deserving of hell please forgive me of my sins and take me to heaven when i die i now believe upon you alone apart from all works and religion as my personal savior thank you amen just as you were born physically to your parents you were born spiritually into the family of god when you believed on jesus john please understand that we are not saved because we pray a prayer but because we believe upon the lord jesus christ it is certainly appropriate to ask the lord in prayer to forgive and save us but it is our faith which prompted us to pray the prayer you could just as easily believe in your heart upon the lord to be saved and not pray at all salvation is of the heart as we read in romans for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness you do not have to be baptized or doing anything to go to heaven other than trust upon the lord as your savior romans but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness what a wonderful savior
