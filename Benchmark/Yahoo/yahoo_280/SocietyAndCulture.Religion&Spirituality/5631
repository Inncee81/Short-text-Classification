creationists does archaeology prove creationism according to biblical scholars there were no rainbows before the flood also the famous scholars ima lyre and m adjineri have written a paper proving that leprechauns live at the end of rainbows with their pots of gold there is no archaeological evidence that leprechauns existed before the flood there's also no evidence the leprechauns existed after the flood but i'm ignoring this because it hurts my argument before the flood leprechauns would not have had anywhere to hide their pots of gold if leprechauns had existed before the flood they would have been robbed constantly god knew this and that's why he waited until after the flood to create both leprechauns and rainbows simultaneously he knew they would have a symbiotic relationship and in his infinite wisdom created both at the same time doesn't the fact that there is no archaeological evidence of leprechauns existing before the flood prove creationism if you knew that you would most likely be robbed wouldn't you try to hide or disguise yourself also do you think it was that easy for a leprechaun to just walk into a coin dealer with a pot full of krugerrands and not have to pay all kinds of taxes have you checked the records for the number of bankruptcies filed at that time by tiny people with big ears use your noodle i'm sure that you know about what great swimmers these guys were and of course they could dog paddle for a lousy year waiting for the waters to subside so of coarse they survived and stashed all that gold in california just before the rush Deluge (mythology) Theodicy Poker jargon Biblical inerrancy God Flood geology Intelligent design Noah's Ark Creationism The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Young Earth creationism Presuppositional apologetics Rainbow Origin belief Kent Hovind Charles Darwin's views on religion Bible Draw poker Creation according to Genesis Fishing History of creationism Creation science Money Betting (poker) Leprechaun Creation-evolution controversy Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Documentary hypothesis Biblical canon Religion Miracle Creation biology Aztec Book of Mormon G__del's incompleteness theorem Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Library of Alexandria Kabbalah Cosmological argument Time travel Socrates Inflation Maya civilization Created kind Aegean civilization Before the Flood Carnivorous plant Japanese tea ceremony Doomsday argument Billboard Hot 100 Kuzari Lucky Charms Buddhism Blood (computer game) Indus Valley Civilization Complexity classes P and NP Genesis Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Cardinal number Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Dating Creation Gold standard Manetho Historicity of Jesus Resurrection of Jesus Trinity David Hume Invader Zim Biblical cosmology Intelligent design movement Blacks and Mormonism Genealogies of Genesis Treehouse of Horror XII Philosophical skepticism Christian apologetics Rainbow Islands Futurama (TV series - season 5) Michael Savage (commentator) The Bible and history Supernatural Archaeology History of ancient Egypt Archaeology and the Book of Mormon Zohar Eastern Orthodox Church Apple Computer Dead Sea scrolls Humphrey Bogart Atheism Nation of Islam William A.
