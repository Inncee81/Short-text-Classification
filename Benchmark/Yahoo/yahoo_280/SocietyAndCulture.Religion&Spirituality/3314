i believe in god and jesus but i'm not a christian then what am i atheist i do believe in god and that jesus died on the cross for all of man's sins but i don't care i'm not a satanist by any means but i'm not ready to forgive wretched people in this world there is so much suffering i know it sounds wrong but people just don't seem to care about other's suffering that's why i'm so negative and not ready to accept any more religion in my life i devote my world to bring misery to those that cause it and hopefully nobody innocent gets caught in the cross fire it just seems to me that not one person on this earth is worthy of living even christians i don't really see most christians or atheists working to make this place a better world most christians and atheists i know just live in their comfortable house and never go out of their way to help the sick in the hospitals or the indigent on the street that's why i'm not a christian even though i believe such things exists i would rather nuke the entire world and make all of mankind pay for all of their wrongdoings upon each other it seems as though the only way suffering and injustice would end would be by trying to kill every last person on the planet and bringing them all of the pain misery and suffering i could afford to them what's your thoughts and opinions let me go out on a limb and say you are gothic am i right anyways i get poed like that some times too but instead of trying to nuke the world if i did that i'd be no better than the ultimate war pig george w i just come on ya and post some random stuff to vent my frustration a little what's the worst that can happen suspension lord knows i've been through that one already and came out feeling like a king anyways i'm not religious either and this isn't meant to be a lecture i enjoyed reading your rant but please refrain from getting too caught up in this revenge game i know from personal experience it can be a real bad situation check out my vent from last night when i was feeling like s t http ca answers yahoo com question index ylt ajqxm wewinwiztaveoqbhjafqx qid aaftazk Theodicy God Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Religion Atheism Sin A Course In Miracles Supernatural Evil Christian eschatology Baptism Religious views of suicide Satan John Howard Yoder Ten Commandments Church of Christ, Scientist Sola fide Scientology beliefs and practices Resurrection of Jesus Theory of conduct Urantia Immortality Original sin Slow Train Coming Salvation Roman Catholic Church Catechism Capital punishment Charles Darwin's views on religion Jehovah's Witnesses Agnosticism Merit Rich Mullins Existence of God Sant Thakar Singh Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Meaning of life Prayer Prophet Jesus Heaven Charles Grandison Finney Friedrich Schleiermacher Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Christian anarchism Sacrifice Justification (theology) The Brothers Karamazov Predestination Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Peter Singer Devil Spiritism Jewish views of religious pluralism The nature of God in Western theology Sin City Mortification of the flesh Book of Isaiah John the Baptist The Pilgrim's Progress Summa Theologiae Qiyamah Christian views of Jesus End times The Amber Spyglass Satanism Socrates Karma Godspell Catholicism Mormonism LaVeyan Satanism Angel Mahatma Gandhi Religious perspectives on Jesus God and gender Religious pluralism Jewish Messiah Anselm of Canterbury George Fox Reinhold Niebuhr Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Bertrand Russell
