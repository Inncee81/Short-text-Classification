so what is existence anyway folks here do seem to love going on about stuff existing or not existing but objectively speaking just what the heck does that mean anyway i'm not looking for examples nor counter examples i'm looking for an objective definition of existence so popey we're regularly making use of a word we can't even define and that for all intents and purposes might as well be totally meaningless mr alpha omega down there lists apparently som attributes of existence and whether everyone agrees with those or not hasn't even come up yet but without actually defining it as such what the heck can you even mean when you claim god doesn't or for others does exist without a stable definition you might as well be talking a completely different language to the theists odds check out the dictionary definition for being and then explain to me how two words which are cyclically dependant on each other for definition can together hold any meaning at all popey again life interesting question i know the list of attributes used to determine whether something is alive or not but as for what life itself actually is the closest i could come to a definition is a state of self perpetuating autonomy dependant on sufficient environmental resources existence tastes like earthworms and smells of soil Atheism Causality G__del's incompleteness theorem Supernatural God Hell Theodicy Meaning of life Goodness and value theory Trademark Falsifiability Biodiversity Philosophy of language Economics Entropy Art Deconstruction Species Capitalism The nature of God in Western theology Intelligent design Theory of conduct Predestination Meaning Datatype Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Object-oriented programming Phaedo Philosophical Investigations Origin belief Philosophy of mathematics XML Artificial consciousness Strong atheism Scientology beliefs and practices Solar system Ontology (computer science) Mythology Postmodernism C plus plus Human Traumatic incident reduction Existentialism Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Class (computer science) Greek language Information warfare Jewish principles of faith Qualia Ethics Objectivist philosophy A Course In Miracles Microeconomics Morality Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Truth Hungarian language Franz Boas Python programming language Leadership Scientific method State Sexual orientation Creation-evolution controversy Bulgarian language Cosmological argument Agnosticism Pseudoscience Kitsch Guns, Germs, and Steel Animism Life Civil rights Tonality Dictionary Magic (paranormal) Mathematical logic Ignosticism Science Crossword Irony Nationalism Wealth Japanese grammar Problem of evil Presuppositional apologetics Public domain Nineteen Eighty-Four Real number Rudolf Hermann Lotze Nation-state Evil Extreme Programming Normal distribution Biology and sexual orientation Moral objectivism Trigonometric function
