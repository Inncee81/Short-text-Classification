are all events and informations way for our development it is sure that when we are healthy and when everthing goes smoothly we consider such state of ours as a normal state and that we develop in such way however my opinion is that we develop even when times are hard and when we are attacked from inside and outside my opinion is that we have good part and bad part inside us when things go smoothly we see just our good part but when things go hard it is because of our bad part inside of us when we experience problems and stressfull situations we are in fact geting rid of our bad part by accepting such hard destiny we expiate our sins and our good parts grows however if we are unhappy with our destiny and return hatred for hatred we become evil persons and in such way we destroy our good part for example if there are hard quarells and problems with our lover or family if we accept such events as our mistake and way for our development love will prevail but if we are full of hatred love will be gone do you agree love is not gone we just have turned our backs on it if i stand on the sidewalk face away from my house the house has not gone i just can't see it i have only to turn around we always are developing yes but we remain whole perfect and eternally as created on that we have turned our backs we develop ultimately into the realization that we need no development our basis is perfection A Course In Miracles Theodicy Simone Weil Evil Justification (theology) Sin Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Reinhold Niebuhr One Tree Hill (TV series) Christian eschatology Kira Yamato Reincarnation Mystique (comics) Incarnations of Immortality Satan Predestination Ranma __ characters Theory of conduct Eastern Orthodox Church Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sola fide Stoicism Phoebe Halliwell Vegeta Force (Star Wars) Piccolo Junior Saga Summa Theologiae Karma Church of Christ, Scientist Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Legacy of Kain Microeconomics Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Merit Appeasement Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Kain (Legacy of Kain) Doctor (Doctor Who) Characters in the Smurfs Goodness and value theory Human nature Epistemology Simon Commission Shen Gong Wu Socrates Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Trinity Nicomachean Ethics Slayers Procrastination Homophobia K' Utilitarianism Sin City 2000 Australian Grand Prix Creationism Equine conformation Religion Enneagram Urantia Homunculi of Fullmetal Alchemist Angel (vampire) Duties of the Heart Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Sant Thakar Singh Naraku Philo Objectivist philosophy Fight Club Nineteen Eighty-Four Maimonides Hearing impairment Blood on the Tracks Charmed The Amber Spyglass Karma in Hinduism Free will Immortality Current teachings of Prem Rawat Luck Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Yusuf al-Qaradawi Original sin Unconscious mind Chu-Han contention Chapterhouse Dune Problem of Hell Philipp Melanchthon Transactional analysis Palpatine The Death Gate Cycle Sheikh Abdullah Boston Public W.I.T.C.H.
