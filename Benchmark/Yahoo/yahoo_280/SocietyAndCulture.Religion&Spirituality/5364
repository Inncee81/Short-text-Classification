christians how do you account for the creation of matter the same way most scientists do time reversal of annihilation e g the conversion of two photons massless particles into an electron positron pair one or more massive particles oh you wanted me to say god created it well i know of the processes just like anyone interested in physics but i do believe that there is a driving force is this equal to another evolution debate where i can ride the fence between knowing the scientific theory and believing that there is a guiding hand Mass Neutrino Antiparticle Photon Quantum mechanics Particle physics Timeline of the Big Bang Antimatter Baryogenesis Elementary particle Black hole Gamma ray Particle accelerator Standard Model Vacuum Timeline of the Universe Annihilation W and Z bosons Quantum electrodynamics Creation-evolution controversy Faster-than-light Non-standard cosmology Cosmological argument Subatomic particle Young Earth creationism Electromagnetic radiation Origin belief Big Bang Speed of light Flood geology ATLAS experiment Dirac equation Physics Atomism Positron Supernova Fine-tuned universe Old Earth creationism Pair production Science Higgs mechanism The Origin of Species Cosmic Era technology Intelligent design Atom Quantum optics Supernatural Renormalization Evolutionary creationism Baryon History of creationism Dark matter Isaac Newton Gas in a box Quantum computer Light Supersymmetry Time travel EPR paradox Standard model (basic details) Nuclear fusion Determinism Universal Century Technology Exotic matter Dirac sea Double-slit experiment Virtual particle Copenhagen interpretation Creation science Path integral formulation Falsifiability Momentum Many-worlds interpretation Causality Temperature Feynman diagram Albert Einstein String theory Large Electron-Positron Collider Quantum chromodynamics Tauon Sun Ionizing radiation Gravity Proton decay Modern geocentrism Spin (physics) Gaia theory (science) Wave-particle duality Age of the Earth Quantum field theory Kaon Spiritual evolution Positron emission tomography God Heim theory Coherent state Normal distribution
