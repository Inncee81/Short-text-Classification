isn't mormonism really based on catholocism i realize mormonism is much different but the main ideas were pulled from christianity in general and catholocism was the first christian religion correct hell to the no mormonism was started by a man who wasnt educated past the third grade he was known for his tall tales and he magically found these golden tablets that only he could read inside a top hat the catholic church is based off of the church that jesus established whilst on earth mormonism is based off the book of mormon and the like no where near related except for when they confess that jesus christ is our lord and savior who died for our sins thats the only similarity um tur b it really isnt an ignorant question many religions are based upon or are believed to be based upon the roman catholic church mormonism is not one of them but they have extracted parts from the bible yet do not claim actual catholicism beliefs i mean mormons dont confess their sins they dont call their priest father and other things they seem to be alike but they arent and i just though that tur b needed to take heed and correction if you want an example of an ignorant question here it is why are catholics so bitter towards former catholics didnt they share the same beliefs at one time then why fight maybe it isnt the question that is ignorant maybe its just the person answering it care to take a stab at it Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Salvation Mormonism Baptism Catholicism Trinity Roman Catholic Church Book of Mormon Christianity Biblical canon Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Mormonism and Christianity Abrahamic religion Priesthood (Mormonism) Baptist Great Apostasy Jesus Christian eschatology Church of Christ Mormon Criticism of Mormonism Protestantism A Course In Miracles History of the Latter Day Saint movement Sabbath Sola fide Bible and reincarnation Religious perspectives on Jesus Eucharist God Heaven Sin Harrowing of Hell Nontrinitarianism Evangelicalism Justification (theology) Catechism Free will Judaism Ten Commandments Catholic Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Community of Christ Hell Paul of Tarsus Bishop Apostle Linguistics and the Book of Mormon Messianic Judaism Blacks and Mormonism Christian views of Jesus Religion Religious pluralism Theology Soul Mary, the mother of Jesus Eastern Orthodox Church Temple (Mormonism) Criticisms of Christianity Religious conversion Angel Infant baptism Dispensationalism New Testament Resurrection of Jesus Charles Grandison Finney Purgatory Perseverance of the saints Curse and mark of Cain Priest Discordianism Theosis Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief First Vision Binitarianism Apocrypha Antichrist Separation of church and state Indulgence Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Opus Dei Augustine of Hippo Mass (liturgy) John Wycliffe Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Excommunication Apostles' Creed Creed Godhead (Mormonism)
