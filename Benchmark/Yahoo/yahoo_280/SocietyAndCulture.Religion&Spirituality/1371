do you believe in this statement poverty is a blessing from god having nothing and being poor is not a curse having less and living with less is a blessing from god do you believe that i do why don't you believe this or do find truth in that statement and why i understand what you are saying and although it is a great burden to be poor if you believe in all the teachings of god then you know that there are many lessons to be taught from being poor that those who pursue materialistic things can never possibly come to know or experience it's like the saying in order to know great joy you must also know great sorrow i believe the poor come to know a whole lot more about compassion human suffering and thus come to understand and give a whole lot back to humanity being very selfless whereas the rich and gluttonous of the world only care about their own personal gains in that aspect it is a blessing because it's more important to have a soul that is healthy than a body which is but the soul remains tormented and lost you can see many examples of the rich who have no joy or peace in thier lives whatsoever the same may be said of the poor but god if you believe in him did say it was the meek and the poor who inherit the earth all said and done there are many lessons to be learned from adversity and even poverty to use another cliche adversity builds character something that is greatly lacking in a great deal of people these days remember not too long ago there were not too many people who were not poor if you care to look at it in another way most of us were equal poverty these days seems to imply everyone who is not a big shot millionaire and if that is the definition which i think is probably what you are really trying to say then yes i'd rather do with less than have my kids raised amongst greedy selfish snots been there done that and just on a personal note i've been rich had more money than i knew what to do with saved most bought my essentials home included but the rest i blew miserably on travel fun and entertainment but man the tables can turn on you in the blink of an eye and they often do and for many years i had to start over from scratch with nothing and work my way up to just getting by and you know what i would rather have this life over my old anyday because yes i have been given many many blessings in this life of poverty than i ever had in my life of riches no way would i turn back the hands of time to what i had then sure it's hard but i believe everything we go through is for a reason my kids still have everything they need and more and by more i mean they already know the lessons it took me a lifetime to achieve so i know they are destined for greater things than i Immortality Summa Theologiae Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Meaning of life Sant Thakar Singh Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an A Course In Miracles Simone Weil Current teachings of Prem Rawat Religion Soul Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Reincarnation Rich Mullins Opus Dei Hell Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Book of Mormon Eastern Orthodox Church Phaedo Predestination Sola fide Ten Commandments The Amber Spyglass Original sin Nicomachean Ethics Urantia Mortification of the flesh Tamriel John Howard Yoder John Wycliffe God Divine grace Trinity Happiness Heaven Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Poverty Al-Ghazali Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Friedrich Schleiermacher Dead Like Me Jon Secada Capitalism Religious pluralism Infantilism On the Nature of Things Paradox Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Scenes from a Memory Theory of conduct Altruism Duties of the Heart Economic inequality Christian eschatology Jewish principles of faith Supernatural Buddhism The Brothers Karamazov Jiddu Krishnamurti Jews as a chosen people The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Israel ben Eliezer John the Baptist Goodness and value theory Meme Arjuna Leviathan (book) Sant Mat Causality Alan Campbell (pastor) John Wesley Justification (theology) The nature of God in Western theology Amidah Numerology Incarnations of Immortality Genesis Bhagavad Gita Free will Saint Jewish Messiah Philo Godspell Alcoholics Anonymous Socrates Bah__'__ Faith and Science Muslim ibn Aqeel Humphrey Bogart Storytelling Scientology beliefs and practices Atheism Alaga__sia
