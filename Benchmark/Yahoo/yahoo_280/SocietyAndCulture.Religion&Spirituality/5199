evolutionists can you explain this according to the theory of evolutionism when you breed two different animals you get a hybrid common examples of this are a liger lion and tiger and a wholfin whale and dolphin but there are some animals you can breed and not get a hybrid for example according to evolutionist logic if i breed a horse and a donkey i should either get a honkey or a dorse but that's not what i get i either get a mule or a hinny this proves that evolution is false mules and hinnies are obviously god's creations mules are made to bear the burdens of mankind and hinnies are made so mules have someone to marry otherwise they'd have to marry other mules which would be an abomination of god how do you evolutionastics explain this this is so incredibly wrong i don't know where to start first off a wholfin is not a cross between a whale and a dolphin the proper spelling is wolphin and they are a cross between a wolf and a dolphin duh many's a night i've spent lying beneath the stars of the vast pacific prairie listening to the wolphins squeak at the moon second mules don't come from mating donkeys and horses they are spontaneously generated by the prayers of the righteous and zealous order of magnificent mule monks of monte monserrat in monaco this alone is proof of the theory of alliterative abiogenesis and provides additional support to the official wildass speculative supposition of biomorphologometric triquetal evolutionasticism through the applied use of underarm deodorant as declared by the righteous scientific pontiff of nooses and loops aka the pope on a rope brennan the xxiii and a half Hybrid Donkey Mule Horse Created kind Dolphin Hinny Liger Gal__pagos Islands Intelligent design Abiogenesis Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Domestication Orca Evolutionism Religion God Whale Creationism Panthera hybrid Origin belief Non-human animal sexuality Taikyoku shogi Evolution Tai shogi Pope John XXIII Creation-evolution controversy Modern geocentrism The Origin of Species Human Lion Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Humpback Whale Argument from ignorance Working animal Victor Cousin History of creationism Biogenesis Origin of language Qiyamah Pope John Paul II Charles Darwin Evidence of evolution Whaling Marine biology Canonical hours Horus Maka dai dai shogi Deer The Two Babylons Meme Origin of life Inception of Darwin's theory Eastern Orthodox Church Livestock Biology Jewish principles of faith The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Atheism 613 mitzvot Darwin from Orchids to Variation Tigon Causality Japanese mythology Eugenics Answers in Genesis Biblical inerrancy Sociobiology Hecate Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Sociocultural evolution Cetacea Guns, Germs, and Steel Theodicy Pseudoscience Opus Dei Cetacean intelligence Right whale Genesis Falsifiability Specified complexity Irreducible complexity Soul Noah's Ark Zoids Trapping Teleological argument Endangered species F1 hybrid Sedevacantism Cosmological argument Sin City Teach the Controversy Pope John Paul I William A.
