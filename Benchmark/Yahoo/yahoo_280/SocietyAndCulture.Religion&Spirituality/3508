are you uncomfortable going to church alone if its a new church or you know noone there i recently went to my parents' church where i haven't been since i was or so that was far more uncomfortable than going to a new church for the first time people i remember being born now married with families some of their parents dead now everyone who remembered me wanting to talk with me about the last years i was not at all at peace there going alone when you don't know anyone is not so bad it's easy to fade into the crowd and get a more objective impression of the church if you feel comfortable with it you can start getting to know people and remember it's not about the building or the people or anything else like that it's if you personally feel that god is present while you're there Social rule Theory of conduct Dream Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Traumatic incident reduction Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Unification Church Hey Jude Friends Megan Griffin Justification (theology) Transsexuality John the Baptist Breastfeeding Empathy Eastern Orthodox Church Survivor (novel) Milton H.
