are non believers more intelligent in general because they don't necessarily believe in family life and having a family and taking care of them and therefore they spend more time in school and go on to get higher degrees i am a believer non christian in college with no children thank you this is more a question regarding some other stupid questions going around on here i'm stereotyping it's the atheists that come on here and say they are more intelligent and they say there are studies to back it up personally i don't think being a believer or non believer has anything to do with intelligence people of all walks of life seek higher education however from some of the questions and answers posted here by both sides but especially by atheists i would tend to think they are less intelligent i don't think they necessarily are less intelligent but they certainly don't offer much respect to their fellow man there are not nearly as many answers and questions by believers that are as ignorant and condescending as those posted by the athiests i know i'm gonna get thumbs down for this cuz most of the atheists here say that the believers are the ones who are intolerant but take a look at of the questions and answers and you literally will see what i mean not a judgement call a reality Agnosticism God Atheism Creation-evolution controversy Religion Teach the Controversy Creationism Anti-intellectualism Freemasonry William A.
