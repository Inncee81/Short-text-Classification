would you support a candidate whose ticket was 'vote for me or i'll torture you' even if you agreed with his policies wouldn't such an approach put you off would you be surprised if others who didn't agree with those policies were reluctant how is this different from the hobson's choice presented to abrahamic theists in which a supposedly omnibenevolent deity commands that unbelievers believe in and worship him on pain of eternal damnation the heavenly reward for righteous worshipful believers i can understand but why is it necessary to back up the carrot with such a gruesome stick regardless of their acts or degree of virtue are those who believe such a scenario is in place happy with it cd windom earle you'll notice i said 'support' rather than 'vote for' given that there's not going to be much choice about voting cd jeffd that's an interesting parallel but i think it fails for one reason obeying laws is not a choice whereas supporting a candidate ignoring how you actually vote is i believe cd you have just described how the majority of muslims appear to think every time someone asks something along the lines of how do we stop islamic terrorism there is at least one or two who show up and say convert to islam stupid then we'll stop killing innocent people no muslim ever calls them on this and denounces conversion by force their silence proves they have no problem with this mentality it also wasn't too long ago within living memory in the us that christians were pulling the exact same thing with their indian schools that were nothing more than reeducation camps i know my great grandmother was in one when she was a little girl as to the necessity of the stick when the carrot fails that's easy the abrahamic god isn't a god he's an idealized protojewish tribal chieftain their god is a barbarian charioteer who ruled his subjects through a combination of generosity to his favored subjects and dire threats backed up with violence to any he saw as a threat this is also why there are so many variations on i'm god i'm the only god you worship if i catch you worshipping some other god i'm going to do horrible things to you these other gods were competing chieftains often from within his own tribe he had to smack down any opposition because in those days you didn't just get voted off the island you lost your head along with your title no i wouldn't support such a candidate people like this are throwbacks that should be left in ancient history along with the ridiculous belief systems they espouse luckily this country also has a long standing tradition of armed rebellion when the government gets out of hand God Religion Theodicy Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Christianity Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Abrahamic religion Religious pluralism Christian eschatology Atheism Idolatry Existence of God Jewish principles of faith Abraham Jewish views of religious pluralism Soul Divine grace Fundamentalism Goodness and value theory Women in Islam Theory of conduct Prayer Ayyavazhi mythology Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Islam Dispensationalism Hell Paul of Tarsus Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Satanism Separation of church and state Religious conversion Original sin Judaism End times Ten Commandments Historical persecution by Christians Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Buddhism Supernatural The nature of God in Western theology Justification (theology) Origin belief Noahide Laws Pascal's Wager ROC presidential election, 2004 Devil Messiah Persecution of Christians Trinity God Emperor of Dune Christianity and anti-Semitism Salvation Reincarnation Survivor: Palau Anti-Mormonism Mormonism and Judaism Status of religious freedom in Sudan Discworld gods Problem of Hell Nation of Islam Domestic violence Chosen people Evolutionary creationism War on Terrorism Moral objectivism Aurangzeb Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam Angel Creationism Westboro Baptist Church (Topeka) Saint Arab Evil Coercion Scouting Cultural Revolution Apostasy in Islam Church of Christ Yusuf al-Qaradawi Gospel of Thomas Mahatma Gandhi God and gender Phaedo Problem of evil Republic Immortality Liberalism
