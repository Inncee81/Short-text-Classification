why do atheists bother answering questions and go out of their way to prove god gods aren't real i thought atheism had to do with simply not believing in anything then why do so many atheists go out of their way to state their denial of god gods or even try and convert some people and for all the atheists that answered sarcastically to my question questions dont' say why do you go out of your way to convert people don't say things if you don't know what you're talking about christians try to convert people because believing in what we do we're suppose to spread the word and help people see that god is real and loving ok thanks for hte opinions i was just wondering since so many atheists say that they want to be left alone and seperate of religon just as they do to religious people i guess in religon including atheists human nature can still be involved in response to zero cool thanks for your opinion i do believe in freedom of religon whenever i say religon i'll be including atheists too so yea i don't think christianity should control the politics by it's a christian's job to try and convert people i just meant to let them know about god and why we think he's real and loving i didn't mean to force it into politics and forcibly change everyone even if that did happen a huge portion of the world would be forced to believe which really isn't believing in response to liberty i didnt' know that but murder isn't really good i dont' get why the hijackers would say that and in response to marshmellow i only said in one question for atheists not to answer because sometimes atheists look in my profile and answer other questions not meant for them like the question i asked about christians believing because of fearing that's the only question that i said i don't want atheists answering mainly because atheists dont' believe at all thanks everyone for their opinions not trying to be stereotypical or anything but this is actually the first question i've asked anywhere online where i haven't recieved almost half or more sarcastic answers thanks for the opinions everyone and i guess i thought of atheists trying to help us in their views like how christians do atheists as well as people of faith like to share their ideas i believe that both groups try to spread enlightenment in their own way Atheism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Agnosticism Existence of God Theodicy Supernatural The nature of God in Western theology God Religion Afterlife Theory of conduct Christianity Meaning of life Jewish principles of faith Strong atheism Creation-evolution controversy Antony Flew Evil Sin Religious conversion Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity A Course In Miracles Predestination Trinity Soul Philosophy of religion Philosophical skepticism History of creationism Simone Weil Judaism Protestantism Richard Dawkins Teach the Controversy Charles Darwin's views on religion Free will Apologetics Criticism of Mormonism Problem of Hell Friedrich Schleiermacher God Emperor of Dune Freethought Justification (theology) David Hume Atomism Intelligent design movement The relationship between religion and science Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Pledge of Allegiance Deism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Singlish Satanism Freemasonry Evolutionary creationism Biblical inerrancy Thomas Jefferson Ontological argument Epistemology Cult I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Little Britain Philosophy Goodness and value theory Eastern Orthodox Church Presuppositional apologetics Ex-gay Origin belief Scientific skepticism History of Christianity Plame affair Nihilism Religion and mythology Persecution of Christians Intelligent design Christian apologetics Urantia Thomas Carlyle Merit Immortality Karl Marx John Howard Yoder Immanuel Kant Deconstruction Bertrand Russell Altruism Infant baptism Psychology of religion
