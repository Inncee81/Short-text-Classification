atheist trolls how would you like it if i called all of you murderers just becasue some atheists murderer than why do some of you trolls call christians evil just becasue i suspect some christian was mean to you how would you like it if people did that to you just because you shared a common lack of belief also i am not calling atheists evil i know many wonderful athist people i am trying to promote veiwing things from both sides and yelling at the trolls who spend all there time calling christians evil oh by the way i meant to say some atheists murder not some atheists murderer which is nonsense so i guess you understand that islam is a looked at in a very negative light shone by the bias media then i mean so many people think that terrorism is islamic just because i suspect some muslims did it but in fact terrorism is totally against islam the killing of any innocent is against islam and so is suicide for any reason these terrorists suicide bombers are killing two birds with one stone you see they are earning themselves one way tickets to hell i appreciate that you are trying to promote viewing things from both sides did you ever view islam from the other side the media only reports one side of the story and this blinds its audience the western masses the western media has been trying to make islam look like a violent bloody intolerant terroristic religion when in fact in reality this is the total opposite grossly exaggerated misleading false fabrications are made up about islam on the news and in the newspaper and the so called muslim extremists shouldn't even be called muslim because their actions are nothing but islamic you will see that islam is truly is a religion of peace of love if you decide to learn the real truth not what many seem to think is the truth so thank you i am sure you already know by now that islam is not as bad as the bias media makes it seem please don't judge all based on the actions of a few i see you are trying to promote that and i appreciate it good luck i am with you all the way on this i am sorry that some people stereotype and generalize others like that as i am a victim myself so once again good luck and take care Religion Evil Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Council on American-Islamic Relations Theodicy Media bias Theory of conduct God Yusuf al-Qaradawi Suicide bombing Islam as a political movement Christianity Fundamentalism Islamist terrorism 2003 Invasion of Iraq Anti-Semitism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Cult Supernatural Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Discrimination Religious pluralism Ten Commandments Existence of God New anti-Semitism Nation of Islam Cult suicide War on Terrorism Jihad Strong atheism Militant Islam Philosophy Nick Berg Hell The Power of Nightmares Ann Coulter Apostasy Dhimmi Religious conversion Nationalism 7 July 2005 London bombings Al-Aqsa Intifada Creationism Islam Gandhism Bill O'Reilly (commentator) Sin Scenes from a Memory Religious views of suicide Militant Video game controversy Internet troll British National Party Phillip E.
