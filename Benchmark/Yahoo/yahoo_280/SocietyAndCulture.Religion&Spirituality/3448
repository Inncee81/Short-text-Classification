why hasn't any pentecostal charismatic yet given me a biblical answer regarding drunk in the spirit i've asked a simple question a couple of times and no one can give me a decent answer so i'll ask again hoping that a different bunch of people might know the answer i've been to pentecostal churches where people have been drunk in the spirit people lose control of themselves rolling and staggering around the floor laughing crying and carrying on without any inhibition the bible says very clearly that drunkeness is a serious sin the bible says to be sober minded and alert my question is how can the holy spirit fill his people to be drunk the same word that god totally condemns and how can the holy spirit fill his people to stagger and roll around the floor as per drunkeness when the bible is completely clear about being sober and alert i have yet to hear a reasonable explanation and 'matthew' don't come around here and lie your ass off buddy it is definately called drunk in the spirit buddy i should know i was in this denomination for over a decade you can come here and lie to others but don't try that crap on me i know what i'm talking about i thought everyone who was doing this was crazy as well but once you have felt the presence of god you can better understand why they call it drunk in the spirit i was raised baptist but consider myself non denominational as long as i am going to a church that believes that jesus came to this earth and was crucified and rose again on the rd day that is what gives me inner peace mostly the older generation still call it drunk in the spirit i know i didn't explain this well b c i really don't know how but i do know that it exists from experience i don't care if people say its crazy or not i was once one of those people so i can understand why people don't believe or understand i did find this on the internet the experience called slain in the spirit usually occurs in churches when the minister or speaker has an altar call and puts his hand on the forehead of the person who has come forward for ministering who then falls over sometimes the minister does not even have to touch people but only gestures toward them and they fall down when they fall the people may be unconscious semi conscious or fully conscious occasionally even people in the pews or the audience fall over when the minister gestures or waves his arm at them i am sure you do know what you are talking about as i have said alot of the older generation still call it drunk in the spirit i and alot of other people call it slain in the spirit the bible talks about it on the day of pentecost in the book of acts why are you so testy Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Charismatic Trinity Eastern Orthodox Church Christianity Pentecostalism Protestantism Holy Spirit Ten Commandments Sola fide Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity A Course In Miracles Church of Christ Dispensationalism Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Christian views of Jesus Sabbath Baptist God Church of Christ, Scientist Alan Campbell (pastor) Resurrection of Jesus New Testament Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Priesthood (Mormonism) Acts of the Apostles Soul Evangelicalism Messianic Judaism Infant baptism Divine grace Book of Isaiah Supernatural God and gender Christian denomination Homosexuality and Christianity Expository preaching Urantia The nature of God in Western theology Fasting Religion Roman Catholic Church Saint Apostles' Creed Book of Mormon Oneness Pentecostal Nontrinitarianism Minister of religion Glossolalia Prayer in Christianity Catholicism Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Creationism Baptism of the Holy Spirit Biblical inerrancy Jesus Salvation Restorationism Theology Past teachings of Prem Rawat Jewish principles of faith Evolutionary creationism Original sin Religious conversion Biblical studies Meaning of life John Howard Yoder United Pentecostal Church Sin Religious Society of Friends Scientology beliefs and practices Liberal Christianity Mass (liturgy) Christian Origen John Wycliffe John the Baptist Slow Train Coming Justification (theology) Charles Grandison Finney Infantilism Christian anarchism The Catcher in the Rye Social rule History of Christianity Mormonism Rastafari movement Creation-evolution controversy Opus Dei Gospel of John History of the English Bible
