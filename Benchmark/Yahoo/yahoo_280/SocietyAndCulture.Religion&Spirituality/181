do you have a personal god meaning something other than you who thinks feels desires loves you that which we call god is outside of time and therefore does not engage in the temporal process of thought no thought no perception no perception no desire there is no personal god for those who are still with me god is one of the many names we give to the source of conscious thought and feeling and so this source does not think or feel it's the source of the illusion of time and space and therefore does not exist in time space rather consciousness thought feeling time space the entire physical illusion exists within this source much the way dreamscapes arise within your own mind and are never other than the functioning of our own minds this god fulfils many ego needs and is also a part of the believer's spiritual process but there is no god 'out there' there is only you dreaming a dream of otherness seeking to know yourself enjoy the dream and be kind to yourself dream world do you have a personal god i use the word 'divine inteligence' for god but its not a peron a person is a concept a mental image of a me and all the beliefs and definitions that go along with that but what i am is not an idea or a belief you are i am that pure awareness that knows the ideas the person or identity appears within the awareness awareness is the ever present background everything is only an appearance in this presence awareness consciousness life spirit emptiness being god oneness and so on belief in god is belief in ourselves and who you are i am all of the spiritual and religious teachings of the past serve the ego and its projections the ego is the belief that there is a separate entity standing apart from being awareness god and that you are that separate one where is the separate self there is not one the ego is a false belief it is not a reality Friedrich Schleiermacher God S__ren Kierkegaard Reincarnation Meaning of life Consciousness Trinity Human Philosophy of perception Scientology beliefs and practices Free will Objectivist philosophy Animism Simone Weil Religion Hinduism The nature of God in Western theology Psychology of religion Heaven Christian eschatology Carl Jung Hindu philosophy Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Mind Predestination Brahman Spirituality Sigmund Freud Supernatural Reality Max Stirner Magic (paranormal) Spiritual evolution Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Dream Gnosticism Jiddu Krishnamurti Immortality Philosophy of space and time Anthroposophy Immanuel Kant Artificial consciousness Hypnosis Out-of-body experience Sant Mat Psychoanalysis Fundamentalism Evil Theology Lucid dreaming John Wycliffe Religious Society of Friends Ten Commandments Meditation Christianity Origin belief Pantheism Bhagavad Gita Opus Dei Arthur Schopenhauer Satanism Jewish principles of faith Unconscious mind Theosophy Samadhi Rudolf Steiner Advaita Vedanta Rosicrucian Fellowship Neuro-linguistic programming Sexual orientation Human nature Mantra Church of Christ, Scientist Oneness (concept) Israel ben Eliezer Ramakrishna Adi Da Evolutionary creationism Bene Gesserit The Life Divine Gestalt therapy Ken Wilber Person Rastafari movement Mind control Buddhism Metaphysics Alcoholics Anonymous Idolatry
