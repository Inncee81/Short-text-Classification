god's existence ok so i've just today been reading some of the posts in this forum and it makes me reallly question deeply about god's existence there have been times before that i questioned this but was always kind of afraid to let it out there i have never been a hard core christian but i grew up believing in god and years ago i started to read the bible and try to understand to be honest i found myself crying alot at night trying to understand and for a moment it seemed like i was going to be okay and the crying and guilt would end but i ended feeling weird i must admiit sometimes i felt like i was doing the right thing but it didnt stick so yeah i dont want to be a bad person at all and want to do what is right anyways this is one of the things that confuse me most most if not all ppl believe in bad evil devil if thats the case why doesnt evil in turn take over the whole world and vice versa with god why doesnt he come forth and save us now not later since is he the one don't listen to other people listen to yourself i suggest you keep studying not only the bible but also agnostic and atheist perspectives and judaism islam buddhism hinduism confucianism taoism jainism zoroastrianism bahai if you're in college think about taking an introductory religious course that will brief you to the major religions of the world otherwise those idiot's guides books are generally pretty good research all the sides of the argument before you blindly accept one or another just because people tell you that's what's right or because people tell you that you're evil if you don't agree with them you should think about how the existence or the nonexistence of a god makes you feel and then you should think about whether the existence or the nonexistence of a god is a logical and reasonable idea to you and then decide what works best for youuu Religion Atheism God Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Supernatural Evil Eastern philosophy Fundamentalism Buddhism Religious pluralism Monotheism Theodicy Major world religions Reincarnation Creationism Hell The nature of God in Western theology A Course In Miracles Existence of God Afterlife Devil Prayer Confucianism Evolutionary creationism Agnosticism Hinduism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Sin The relationship between religion and science Origin belief Apologetics Immortality Philosophy Cosmology Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Max Weber Ten Commandments Witchcraft Predestination Infant baptism Vegetarianism Idolatry Religious conversion Apostasy Philosophy of religion Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Taoism Pascal's Wager Jewish principles of faith Demon Scientology beliefs and practices Sacrifice Eschatology Religious Society of Friends Jewish philosophy Human Nation of Islam Soul Ontological argument Strong atheism Theory of conduct Judaism Sant Thakar Singh Jewish views of religious pluralism Heaven Religion in India Urantia Deity David Hume Meditation Karma Moral objectivism Goodness and value theory Intelligent design Gnosticism Jacob Neusner Trinity Sabbath Zoroastrianism Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Biblical inerrancy Problem of Hell Charles Darwin's views on religion Jainism Homosexuality History of Christianity Christian apologetics Bertrand Russell Faith Fasting
