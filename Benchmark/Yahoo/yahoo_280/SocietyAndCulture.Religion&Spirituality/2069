if satan inspired jk rowling to write the harry potter series why would he have made the main character so good so trustworthy and so loyal traits that satan despises and traits that all followers of god should have and the main villain so much like himself please don't forget about the second part of the question why would satan create a villain who is so much like himself the funny thing is after i drew more attention to the second partof the question the people who believe it is from the devil shut up i guess i did what i set out to do thank you so much i've been waiting for a while for someone to actually answer this question who actually seems to know what they were talking about thank you devinlw i would like to appologize for the comment i made about the people who believe these books are from satan it was rude but i would like to point out that no one still has given me a satisfactory answer to the second part of the question and yeah i am a catholic did you know that the catholic church does not teach about the rapture yet i still believe in it the signs are too numerous to deny did you know that there are talks in the middle east of a year peace treaty supposedly this peace treaty is going to make way for the antichrist to come to power i believe this and i believe that the end time are going to be soon so please don't make assumptions that i don't know much about the christian faith great question and points jk rowling sees herself as a christian and has implied that the harry potter books have a christian theme so it is hard to see how satan inspired this series i am christian and this seems to offend the religious right far worse than if i said i thought there was no god every time i've been asked if i believe in god i've said 'yes ' because i do but no one ever really has gone any more deeply into it than that and i have to say that does suit me if i talk too freely about that i think the intelligent reader whether or will be able to guess what is coming in the books the guardian books section ukaug michelle pauli let's look at the fruits of her books despite the controversy that surrounds them millions of christian and non christian kids and parents are reading the phenomenally best selling harry potter books book by john granger the only comprehensive study of how harry potter has affected children s reading skills was done in the united kingdom by the federation of children s book groups one thousand british children ages to responded to a survey from the federation and percent of them said that the harry potter books have improved their reading skills percent said the books are why they read more so what does satan get for his inspiration an author who does not give him any claim in fact claims christ in response to a simple question is she a christian jk rowling answered yes and took it a step further by has stated the importance of her christian faith in constructing these stories so i think that we are looking at meaning that goes deeper than stories about childhood she has further explained the reason she did not elaborated on her faith in the past was because it would have revealed key plot lines in the future novels more kids and and their parents learned to love to read more and many of these people are christians an example a christian gina burkart whose book a parent s guide to harry potter intervarsity press came out last june share's the following one of the most powerful connections my son made was when he was in the fourth grade burkart said he told me that when harry drives the serpent s tooth through tom riddle s journal in harry potter and the chamber of secrets that reminded him of how christ destroyed satan s book of lies when they drove the nails through christ s hands and feet and he told me that when the phoenix s tears heal harry that made him think of christ s tears at the crucifixion that s how christ heals us it seems he gains nothing rather good comes from these books not evil i would argue harry potter was inspired in the tradition of christian writer's tolkien and c s lewis and boy this would make satan angrier then all get out fairytales that most christians tell their children such as sleeping beauty beauty and the beast hanzel and gretel ect these all have some type of witchcraft are those christians who oppose potter books are going start burning these books are they going to expose these evil teachings were is the up roar i do not see any there seems to be a double standard it's okay to accuse harry potter of being too much into the occult and then at the same time love those fairytale's like sleeping beauty snow white or beauty ect and read them to the kids at bedtime say our prayers and tug them in can you see how unfair that jugement is as christians one should be consistent in our own lives with following scripture humbly answered devin willis Christianity Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Hermione Granger Resurrection of Jesus J.
