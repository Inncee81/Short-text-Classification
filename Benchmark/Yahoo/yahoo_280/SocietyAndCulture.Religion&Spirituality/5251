should evolution and state be separate seems like a religion to me they claim to know how we came into existence yet they have yet to give us solid proof that we actually evolved from something else even worse they are discovering now that man did not evolve from monkeys at all so all that stuff we learned in school about apes becoming human is just a bunch of monkey sh it well what is wrong with christianity in schools if evolutionist don't believe in god then what are they worried about teaching kids bible principals is a much better way to get them ready for the real world and how to treat there fellow man then some teacher preaching on a soap box that we are all primates that evolved and we have no purpose except survival of the fittest it would be better to teach christianity and perhaps be wrong than to not teach christianity and be right we are created beings created by a creator god of the holy bible who wrote his book with his instructions for his creation no one can begin to prove evolution but if some want to believe they came from a monkey that's okay with me i for one did not Creationism Human Teach the Controversy Evolutionary creationism Urantia Meaning of life Trinity Intelligent design movement Evolutionism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism The Origin of Species A Course In Miracles History of creationism Intelligent design The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Religion Charles Darwin's views on religion Church of Christ, Scientist Separation of church and state Scopes Trial Genesis Creation science Creation according to Genesis Creation-evolution controversy Origen Salvation Theodicy Jewish principles of faith Ten Commandments Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Wedge strategy Primate Existence of God Soul Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Catechism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Biblical inerrancy Sabbath Kuzari Rosicrucian Fellowship Evolution Supernatural William A.
