female priests to fellow catholics is this proof that back when the bible was written women were preachers too romans greet mary who has worked hard for you if paul in this letter is gretting all of the greatt teachers of jesus of his time doesn't this proove women should be able to be priests i support femal priesthood please no rude answers to jeannielunchbox i didn't know men in that time were named mary the fact that women can teach religious truths does not mean they can be priests when it comes to mary she is unique in her position as the queen of heaven mary is our mother and queen of the new davidic kingdom john jesus makes mary the mother of us all as he dies on the cross by saying behold your mother jesus did not say john behold your mother because he gave mary to all of us his beloved disciples all the words that jesus spoke on cross had a divine purpose jesus was not just telling john to take care of his mother rev this verse proves the meaning of john the woman's mary's offspring are those who follow jesus she is our mother and we are her offspring in jesus christ the master plan of god's covenant love for us is family but we cannot be a complete family with the fatherhood of god and the brotherhood of christ without the motherhood of mary john this is a very signifcant verse in scripture as our mother mary tells all of us to do whatever jesus tells us further mary's intercession at the marriage feast in cana triggers jesus' ministry and a foreshadowing of the eucharistic celebration of the lamb this celebration unites all believers into one famiy through the marriage of divinity and humanity john jesus allows his mother to intercede for the people on his behalf and responds to his mother's request by ordering the servants to fill the jars with water psalm the psalmist teaches that the queen stands at the right hand of god the role of the queen is important in god's kingdom mary the queen of heaven is at the right hand of the son of god kings in the old testament davidic kingdom the king does not refuse his mother jesus is the new davidic king and he does not refuse the requests of his mother mary the queen kings in the old testament davidic kingdom the queen intercedes on behalf of the king's followers she is the queen mother or gebirah mary is our eternal gebirah kings in the old testament davidic kingdom the king bows down to his mother and she sits at his right hand we as children of the new covenant should imitate our king and pay the same homage to mary our mother by honoring mary we honor our king jesus christ kings the queen mother is a powerful position in israel's royal monarchy here the queen is removed from office but now the davidic kingdom is perfected by jesus and our mother mary is forever at his right hand chron here queen mother athalia destroys the royal family of judah after she sees her son king ahaziah dead the queen mother plays a significant role in the kingdom neh the queen mother sits beside the king she is the primary intercessor before the king however when it comes to women in the priesthood the bible teaches gen luke john rev mary is god's greatest creation was the closest person to jesus and yet jesus did not choose her to become a priest god chose only men to be priests to reflect the complimentarity of the sexes just as the man the royal priest gives natural life to the woman in the marital covenant the ministerial priest gives supernatural life in the new covenant sacraments judges fatherhood and priesthood are synonymous terms micah says stay with me and be to me a father and a priest fathers priests give life and mothers receive and nurture life this reflects god our father who gives the life of grace through the priesthood of his divine son and mother church who receives the life of grace and nourishes her children in summary women cannot be priests because women cannot be fathers mark luke john jesus allowed women to uniquely join in his mission exalting them above cultural norms his decision not to ordain women had nothing to do with culture the gospel writers are also clear that women participated in jesus' ministry and unlike men never betrayed jesus women have always been held with the highest regard in the church e g the church's greatest saint and model of faith is a woman the church's constant teaching on the dignity of motherhood the church's understanding of humanity as being the bride united to christ etc mark luke the language the twelve and apostles shows jesus commissioned the eucharistic priesthood by giving holy orders only to men gen heb jesus the son of god is both priest and king after the priest king melchizedek jesus' priesthood embodies both kingship and sonship gen as foreshadowed god chose our redemption to be secured by the sacrificial love that the son gives to the father matt mark luke because the priest acts in persona christi in the offering to the father the priest cannot be a woman mark jesus selected the apostles as he desired according to his will and not according to the demands of his culture because jesus acted according to his will which was perfectly united to that of the father one cannot criticize jesus' selection of men to be his priests without criticizing god john jesus only breathed on the male apostles the first bishops giving them the authority to forgive and retain sins in fact the male priesthood of christianity was a distinction from the priestesses of paganism that existed during these times a female priesthood would be a reversion to non christian practices the sacred tradition of a male priesthood has existed uncompromised in the church for years cor paul says a woman is not permitted to preach the word of god in the church it has always been the tradition of the church for the priest or deacon alone an ordained male to read and preach the gospel tim paul also says that a woman is not permitted to hold teaching authority in the church can you imagine how much mary the mother of god would have been able to teach christians about jesus her son in the church yet she was not permitted to hold such teaching authority in the church rom while many protestants point to this verse denounce the church's tradition of a male priesthood deaconesses like phoebe were helpers to the priests for example preparing women for naked baptism so as to prevent scandal but these helpers were never ordained luke prophetesses like anna were women who consecrated themselves to religious life but were not ordained isaiah isaiah complains that the priests of ancient israel were having their authority usurped by women and this was at the height of israel s covenant apostasy
