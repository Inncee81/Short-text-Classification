why do people say that bible translations are erroneous changed many times i read in frount of my nt king james translation the new testament of our lord savior jesus christ translated out of the original greek with the former translations diligently compared revised by his majesty's special command appointed to be read in churches our old testament comes from israel's hebrew translation and the dead sea scrolls of biblical are the same message as the ones we have today i have the king james translation there are many reasons why people claim that the scriptures are erroneous or inaccurate the primary one i think is so they can use that as an excuse not to believe and not to study them however except for the intentional corruption and perversion of the nwt used by the jehovah's witnesses virtually every translation and even paraphrase like ken taylor's tlb john bertram phillips' the new testament in modern english and letters to young churches has been subjected to close scrutinity by biblical scholars translators of the ancient languages of hebrew aramaic and ancient greek as well as by linguistic research scholars and very carefully studied for errors in fact when the ancient jewish scribes apostles monks etc used to hand copy manuscripts if only one error was made in transcription the scroll or page of manuscript would be discarded and the transcription would start over my wife and i have several different translations of the bible including kjv rsv neb tev new kjb niv including on cassette tape also the nt in eight translations which also includes the jerusalem nasb and j b phillips' ntme greek kjv niv interlinear nt and a german and english interlinear nt upon studying these various versions i see no significant differences in addition we have a nwt plus the book of mormon and doctrine convenants pearl of great price just for comparison there is a kjv only movement which declares that literal translations especially the king james version are god's word and all dynamic translations are evil however this has been debunked by many biblical scholars most notably james white in the king james only controversy Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible Holy Spirit Book of Daniel Old Testament Trinity Jehovah's Witnesses Sabbath Resurrection of Jesus Ten Commandments Vulgate Gospel of Thomas Creation according to Genesis Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Christianity Baptism Alan Campbell (pastor) Hell Gospel of Mark Dating the Bible Apostle Prophet God and gender Acts of the Apostles Christian views of Jesus Authorship of the Pauline epistles Book of Isaiah Historical Jesus Hebrew name Creationism Christian denomination Masoretic Text Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Church of Christ Gospel of John Book of Revelation Religious perspectives on Jesus End times Dispensationalism History of Christianity Qur'an New King James Version Saint James the Just Historicity of Jesus Great Apostasy Aramaic of Jesus Christian eschatology New International Version Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Psalms Mary, the mother of Jesus Nazarene Book of Esther Biblical archaeology Documentary hypothesis Study Bible Yeshu Homosexuality and Christianity Greek language Restorationism Biblical studies Whore of Babylon Textual criticism Idolatry A Course In Miracles The Bible and history American Standard Version Council of Jerusalem Fundamentalist Christianity Moses
