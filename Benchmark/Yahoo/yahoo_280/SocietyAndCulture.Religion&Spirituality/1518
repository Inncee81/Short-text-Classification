how should we as muslims tackle the issue of abuse and how can we get to the brutes who think this is allowed when the prophet pbuh himself never spoke harshly to a woman nor hit one since there are some in the muslim community that believe it is halal to smack their wives around because the woman is the property of the man an unislamic idea in the first place i thought it would be good to send out this important reminder i know many people would like to see this issue not talked about as it is airing our dirty laundry in public but it must be talked about and dealt with as allah commands us to stand up for justice even if it is against our ownselves we in the muslim community should not tolerate our sisters being abused in anyway and should actively take measures to insure that this abuse ceases if you know of someone who is being abused it is haram for you to remain silent and you will be held accountable before allah if you do not speak out i personally hold in contempt any man who beats his wife and then comes to the mosque with all his outward signs of piety with the false assumption he is practicing the sunnah this man is nothing more than a two bit hypocrite as the old saying goes why does he not pick on someone his own size cowards rarely do that alot of it may be behind closed doors sadly in all communities in the world and involving people of all religious backgrounds the woman in question may feel ashamed to speak up may think she has to accept that as her lot it could be that in some thirld world 'poor' communities she puts up with this rather than end up being a 'social pariah' communities need to pull together on this to address this issue because it is a serious issue i watched a dreadful tv documentary a few weeks back that was a real eye opener about the plight of some women in one thirld world country and it is not necessarily the menfolk who were doing the abusing sometimes mother in laws or other members of the household are involved or encourage it it is all not so cut and dry community support to help deeper issues at large such as poverty and unemployment may help imams should address this issue too with their community everyone needs to pull together on this and the wider issues that may contribute somehow towards abuse i agree about speaking up i think you are party to a sin if you see it and don't speak out against it i love the simple but profound quote of edmund burke the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing evil could be evil deeds or acts on the one hand or indifference or inaction to such deeds or acts on the other hand wake up world add muslim men should wake up every morning with the reminder of how prophet muhammad peace and blessings of god be upon him was sent as a mercy to mankind was the most gentle and sublime of characters and the best to his wives he was an example to follow and they should follow his example always Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sharia Qiyamah Apostasy in Islam Islam Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Muhammad Salah Muslim ibn Aqeel Women in Islam John the Baptist Women as imams Mary, the mother of Jesus Nation of Islam Eid ul-Fitr Polygamy Ali Christianity Sin Yusuf al-Qaradawi Jizya Ten Commandments Five Pillars of Islam Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Prophet Theodicy Sunni Islam Bilal ibn Ribah Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Rais massacre Marriage Exorcism Eastern Orthodox Church Islam and anti-Semitism Hadith Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Ismaili Summa Theologiae Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Predestination Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Jewish principles of faith Abd al-Rahman ibn Sakhr Religion 613 mitzvot Religious pluralism Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) EastEnders Duties of the Heart God Opus Dei Holy Spirit Caliph Nahj al Balagha Homosexuality and Christianity Shi'a Islam Abraham Virgin Mary in Islam Plame affair Sunnah Status of religious freedom in Malaysia Qur'an Angel Sufism Fundamentalism Alawite Twelvers Jerusalem Idolatry Domestic violence Fred Phelps Abdul Qadir Jilani Aqidah Aisha Khabbab ibn al-Aratt Estoppel Wu-Tang Clan affiliates Apostasy Islam as a political movement Divorce Al-Ghazali Homosexuality and Islam Battle of Badr Hell Hijab Knots Landing Dhimmi Evil Atheism Israel ben Eliezer Sin City
