we can know we are in the right religon by how the people in that religion act jesus said test them by their fruits if that religon fosters hate and blood shed would that correspond with what god said before the flood the end of all flesh has come before me because the earth is full of violence because of them or when he destroyed sodom and gamorrah because of their loose morals and immoral sex worship there again that would not be pleaseing to god so my question is if he destroyed them for those things before would he now somehow approve of such things would a religon that says it is okay to lie steal or to extort money on false pretenses be a true religion say they say send me money and god will make you rich would that be true i mean how do they know that did god somehow tell them that so would a religion be the true religion if the people who were in that religion sinned against god you are a wise young lady and you know those answerer's all ready but also consider one or two things jesus said to go forth and preach to the entire inhabited earth to teach and to baptize he also said his kingdom is no part of this world and he is the king so real christians would follow their king and remain neutral to world politics not join in the killing of other nations because their king christ is no part of this world true christians should be no part of this world also they should be known for their fine works titus people zealous for fine works hebrew incite to fine work and love so fine works of spreading gods word preaching and teaching then each member cooperating to spread the truth looking out for the injured and week and continually working out ore own salvation philip not one saved always saved but keep working and they should teach the name of the true god to all check these verses or the foot notes of these verses for the true name of god exodus exodus exodus judges ezekiel psalms isaiah and isaiah exodus in the douay version foot note Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Ten Commandments Book of Isaiah Salvation Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Angel Dispensationalism Prophet Religion God Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Idolatry Alan Campbell (pastor) Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Sola fide Paul of Tarsus Jewish Messiah Soul Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Christianity Divine grace Articles of Religion (Methodist) Roman Catholic Church John Howard Yoder Noah Resurrection of Jesus Charles Grandison Finney Christian anarchism End times Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Abrahamic religion Mary, the mother of Jesus Trinity Origen Eastern Orthodox Church Infant baptism Genesis Merit Jesus Mormonism and Christianity Sodom and Gomorrah Creationism Names of God in Judaism Noahide Laws Christian views of Jesus Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Satan Book of Ezekiel Sin Jewish eschatology Justification (theology) A Course In Miracles God and gender History of anti-Semitism Holy Spirit Binitarianism Religious pluralism Religious conversion Christian eschatology Historical persecution by Christians Book of Mormon Apocrypha Biblical inerrancy Rapture Chosen people Evil New Testament Bible Messiah Mormonism and Judaism Great Apostasy Summa Theologiae Christianity and anti-Semitism Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Devil Demon Nation of Islam Apocalyptic literature Fundamentalism Council of Jerusalem Rastafari movement Mortification of the flesh Satanism John Wycliffe Usury Ezekiel Religious perspectives on Jesus Anointing
