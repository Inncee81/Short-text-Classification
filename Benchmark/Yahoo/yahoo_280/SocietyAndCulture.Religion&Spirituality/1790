what do creationists say about dinosaurs and extinction i'm really curious if there is some kind of consensus about these things or if there are as many ideas about it as there are religions please no bible quotes just your own words and opinions well years ago they claimed the dinosaur bones were jsut a liberal plot then when that didn't work they changed their story now they claim the dinoosaurs were drowned in the flood of course to do this they had to ignore the geoligical evidence so they invented a fake geology to explain away the evidence and since scientific dating didn't agree with their timeline they now claim that's a liberal conspiracy and of course since they claim to take the bible literally they are being inconsistant the bible specifically says that all animals were on the ark so how did the dinosaurs miss the boat and here's the best explanation that god planted the evidence of dinosaurs to test people's faith so what that boils down to is saying god planted false evidence to mislead people in short they're calling god a liar all of which expains why real christians won't have anything to do with these fakes and hypocrites who cal themselves creationists Young Earth creationism Flood geology Noah's Ark Creation science Creationism Creation-evolution controversy Biblical inerrancy Intelligent design Origin belief Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Resurrection of Jesus Pseudoscience Dinosaur Miracle Answers in Genesis Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Religion Deluge (mythology) Science Intelligent design movement Evolutionary creationism God Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Supernatural Reincarnation Teach the Controversy Day-Age Creationism Truth Book of Mormon Mythology Atheism Trinity Evil Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Time travel Christianity Creation according to Genesis Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Moses The Bible and history The Origin of Species Fundamentalism Created kind Michael Crichton Existence of God Satanism Documentary hypothesis Charles Darwin Church of Christ Kent Hovind Species Idolatry Modern geocentrism Paul of Tarsus Presuppositional apologetics Christian apologetics John Titor Liberal Christianity Evolution Creation biology Theodicy Killian documents Alan Campbell (pastor) Religious pluralism Soul Bible prophecy Predestination Prophet Church of Christ, Scientist Genesis Jesus Isaac Asimov Bible Biblical canon Nontrinitarianism Book of Joshua Authorship of the Pauline epistles Judaism Abrahamic religion Bigfoot Fundamentalist Christianity Plame affair William A.
