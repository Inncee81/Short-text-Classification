christ coming back do you guys think that the end is near with all the war rising oceans global warming the end is nearer than it has ever been but i wouldn't look at the signs you are mentioning to think that it was immanent instead look for what paul said to look for thessalonians now concerning the coming of our lord jesus christ and our being gathered together to him we ask you brothers not to be quickly shaken in mind or alarmed either by a spirit or a spoken word or a letter seeming to be from us to the effect that the day of the lord has come let no one deceive you in any way for that day will not come unless the rebellion comes first and the man of lawlessness is revealed the son of destruction who opposes and exalts himself against every so called god or object of worship so that he takes his seat in the temple of god proclaiming himself to be god do you not remember that when i was still with you i told you these things and you know what is restraining him now so that he may be revealed in his time for the mystery of lawlessness is already at work only he who now restrains it will do so until he is out of the way and then the lawless one will be revealed whom the lord jesus will kill with the breath of his mouth and bring to nothing by the appearance of his coming the coming of the lawless one is by the activity of satan with all power and false signs and wonders and with all wicked deception for those who are perishing because they refused to love the truth and so be saved Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Antichrist Christian eschatology Holy Spirit Sabbath Book of Mormon Prophet Ten Commandments Sola fide Messiah Book of Isaiah John the Baptist Mary, the mother of Jesus Paul of Tarsus Summa Theologiae Adam-God theory Jesus Eastern Orthodox Church John Howard Yoder Baptism Dispensationalism Rapture Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Church of Christ Soul Urantia Mormonism and Christianity Devil Gospel of Barnabas Gospel of Thomas Athanasian Creed New Testament Mark 16 Belial Eucharist Book of Revelation Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Antinomianism Tribulation Salvation Slow Train Coming Endowment (Mormonism) Angel Apocalyptic literature God and gender Noah Binitarianism First Book of Nephi Virgin Mary in Islam Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Gospel of Mark Pharisees The Pilgrim's Progress Herbert W.
