ok so what religion would you catergrise me as being ok i believe that theres a god but i don't believe he made any rules for us besides what we see and set for ourselfs i don't follow no religion but admire the good that religion has done i believe that heaven and hell actually exsist here on earth within our lives when we are depressed and going through turmoil that is hell when we live in bliss and happiest and have families we're actually living in heaven i believe that good is made up of both evil and good but more or less wants to be completly good i believe that we are being wathed by god and his people and that we are meerly just advanced pieces of technology far ahead of our own time and i don't think that there is an afterlife what sort of category of religion would i fall under that is certainly an odd set of religious beliefs you have you have a funny definition of good believing that it is made up of both good and evil apparently you believe that justice is something that takes place here on earth during our lives since you don't believe in an afterlife and you see heaven and hell as times in our lives also i find it odd that your god is not the source of ultimate justice but instead justice is set by human standards you seem to have a kind of mechanistic or materialistic view of mankind since you call us advanced pieces of technology i would classify you as relative moral deist the relative moral part is because you believe that humans set their own rules and standards the deist part is because you believe in some sort of a god but your god doesn't seem to interfere in the lives of humans or care about justice your god seems to have set the world in motion and then left it to go like a big machine Heaven Afterlife Theory of conduct Theodicy Hell Reincarnation Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Goodness and value theory Immortality Evolutionary creationism Evil Religion God Soul Meaning of life Satanism Predestination Christian eschatology Original sin Abrahamic religion Human A Course In Miracles Monotheism Morality Ten Commandments Devil Salvation Deity Scientology beliefs and practices Qiyamah Demon Atheism Summa Theologiae Origin belief Sin Fundamentalism Jewish principles of faith Religious pluralism Moral objectivism Deism Pascal's Wager Noahide Laws Justification (theology) End times Incarnations of Immortality Urantia Rich Mullins Human nature Simone Weil Death Confucius Problem of Hell Jewish eschatology Social justice Emanuel Swedenborg Supernatural Animism The nature of God in Western theology Ascetical theology Neopaganism Atomism Jihad Angel Roman Catholic Church Satan The Amber Spyglass Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Religious perspectives on Jesus Maimonides Islam Ishmael (novel) Jewish philosophy Divine grace Bangsian fantasy Angel Sanctuary Friedrich Schleiermacher Legalism (theology) Antony Flew Dualism (philosophy of mind) Philosophy of religion Zoroastrianism Jewish views of religious pluralism Intelligent design Altruism Ethics Hinduism Thomas Jefferson Idolatry Problem of evil Reconstructionist Judaism Apocalypse Truth Spiritism
