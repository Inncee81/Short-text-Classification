who is ayisha bint abi bakr sadik r a the prophet is closer to the believers than their ownselves and his wives are as their mothers qur'an o prophet surely we have sent you as a witness and as a bringer of good news and a warner and one who calls the people to allah by his permission and as a shining light quran allah and his angels pray blessings on the prophet o you who believe pray blessings of him and ask for peace for him quran aisha bint abi bakr gradually the muslims who remained in mecca left the city and traveled to medina to join their beloved prophet and amongst them was a little girl called 'a'isha the daughter of abu bakr soon after arriving in medina 'a'isha who was now nine years old as married to the prophet muhammad peace and blessings of allah be upon him who was now fifty four years old it was at this point that she left her family's household and joined that the prophet muhammad peace and blessings of allah be upon him 'a'isha later reported that the prophet muhammad peace and blessings of allah be upon him had told her that jibril came to him and showed him a picture of her on a piece of green silk and said she is your wife in this world and in the next world about her wedding she related that shortly before she was to leave her parents' house she slipped out into the courtyard to play with a friend i was playing on a seesaw and my long streaming hair became disheveled she said they came and took me from my play and made me ready they dressed her in a wedding dress made from fine red striped cloth from bahrain and then her mother took her to the newly built house where some women of the ansar were waiting outside the door they greeted her with the words for good and for happiness may all be well then in the presence of the smiling prophet peace and blessings of allah be upon him a bowl of milk was brought the prophet drank from it himself and then offered it to 'a'isha she shyly declined it but when he insisted she drink as well and then offered the bowl to her sister asma' who was sitting beside her the others who were present also drank from it and that was all there was to the simple and solemn occasion of their wedding her marriage to the prophet peace and blessings of allah be upon him did not change 'a'isha's playful ways and her young friends continued to regularly come to visit her in her own room i would be playing with my dolls she once said 'with the girls who were my friends and the prophet peace and blessings of allah be upon him would come in and they would slip out of the house and he would go out after them and bring them back for he was pleased for my sake to have them there sometimes he would say stay where you are before they had time to leave and would also join in their games one day 'a'isha said the prophet peace and blessings of allah be upon him came in when i was playing with my dolls and said 'a'isha whatever game is this ' 'it is solomon's horses ' i replied and he laughed on another occasion during the days of the id al adha two young girls were with 'a'isha in her room singing a song about the famous battle of bu'ath and beating a tambourine in time the messenger of allah peace and blessings of allah be upon him came in said 'a'isha 'and lay down with his face turned away then abu bakr came and scolded me saying 'what is this musical instrument of shaytan doing in the house of the messenger of allah ' the messenger of allah turned towards him and said 'leave them alone for these are the days of the 'id ' after a while 'a'isha asked the girls to leave and the prophet asked 'a'isha whether she would like to watch the abyssinians who were giving a fighting display with their weapons in the mosque and she said yes by allah said 'a'isha i remember the messenger of allah peace and blessings of allah be upon him standing at the door of my room screening me with his cloak so that i could see the sport of the abyssinians as they played with their spears in the mosque of the messenger of allah peace and blessings of allah be upon him he kept standing for my sake until i had enough and then i went back in so you can well imagine how a young girl enjoyed watching this display some might have viewed the marriage of muhammad and 'a'isha as an exceptional marriage but then the two partners were exceptional people the prophet muhammad peace and blessings of allah be upon him was the last of the prophets and the best of creation and 'a'isha was a very intelligent and observant young girl with a very good memory 'a'isha may allah be pleased with her spent the next nine years of her life with the prophet peace and blessings of allah be upon him and she grew into womanhood she remembered all that she saw and heard with great clarity for to be the wife of the prophet was even more than extraordinary so much happened around him the quran continued to be revealed ayat by ayat and people's hearts were constantly being turned over and transformed including hers and she was a witness of so much of all that took place it is not surprising therefore that a great deal of the knowledge that we still have today about how our beloved prophet peace and blessings of allah be upon him lived and behaved was first remembered and then taught to others by 'a'isha it is thanks to this exceptional marriage between a man nearing the end of his life and a woman still near the beginning of hers that we know so much about the both of them and this is what makes it so much easier for those who wish to follow in their footsteps to try and follow their example whereas khadijah was already a wise and mature woman when she married the prophet muhammad 'a'isha was a spirited young girl who still had a great deal to learn when she married the prophet may allah be pleased with her and peace be upon him she was very quick to learn however for she had a clear heart and a quick mind and an accurate memory she was not afraid to talk back in order to find out the truth or make it known and whenever she beat someone else in argument the prophet would smile and say she is the daughter of abu bakr musa ibn talha once said i have not seen anyone more eloquent than 'a'isha 'a'isha may allah be pleased with her became so wise that one of her contemporaries used to say that if the knowledge of 'a'isha were placed on one side of the scales that of all other women on the other 'a'isha 's side would outweigh the other she used to sit with the other women and pass on the knowledge that she had received from the prophet peace and blessings of allah be upon him and long after he had died and as long as she lived she was a source of knowledge and wisdom for both women and men abu musa once said whenever a report appeared doubtful to us the companions of the prophet and we asked 'a'isha about it we always learned something from her about it on one occasion the prophet muhammad peace and blessings of allah be upon him said to her o 'a'isha here is jibril giving you greetings of peace and on him be peace she said 'and the mercy of allah when she was telling abu salama about this she added he meaning the prophet muhammad peace be upon him sees what i do not see as well as being extremely intelligent 'a'isha became a very graceful young woman when she first came to live in the prophet's household as a young girl a strong and lasting friendship grew up between her and sawda and sawda took care of her along with the rest of the household when 'a'isha grew up sawda who was by then an old woman gave up her share of the prophet's time in favor of 'a'isha and was content to manage his household and be umm al mumineen 'the mother of the believers' a title of respect that was given to all of the wives of the prophet may allah be pleased with them which confirmed what the quran clearly states that no man could marry any of them after they had been married to the prophet for the prophet is closer to the believers than their ownselves and his wives are as their mothers qur'an o you wives of the prophet if any of you is openly indecent the punishment for her will be doubled and that is easy for allah and whoever of you submits to allah and his messenger has right action we shall give her a reward twice over and we have prepared a generous provision for her o you wives of the prophet you are not like any other women if you are fearful of allah then do not be soft in yspeech lest someone whose heart is sick is attracted to you but speak words that are wise and stay quietly in your houses do not make a dazzling display like that of the time of ignorance before and establish prayer and pay the zakat and obey allah and his messenger surely allah wishes to remove impurity far from you o people of the house and to purify you completely and remember that ayahs of allah that are recited in your houses and the wisdom surely allah is alpervading all aware quran it is sometimes difficult to picture what life must have been like for the wives and the companions of the prophet peace and blessings of allah be upon him because the light that emanated from him and through them was so unique the messenger of allah peace and blessings of allah be upon him had no shadow because he was light and this light illuminated the hearts and minds and understanding of his followers giving them insight without blinding them the prophet muhammad peace and blessings of allah be upon him was truly a mercy to all the worlds and no one with a clean heart could possibly forget this least of all the prophet himself o prophet surely we have sent you as a witness and as a bringer of good news and a warner and one who calls the people to allah by his permission and as a shining light quran it is said that people were awed by the prophet muhammad peace and blessings of allah be upon him when they were in his presence and that they sat and listened to his words with their eyes lowered as if they had birds perched on their heads and that they would do anything for him so great was their love for him it was because of the perfection of the prophet muhammad peace and blessings of allah be upon him that everyone was commanded to ask blessings on him allah and his angels pray blessings on the prophet o you who believe pray blessings of him and ask for peace for him quran
