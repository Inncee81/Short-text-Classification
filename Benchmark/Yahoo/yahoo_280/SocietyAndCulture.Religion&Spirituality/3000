more pagan questions the other day i was talking to my wiccan friend about my conversion to paganism not wicca and she told me that you'd better be serious about practicing and do you're rituals right or the gods and karma will kick your a s s but the paganism i am practicing doesn't involve gods just nature and the spirits a mixture of native american and celtic and i create my own rituals so am i doing something wrong and also to other pagans how did you come out and tell you're family of your switch and no scripture or you're going to hell please bless i don't plan on evoking or invoking any spirits at least not yet my philosophy is just revering nature and spending quality time with my spirit guide and such i'm only a beginner on this path so i'm gonna take it nice and slow and not do anything that causes potential problems but i just want to make it clear that i am not practicing witchcraft just naturalistic paganism and control of inner energy flow thanks bless excuse me mrtwocrows but borrowing ideas from my ancestors religion is not stealing if you were a true follower of the native american way you would not even say that you're a disgrace okay all of you touchy people sorry i offended you but i didn't steal anything from anyone i was just admiring and borrowing some native american beliefs and mr twocrows i didn't mean to say you were a disgrace just the idea of being angry at others for borrowing ideas from your religion so all of you just f ing chill karma is an eastern concept that has been co opted by the west and mutated into a completely different but still valid concept i prefer the word apodidome but it's not as pretty a word as karma and nobody uses it basically what it means is that what you do will come back to you you don't have to be pagan for this to happen it's just what happens it's a natural state of things and it's not a conscious vengence thing either it's one of those mysteries that alot of people don't get right away which is cool no point in having a mystery religion if everyone gets it right away the idea is not a righteous retribution but more that the energy you send out is the sort of energy you attract for example if you are generous you will attract generous people to you and the universe as a whole will be more generous to you if you are a gossip you will attract gossips and eventually you will be gossiped about likewise if you do magic to bring harm to others say to make someone ill the energy that you raise to do that magic will hang about you and eventually eat away at you causing you to be ill get it so no karma as western neo pagans will understand it will not kick your ass just because you aren't serious enough it will if you run around acting like a jerk because one day you'll wake up and find out the only people who will hang out with you are a bunch of jerks and karma as it is understood in the east won't kick your ass till after you're dead anyway now as for the gods the gods have a sense of humor they do not expect everyone who approaches them to be experts that is why we have guides this is why also many people walk with different gods at different points in their lives a woman for example might walk with artemis as a young child athena while she is getting educated and deciding on a career aphrodite when she's sowing her wild oats and hera when she has settled down to raise a family the gods aren't jealous of each other and they don't generally punish people for simple screwups or goofing off if they did there wouldn't be any such thing as the chocolate ritual the erisian high mass of the crispy creme cabal or the fluffy bunny ritual if they took offense to this i can think of an awful lot of pagans who would be running around with their hair on fire the most important thing about neo paganism isn't doing things right it's finding the truth within yourself we have a saying us oldies if you cannot find the truth within you will never find the truth without and we have similar sayings about beauty and love when we gather and we've been doing it for years we take turns writing rituals everyone does it slightly differently we meditate on the topic we decide on a theme and then we wright out the ritual every month is different i pour out libations my friend calls quarters my other friend dances while we drum and that's just the opening of the ceremony some of us claim our gods or spirit guides told us how to write the ritual some of us rip off stuff we find in books and on the internet and we almost always have some kind of screwup we spill the wine the fire won't light things catch on fire that weren't meant to catch on fire always keep a bucket of water or fire extinguisher handy or we forget some important thing and have to make due without once the dog ran through the middle having pulled up the spike in the ground he was tied to and the rope caught on the altar cloth and sent everything flying and then he proceeded to drag it across a field thinking this was a great game we weren't punished the gods have a sense of humor the deepest truth that i have learned that in spiritual work whether it be magic or just ritual or meditation it is the intent that matters most of all Meaning of life Reincarnation Hinduism Shamanism Religious Society of Friends Immortality Soul Sin Determinism Yoga Roman Catholic Church The
