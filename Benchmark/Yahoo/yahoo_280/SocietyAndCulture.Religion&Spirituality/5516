how does the atheist account for the laws of logic i asked this in a previous question and just got argumentative responses b c i involved my beliefs so please just answer the question to your best ability and understand that my beliefs have nothing to do with this question i am simply trying to understand your if you are an atheist account again so please just answer the question to your best ability and understand that my beliefs have nothing to do with this question i am simply trying to understand your if you are an atheist account if the atheist states that the laws of logic are derived through observing natural principles found in nature then he is confusing the mind with the universe okay they don't need any proof to swallow what it is they believe and yet they deny that emphatically so therefore they are in denial about something they have no clue of that's not scientific so while are espousing atheism they admit to being unscientific and therefore illogical to the methods of science it's obviously important to them many are here every single day preaching it so the one's you are asking about how does the atheist account for the laws of logic you are writing of a people in complete denial about what they think they attribute logic to others things perhaps but by definition they are irrational and faithful to their beliefs my point is that you are asking for logic from a people who are by definition wandering away from the very precepts they attest to and yet living in the conflict of their own denial you cannot get a rational answer from such a person who's demeanor is set so deep in denial they will rationalize their answers some by avoiding the question and some by denying the charge i noticed that you answer does not give a charge you did not accuse them of anything you only mentioned that you got some argumentative answers and yet people in denial react by acting accused because they feel like they are under pressure they feel guilty Atheism Supernatural Existence of God Religion Falsifiability Creationism Epistemology Scientific method The nature of God in Western theology Theodicy Strong atheism Meaning of life Intelligent design Deconstruction Immanuel Kant Biblical inerrancy God Evolutionary creationism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Philosophy of language Presuppositional apologetics Charles Grandison Finney Science Objectivist philosophy Creation-evolution controversy Faith and rationality Soul Scopes Trial Agnosticism Fundamentalism Goodness and value theory Friedrich Schleiermacher Jewish principles of faith Philosophy of science Theory of conduct David Hume Antony Flew Phillip E.
