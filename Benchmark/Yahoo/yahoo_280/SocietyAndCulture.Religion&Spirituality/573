why do people think mormons are so family oriented i live in utah almost all of my friends are mormon mormons i've noticed are very generous people and i love my friends they are so kind however people have this notion that mormons are very family oriented i don't agree my mormon friends back me up on this too as soon as a mormon tells their parents that they want to convert to a different religion their parents disown them some throw them out of the house i know a few same with coming out gays lesbians they will completely disown the kids this also goes with getting pregnant before marriage i know these things happen in a lot of other religions too but the most extreme cases i've heard and experienced were with mormon families families need to start learning that tolerance is important sorry i don't mean that the church makes them get rid of the children i just noticed and my mormon friends have noticed that mormon parents seem very quick to disown there kids for doing something against the church maybe i just notice it more because i'm in utah i've heard the mormons here are more strict i guess if i lived somewhere where there were a lot of catholics i might notice the same thing i don't know i'm just making an observation and seeing if anyone else has noticed this too thanks for the feedback though i know what i'm talking about i personally have seen more that incedences of this and bases on the kid being gay or just wanting to convert while still being a good smart person who doesn't do drugs and gets good grades i've seen this on the news in utah even it's not just me i guess you wouldn't know unless you were actually around mormon families mormons have earned the reputation for being family oriented families are supposed to set aside one family night a week generally monday family night normally includes a short lesson some sort of game or activity and a treat then there's the notion that families can be sealed in the temple so that they remain a family even after death the gospel is so strongly tied to every aspect of life parents don't know how to react when a child does something at odds with it only those family members who make it to the celestial kingdom the highest heaven will remain part of the family after death so it's traumatic when a child chooses to pursue a different religious path it's true that culturally things are very different in utah than other places i've lived people outside often tell utah mormon jokes brigham young was worried that the saints would face more hardship under prosperity than persecution Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Mormonism and Judaism Marriage Criticism of Mormonism Mormon Anti-Mormonism Book of Mormon Joseph Smith, Jr. Plural marriage Theory of conduct Mormonism and Christianity Temple (Mormonism) Endowment (Mormonism) History of the Latter Day Saint movement Brigham Young University Mormonism Polygamy Christianity Fundamentalism Saint Nicholas Brigham Young Utah Baptism Priesthood (Mormonism) Sexual orientation Abrahamic religion Community of Christ Separation of church and state Latter Day Saint movement Blacks and Mormonism Salt Lake City, Utah Homosexuality and Christianity Transsexuality Humphrey Bogart Succession crisis (Mormonism) Provo, Utah Social rule Blood atonement Same-sex marriage Eastern Orthodox Church Rich Mullins David Whitmer First Vision Religious conversion Religion and sexual orientation Adam-God theory Ten Commandments Judaism Laura Schlessinger Heber C.
