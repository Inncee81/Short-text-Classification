i don't understand hinduism well at all can you please explain what hinduism is all about what are there holidays there rituals can you explain hinduism to me and yes i know that explaining a religion in full on y a is impossible so i would be thankful if you could leave me with some websites thanks hindus follow the rules and regulations in their scriptures called the vedas they like christians and muslims and buddhists have smaller circles within hinduism that disagree on points basically hindus respect the demigods and express much gratitude to them all year long with festivals and even every day hindus do not eat cows because the cow is considered our mother since she gives us milk the bull is the father who ploughs the feilds hindus have great respect for parents and practically parents should be worshiped karma is a major part of hinduism that all hindus agree on the law of karma is similar to the law of attraction you do good deeds and get good results reincarnation is also a major part of hinduism that all hindus agree upon we know that we had many births in different lives before and that we will take many more there are heavenly planets and there are hellish planets the caste system or varnasram dharma is a way to organize society so that we function as many parts of the whole the priests brahmin should live simply and purely and give good advice to the others the kings kshatreya should listen to the advice of the priests and protect the citizens the merchants vaisha should protect the land and cows and maintain the belly of society the laborers sudra should help in anyway and also be the entertainers solders helpers and what ever their talents have them do they should be honest and simple in this way the whole society works together as one hindus believe you must be born in a hindu family to be hindu outsiders are outcastes especially cow eaters however sri caitanya mahaprabhu has taught that we can all become first class servants of god and there are no outcasts who is a devotee of god is completely pure sri caitanya mahaprabhu reawakened vaishnava dharma vaishnavas are hindus who prove that there is only one god and many demigods work under him like his secretaries jehovah christ allah and buddha are names of the one god krishna is the name of god in his original and highest aspect krishna has no material form but a transcendental form which is more beautiful than you could possibly imagine krishna lives beyond the heavenly planets in the abode called goloka vrndavan where once you go there you never return that place is past the material covering of this material universe and situated in the spiritual sky sometimes krishna comes down to this planet so that we may have a taste of life with god he brings everything including his eternal associates and the beautiful scenery and wonderful pastimes that he has in his own abode just in case we desire to come out of the repeated cycle of birth death old age and disease with our free will we can choose to serve illusion and serve ourselves or to be happy forever in transcendental loving service of god krishna the highest goal of life is divine love of god he is the root of all existance if we water the root the entire tree of life will become green and happy Buddhism Ramakrishna Sin Adi Shankara Shiva Hindu denominations Origin belief Sikhism Ishta-deva Eastern philosophy Bhakti movement Kali Yuga Ethics in religion Bhajan Jainism Ramayana Past teachings of Prem Rawat Sri Aurobindo Sathya Sai Baba Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Arjuna Heaven Bhakti Hell Prayer Iyer Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Upanishad Gautama Buddha Ayyavazhi Islam Religious perspectives on Jesus Tantra Vedic civilization Guru-shishya tradition Religious pluralism Abrahamic religion Swaminarayan Mahabharata Swami Vivekananda Aum Fundamentalism Mahatma Gandhi Jesus Theosophy Bhakti yoga Immortality Eschatology B.
