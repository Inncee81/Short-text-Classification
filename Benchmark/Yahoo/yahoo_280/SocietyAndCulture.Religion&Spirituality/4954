fellow muslims a question about isthikhara prayer i wanted to know if any of you have prayed it and if it has helped to resolve your issue inshallah while prayer isthikhara i have often been confused as to what the intention has to be do i ask about a certain future event or about a event already happening and can someone give me the english version of the arabic the du'a in arabic but written in english for isthikhara i read the quran in arabic but i find reading dua's in english easier for me thanks moonlit jabir bin abdullah ra said the prophet pbuh used to teach us to seek allah's counsel in all matters as he used to teach us a surah from the quran he would say when anyone of you has an important matter to decide let him pray two rak'ahs other than the obligatory prayer and then say transliteration allaahumma 'innee 'astakheeruka bi'ilmika wa 'astaqdiruka biqudratika wa 'as'aluka min fadhlikal 'adheemi fa'innaka taqdiru wa laa 'aqdiru wa ta'lamu wa laa 'a'lamu wa 'anta 'allaamul ghuyoobi allaahumma 'in kunta ta'lamu 'anna haathal' amra then mention the thing to be decided khayrun lee fee deenee wa ma'aashee wa 'aaqibati 'amree or say 'aajilihi wa 'aajilihi faqdurhu lee wa yassirhu lee thumma baarik lee feehi wa 'in kunta ta'lamu 'anna haathal 'amra sharrun lee fee deenee wa ma'aashee wa 'aaqibati 'amree or say 'aajilihi wa 'aajilihi fasrifhu 'annee wasrifnee 'anhu waqdur liyal khayra haythu kaana thumma 'ardhinee bihi meaning o allah i seek the counsel of your knowledge and i seek the help of your omnipotence and i beseech you for your magnificent grace surely you are capable and i am not you know and i know not and you are the knower of the unseen o allah if you know that this matter then mention the thing to decide is good for me in my religion and in my life and for my welfare in the life to come or say in this life and the afterlife then ordain it for me and make it easy for me then bless me in it and if you that this matter is bad for me in my religion and in my life and for my welfare in the life to come or say in this life and the afterlife then distance it from me and distance me from it and ordain for me what is good whenever it may be and help me to be content with it whoever seeks the counsel of the creator will not regret it and whoever seeks the advice of the belivers will feel confident about his decisions allah said in quran and consult them in the affair then when you have taken a decision put your trust in allah istikhara is done after any rakah as long as it's not an obligatory prayer any time of the day or night one can pray a nafl just for the sake of istikhara or he can make istikhara after any sunnah such as regular sunnahs tahiyat al masjid sunat al wudu etc the prophet said in the hadith of jabir narrated by bukhari about istikhara then let him pray two rakah not from the obligatory and then say after one makes tasleem from the two rakah he can make the dua of istikhara but there are some scholars like ibn taymiyah who say you make dua of istikhara before tasleem since before tasleem is for dua and after tasleem is for dhikr this dua is like any other dua it may or may not be answered allah knows best people talk about seeing a dream or a sign etc but the consensus of the scholars is that in most cases you have already have an inclination towards a particular thing to be decided then you should go for it continue on it even if you face hurdles if allah does not want you to go on a particular path you will know for sure e g if its a case of marriage you have decided on a particular girl boy as the case may be go ahead with the plans if allah does not want it to happen may be the parents will say no and the marriage will not happen and allah knows best Women in Islam Islam Sufism
