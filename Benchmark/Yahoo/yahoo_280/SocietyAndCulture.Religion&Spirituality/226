why do christians always say you're going to hell whenever we do something wrong in their eyes i believe in god i read the bible but i don't go around telling people they're going to hell because of the paths they have taken in their life people make mistakes most learn from experiences they've gone through i'm not trying to dis christians in any way as my family are religious christians i just don't think it's christianlike for them to condemn an individual they know nothing about i always say be nice to everyone you meet for they may be fighting a battle of which you know nothing about what about all the men and women in jail do they not deserve a second chance why is it their way or the highway isn't believing in god enough brent y lol you making assumptions you really know nothing about my personal beliefs on a personal level nice try i think you answered your own question cg smile they may be fighting a battle of which you know nothing about the fact that they are using a fear appeal trying to scare you into believing what they believe is a pretty good indication that they have their own issues with fear if i had to guess in at least some cases the fear they are dealing with is their own fear of hell condemning someone to hell for any behavior fails to recognize a basic value of their religion by grace not by works are you saved and probably indicates that they are still struggling to accept that they can't buy their way into heaven or out of hell through their own actions scary way to live wouldn't you think i'm speaking from some experience here because i watched both my parents struggle for over years with their own fears mom was raised baptist and dad was raised catholic and both had plenty of hellfire and damnation thrown at them from an early age that kind of conditioning is hard to put aside completely i have no doubt that some people will choose not to accept god's invitation to his eternal kingdom but i have no desire nor the ability to manage his guest list or decide what will happen to those that don't accept the invitation yikes i have a hard enough time managing the rsvps for my son's birthday party and i only invited the kids in his kindergarten class i couldn't even begin to keep track of the entire population of my city about million let alone the billion people alive today thanks but no thanks that's god's job and i'll leave it to his expertise Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Hell A Course In Miracles Baptism Religion Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Free will Abrahamic religion Sin Theory of conduct Salvation Roman Catholic Church Predestination Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Simone Weil Baptist Infant baptism Theodicy Resurrection of Jesus Church of Christ Jehovah's Witnesses Justification (theology) Christian eschatology Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Problem of Hell Divine grace Merit Eastern Orthodox Church Heaven Christianity and anti-Semitism Afterlife Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Gospel of Thomas Religious pluralism Abortion debate Sant Thakar Singh Bible and reincarnation Sabbath Humphrey Bogart Soul Christianity Ten Commandments Religious views of suicide The nature of God in Western theology Alan Campbell (pastor) The Pilgrim's Progress Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Human sexual behavior Religious Society of Friends Kain (Legacy of Kain) Capital punishment Supernatural Avenue Q Trinity Fred Phelps Urantia God Emperor of Dune Religious conversion New Testament Homosexuality and Christianity Opus Dei Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Milton H.
