what are your thoughts on roman catholics and roman catholicism and catholics and catholicism in general respectful answers please they are wrong why doesn't that surprised me i have to wonder how many people who say things like that have actually talked to a catholic to find out what we believe and why we believe it or are they just parroting what pastor so and so or some sunday school teacher said about those horrible catholics and catholicism if you're going to bash the church and tell us we're wrong the least you could do is a elaborate and b cite your sources for the information you're putting out there and btw just saying the bible doesn't count we catholics read the bible too our doctrine and sacred traditions come from scripture edit oh how delightful now we're not christians and not saved says who we worship the one living and true god and we believe that the only means of salvation is by accepting christ as our lord and savior it's through the shedding his precious blood as the pure and holy sacrifice that all my sins were forgiven and that would make me not christian and unsaved exactly how again Salvation Sabbath Catholicism Eucharist Roman Catholic Church Baptist Justification (theology) Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Abrahamic religion Church of Christ New Testament Trinity Infant baptism Mass (liturgy) Baptism Ten Commandments Christianity Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Sola fide Religious Society of Friends Eastern Orthodox Church A Course In Miracles Mary, the mother of Jesus Jehovah's Witnesses Paul of Tarsus Great Apostasy Purgatory Sin Lutheranism Prophet Divine grace Mormonism and Christianity Traditionalist Catholic Biblical canon Catechism Martin Luther Book of Isaiah Religion Catholic Book of Mormon Apocrypha Sacrifice Tridentine Mass Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Alan Campbell (pastor) Repentance Perseverance of the saints Theology Christian eschatology Calvinism Confession Temple in Jerusalem Apostles' Creed John Wesley Heresy Church of Christ, Scientist Christian Papal Infallibility Bible Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod Saint Evangelicalism Tetragrammaton Biblical inerrancy Anglicanism Christian and Missionary Alliance Second Vatican Council Philipp Melanchthon John Wycliffe Icon Holy Spirit Indulgence Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses History of the English Bible Liturgical year Creationism Pope Articles of Religion (Methodist) Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Protestantism Immaculate Conception Original sin God Mormonism Bishop Chosen people Evolutionary creationism Gospel Blessed Virgin Mary Religious pluralism Tertullian
