how come every time someone finds an image of what looks like a man's face in wood concrete etc they say it looks like jesus and then sell it on ebay i just saw one on the news and personally i thought it looked nothing like jesus i've seen a few but never anything that looked like what they were claimed to look like how would anyone now know even if something like that looked like a person whether it looked like someone who lived years ago and never was painted or sketched the so called pictures of jesus christ were not painted by people who lived when he did so how could they have known besides god warns against the making of images so why would he make one he hasn't preserved provided the ark of the covenant or noah's ark so why would he produce an image of his son in a knot of wood or anything else faith is the assured expectation of things hoped for the evident demonstration of realities though not beheld heb those who sell such things are obviously doing it for the money that is hardly how god provides for his followers Noah Priesthood (Mormonism) Ark of the Covenant Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Eastern Orthodox Church Book of Mormon Trinity Baptism Idolatry Sola fide Noah's Ark Religion Jesus Genesis Sabbath Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Images of Jesus Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Icon Blacks and Mormonism Salvation End times Biblical inerrancy The Ark (Halo) Religious pluralism Godhead (Mormonism) Book of Isaiah Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Prophet Binitarianism Aramaic of Jesus Urantia Calvinism Noahide Laws John Howard Yoder Linguistics and the Book of Mormon Rich Mullins Perseverance of the saints Abrahamic religion Slow Train Coming Resurrection of Jesus Covenant Theology Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Christianity Names and titles of Jesus Summa Theologiae Saint Peter Deluge (mythology) Creationism Apostle Paul of Tarsus Book of Joshua Joseph Smith, Jr. God Divine grace United Church of Christ Idolatry in Christianity Dispensationalism Endowment (Mormonism) Church of Christ, Scientist Old Testament Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief John the Baptist Holy Spirit Theology Gospel of Thomas L'Arche God the Father Creation science Second Vatican Council Curse and mark of Cain Antichrist Christian eschatology Infant baptism A Course In Miracles Mormonism and Christianity History of the Latter Day Saint movement Biblical archaeology Rosary First Vision Prayer Jehovah's Witnesses Latter Day Saint Opportunity rover Historicity of Jesus Faustyna Kowalska Angel Bah__'__ Faith Religious Society of Friends Supersessionism The Ark in Space Legalism (theology) Religious conversion Charles Grandison Finney Roman Catholic Church Community of Christ
