what is our responsibility regarding truth when a person practices an eternal truth they gain a conviction of its truthfulness these convictions often keep people on the spiritual path that they first chose even though they could remain true to their faith and seek more in addition sometimes i feel tempted to renounce some of the truth i have tasted i know it's good because it has yielded so much spirituality but as i learn to accept other people's spiritual paths this freedom from judgment tempts me to leave my own path and opt for an easier one what is the nature of our responsibility regarding truth what will happen if we opt for the easy way and reject some portions of eternal truth adam's rib many people live by god's laws the same spiritual laws are taught in nearly every religion mrs c thanks for your thoughtful response truth is reality and we find out truth through applying the religious teachings we have learned it becomes real when we practice it so what realities are we missing out on by not practicing those truths that we have not yet encountered cosmicoyote kiss there is a point of no return that point must be crossed ie commitment i must remain true to the truths that i know thank you i mentioned temptation to go the easy path the temptation is there for all of us i am acknowledging that we all take the easy path rather than seeking for the deep conviction that comes through living truth for me living the gospel of jesus christ has brought great joy hevn bd i can see that it has done this for you too we all feel a responsibility to stay true to the truths we already have but what of our responsibility to find more truth god is so big is there ever really an end to learning wow yoda that's deep but i get your message a little have to think on it a bit more truth practiced ie disipline is truth that is understood deeply there is no easy way to increasing the light within only self discipline to remove each little pieces of inner darkness and outer disfunctionality can truly yield a soul full of eternal light and a life of usefulness rejecting the truth is a futile attempt to reject one's self for our soul is the seed of truth and its resulting plant must be nourished or else it will stop growing and not produce fruit actually by seeking the self or knowledge of the self one must along the way reject that which is not true a sculptor carves and rejects that rock which hides the image in his mind sometimes bathing in the sun requires leaving the shadows by searching for the self one shall find god and by searching for god one may find the self what is truth and what is false is all part of god for everything is made by god both truth and untruth both physical and spiritual for the one who made the inside of the cup is the one whom made the outside they are of the same source the two choices lead to two destinies further imprisonment and final release the truth is that everyone has a choice as to whether to choose to control one's self or choose to allow the world circumstances to control one's self certainly those in the kingdom of god are all self controlled the mortal mind is of this world and uncontrolled it can induce many fears leading to false illusion and craziness fear leads to lust and lust to anger and anger to ignorance creativity is stifled by such diversions of the mind learn to clear the mind of fear and concentrate upon creative process to create is to liberate to destroy is to debilitate giving up fear requires the understanding that god knows who he has made and what each and every one of his creations needs what is rightfully yours therefore is yours upon liberation just as the prisoner is given back his belongings after he has served his sentence so in the end liberation will bring justice therefore to remember only one thing can be the catalyst to salvation god is benevolent fear nothing but the illusion lie that god means you harm god is not at all jealous as some have written before the messiah some religions say fear the lord your god this is the illusion fear not the lord for god wants all creations to find maturity for it was written by the son of god the father's kingdom is like a shepherd who had a hundred sheep one of them the largest went astray he left the ninety nine and looked for the one until he found it after he had toiled he said to the sheep 'i love you more than the ninety nine ' fear not the lord then you will have nothing left to fear giving in to false fear is the so called easy way but it is a cosmic joke like robin hood calling his ft tall companion little john fear leads to suffering what is easy about that jesus said whoever is near me is near the fire and whoever is far from me is far from the father's kingdom by illusion of fear the fire may look like the hard option yet having chosen the dull glow then one finds out what the hard option entails from fear is born ignorance darkness and from fire emanates light just as the sun shines and emanates rays stand in the rays of 'the son' and renounce your fears when you renounce your fears the pottery jar that is your body mind will become like glass so that the light that shines within can light the way for you and for others jesus said there is light within a person of light and it shines on the whole world if it does not shine it is dark after all no one lights a lamp and puts it under a basket nor does one put it in a hidden place rather one puts it on a lamp stand so that all who come and go will see its light S__ren Kierkegaard Origin belief
