if you were to die today would you goto heaven how do you know you would go to heaven what gets you in to heaven is it by being a good person or by doing good deeds or is there somthing more a person must do to go to heaven you tell me o k suppose you did die and you were standing before god and he said why should i let you into my heaven what would you say i am a born again christian and i have the full assurance that i am going to heaven my faith is in god the father who sent his son jesus to die for my sins i was purchased by god the father with the blood of his son jesus if you would like to know how to have a relationship with jesus call needhim god bless you all a lot of people can't be as sure as they say they are even if you go to church every sunday you listen to the christian radio stations you go to church on the extra days etc you still haven't got your ticket in your pocket you have to really have the faith even the nicest person might go to hell believe in jesus christ as your savior stay faithful to him repent all your sins really read the bible and of course go to church of course there's more but i'm not a pastor so i'm no expert you should go ask your church's pastor this question the only true way to heaven is through jesus this is one of my favorite verses it also explains that ephesians for it is by grace you have been saved through faith and this not from yourselves it is the gift of god not by works so that no one can boast for we are god's workmanship created in christ jesus to do good works which god prepared in advance for us to do i hope this helps a little but like i said you should consult a pastor and of course the bible Salvation Justification (theology) Baptism Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Book of Mormon Divine grace Heaven Sin Trinity Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Holy Spirit Church of Christ Abrahamic religion Dispensationalism Church of Christ, Scientist Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Mormonism and Christianity Merit Roman Catholic Church Catholicism Lutheranism Calvinism Priesthood (Mormonism) Christian eschatology Indulgence Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Christianity Mass (liturgy) Apostles' Creed Mormonism Binitarianism Ten Commandments Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Paul of Tarsus Articles of Religion (Methodist) Predestination Eucharist Purgatory Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology New Testament Original sin Mary, the mother of Jesus A Course In Miracles Resurrection of Jesus Christian views of Jesus Alan Campbell (pastor) Great Apostasy Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Soul John Howard Yoder Seventh-day Adventist Church Jesus Nontrinitarianism Catechism Jehovah's Witnesses John Wesley Repentance Five points of Calvinism Urantia The Pilgrim's Progress Opus Dei Christian and Missionary Alliance Sabbath Epistle to the Romans Religious pluralism Summa Theologiae Authorship of the Pauline epistles Athanasian Creed Gospel of Thomas Christian Antinomianism Mortification of the flesh Justin Martyr Devil Harrowing of Hell Aramaic of Jesus Theosis Epistle to the Ephesians Genesis Perseverance of the saints Herbert W.
