put you money where you mouth is so many of you who are enlightened have stated time and again how many times evolution has been proven while at the same time claiming as well there is no proof at all for what the bible claims as historical events as historical figures and as for what the bible claims as truth three different times i have asked for just clear undeniable example that shows one level of species evolving to the next i have been shown models computer projections drawing of what some one thinks but as of yet not one single direct line are you telling me you believe something with so much passion that does not have one leg to stand on show me if you can because i don t think you can i think you have foolishly bought into the whole ideal without one bit of thought you can rant and rave act like a complete fool but if you can not show me a link that shows a clear connection don t waist you time i don t want someone else s ideals i don't want to hear about scientific method i want proof or nothing so if you believe it back it up mock the bible mock my spelling if that makes you feel more confident back it up or quite lying and stating it has been proved just because you and some misguided scientist want to believe it is fact does not make it fact as i figured more dead links show me a link that has a fish with feet a monkey with gills somthing people all of the examples that are given here as evidence for evolution are all examples of micro evolution no one is arguing micro evolution also known as adaptations or mutations creationists don't even argue that what we do have a problem with is the concept of macro evolution changing from one kind to another i e from a monkey to a human from a reptile to a bird etc this has not been observed and cannot be proven the problem that i have with evolution teaching is the way that it is being taught in our schools the kids are told boys and girls we all know that fruit flies change from generation to generation that must mean that you came from monkeys what kind of reasoning is that the kids are given examples of micro evolution and these examples are used to prove macro evolution if you want to prove macro evolution give us some examples of macro evolution believing that macro evolution is fact is the same as believing in a god you cannot see it's religious if you want to keep religion out of schools stop teaching kids that they came from monkeys Intelligent design Creationism Determinism Creation science Supernatural Religion Macroevolution Young Earth creationism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Species Creation-evolution controversy Science Atheism Scopes Trial Evolutionism Meaning of life Teach the Controversy The Origin of Species Evolutionary creationism Evolution Existence of God Sociocultural evolution Franz Boas Age of Enlightenment Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Origin belief Biblical inerrancy Evidence of evolution Phillip E.
