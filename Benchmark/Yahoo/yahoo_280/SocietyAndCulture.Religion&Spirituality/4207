are god and christianity overrated why do some people go around talking about god this and that as if god controls their everday life realistically we have free will and god is not going to interfere in everyday life look if you stand in front of a moving train god is not going to save you i don't see god saving lives or preventing disasters such as car accidents soldiers being killed in iraq dang prez bush or natural disasters this tells me that we must rely on ourselves as much as possible science is important because that is how we develop technology and medical treatments god may have created us but we must do for ourselves as much as possible well you've made a lot of assumptions here while i do believe that god does not force folks into his will or worship him that does not mean that for those that do are not in his hands by choice and that he doesn't intervene in their lives i can attest to that in my own life for all the atrocities around the world throughout time there is one constant rebellion if you choose destruction your life will self destruct you're right things happen and we can't be stupid like standing in front of a train but that again does not that god doesn't step in and excercise mercy and often the bible tells us that with our getting to get wisdom it is good to learn science isn't a bad thing on it's own it's when people assume they have gotten so intelligent that they know it all and can prove there is no god or creation that there is danger how many generations of scientists have thought such things that this that and have 'evidence' to prove it only to find out generations later it was completely wrong the way it was presented who said there wasn't a bang when god created the world these things don't disprove god we are all still on a journey but you know what i've seen in my meager years thus far that things that were sworn off decades ago are now being re evaluated and found to reflect the perception many christians had all along while folks said they were stupid the reverence of god is the beginning of wisdom knowledge and understanding without that the words out someone's mouth and their evidence are questionable at best no one can really say that in the future half this stuff won't be proven completely mistaken but those who seek god see that reguardless of how things are god still has power over it all Theodicy Meaning of life Intelligent design Creationism Theory of conduct Predestination Religion God Scientific method Existence of God The nature of God in Western theology Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Origin belief Agnosticism Trinity Teleological argument Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Phillip E.
