if being gay is due to neurology in some people how does that fit into the bible teachings i believed at one time that homosexuality was abnormal some sort of mistake because of what i was learning in college the purpose of sex being to perpetuate the species makes homosexuality evolutionarily redundant however twenty years on plus i recant there are so many homosexuals in society and have been through out history that this surely can't be a mistake of evolution they have their place in the evolution of the human species but what their functions is i don't know now as far as the bible goes parts of it may be inspired by god but it was written by men these came from a patriarchal society a tribe that wandered around fighting other tribes and getting oppressed in the various lands they settled in i think there is a lot of influences coming from the semitic culture in the bible there is a lot that is already recognised as inappropriate to this culture and time and no longer adhered to i think this will happen with the issue of homosexuality i hope anyway god would never condemn a good person no matter what their sexual preferences were Homosexuality and Christianity Sexual orientation Religion and sexuality Human sexual behavior Homosexuality and Bah__'__ Faith Human Religion and sexual orientation Gender role Bisexuality Homosexuality in China Rape Biology and sexual orientation Creationism Church of Christ Gay Homosexuality Rick Santorum New Testament Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Creation-evolution controversy Religion Heterosexuality Christianity Abraham Evil Anglican views of homosexuality Roman Catholic Church Free will History of Christianity and homosexuality Idolatry Lot (Biblical) Original sin Marriage Human sexuality Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Intelligent design Evolution Jehovah's Witnesses Rastafari movement Bible Homosexuality and Judaism History of Christianity Sexual intercourse Physical attractiveness Transgender Book of Mormon Eastern Orthodox Church Gay rights Predestination Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Sodom and Gomorrah Zoophilia Soul Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Charles Darwin Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Genesis Transsexuality The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Baptist Culture Coming out Abrahamic religion Fundamentalism Pedophilia Jews as a chosen people History of ancient Israel and Judah Lawrence v.
