how does judaism feel about jesus in judaism is jesus christ believed to be the son of god and that he died on the cross for our sins jesus is the messiah do they believe this too i'm curious on christianity vs judaism what is so different and the same i thought that christianity was based from judaism am i wrong or right thanks in advance why we don't believe jesus is the messiah the dead were not resurrected the jews did not beome priests to the other nations there is no world peace the temple is not standing there is no temple service there is no parah adumah or its ashes to render us tahor the messiah is from the house of david your house tribe is inherited from your father your father is your biological father there is no adoption in judaisim to another father if god is the father of jesus then jesus cannot be from the house of david as god is not frm the house of david human sacrifice is completely forbidden in judaism remeber god stopping the sacrifice of isaac the idea of a human being sacrificed is the opposite of anything from judaism you have to atone for yourself an essential part of the atonement process is being repentant someone cannot be repentant for you you have to do it for yourself only communal sins can be forgiven communally not individual private sins and no the messiah does not proclaim himself he will be recognised by his deeds not by his claims in other words through doing the above he will be recognised as the messiah on top of that mashiach is a human being with human parents the idea of an anthropomorphised god going around and impregnating young woman is completely alien to judaism though it fits very nicely into the pagan religions of the time which had their heroes being fathered by gods ala hercules and his daddy zeus note on messianic judaism jews for jesus both of these are deemed as nothing more than christian sects using deceitful means to convert jews every jewish denomination denounces these sects as christians and nothing more however by jewish law once a jew always jew whether born or converted thus once a person is jewish they are always judged by jewish standards and if they revert convert to a different religion they are still considered jewish by jewish law but someone practising a religion other than judaism is considered outside of the community may not be a member of the community receive any community honours be a representative for the community be buried in a jewish cemetary marry a jew or be treated as a jew for the purposes of the laws of mourning however since they never stop being a jew they merely have to repent return to judaism and go to mikveh in order to once again be a full member of the community differences between judaism and christianity the belief that god would physically manifest to produce a child is the opposite of jewish belief the belief that god is made up of different beings is the opposite of jewish belief in the single undivided nature of god the belief that any being could set itself up in opposition to god i e the devil is the opposite of jewish belief in which god is the sole and only authority and author of events in the world the idea of eternal damnation for people who err hell is the opposite of jewish belief in which god is loving and always forgives the idea that god would ever cancel his covenant after explicitly stating it was eternal and thus turning god into a liar is the opposite of jewish belief the idea that god could ever make a mistake i e that the law he gave was too difficult to follow and was thus replaced with the sacrifice of his son is the opposite of the jewish belief that god is perfect and never makes mistakes the idea that god can make mistakes is also the opposite of the jewish belief that god is eternal and across all of time god is god was god will be and thus knows rthe consequences of every action and can thus never makes mistakes or not know the results of something he does Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Kohen Halakha Heaven Great Apostasy Reform Judaism Christian Noahide Laws Evil Satanism Anti-Semitism Atheism Chabad Lubavitch Christ Unification Church Islam Church of Christ God and gender Apostasy Jehovah's Witnesses Priest Miracle Religion and sexuality Urantia
