atheists how can you be so sure that god doesn't exist im not very religious at all though i do have faith but i need to know what makes you so sure that god doesnt exist sure we could get into the stupid argument that technically since you cant show physical evidence either way it cant proven for the pro or the negative so are why be so closed minded about it because i can accept the fact that there is a possibility that god doesnt exist can you do the opposite can you try to accept the fact that god could exist has anybody ever cinsidered the fact that science might just be a way of proving how god did the things he did maybe god created evolution ever thought of that i agree that the god portrayed in the bible is an unjust one thats why i dont read the bible i find it absolutely hilarious that people feel like im trying to prove something i was simply asking a question gosh religon is a hot topic to talk about on y and by the way i have absolute faith in the purple people eaters i honestly think that god might have set things in motion and thats it i dont believe in the fact that if you dont go to church every sunday you go to hell because obviously if god was that selfish then i wouldnt want to be around him i do believe that there is no way this all came together by coincedance that seems so far fetched and the fact there must be something after death i mean gosh wouldnt that suck if there was nothing after death i'd be pissed they can't no evidence but neither can you stalemate Atheism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism The nature of God in Western theology God Existence of God Religion Evolutionary creationism Creationism Supernatural Theory of conduct Urantia Falsifiability Presuppositional apologetics Phillip E.
