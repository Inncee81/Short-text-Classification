how have you shown courage in declaring god's word to others both the good and the bad news i wouldn't go so far as to say i have shown any kind of courage through words i attempt to declare my faith more through my actions i attempt to show love and compassion when people need it and when people are being jerks i call them on it i also try to keep in mind how my actions will affect people if my words or actions would cause people to curse god i don't do it i don't mind if people curse me but my words or actions should never ever reflect poorly on god i believe that the job of the believer is to help bring unbelievers to god not drive them away so in short if people are not touched by my actions and behavior if they don't feel god's love or respect through what i do there is very little point in declaring my religion as my words would be empty james Ten Commandments Theodicy Sola fide The nature of God in Western theology Evil Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Sin Sabbath Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Justification (theology) Religion Love Patriotism Nicomachean Ethics Alignment (role-playing games) Religious Society of Friends Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Simone Weil Goodness and value theory Salvation Magic (paranormal) David Hume The Catcher in the Rye Prophet Christianity and anti-Semitism John Howard Yoder Hinduism Religious pluralism Jehovah's Witnesses Blacks and Mormonism Curse Magical thinking Trinity Sant Thakar Singh Muslim ibn Aqeel Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Witchcraft Original sin Christian-Jewish reconciliation Separation of church and state in the United States Christian anarchism A Course In Miracles Fiddler on the Roof Humphrey Bogart Five points of Calvinism Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Summa Theologiae Rich Mullins Royal Assent Religious perspectives on Jesus Holy Spirit God Emperor of Dune Jewish principles of faith Yoga Sutras of Patanjali S__ren Kierkegaard Biblical canon Human nature Roman Catholic Church Scientology beliefs and practices Friedrich Schleiermacher Swami Vivekananda Age of Enlightenment Supernatural Predestination Saint Eucharist Pashtunwali Shinto Gospel of Thomas Francis Hutcheson (philosopher) Chosen people Revelation Michel Henry Religious conversion Nihilism Presuppositional apologetics Consciousness Faith in Buddhism Idolatry God Subud Bah__'u'll__h Infant baptism Confucius Buddhism Hell Poker jargon Vishnu sahasranama Fundamentalism Devil Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Time Out of Mind Perseverance of the saints Resurrection of Jesus Karma in Hinduism Atheism Philosophy of religion Slow Train Coming Macbeth
