how do you convince the church that it is in their best interests to stay out of the affairs of state i advocate the seperation of church state as loud as i can yet many of my peers seem to think that god's will for our civic leaders is not good enough and man's intervention is required how do we as members of the body of christ convince others that we need to matthew but seek first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things will be added to you therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow for tomorrow will be anxious for itself sufficient for the day is its own trouble i think it is neat that you want to keep church and state separate actually it is more than neat in today's current climate from an evangelical standpoint it is downright brave too many churches have hooked their carriages up to the republican party and look where the horse led god should come before politics and i say that as a very passionately opinionated person with deep political opinions of my own when we say that a politician speaks for god we are setting ourselves up for disaster maintaining a separation between church and state helps us more easily resist becoming victims of tyrannical leaders who justify themselves by saying god is on their side hope that makes sense peace to you Dispensationalism Sola fide Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Separation of church and state Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Christian and Missionary Alliance Christian eschatology Salvation Justification (theology) Evangelicalism Protestantism Eucharist John Wycliffe Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Eastern Orthodox Church John Wesley Sacrifice Pacifism Baptist Dominionism John Howard Yoder Leviathan (book) Christianity Perseverance of the saints Acts of the Apostles Salvation Army Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Religious Society of Friends Book of Isaiah United Methodist Church Theodicy Politics of the United States Baptism Trinity Original sin Charles Grandison Finney President of the Church (Mormonism) Soul Methodism Roman Catholic Church Alan Campbell (pastor) United States religious history Homosexuality and Christianity Unification Church Irish Republicanism Free will Christianity and anti-Semitism Church of Christ, Scientist Community of Christ Christian A Course In Miracles Democratic Party (United States) Intelligent design movement Christian right Succession crisis (Mormonism) End times Merit Abortion debate Assassination Restorationism House of Lords Monarchy in Canada Herbert W.
