if there was a world wide flood how did life continue think about it it supposedly rained for forty days and forty nights the world was underwater for about a year even if there was an arc that could hold all of the animals that needed to be held plus a years worth of rations and partitions to keep carnivores from killing other animals the flood would've killed all non aquatic plant life in short there would be nothing for the herbivores to eat also as there are some animals that are carnivores lions tigers bears etc they would need to kill other animals to survive as there were only two of each animal of each animal used in sacrifice and as carnivores would need to eat daily they would wipe out many herbivores and eventually each other how did plant life survive how did the animals not kill each other in the time immediately after the flood please no jargon about how i am an evil atheist and no attacks on science or evolution as i didn't mention science or evolution please stay on topic people if such a worldwide flood really happened it would result in a mass extinction very few organisms would survive just the fact that the planets is now teeming with life is proof against such a flood Ecology Dinosaur Brown Bear Carnivore Noah's Ark Carnivorous plant Deluge (mythology) Paleocene Narnia Trophic level Tiger Biodiversity Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Young Earth creationism Fauna of Australia Lion Domestication Flood geology Afterlife Tasmanian Devil Gray Wolf Earth Digimon Water Europe Holocene extinction event Extinction Triassic Orca The Legend of Zelda series races Permian-Triassic extinction event The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Livestock Botany Vegetarianism Kangaroo Biology Evidence of evolution Creationism Therapsida Tyrannosaurus rex Answers in Genesis Religion Supergirl Whale Pliocene Guns, Germs, and Steel Animal Cat Atheism History of creationism Doctor Eggman Biosphere Bladderwort Cheetah Bah__'__ Faith and Science Bob and George V.F.D.
