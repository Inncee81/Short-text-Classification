would anyone else like to become a spiritual vitalist i mean it's no fun being the only one in existence you know nobody will give me donations or anything we i believe that there were never any gods or deities but that consciousness existed before physical existence and then fused with molecules in order to order amino acids into ribonucleicacid through using gravitational waves it's like science with a scientific spin to fill in the gaps of our knowledge any make everyone lok a hell of a lot better ya know so who wants to join what no one that makes me a sad panda so consciousness is a further fundamental force in the universe along with gravity electromagnetism and the strong weak forces but is more primary than any of those or is consciousness a sort of overseer driver of those physical forces you say that consciousness existed before physical existence do you mean by physical existence any physical existence at all or the physical existence of life if the former then where did the molecules which consciousness fused with come from interesting idea being an agnostic i'm not inclined to believe but i like the theory i think that it's completely credible i do have a question for you if consciousness could order amino acids into ribonucleic acid through gravitational waves in those times then why can our consciousness not do the same thing now for example why can i not direct gravitational waves with my mind now or maybe i can do but just don't realise it d another question was the consciousness which existed before physical existence divided into many individual consciousnesses as it is now or was it merged into one whole Gravitational radiation Gravity Francis Crick Physics Religion Supernatural Consciousness Meaning of life Scientific method Soul Quantum mechanics Quantum mind Nuclear fusion Origin belief General relativity Cell (biology) Existence of God Biochemistry Modernism Fermi paradox Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Atheism Agnosticism History of science Mass Black hole Intelligent design Planck units Age of Enlightenment Causality Theory of everything Metaphysics Immortality Sri Aurobindo Strong atheism God Cosmology Standard Model Urantia Ecology Graviton Determinism Electromagnetism Force Human Time travel Artificial consciousness Classical mechanics New Age Falsifiability Existentialism Roger Penrose Tests of general relativity Aristotle Luminiferous aether Anthroposophy Rudolf Steiner Evolution The nature of God in Western theology Energy Moon String theory Photon Speed of light Physical science Creationism Unified field theory Isaac Newton Dualism (philosophy of mind) Bah__'__ Faith and Science Particle physics Alcoholics Anonymous Albert Einstein Magic (paranormal) Light Human nature Theosophy Reincarnation Magnet Philosophy of perception Magnetism Anti-gravity Unconscious mind Unidentified flying object Mind Multiverse Sun Elementary particle
