if i create something am i allowed to destroy it excerpt from an answer on a previous question suppose you created a beautiful masterpiece work of art what if you decided to destroy it you created it you have every right he was using that as an analogy to explain why god has the right to kill humans his creations does that right extend to human beings are they allowed to destroy what they create anything they create john whoever you the law society in general god etc biblegracespirit so i can destroy something that i conjured out of thin air then i can destroy my creations annie oakley that didn't actually answer my question read the bible doesn't tell me how you personally would answer this question by the by thank you so much for threatening me with malicious reporting when i emailed you and asked you not to respond unless you're actually going to answer the question asked it's attitudes like that that make christianity seem all the more appealing yachadhoo et al if you want to interpret create so strictly perhaps you should interpret destroy the same way to the best of my knowledge people are not capable of causing physical matter to un exist though we can convert some of it into energy besides that i believe i can create ideas if i can't then there's no such thing as free will is there i can create order within physical things while i may not be able to cause materials to leap into existence i can create structures from within among them i think the real question is just because you do something does that give you the right to undo it if you paint a masterpiece are you allowed to reduce it to component pieces ashes poster sized reproductions my answer is so long as nobody else has a stake in the matter yes if you make a bowl and decide you don't like it go ahead and smash it no problem but if you've made a house that someone else owns you don't just get to knock it down you have to buy it back first and if mark is true then there are some things that belong to humans it would be uncivil for god to destroy them without at least asking first Origin belief Meaning of life Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Supernatural Theory of conduct Free will God The nature of God in Western theology Predestination Creation-evolution controversy Religion Intelligent design Creationism Determinism Theodicy Atomism God Emperor of Dune Biblical inerrancy Causality Simone Weil Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Resurrection of Jesus Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an A Course In Miracles The Amber Spyglass Atheism Human Plame affair Deconstruction David Hume History of creationism Ontological argument Flood geology Expert system Eastern Orthodox Church Trinity Carlos Castaneda Charles Darwin's views on religion Philosophy Afterlife Transcendental argument for the existence of God Judaism Phaedo Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Socrates Public domain Philosophical Investigations Immanuel Kant Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Rudolf Hermann Lotze Current teachings of Prem Rawat Science Soul Dualism (philosophy of mind) Abortion debate Creation science Scientology beliefs and practices Discordianism Fundamentalism Devil Consciousness Ten Commandments Infant baptism Sant Thakar Singh John Wycliffe Reincarnation Immortality Omnipotence Noah's Ark Justification (theology) Evil Same-sex marriage in Canada Adam and Eve Ethics Angel Jan Hus Summa Theologiae The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Modern geocentrism Eugenics Prayer Piccolo Junior Saga Islamic philosophy Divine Providence Philo The Subtle Knife The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Answers in Genesis Goodness and value theory Paul of Tarsus Capital punishment Modernism
