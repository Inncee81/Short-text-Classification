how are you willing to help the youth of america to have hope and find jesus that is an awesome question i actually work in a church nursery and teach year olds who jesus is i also teach my own kids who are and almost that they have a brother with jesus and that jesus is with them all the time even when they do something wrong i would like to help older children understand it but just haven't had the opportunity to do so i have notice in some of the older children they need to learn how to pray even if they are believers and they need to learn to listen to god because they are most likely on a path that was not meant for them i'm glad to see someone else is concerned with this because the signs are there and the youth needs to recognize trouble and have hope and faith Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Sola fide A Course In Miracles Salvation Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Church of Christ Justification (theology) New Testament John Howard Yoder Roman Catholic Church Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Mary, the mother of Jesus Christianity Religious Society of Friends Book of Mormon Abrahamic religion Catechism Religious pluralism Community of Christ Book of Isaiah Nation of Islam Nontrinitarianism Baptism Christian eschatology Blood atonement Paul of Tarsus Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Opus Dei Eastern Orthodox Church New Testament view on Jesus' life Adam-God theory Infant baptism Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Godhead (Mormonism) Gospel of Thomas Trinity Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Prophet Prayer Temple (Mormonism) Charles Grandison Finney Biblical canon Church of Christ, Scientist Ten Commandments Chosen people God Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Christian-Jewish reconciliation John the Baptist Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Religious conversion Epistle of James Priesthood (Mormonism) Protestantism Christadelphians Sola scriptura Dispensationalism Mormonism and Christianity Sabbath Gospel of John Pope Benedict XVI Binitarianism Soul Horus Jewish Messiah Theology Sin Creationism Pentecostalism Meaning of life Supersessionism Religion George Fox Pledge of Allegiance Great Apostasy Mormonism Christian Papal Infallibility Baptist Evangelicalism Filioque clause Covenant Theology Divine grace God and gender Atheism Original sin Names and titles of Jesus Godspell Sermon on the Mount Saint Biblical inerrancy Eusebius of Caesarea First Vision Urantia Council of Jerusalem Holy Spirit 2004 Democratic National Convention Unification Church
