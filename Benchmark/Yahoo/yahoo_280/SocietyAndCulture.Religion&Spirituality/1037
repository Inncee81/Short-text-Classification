what are you plagued by most of all in this life how about the origins of the universe that there could be something from nothing or something always there does that gnaw away at you it does for me certainly i am plagued by christianity i was born into a dysfunctional family and my parents were outrageously ignorant pentecostal fundamentalists dad used to beat me regularly to teach me proper respect for his and for god's authority mom was a hallucinating schizophrenic who divided her time between church and the state mental hospital i began to think of myself as an atheist at nine and came out of the closet at twelve i ran away from home to avoid being forced to attend church and asked the juvenile authorities for protection from my parents and their church which i received in high school i was beaten up four times by gangs of christian boys because gossiping girls spread the word that i was an atheist as an adult i've lost two good jobs thanks to employee gossip because the share holders won't like paying the salary of a known atheist no matter how good a job he does the thing that gets to me is that christians think my atheism is a matter of choice nothing could be further from the truth once i realized man created god there was simply no way to deny that god is a fabrication of our bronze age ancestors as i see it now solipsistic thinkers have no choice but to believe god is obvious if you imagine your subjective experience is reality unfortunately i have never been a solipsist i can't help it i seem to have been born knowing that the physical realm is actually real and that my subjective experience is a construction of my mind based on limited information from my five senses about the state of physical reality it is also a fact that prayer meditation and hypnosis simply do not work for me all i've ever felt is acute embarrassment during countless attempts to pray meditation doesn't do anything at all that i can tell and hypnosis seems a total waste of two people's time it's not that i'm being stubborn or reluctant i'm more than willing but after more than fifty years of failure i am now quite skeptical about prayer and such after more that fifty years of atheism i have come to realize that while religion apparently does bring those who believe some comfort on the whole it is a disaster for humanity any objective survey of history reveals that religion always fails to provide a stable foundation for human civilization and generally does far more harm than good i suspect because religion falsely equates subjective experience with reality it prevents otherwise good people from realizing the fundamental errors in their own thinking religion has become a device naively used to deceive one's own better judgement and justify immoral behavior toward fellow human beings that something so obviously evil should be so well thought of by most of my fellow human beings gnaws away at me almost constantly what plagues me is why can't other people see what is so obvious to me God Theodicy Supernatural Existence of God Simone Weil A Course In Miracles Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Reality Fundamentalism The nature of God in Western theology Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Friedrich Schleiermacher Evil Separation of church and state Original sin Evolutionary creationism Buddhism Narcissism Idolatry Church of Christ, Scientist Abortion debate Soul S__ren Kierkegaard Urantia Eastern Orthodox Church Francis Crick Deconstruction Neuro-linguistic programming Agnosticism Moral objectivism Immortality Ontological argument Satanism Ten Commandments God and gender Summa Theologiae Goodness and value theory New Age Creationism Milton H.
