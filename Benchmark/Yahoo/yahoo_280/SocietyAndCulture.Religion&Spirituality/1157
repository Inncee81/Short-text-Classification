any pastors preists i have always wondered why a pastor preist would marry a person who has been divorced and his her ex is still alive since in the bible it says that anyone who remarries when the ex is still alive would be committing adultry and since we are not supposed to do anything to cause someone to sin why would they do it they have a choice do what the bible say s or not some of them do whatever they want to regardless Eastern Orthodox Church Baptist Clergy Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Church of Christ Homosexuality and Christianity Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Sin Paul of Tarsus Opus Dei Hell Confession Matthew 5:32 S__ren Kierkegaard Fred Phelps Religion and sexuality Ethics in the Bible Alan Campbell (pastor) Evil Marriage Jehovah's Witnesses Polygamy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Worldwide Church of God New Testament Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Martin Luther Seventh-day Adventist Church Animal husbandry Catholicism Charles Taze Russell Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Predestination Jennifer Lopez Deacon Reinhold Niebuhr Jewish view of marriage Original sin Infant baptism Justification (theology) Calvinism Clerical celibacy Religious Society of Friends Rule against perpetuities Christian Identity Divorce Pastoral Epistles Problem of Hell United Pentecostal Church American Pastoral Capital punishment Reincarnation Reformed Baptist Anglican views of homosexuality Brigham Young Christadelphians Organizational structure of Jehovah's Witnesses Abrahamic religion Charles Grandison Finney Pandeism Lutheranism Noah John Wesley Rudolph Valentino Puritan Resurrection of Jesus Aimee Semple McPherson 613 mitzvot Authorship of the Pauline epistles Book of Revelation Sin City Soul Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod Mennonite Book of Mormon The Way International Aiden Wilson Tozer Theodore of Mopsuestia Christianity Roman Catholic Church Antinomianism Italian literature Genealogy Layman's Home Missionary Movement Paul S.
