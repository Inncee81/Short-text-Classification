so how many people here believe in evolution and then consider this christians say only of the usa is atheist i've never been asked so how can they say that if it is only then why is it taught in school if is the majority then is backwards forwards is up down is falling flying i would like to be surveyed before i see things like this how old is this survey of the public believes that humans only use of their brain's potential that doesn't mean it's true and it isn't you use of your brain of the public believes that humans are water that doesn't mean it's true it's actually around from what i've seen a lot of people can't even point out north korea on a world map does that mean that geography isn't true what i'm getting at is that just because the majority of the public aren't adequately educated to understand some things it doesn't mean that they aren't true or valid look at global warming for example a large percentage of the western world have been convinced that it's a political farce and doesn't exist despite the evidence does that mean they're right or that they just don't accept know the reality behind it again public consensus doesn't determine what is true Atheism Religion Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Soul Creationism Teach the Controversy Theory of conduct Phillip E.
