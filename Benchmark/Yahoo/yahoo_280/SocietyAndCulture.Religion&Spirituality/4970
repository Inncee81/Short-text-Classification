do you know what i want to do tonight i want to question science well acctualy i did that already one person answered that there was something wrong with me for questioning science well i happen to think questioning science is a productive thing how do you feel about it you know the book darwin's black box it has some good criticism to science and a few years after its release all of the examples of irreductible complexity in the book have been solved that would'nt have happened if behe hadnt written the book we'd all be living our lives without a clue of how the coagulation cascade evolved paz de cristo amiguinhos i think its good to question science but i dont see the point in questioning what has already been explained for the sake of arguing that some god did it and science is wrong in my opinion one cant call atheists non believers silly for believing in evolution or any other idea and at the same time believe that someone can part the sea or walk on water not that you said that but others have good question though and for science to move ahead and answer more questions it has to be questioned itself Intelligent design Irreducible complexity Creation-evolution controversy History of creationism Michael Behe William A.
