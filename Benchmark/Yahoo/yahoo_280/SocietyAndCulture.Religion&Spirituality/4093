do you believe that repentance means to stop sinning if that is the case then why does the bible say that god repented what sin did he have to stop we must take the definitions of words from scripture to fully understand what they mean repentance means to change ones mind it has nothing at all do to with stopping sinning since we are in these bodies the presence of sin will always be with us but because we have a new identity and are in christ the law of sin and death has no power over us we are set free from the power and penalty of sin but from its presence no not until we get our new bodies so be sure you know the biblical definition of a term before you parrot what your pastor tells ya hint more often than not your pastor is wrong gasp study for yourself and dont let someone else spoon feed you god changed his mind and decided not to kill everyone god is god it is his perogative to change his mind and he exercises it regularly in scripture his character never changes but his methods of dealing with mankind have changed radically over history if this wasnt the case then you would be building an ark or sacrificing animals or entering into a marriage contract with him and you arent and has anyone here stopped sinning we learn to sin less but until we get our new bodies no one is sinless this side of heaven we can't stop sinning for if we claimed we did then the bible says we're liars repenting according to jesus was changing the mind from unbelief to belief unbelief in the gospel to belief in the gospel that is repentance and i agree so many tons of pastors are wrong but people don't like to think for themselves they want to be spoonfed Salvation Sin Baptism Church of Christ Abrahamic religion Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Repentance Original sin A Course In Miracles Christianity Divine grace Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Lutheranism Charles Grandison Finney John the Baptist Book of Mormon Mormonism Resurrection of Jesus Roman Catholic Church Prophet Purgatory Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod Jesus Legalism (theology) Church of Christ, Scientist Evil Ten Commandments Biblical inerrancy Religion Baptist Calvinism Sola fide God Alan Campbell (pastor) Eucharist Articles of Religion (Methodist) Jehovah's Witnesses Hell Mary, the mother of Jesus Dispensationalism Sabbath Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Old Testament Gospel of Thomas New Testament Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Noah Martin Luther Immaculate Conception John Wesley Confession Theology Catholicism Charles Taze Russell Evangelicalism John Wycliffe Capital punishment Great Apostasy Creationism Christian Reconstructionism Summa Theologiae Religious conversion Catechism Soul Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Blacks and Mormonism Mormonism and Christianity Excommunication Heresy Priesthood (Mormonism) Halakha Christadelphians New Testament view on Jesus' life Trinity Homosexuality and Christianity Revelation Holy Spirit Religious Society of Friends Prevenient grace Traditionalist Catholic Christian Religious perspectives on Jesus Justin Martyr Predestination Genesis Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Infant baptism Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Pharisees Latter Day Saint Christian apologetics Jewish principles of faith
