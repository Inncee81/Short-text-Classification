does anyone else have this view i was thinking about this and came to this conclusion in religion we have free will while at the same time having a set course yeah i know confusing and then it occured to me we may have a set course but we can choose which courses to take in our many choices if we make one decision then the path is already set until we come to the next decision for example you can choose to either steal or not steal if you steal the time from point a to point b is set and will stay that way until you have to make another decision even small ones does anyone else think of it like this i agree with what you are saying it seems to me that we all have the freewill to make choices but once we do that and take actions based on our decisions then we have an effect of some sort on our world once the action is taken there is no going back you can only make your next best decision from that point on Free will Decision making Theodicy Ethics Theory of conduct Predestination Microeconomics Expert system Abortion debate Supply and demand Poker jargon Extensive form game Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Satanism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Determinism Economics Prisoner's dilemma Consensus decision-making Value system War Libertarianism Paradox Moral objectivism Non-aggression principle The nature of God in Western theology Appeal Anarchism and society Externality Ra (board game) Exit counseling Consciousness Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Newcomb's paradox Scientology beliefs and practices Opportunity cost Utilitarianism Intellectual property Special relativity Kohlberg's stages of moral development Alcoholics Anonymous Human nature Counter-Strike Separation of church and state Economic anthropology Liberalism Probability Presidential system Social justice Coercion Reality Action (physics) She Loves You The Amber Spyglass Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe Quicksort French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Groupoid Mouse (computing) Essence of Decision World War I Football (soccer) Information Services Procurement Library Game theory Computer role-playing game Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Partial-birth abortion Divine grace Religious conversion Golden Sun The Skeptical Environmentalist The Apprentice 2 MapleStory Socrates American football strategy Religious pluralism EverQuest II Paul Feyerabend Bell's theorem Democracy 3-sphere Bhakti Existentialism Utility cycling Categorical imperative Infant baptism Manifold Ecco the Dolphin Original sin Separation of church and state in the United States A-level Tag United Nations Security Council Labour economics Fighting Fantasy Game Books Libertarian socialism Anthroposophy Green Day Simone Weil 2004 Republican National Convention
