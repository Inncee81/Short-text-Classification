is there life after death do all people go to heaven that would depend if you are a true believer and follower of jesus christ john jesus answered i am the way and the truth and the life no one comes to the father except through me deuteronomy walk in all the way that the lord your god has commanded you so that you may live and prosper and prolong your days in the land that you will possess john for god did not send his son into the world to condemn the world but to save the world through him john when he heard this jesus said this sickness will not end in death no it is for god's glory so that god's son may be glorified through it romans and who through the spirit of holiness was declared with power to be the son of god by his resurrection from the dead jesus christ our lord romans for if when we were god's enemies we were reconciled to him through the death of his son how much more having been reconciled shall we be saved through his life galatians sons of god niv you are all sons of god through faith in christ jesus for all of you who were baptized into christ have clothed yourselves with christ there is neither jew nor greek slave nor free male nor female for you are all one in christ jesus if you belong to christ then you are abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise hebrews the son superior to angels niv in the past god spoke to our forefathers through the prophets at many times and in various ways but in these last days he has spoken to us by his son whom he appointed heir of all things and through whom he made the universe the son is the radiance of god's glory and the exact representation of his being sustaining all things by his powerful word after he had provided purification for sins he sat down at the right hand of the majesty in heaven so he became as much superior to the angels as the name he has inherited is superior to theirs for to which of the angels did god ever say you are my son today i have become your father a b or again i will be his father and he will be my son c and again when god brings his firstborn into the world he says let all god's angels worship him d in speaking of the angels he says he makes his angels winds his servants flames of fire e but about the son he says your throne o god will last for ever and ever and righteousness will be the scepter of your kingdom you have loved righteousness and hated wickedness therefore god your god has set you above your companions by anointing you with the oil of joy f he also says in the beginning o lord you laid the foundations of the earth and the heavens are the work of your hands they will perish but you remain they will all wear out like a garment you will roll them up like a robe like a garment they will be changed but you remain the same and your years will never end g to which of the angels did god ever say sit at my right hand until i make your enemies a footstool for your feet h are not all angels ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation john this is how god showed his love among us he sent his one and only son into the world that we might live through him john jesus comforts his disciples niv do not let your hearts be troubled trust in god a trust also in me in my father's house are many rooms if it were not so i would have told you i am going there to prepare a place for you and if i go and prepare a place for you i will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where i am you know the way to the place where i am going jesus the way to the father thomas said to him lord we don't know where you are going so how can we know the way jesus answered i am the way and the truth and the life no one comes to the father except through me if you really knew me you would know b my father as well from now on you do know him and have seen him philip said lord show us the father and that will be enough for us jesus answered don't you know me philip even after i have been among you such a long time anyone who has seen me has seen the father how can you say 'show us the father' don't you believe that i am in the father and that the father is in me the words i say to you are not just my own rather it is the father living in me who is doing his work believe me when i say that i am in the father and the father is in me or at least believe on the evidence of the miracles themselves i tell you the truth anyone who has faith in me will do what i have been doing he will do even greater things than these because i am going to the father and i will do whatever you ask in my name so that the son may bring glory to the father you may ask me for anything in my name and i will do it jesus promises the holy spirit if you love me you will obey what i command and i will ask the father and he will give you another counselor to be with you forever the spirit of truth the world cannot accept him because it neither sees him nor knows him but you know him for he lives with you and will be c in you i will not leave you as orphans i will come to you before long the world will not see me anymore but you will see me because i live you also will live on that day you will realize that i am in my father and you are in me and i am in you whoever has my commands and obeys them he is the one who loves me he who loves me will be loved by my father and i too will love him and show myself to him then judas not judas iscariot said but lord why do you intend to show yourself to us and not to the world jesus replied if anyone loves me he will obey my teaching my father will love him and we will come to him and make our home with him he who does not love me will not obey my teaching these words you hear are not my own they belong to the father who sent me all this i have spoken while still with you but the counselor the holy spirit whom the father will send in my name will teach you all things and will remind you of everything i have said to you peace i leave with you my peace i give you i do not give to you as the world gives do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid you heard me say 'i am going away and i am coming back to you ' if you loved me you would be glad that i am going to the father for the father is greater than i i have told you now before it happens so that when it does happen you will believe i will not speak with you much longer for the prince of this world is coming he has no hold on me but the world must learn that i love the father and that i do exactly what my father has commanded me come now let us leave Religious conversion
