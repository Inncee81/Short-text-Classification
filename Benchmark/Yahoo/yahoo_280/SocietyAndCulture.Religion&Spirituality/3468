what do you think the rapture is and when will it come i am speaking of the christian event that involves christ i am curious as to what others opinions might be i have my beliefs on the subject but i would like to know non christians as well as christians beliefs thank you god be with you evangelist wiliam m butler st luke ministries great question i see from this question linked to your last one that you have been thinking about the second coming i believe that the rapture that you are speaking of is the event that desribes the return of jesus christ our lord and savior to the earth after reading the discription of the day of the second coming in the book of revelations it is evident that rapture is the best word to discribe this stunning capturing event where everything stops both on earth and in heaven jesus is here this is the apex the moment of truth in my father s house are many mansions if it were not so i would have told you i go to prepare a place for you and if i go and prepare a place for you i will come again and receive you to myself that where i am there you may be also john when the time which has been appointed has come jesus himself will come back for us this links to your last question of what happens when one dies i believe that at the moment of death we fall into a deep slumber in which we have no conception of time or place at the time of the rapture these brothers and sisters which have fallen asleep will be awoken by jesus and brought to his holy city to rejoice forever with the lord i feel that it is fundamental to say this however amongst the constant battle of understanding if times are coming to an end and the interpretaion of daniel and revelations which many believe is a sure sign that jesus will come tomorrow morning oct th dec st but of that day and hour knoweth no man no not the angels of heaven but my father only matthew these are the words of our lord if i may add a personal view on the issue and this is not directed to you min butler it is for all those who put so much time into mapping out and time lining events and interpretations of exactly when this event will come to pass lord knows i have been one of them i believe that instead of worrying so much about the calculations of when the lord will appear we should get cracking on working in his field so that when he does come he hasn't caught us with idle hands rather he has caught us working diligently in the way that he commanded us to then he said to his disciples the harvest is abundant but the workers are few therefore pray to the lord of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest matthew work and don't worry about things that aren't for you to worry about do what he taught you to do and let him do his work do not be anxious about anything but in everything by prayer and petition with thanksgiving present your requests to god and the peace of god which transcends all understanding will guard your hearts and your minds in christ jesus finally brothers whatever is true whatever is noble whatever is right whatever is pure whatever is lovely whatever is admirable if anything is excellent or praiseworthy think about such things whatever you have learned or received or heard from me or seen in me put it into practice and the god of peace will be with you philippians god bless all i don't usually cite this much but today i felt the need to Book of Revelation Trinity Baptism Roman Catholic Church Resurrection of Jesus Gospel of Thomas Book of Isaiah Eucharist Priesthood (Mormonism) A Course In Miracles Christian views of Jesus Soul Eastern Orthodox Church Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Christianity Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Messiah Jehovah's Witnesses God Salvation Jesus Abrahamic religion Prophet Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology John Howard Yoder Didache Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Tribulation Christ Angel Baptist Endowment (Mormonism) Church of Christ, Scientist Justification (theology) New Testament view on Jesus' life Paul of Tarsus Aramaic of Jesus Catechism Church of Christ Religious Society of Friends John Wesley John Wycliffe Apocalyptic literature Opus Dei Immortality Mormonism Apocrypha Philipp Melanchthon Origen Urantia Joseph of Arimathea Saint Peter Slow Train Coming Epistle to the Philippians Hell Great Apostasy The Pilgrim's Progress Millennialism Prayer in Christianity Jewish Messiah Agap__ Gospel of John Free will Perseverance of the saints Mass (liturgy) Charles Grandison Finney Historical Jesus Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Biblical canon Community of Christ Mormonism and Judaism Homosexuality and Christianity Second Coming Religious pluralism Adam-God theory Mary Magdalene Summa Theologiae Restorationism History of the Latter Day Saint movement Religion
