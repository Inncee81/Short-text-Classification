why do we get taxed more when we have nd jobs i currently have jobs but i get taxed so much on my nd job its almost not worth me working a nd job why do we get taxed so much on nd jobs its like we get punished for it it's not like you get punished for it it's you are punished for it by having a second job you are then in a higher income level that punishment is that you get hit with bigger deductions as though you had that income as a regular job one job if you keep that second job year round then the deductions will reflect it fairly er it is obvious that all deductions are way out of line because you must file an income tax return to get back what the gov stole from you and just look at how much the gov wastes on useless expenses i beieve that there should be a flat tax say and a tax return is not required this goes for all citizens no return no cheating no phoney baloney period Flat tax 401(k) Taxation in the United States Income tax Microeconomics United Kingdom corporation tax FairTax Social Security (United States) Self-employment Depreciation Sport utility vehicle Life insurance Income trust Wal-Mart Progressive tax Form 1040 Tax avoidance/evasion Welfare trap Tax deduction Food Stamp Program Annuity National Insurance Inflation Mutual fund Tax protester Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 Cheating in Counter-Strike Efficiency wages Surplus value Arguments for and against drug prohibition United States Postal Service Alcohol fuel Compensation of employees Reaganomics Barbara Boxer Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Productive and unproductive labour Hybrid vehicle Credit card $ale of the Century Registered Retirement Savings Plan Tax bracket Kansas Guaranteed minimum income Article One of the United States Constitution Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Warren Buffett Negative income tax Domestic partnerships in California Student loan Insurance Poker jargon Publicly funded medicine Biodiesel Health insurance Property tax George W.
