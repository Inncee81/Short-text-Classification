how long until nickelodeon makes a tv land sort of channel for s and s nick shows i honestly think they could save a lot of money and then make some if they just stopped making their current shows and running their lineups from or something or at least test things by doing a retro week sort of thing and advertise the hell out of it im sure the ratings would be great did they lose the rights to a lot of the shows rocko rugrats and ren and stimpy are still on some places but in graveyard spots what about doug are you afraid of the dark salute your shorts etc and maybe throw some spongebob around that and that nick gas crap is garbage yea i used to like nick arcade but now i realize how dumb it was and i never liked guts or legends of the hidden temple why show those and not the good ones they already have made a separate nick channel just like that on dish network but i would have to pay to get that channel either that or my satellite just doesn't receive that channel Nickelodeon (TV channel) SpongeBob SquarePants Ren and Stimpy Rocko's Modern Life Rugrats Nicktoons The Angry Beavers Doug As Told By Ginger Hey Arnold!
