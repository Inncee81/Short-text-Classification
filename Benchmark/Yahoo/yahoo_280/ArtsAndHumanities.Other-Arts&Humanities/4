how can i express myslef i've never really been good at drawing i've always wanted to try painting but i don't have the money or the supplies needed to start i skateboard a lot everyday to be exact i need artistic ways to express myself though people say that skateboarding is a form of art and that it's a way to express yourself but how can i express myself through skateboarding if skateboarding consists of doing tricks and everybody that skateboards does those same tricks i just don't feel that skateboarding makes me unique i don't feel that i can set myself apart from other skateboarders and express myself expressing yourself isn't about being the best at a sport or artform just being yourself is expressing yourself and when you try to hard to make yourself unique you take away from your uniqueness i guess what i am trying to say is that just being yourself is enough to express yourself don't let the world convince you that you have to be the best at something to be unique Skateboard Skateboarding trick Art 720 Degrees Snowboarding Rodney Mullen Roller skating Magic (illusion) Skate punk G__del's incompleteness theorem Milwaukee, Wisconsin Monopoly (game) Jumpstart 3rd Grade Kyle Broflovski Sheepshead Hiberno-English Modernism Expressionism World Industries Renaissance Don Rosa Pitaten Cultural movement Aggressive skating Copyleft Password X Games Powell Peralta Tony Hawk's Underground Aladin English grammar Aerial (dance move) Tony Hawk Franco-Belgian comics Tai Chi Chuan Wonder Woman (television series) Law of value Sport Witches (Discworld) Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?
