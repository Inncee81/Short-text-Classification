is my short story any good the door slammed shut jarring the doorframe i stared absently out the window watching the headlights cut a path through the night air i choked back a stream of tears and let out a long ragged breath my dog lay at feet his chin resting upon my toes his breaths slow and steady tears continued to flow down my cheeks despite my best efforts to control them at that moment i seemed unable to control much of anything the world was falling apart around me and all i could do was sit and cry careful not to disturb my dog i slipped my feet out from under him i curled my toes into a tight ball and ran them along his back then his ears he looked up at me expectantly his tired eyes expressing a deep sadness i knew he was in pain we both were i sunk to the floor and curled up beside him pulling him close to me at that moment i began to pray i don't really believe in god but i prayed nonetheless please god if you're your listening let him live another day i consider myself an amateur writer please let me know if you think this is at all worth persuing i realize that is intentionally vague but would appreciate any feedback overly descriptive without much plot movement Shaggy dog story Professional wrestling holds Equine conformation Diving Aerial (dance move) Boxing Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Toilet humour Glossary of nautical terms Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Dog training Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Tenshinhan Backstroke The Shining (film) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Amber Spyglass Night (book) Futurama (TV series - season 4) Jon Secada Professional wrestling throws Sin City Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Humphrey Bogart Cat Tetrapod Fast bowling Milton H.
