help with art volunteering program i am a volunteer at an art program in a hospital i am asking this question to find out if anyone knows any great activities i can do with the visitors of my period any information you can give will be helpful thank you in advance the age group of the participants are from to they are of every race and most aren't religious they are quite capable of preforming artistical even though they have mental illness they are also very perceptive painting is the obvious one my least favorite craft for any group is where is person is given the same item to paint or decorate it just seems so trivial like when you trace your hand on a piece of paper and decorate it like a turkey for thanksgiving i just don't think that's all that creative you could also do something like a memory quilt or mobile each person contributes one item to a group project pieces of cloth uniform or not can be decorated by each person in whatever way they see fit and then they can be sewen together each square is like an individual story from each individual you could change this up a little by having everyone braid cloth and little objects that they like or are significant to them into their own individual braids or strands then you can turn it into a mobile i'm borrowing those idea from others i've never done them myself NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt Art Clothing Textile manufacturing terminology Quilt Braid group Boy Scouts of America Hypnosis Modernism Pottery Knitting Pre-historic art Society for Creative Anachronism Symmetry Milton H.
