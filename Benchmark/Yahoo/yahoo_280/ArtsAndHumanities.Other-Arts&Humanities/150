child models does anyone have their child in modeling like for print work or commercials etc my daughter is with an agency but i can't help thinking it's a rip off because we paid a pretty penny and so far nothing it seems like a legit agency but i am thinking they endorse they favorites and leave the others out in the cold my daughter is cute and not shy at all and would do well if given the chance i just want her to have a better and easier life than myself and not have to work so hard i'm in portland or and have looked for other agencies and i don't see them what a great mom that you want a better life for your daughter as a teacher i've seen a lot of younger girls develop eating disorders and the probability of child models developing them is astronomical so please just keep an eye on it maybe try and find some studies and evaluate how likely her chances are of making it i know how fabulous that would be though o versus her feeling like her main worth is extrinsic superficial it's a very tough call for you i'd imagine best of luck with whatever you decide Kodocha Asperger syndrome Poker jargon Okashina Okashi Knots Landing Arianne W.I.T.C.H.
