why does this seem so deep and interesting to me it was weird at around pm last night on a whim i just decided to rearrange my bedroom in record time i tore everything apart moved everything had everything set up completely differently this is the first time in many many years my room looked the least bit different right away i decided i didn't like it so as fast as i rearranged everything i put it all back exactly how it was not an easy feat considering how much stuff i have and how small the room is for that brief minutes tonight my room was as it has never been before and then now it is back to how it was for the past few years no one in my house even knows i did it either they could walk in right now and see it and never know for that short amount of time it was as they never saw it before why would i see this as something that is so deep because you can't know how something really is until you're really open to the experience it's one thing to ponder it then dismiss it it's quite another to fully contemplate it and examine the possibilities even if you return to your original decision it's kind of like religion most people will assume what they believe to be the only way few people will actually feel secure enough in their beliefs to be open to someone else's faith perhaps they are scared if they did they could never go back Shaggy dog story Time Out of Mind Milton H.
