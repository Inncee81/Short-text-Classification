do you need both a router and an adaptor to go wireless i want to set up for wireless and am wondering if you need both the adaptor and the router or is the router enough how can you tell if you have a wireless network card already installed in your computer i think i mean how do you figure out if you already have built in wireless how old's your computer you may already have a wireless card if not just by the pcm cia wireless card it's better than usb because it doesn't stick out of the side or back of your computer i find that the usb adapters get ruined easily the pci card sticks further in the slow and stays out of the way Universal Serial Bus Wi-Fi PlayStation 2 IEEE 802.11 PlayStation Portable PlayStation 3 PCI Express Nintendo Revolution USB flash drive Wireless LAN Xbox Softmodem AirPort IBook Nintendo DS Cisco Systems HomePNA Memory Stick 3Com Corporation MAC address Knoppix Modem HyperTransport PowerPC Computer hardware Secure Digital card Hotspot (wifi) PC motherboard Wireless access point IMac Computer bus Television Telegraphy Local area network PC card Laptop Mac mini Apple Macintosh Windows XP Mobile ad-hoc network IPod Adapter Computer network Mouse (computing) Wireless Personal computer Verizon Wireless Memory card Telephone Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection Personal area network Federal Standard 1037C Expansion card Linux kernel ZigBee PS2 Linux Power Macintosh G3 Linux Graphics card Cisco PIX Hard disk Apple Computer Super Nintendo Entertainment System Communications protocol N-Gage IEEE 802.11i Nintendo GameCube Compact disc LAN party Floppy disk Danger Hiptop Closed-circuit television Wireless network Radio Wi-Fi Protected Access Surveillance SCSI Streaming media Musical Instrument Digital Interface Digital photography Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire RS-232 Digital camera Handheld game console CompactFlash Denial-of-service attack NetBSD Multimedia Card Internet Group Management Protocol Peripheral Component Interconnect Automatic teller machine Amateur radio Wardriving Voice over IP OpenBSD PlayStation 2 Expansion Bay SGI Octane Atari ST
