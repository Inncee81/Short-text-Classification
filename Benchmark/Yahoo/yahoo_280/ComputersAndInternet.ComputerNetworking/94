why cant i get on an unencripted unprotected wireless network i live outside of the city and dsl is unavalabe but one of my neighbors has satalite internet and is broadcasting the internet through a linksys wireless router im not shure what kind exactly and the signal is not secured in any way that my imac can tell but even when signal strength is good i cant get internet i was able to get a usable signal a few months ago but that stoped when i hooked my imac up to my friend's high speed internet it just didnt work when i came back i can still connect with airport but no data is being transfered and cant get internet acsess on any of my apps the best i can assume is mac filtering every nic network interface card in the world has a unique mac address mac filtering means that the router has a list of these macs and that only an nic with a mac address in the list will be able to associate i e get internet the problem for me is that you have a mac haha mac filtering and i am not familiar with the hardware where my assumption could be wrong is in the fact that you were able to connect at one time he may have had a router problem then and you just got luck i don't know can you tell if you have a ip or have been assigned a dns server again i can't tell you how to look as i don't know macs i may not return to this question so please feel free to send me an email with answers to my questions good luck all nics are created with a unique mac this however can be changed via software the mac will always reset back to the original mac as it is hard wired into the nic Router MAC address Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Wi-Fi IMac Ethernet Apple Macintosh Apple Computer Floppy disk Digital Subscriber Line Modem E-mail IEEE 802.11 Internet Email authentication Bluetooth Internet Group Management Protocol Federal Standard 1037C AppleTalk Internet protocol suite Windows XP Mac OS X Universal Serial Bus Denial-of-service attack IPv6 Wireless LAN IP Multimedia Subsystem Linux Web crawler Voice over IP AirPort Computer Wireless access point Transmission Control Protocol IPod Broadband Internet access Gmail Peer-to-peer X Window System Simple Mail Transfer Protocol IBook File Transfer Protocol IP address Telegraphy PlayStation 3 FireWire Network address translation Anonymous remailer OSI model Pretty Good Privacy ITunes Internet service provider Timeline of computing Stopping e-mail abuse Microsoft Windows Netfilter/iptables Xbox Commodore 64 Internet Relay Chat Network switch Mac OS X v10.4 PCI Express Satellite internet Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing Proxy server Power line communication Session Initiation Protocol Communications protocol Nintendo GameCube Global System for Mobile Communications Mac OS history Nintendo DS Common Unix Printing System Novell NetWare Usenet Database ISCSI Mac OS Routing Copy protection ZX Spectrum CPU cache Linux kernel Cable television PowerPC WiMAX Verizon Wireless Morse Code System 7 (Macintosh) Telephone Embedded system
