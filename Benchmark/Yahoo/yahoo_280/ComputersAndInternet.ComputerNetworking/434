is there a maximum optimum length for an ethernet cable can an ethernet cable be any length or will it effect performance interference and speed if the cable is too long what is the maximum legnth of ethernet cable that can be used without compromising data transfer can anyone recommend reference sites for setting up a non wireless computer terminal at a considerable distance from the dsl modem ethernet under the standards is not supposed to go over meters of cable length or else the throughput actual speeds fades if you have a crappy router or switch that can also minimize the throughput if you're making your own cables that will decrease it some more in the end i think the maximum speed can only be achieved with meters or less some people say going over meters may slow it down everyone's experience will be difference but in the end you may notice the difference Digital Subscriber Line Federal Standard 1037C Asynchronous Transfer Mode Universal Serial Bus SCSI Modem Bluetooth ARCNET Router Password Wi-Fi Local area network WiMAX Cable television ALOHAnet Serial ATA Cisco Systems Transmission Control Protocol HomePNA OSI model Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line Action potential Token ring Optical fiber Computer bus Advanced Technology Attachment Nintendo Revolution FireWire 10-gigabit Ethernet ITU-T General Packet Radio Service Cable modem Digital photography AppleTalk TIA-568A/B Physical layer Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing Cray-1 Telegraphy GSM services Redundant array of independent disks Category 5 cable PlayStation 3 Musical Instrument Digital Interface Power over Ethernet 3Com Corporation Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol 100BASE-TX SCADA Myrinet Broadband Fuel injection Embedded system Internet service provider Transformer Airbus A380 Power line communication Loudspeaker MIPS architecture PowerPC AirPort Computer Speed of light Throughput Floppy disk Oscilloscope IP Multimedia Subsystem Sega Dreamcast High-voltage direct current Integrated Services Digital Network 10BASE-T Magnetic tape Interstate Highway X.25 Secure Digital card Radio TGV MAC address Antenna (radio) Telephone Central processing unit Personal rapid transit Xbox Hash table Spacecraft propulsion Explosive material DMX (lighting) Radar Nintendo GameCube Propeller Jet engine
