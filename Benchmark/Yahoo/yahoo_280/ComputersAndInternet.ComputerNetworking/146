fastest way to transfer files between two computers that are next to each other okay we have a small home office where we do wedding videos we edit and prepare the dvd files on one computer but burn the discs using another computer the computers are networked with a hard wired connection but we transfer gb of info at a time and it takes a while i'm wondering if there's a way to connect the computers using usb in addition to the regular network connection theoretically usb is capable of m bps but that's considered a burst speed firewire can do a faster sustained transfer there's overhead involved in either one your m bps ethernet also has some overhead depending on how you're using it if you're sharing directories and using the file manager to drag and drop to copy files there's a lot of overhead both in the device drivers managing the shared disks but also in the transfer protocol itself you could try a protocol like ftp check out filezilla in the link below filezilla has a nice interface and both client and server are available it will cut down on some of the overhead associated with other protocols a gb file can transfer over a m bps connection in about seconds not counting the packet overhead i'd bet that some of the delay you're sensing is from your hard drive the sender has to be able to read the data off the drive at m bps and the receiver has to be able to write it at m bps to get the theoretical maximum speed over the ethernet connection if one of the hard drives is older and slower your biggest speed increase may be achieved by replacing it with a fast drive and ensuring that your bus ide eide ata pata sata and computer can support the speeds you'd like to achieve certainly there are devices available that will do what you want see last link below i've got one that i've used but my feeling was that it wasn't any faster than ethernet i used it just as a convenience when a cross over cable hub or even ethernet port wasn't available Windows XP USB flash drive PlayStation 3 Bluetooth IPod Floppy disk Asynchronous Transfer Mode Transmission Control Protocol PCI Express Digital photography Cache Storage area network File Transfer Protocol DVD BitTorrent Musical Instrument Digital Interface PlayStation 2 Linux Commodore 64 Secure Digital card Xbox IMac File Allocation Table Voice over IP PlayStation Portable Internet protocol suite Apple Macintosh File system Xbox 360 Serial communications AppleTalk Token ring Internet Computer hardware Sound recording Atari 8-bit family Computer network Power Macintosh G3 IEEE 802.11 X Window System Ripping HyperText Transfer Protocol USB mass storage device class Digital audio player ALOHAnet Streaming media Wi-Fi Xserve Mach kernel Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Modchip RS-232 Password Cheating in Counter-Strike Federal Standard 1037C Fibre Channel File sharing Architecture of Windows 2000 Secure Shell Apple II family General Packet Radio Service MicroATX Network address translation IBook TiVo Internet Group Management Protocol Peer-to-peer Serial port Quality of service CD-ROM Computer virus Desktop computer Internet Relay Chat Warez MDAC CD recorder Mac OS X Nintendo GameCube AmigaOS
