is optometry school do able hey im an undergrade at bc and i would like to go into optometry but as i do more research on the proffesion im a little hesitant about the course work if anyone is an optometrist or an optometry student would you please tell me about your experience in optometry school i wouldn't have said that it was that difficult it was tedious in parts as there a fair stack of information to absorb especially on the biological side when i was studying years ago in the uk we were worked appreciably harder in terms of the volume of lectures and coursework than many of the other students at university but none of the material was terribly difficult as a career it has good and bad points it's fairly well paid but repetitive it has a flat career structure the day you qualify you're sitting in a little dark room looking at eyeballs the day you retire you're but it's an easy profession to return to after a break and a good one to work at part time which can be a real plus for women expecting to have families unless you get into management and running businesses work can be left behind at on the plus side you're working with people and often helping them significantly on the minus side you're working with people with all the hassles that can bring did you bring your old glasses no would you go to your dentist without your teeth you''re only allowed to think that last line no i can see to drive i just can't see the television and many many other similar mind boggling utterances i've done years as an optometrist and i'm taking a career break at the least it was good but between the patients and the bureaucracy i felt i'd had enough it may just be a mid life crisis but i know several other optometrists just locally who feel the profession isn't what it was Graduate school Optometry Dentistry Doctorate Myopia Psychoanalysis Procrastination Stereoscopy Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Scientology beliefs and practices Medical prescription Tai Chi Chuan Economics Undergrads Poker jargon Indiana University Bloomington Education in the People's Republic of China Education in the United States Time Out of Mind Division of labour Rudolf Steiner Master's degree Shaggy dog story Unemployment Theory of conduct Babe Ruth Publicly funded medicine Project MKULTRA Juris Doctor Grade (education) Eyeglass prescription Education in Germany Teacher Lawrence J.
