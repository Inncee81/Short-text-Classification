most people are uncomfortable making eye contact with people with crossed eyes i have crossed eyes the eye i'm not using will always cross inward some people say they never know what i'm looking at and eye contact is uncomfortable so when i talk to people should close or squint the eye i am not using so people know where to look it bothers me that people are uncomfortable looking me in the eyes when i talk to them i like making eye contact because i want people to know i'm listening and i care would it be too weird if i close one eye just an idea that just hit me i don't know what else i can do i honestly know how you feel i was born with both of my eyes crossed inward they were both corrected by a strabismus surgery but the results were not permanent now i have two lazy eyes and only one focuses at a time i am nearsighted in one and farsighted in the other so it is hard for me to look individuals straight in the eye what i try and do is just look them in the eye and if they are not mature enough to handle the fact that we all have our own disabilities in one form or another then why bother with them you deserve to be around individuals who will do what they can to make you feel comfortable about your situation i wish you the best of luck in all you do Strabismus Contact lens Social rule Glasses Theory of conduct Milton H.
