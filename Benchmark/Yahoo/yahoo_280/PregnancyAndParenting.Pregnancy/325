pms while on birth control i'm on birth control and my period is due in exactly two weeks i am expirencing signs of both pregnancy and pms which can be similar i have read so my question is is it normal to have pms way before your period i've been expierencing it for almost a week now so that would be three weeks before my period is that normal or should i consider pregnancy as an option i'm not the best when taking bc i have forgot a couple pills this previous month and have a very light period when i wasn't even due any advice is great thanks so much i've been on bc for months and i have never had this problem before thats why i'm more concerned if you miss any pills during a cycle of birth control pills you are not considered protected from becoming pregnant so if you have had unprotected sex during that time pregnancy is a possibility though two weeks before a period would be a little early to experience most symptoms of pregnancy if these are a new type of pills for you that you haven't taken before your pills could also be causing pms symptoms the first birth control pill i took gave me some of the pms symptoms nearly the entire month my breasts were tender and sore for the whole month i could tell it was having an effect on my attitude i had to really work not to sound cranky to people etc i was not sexually active so i knew it was the pills when i finally went back to the doctor stupidly i waited an entire year they switched brands to one that had a different medication and a different dosage and those symptoms went away if your period does not start on time you should definitely take a home pregnancy test also remember that if you have missed even a single pill during a monthly cycle of pills you should use an alternate form of birth control until after you have completed a full cycle of pills because you are not well protected from pregnancy unless you take them regularly with no misses Menstrual cycle Pregnancy Oral contraceptive Fertility awareness Psoriasis Emergency contraception Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Urinary incontinence Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Birth control Breastfeeding Folic acid Endometriosis Abortion debate Obstetrics Childbirth Tocopherol Abortion Guinea pig Turner syndrome AIDS Miscarriage Hypertension Multiple sclerosis Migraine Sexual intercourse Stomach cancer Paroxetine Cephalic disorder Antidepressant Coeliac disease Teenage pregnancy Diabetes mellitus Heartworm Neighbours Acne Prolactinoma Cytomegalovirus In vitro fertilisation Herpes simplex virus Medical cannabis Androgen insensitivity syndrome Sex education Clinical depression Infantilism Alanis Morissette Puberty Cancer Bipolar disorder Sexual abstinence Ectopic pregnancy Pelvic inflammatory disease Infertility Condom Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Intrauterine device Depo Provera Stillbirth Polycystic ovary syndrome Insulin Sexually-transmitted infection Sulfasalazine Hearing impairment Prenatal diagnosis Hypoglycemia Hepatitis C Sexual dysfunction Gonorrhoea Placebo Carpal tunnel syndrome Medicine Progesterone Doxepin Breast cancer Sleep Hebrew calendar Premenstrual stress syndrome Tobacco smoking Transsexuality Maprotiline Friends Randomized controlled trial Sexual revolution Diabetic retinopathy EastEnders Chlorpromazine Masturbation Baldness treatments Alzheimer's disease Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia
