excessive weight gain hi weeks along right now to this point i have only gained about lbs i am a larger woman to begin with so they told me to keep my weight gain minimal as i already had plenty of excess weight to work with at last month's appointment i had only gained one more pound and that brought my total weight gain to about lbs total now i went to this month's appointment and they told me that i gained lbs from last month's appointment i have been eating really well i haven't been eating snacks and goodies every day we even switched to milk to cut down i only eat breakfast lunch and dinner and maybe have some popcorn or something for a snack occasionally after work but that's about it how could i have gained that much weight in a one month period i've been trying so hard to do well and now i don't know what to do my doctor is upset with me because of the weight gain but i don't know what to do i'm shocked has this happened to anyone i am having the same problem i hardly gained anything in the first half of my pregnancy and then suddenly i gained pounds in one month my doctor scolded me nicely but i was still very upset and spent the next month eating very carefully no junk at all which was so hard tons of water skim milk only walking every day etc guess what at my next monthly appointment i had gained the same amount of weight i started sobbing in the doctor's office because i really expected to only gain or pounds it leads me to think that our bodies will gain whatever they need to have a healthy pregnancy no matter what you do remember the worst thing you can do is deprive your baby of nutrition i know it is hard but just think of what we will get out of it in the end healthy happy babies and hopefully a little bit chubby too cuz that's so cute Milk Dieting Guinea pig Breastfeeding Pregnancy Super Size Me Theory of conduct Atkins Nutritional Approach Coeliac disease Little Britain Mixed martial arts Obesity Humphrey Bogart Childbirth Shaggy dog story Snack food Stomach cancer Sumo Food Folic acid Clinical depression Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hyperinflation Insulin Abortion debate Ron and Fez Menstrual cycle Kodocha Coffee Social rule Urinary incontinence 2000 Australian Grand Prix Puberty The Contender (television series) Miscarriage Tocopherol National Kidney Foundation Singapore Dairy Terri Schiavo Garfield EastEnders Knots Landing Bread Anorexia nervosa Marie Antoinette Cheese The Smoking Room Human height "Weird Al" Yankovic The Shining (film) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Mitsubishi 3000GT Pound Chronic fatigue syndrome Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Fecal incontinence Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Binge eating disorder Happy Tree Friends Milton H.
