depo shot i over heard my son's girlfriend say she got a depo shot yesterday i think it has something to do with birth control because of the context of the conversation while sitting at the dinner table can somebody give me more insight please depo provera is a form of birth control it is given with a shot every weeks i personally was on the depo provera injection for birth control for over years i would not recommend it to anyone it completely changed my body it also caused me to gain alot of weight when you are on the depo shot it adventually completely takes away your menstrual cycle when i was ready to have another child it took me a year and a half for my body to kinda get back to normal i would have a painful cycle like every other week it caused me to be more moody i hope this kinda helps i would suggest she really search on the internet about it before she gets the shot most doctors do not tell you everything when you go to get it also it is most effective when given every weeks not every months like most physicians say let me know if you have any other questions Depo Provera Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Birth control Fertility awareness Puberty Migraine Chlorpromazine Breastfeeding Psoriasis Dieting Childbirth Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Progesterone Hypoglycemia Tocopherol Hypnosis Physician Autism Stomach cancer Insulin Anorexia nervosa Prostate cancer Endometriosis Malaria Phoebe Halliwell Menstrual cup The Contender (television series) The Caves of Androzani Oral contraceptive Acne Weight training Paget's disease of bone Emperor Xuan of Han Transsexuality Obesity Anabolic steroid Spina bifida Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Ovulation Obstetrics Table tennis Terri Schiavo Diabetes mellitus Medical prescription Osteoarthritis The Ark in Space Polycystic ovary syndrome Bipolar disorder Antidepressant Folic acid The Invisibles Escape from New York Charles Darwin's education Growth hormone treatment Emperor Yuan of Han Characters of Lost Pharmaceutical company Breast cancer Domestic violence Saints and Soldiers Milton H.
