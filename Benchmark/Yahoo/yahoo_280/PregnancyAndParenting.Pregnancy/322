pregnancy or pms i'm on birth control and my period is due in exactly two weeks i am expirencing signs of both pregnancy and pms which can be similar i have read so my question is is it normal to have pms way before your period i've been expierencing it for almost a week now so that would be three weeks before my period is that normal or should i consider pregnancy as an option i'm not the best when taking bc i have forgot a couple pills this previous month and have a very light period when i wasn't even due any advice is great thanks so much oh and i know you can't tell me if i'm pregnant or not i'm just looking for advice thanks it is possible to experience the pms symptoms way before your cycle actually the best thing to do is just waith for your cycle if it does show up wait until your cycle is over like a week or so and take a pregnancy test there have been rare occassions where females still experienced the periods and they were pregnant and if your cycle doesn't show up a week or so late then still take the test good luck Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Childbirth Oral contraceptive Obstetrics Endometriosis Abortion Psoriasis Urinary incontinence Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Abortion debate Birth control Miscarriage Premenstrual stress syndrome Guinea pig Prenatal diagnosis Breastfeeding Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cephalic disorder Stillbirth Infertility Turner syndrome Cytomegalovirus Coeliac disease EastEnders Multiple sclerosis Pregnancy test Friends In vitro fertilisation Morning sickness Emergency contraception Neighbours Spina bifida Sharon Tate Breech birth Extreme Programming Prolactinoma Tocopherol Malaria Autism Coffee Diabetes mellitus Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Ectopic pregnancy Pregnancy fetishism Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Aortic dissection Infantilism Polycystic ovary syndrome Hearing impairment Haloperidol Estrus cycle Wheel of Fortune Clinical depression Charmed Paroxetine Toxoplasmosis Roe v.
