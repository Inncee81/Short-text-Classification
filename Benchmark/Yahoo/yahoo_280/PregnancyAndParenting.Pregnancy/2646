ok strange question i am about weeks pregnant i have no idea if one of these symptoms has anything to do with another but any help would be appreciated i am waiting for my doc to get back to me ok for the past week or so i have been having strange pains in my belly but chalked it up to gas and pregnancy pains but i have also been unbelievably thirsty i mean drinking bottles of water an hour sometimes i've just overall had strange feelings the last week or so i woke up this morning and my eyes are bright bright red looks like i have been drinking all night i haven't and dark circles under them and a yellowish color to my skin i feel ok not sick or anything a little more tired than usual but nothing i would worry about so anyone have a clue what could be going on with me i feel the baby on a regular basis so i know she is ok but what the hell is going on with my body if you haven't already i would get your doctor to check your bloodsugar as soon as possible the excessive thirst could be a symptom of gestational diabetes that's when you only are diabetic while pregnant i have been diabetic for years now and i remember that unbelievable thirst it is your body trying to wash away all that excess sugar in your blood in the meantime if you can get some exercise that might help exercise lowers your bloodsugar good luck take care of yourself and that precious baby Diabetes mellitus Obstetrics Breastfeeding Diabetes insipidus Childbirth Polycystic ovary syndrome Episodes of Lost (Season 1) First aid Hyperglycemia Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Hypoglycemia Coffee Psoriasis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Urinary incontinence Drinking Hyperthermia Insulin Decompression sickness Premature birth Miscarriage The Shining (film) Prostate cancer Stomach cancer Guinea pig Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Diabetic retinopathy Dehydration Chronic fatigue syndrome Hypertension Dialysis Menstrual cycle Coeliac disease Sin City Fecal incontinence Birth weight Shaggy dog story Anxiety Social rule Alcoholism Folic acid Medicine Group A streptococcal infection Stroke Time Out of Mind Vampire Exercise Maprotiline Characters in the Smurfs Prenatal diagnosis EastEnders Diabetic coma Penis Alzheimer's disease Chlorpromazine Clinical depression Cephalic disorder Knots Landing Diabetic neuropathy Caffeine Fitz Hugh Ludlow Pneumonia The Amber Spyglass AFI 100 Years series Diarrhea Dieting Breech birth Aloe Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Elephant Fertility awareness Propranolol Anemia Spina bifida Hamster Haloperidol Morning sickness Kyle Broflovski Fasting Atherosclerosis Glaucoma Tuberculosis Cirrhosis Everwood Out-of-body experience Hellraiser Fancy rat Jam (TV series) Gout Cat Pet skunk One Tree Hill (TV series) Sharon Tate Hypnosis Endometriosis Turner syndrome Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder
