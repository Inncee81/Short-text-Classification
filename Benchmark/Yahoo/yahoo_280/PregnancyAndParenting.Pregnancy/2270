lightening in the third trimester i have recently seen a couple of answers where they talked about experiencing lightening in the third trimester what are they talking about what does it feel like and when does it usually happen my parents used to say dropped its when the baby has dropped into the pelvic area and sits lower in the belly you know it when it happens because you can see that your belly is lower over night its easier to breath the indigestion doesn't seem as bad etc it tends to happen within a few weeks of labor but some women drop earlier think of it as the lightning before the storm Pregnancy Abortion Abortion debate Miscarriage Urinary incontinence Obstetrics Breastfeeding Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Breech birth Roe v.
