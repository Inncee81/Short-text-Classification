weeks and fearful about labor i am weeks and days pregnant and so scared about going into labor it comes and goes and sometimes i get so scared i almost start to cry i know women very rarely die during childbirth but that is one huge fear i am having right now i cant help but think about it and i am so worried that the pain will just be unbearable also i dont want to be mean to my boyfriend during delivery i feel like a mess has anyone felt this way and what do you do to get over it what you are feeling is totally normal it is scary the unknown always is you will probably have words for your boyfriend but i am sure he will understand giving birth is painful and long it will be the hardest thing you ever do but it will be the best most rewarding special spiritual thing you will ever do you hear women all the time say once i saw that baby all the pain and fear went away i know it seems cliche but it is so true nothing else matters after that point have you taken birthing classes i highly recommend them they will help prepare you for the process and kind of what to expect granted nothing will really prepare you but it helps good luck hang in there and you are stronger then you realize Childbirth Pregnancy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Kodocha Breastfeeding Simone Weil EastEnders Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Caesarean section One Life to Live Abortion debate Eastern Orthodox Church Milton H.
