sharp pains i am weeks pregnant and since this afternoon i have been getting these really painful sharp pains in my pelvic area that last about seconds there is no tightening of my abdomen with these but i am getting them about minutes apart any idea as to what this could be i have never experienced this before i never actually went into labor on my own with my first child i was induced so i dam not completely sure what early labor is like i haven't lost my mucous plug and my water hasn't broken at weeks i was dilated to cm but haven't been checked since any info would be greatly appreciated i should also mention that i have had back pain that started days ago and has gotten progressively worse over the past days i haven'' had back pain with this pregnancy nor with my first it sounds like you will be getting ready to go into labor soon i think you are having what some people call pre labor pains even though your belly isn't tightening yet it could be your baby moving closer to the birth canal and your body getting ready for the birth call your dr to see if he she wants you to go in and get checked good luck and congrats Childbirth Miscarriage Breech birth Obstetrics Premature birth Cervix Breastfeeding Endometriosis EastEnders Intact dilation and extraction Androgen insensitivity syndrome Fecal incontinence Abortion Abortion debate Urinary incontinence Elephant Professional wrestling holds Abdomen Friends Milton H.
