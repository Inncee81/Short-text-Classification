pregnant with monochorionic monoamniotic twins i am pregnant with monochorionic monoamniotic twins and i am now weeks pregnant my consultant said that she is not going to deliever my babies until their weeks and every time i go into labour they just stop it again but i read up that this is dangerous for the type of twins iv got as the cord can get caught and their is a chance of tts it also said that my type of twins should get delievered no later than weeks i was just wondering if anybody can give me some more advice on this as i want my babies to have the best possible chance thankyou x no set of twins should be automatically delivered by weeks unless life inside the uterus has become dangerous in some way every day spent in utero gives each baby precious time to grow and develop more for life in our world i've delivered two sets of twins the first set was born at weeks days they were in the nicu for two weeks the second set of twins were born at weeks day they left the hospital two days after birth before me and never went into the nicu it's crazy what just a week can do eh the only reason i can suspect for anyone to believe that your type of twinning should be delivered early is because sometimes placentas begin deteriorating sooner with multiples identicals sometimes succumb to a situation called twin to twin transfusion where when one placenta is shared one baby hogs all the nutrients in this instance one baby is abnormally small and suffers from a lack of oxygen and nutrition while the other baby is very big and suffers from too much of a good thing this is rare and it is unmistakable in ultrasound the technician will see a remarkable size difference among the infants in addition the small one will be severely anemic while the large one will have a large heart as for a prolapsed cord this is a fear in any type of twinning if you are allowed to try for a vaginal birth your doctor will be prepared to whisk you away for an emergency c section chances are however that you'll have to be sectioned anyway if you deliver before weeks you wont be given the option to deliver naturally i know you are greatly uncomfortable but for the sake of your babies make the most out of your situation kick up your heals and wait this out your ob knows best and everyday you remain pregnant your babies grow bigger and stronger and make you more likely to be able to bring them home with you from the hospital Childbirth Pregnancy Breech birth Premature birth Amniotic sac Caesarean section Miscarriage Androgen insensitivity syndrome Fetus Intact dilation and extraction Prenatal diagnosis Breastfeeding Cephalic disorder Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Abortion debate In vitro fertilisation Traumatic brain injury Folic acid Intravenous therapy Cryptorchidism Prostate cancer Stroke Poker jargon Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Coeliac disease Abortion Radiation therapy Sex assignment Medicine Placenta Charmed Romulus and Remus Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Knots Landing Placenta praevia Ayyavazhi mythology Redundant array of independent disks Atrial septal defect Midwifery Psychiatric hospital Partial-birth abortion Neonatal intensive care unit Birth control Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Ectopic pregnancy Mental Health Act 1983 Spina bifida Menstrual cycle RISC Puberty History of intersex surgery Gastroparesis Drowning Mario Parasitic twin Anemia Infant Guinea pig Days of our Lives One Tree Hill (TV series) Characters of Lost Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Erythropoietin Diabetic retinopathy Simone Weil Friends Elephant Pregnancy (mammals) Neighbours Cancer TGV Human cloning Hulk (comics) Big Brother (Australian TV series) Max Martin Psoriasis Cerebral palsy Vaginal bleeding Myocardial infarction Dairy Anorexia nervosa Alois Hitler Biosphere 2 Milk
