im finding it so hard to keep the pregnancy a secret help im only weeks sorry should have said x its my first pregnancy and im scared something will go wrong if i tell people we are over the moon about being pregnant and want to shout it from the roof tops we have been trying for months and i had clomid for months and got pregnant the second month im going to tell my mum and nanna and then keep it secret until my month scan really appreciate everything you have said it has really helped me feels good to tell someone im having a baby kelly b i have thought like that and ur right what s the reason are you afraid of the month time so many people say you shouldn't tell consider that the reason for that tradition is to avoid the unfortunate and not uncommon in is one stat i've heard situation of later telling would be congratulators that you had a miscarriage therefore my suggestion is tell a trusted friend the sort of person you could also tell about something as personal and unfortunate as a miscarriage without it becoming public now you can release some of the excitement and energy which should help you hold back until the date you feel it's appropriate to tell the world or if you just can't tell anyone you know go online to any one of the many mommy blogs boards and sites and talk there under a username your friends wouldn't recognize Pregnancy Miscarriage Friends Social rule Abortion Abortion debate Theory of conduct EastEnders Neighbours Charmed Breastfeeding Blonde on Blonde Knots Landing Infantilism Shaggy dog story Big Brother UK series 6 Plame affair Piccolo Junior Saga Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Avenue Q Coming of Age (TNG episode) One Tree Hill (TV series) Sex and the City Boston Public John Sheridan (Babylon 5) The Smoking Room Everwood Days of our Lives Kodocha Liza of Lambeth About a Boy Miscarriage of justice Jean Grey Eddie Guerrero Marilyn Monroe Gmail Sydney Riot of 1879 Married... with Children Teenage pregnancy Elvis and Me Autism Religion and abortion Human sexual behavior Pregnancy fetishism Seiken Densetsu 3 Melanie Wilkes Hollyoaks Jon Secada Hearing impairment Phoebe Halliwell Sant Thakar Singh History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Sharon Tate Scenes from a Memory Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban LiveJournal Cliff Richard Classified information Kender One Life to Live Alias (TV series) Downing Street memo Fertility awareness Alexander Technique Blood on the Tracks RuneScape cheats Diving Ron and Fez A Series of Unfortunate Events Jumpstart 3rd Grade Rent (musical) The Parting of the Ways Episodes of Lost (Season 1) R.
