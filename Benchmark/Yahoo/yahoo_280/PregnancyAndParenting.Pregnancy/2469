okay pregnancy issue very serious ok about the friend of mine who's wife i slept with for the record i did not get her pregnant and their not the couple who i want to get an abortion i have a buddy who accidently got his wife pregnant i earlier had asked if i had legal right to choose an abortion for his wife i guess not my question is howcome a guy has less of a say in the abortion as does his girl i mean they both have to raise the child well what if a guy wants to be a father and the girl doesn't both people willingly had sex knowing the biological risks pregnancy ect no it's not because the womans body isn't the only body at stake souless idiots the reason a guy has less of a say in abortion is because the baby is inside the womans body it is ultimately her choice what she wants to do w her body Abortion debate Abortion Prenatal diagnosis Pro-choice Friends Anti-abortion movement Pregnancy Abortion in the United States Knots Landing Birth control Miscarriage Sex and the City Roe v.
