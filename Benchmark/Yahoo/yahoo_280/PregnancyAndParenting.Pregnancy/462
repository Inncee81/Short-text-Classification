wks and full of energy i am wks and i have been so full of energy since last night i have also been having some very strong braxton hicks contractions i have heard some people say that when you get big bursts of energy that means labor is right around the corner just wondering if this is true as far as being full of energy all i did was iron some clothes nothing to over board but i am usually alseep by and i had to make myself go to sleep at this morning then coming into work i am so hyper and bursting w energy and i didn't say anything about my energy other people have noticed it doesn't necessarily mean that labor is right around the corner but it probably signals that it isn't too far off usually its called your nesting period if you can't seem to get your house clean enough even though you've used q tips to clean every last corner you're nesting sometimes women just get tons of energy and use it to clean sometimes its that they don't feel their houses are clean enough for the coming baby and usuallly isn't a totally conscious thing you're at weeks so really it could be any time now just keep cleaning and using your energy to be productive and you'll be a mom before you know it Shaggy dog story The Inside Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Social rule EastEnders The Amber Spyglass Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Hiberno-English Procrastination Daylight saving time Hangul Philosophical skepticism AFI 100 Years series Cliff Richard Pitaten Capitalism Macbeth The Big Goodbye (TNG episode) Friends The Shining (film) I Want to Hold Your Hand Urinary incontinence Avenue Q Ron Weasley Gravitational radiation Economy of the People's Republic of China Time Out of Mind Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Apprentice 2 Childbirth K' The Arsenal of Freedom (TNG episode) Kodocha Welding Ron and Fez Technocratic movement Pok__mon Live!
