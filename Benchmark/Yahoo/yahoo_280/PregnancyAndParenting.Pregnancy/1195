how quickly did you go into labor when you had this happen when i had my son i was induced at weeks due to preeclampsia i was in labor for hours and had an emergency c section now i'm weeks along no hypertension no preeclampsia no diabetes c section is scheduled for september th so that's the latest i have to go the baby has dropped significantly over the past few days and i've been losing my plug in pieces for about a week doctor hasn't done a pelvic exam yet but i'm pretty sure i'm dialated to cm already i see her next friday braxton hicks are getting more pronounced but contractions aren't close enough to worry about yet my question is this what are the chances that i will make it to september th while i know that none of you are my doctor i pray that someone has been in a similar situation and can say well i had the same things happen and went over by a week or what have you yes i plan on asking my doctor no problems there i'm not worried just anxious obviously i know what contractions feel like right now they aren't very intense maybe it's because i have a high pain threshold but half the time it's more of a wow that's smarts then wow i need to go to the hospital i've had the bh for a coupe of weeks now and i didn't get them this strong with my son i went to the er they told me that i wasn't even dilated so i was sent home being told it was just bh have been timing them though it's been rather inconsistent there'll be a minute span and then nothing for hours i called my doctor about it and she told me to just chill until monday if it gets really bad i'll just head to the er i see the doctor on monday so i'm not really that worried i've been doing a lot of resting which is hard to do with a bouncing year old losing the mucous plug means you're going to have a baby within the next four weeks it doesn't mean labor is imminent by any means it's not abnormal to contract at weeks it is abnormal to contracract regularly if they're timeable and regular you should go to the hospital you've had a preemie and thank god you're smart enough to know you don't want to have another one especially in the summer it's very easy to get dehydrated which can cause uterine irritibility also urinary tract infections can play a role drink lots and lots of water and stay in the air conditioning Childbirth Urinary incontinence Prostate cancer Breastfeeding Breech birth Fecal incontinence Humphrey Bogart Obstetrics Theory of conduct Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Miscarriage Medicine Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an EastEnders Social rule Saturday Night Live Penis Time Out of Mind Soap opera Equine conformation 2000 Australian Grand Prix Hypoglycemia Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Ron and Fez Cystoscopy Operation Market Garden Diabetes mellitus Abortion Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Pregnancy Diabetic retinopathy Hikikomori Medical prescription Urinary system Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Poker jargon Turner syndrome Oasis (band) Medical analysis of circumcision Severe weather terminology (United States) The Emancipation of Mimi Dehydration Extreme Programming Milton H.
