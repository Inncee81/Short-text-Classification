th week cramping at night for the past week or so i have had really bad cramping in my belly all over not as much during the day but alot at night i moan in my sleep all night it hurts so bad between the pain and the every minute bathroom trips i get no sleep what is this is this cramping just braxton hicks though they really only come at night they tell u to walk off braxton hicks right could they only be coming in my sleep because i am fairly active and then i am trying to sleep is the only time that i am resting are they supposed to be this painful also i took a nap today and woke up cramping are you laying on your back at night if so it will cut off blood supply to the placenta and bring on contractions try always to lay on your left side also being dehydrated brings on contractions if you are peeing every minutes at night then i doubt that is the problem your pregnancy will probably be mostly uncomfortable from here on out probably braxtons but only because pre labor is on its way if your contractions are spreading from the top or fundus and spreading down into your low back into your pelvis you are likely having true contractions and should go into labor and delivery for an exam if they are erratic at best even if they are painful they are only braxtons at this time you should drink some water i know i know and lay on your left side until they subside Childbirth Obstetrics Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sleep The Shining (film) Premature birth Toni Braxton Pregnancy Breech birth Babe Ruth Mattress Urinary incontinence Professional wrestling holds Prostate cancer Miscarriage Dialysis Equine conformation Avenue Q Sin City Siesta Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Placental abruption Breastfeeding Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sexual intercourse Diazepam LSD Pitaten Stomach cancer Cholera Ectopic pregnancy First aid Social rule Battles of Lexington and Concord Knots Landing Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Eddie Guerrero Gemini 7 Unemployment Major League Baseball television contracts Bodybuilding Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Professional wrestling attacks Endometriosis Saturday Night Live Boston Public One Tree Hill (TV series) Bill Hicks Fecal incontinence Twin We Belong Together Placenta praevia The Caves of Androzani Oral sex Goodness and value theory Heinkel He 112 Cliff Richard Kidney Dehydration Montreal Screwjob Elvis Presley Jacob 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Apollo 8 1957 World Series Keynesian economics Chronic fatigue syndrome Public transport Kitchen Polyphasic sleep Marathon (sport) Conker's Bad Fur Day Blood (computer game) Ron and Fez Glycogen storage disease type I Big Brother UK series 6 Humphrey Bogart EastEnders The Amber Spyglass Aerial (dance move) Placenta Insomnia Abdomen USS Wahoo (SS-238) Blood Simple The Time Machine Carpal tunnel syndrome Paget's disease of bone Theory of conduct Massage Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Mercury Atlas 6 The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe STS-59 Lord's Resistance Army Group A streptococcal infection Psoriasis
