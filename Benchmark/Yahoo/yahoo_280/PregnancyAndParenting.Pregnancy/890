pregnant my sister in law is months pregnant she was rushed into hospital last week as she was in a lot of pain she came out and got rushed back in yesterday as she has excruciating pains the doctor has said that her stomach muscles have collapsed and nothing is holding the baby up now they are going to put some sort of belt inside her to keep the baby up have any of you heard of this and how dangerous or safe can this be can it affect the baby mother at all it sounds like uterine prolapse there are any number of ligaments inside our abdomen that hold up the uterus kind of like a hammock when the hammock stretches out too much many possible reasons the uterus follows the laws of gravity and slips downward it's pretty painful but normally happens earlier in the pregnancy months seems a bit late doctors will usually insert what is called a pessary through the vagina which helps to prop the uterus up your sister in law may also have to have bed rest if the pessary doesn't look like it will do the job there are more invasive procedures that can be done but don't worry about that just yet as for affecting mum and baby the idea is to protect the baby and keep it in there as long as possible the internal sling or pessary doesn't touch the baby itself only the outside of the uterus if the procedure isn't done with an anaesthetic and some don't require one the baby should be pretty unconcerned by this as for mum having a pessary inserted can be pretty unpleasant but most likely not nearly as bad as the pain she's having now Urinary incontinence Obstetrics Breech birth Pregnancy Breastfeeding Uterus Intact dilation and extraction Miscarriage Caesarean section EastEnders Gynaecology Birth control Abortion Endometriosis Premature birth Equine conformation Pessary Menstrual cup Sexual reproduction Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Milton H.
