why the constant questions in pregnancy and parenting there are at least twenty questions a day on i took a pregnancy test and it was negative but could i still be pregnant these questions seem to be posted mostly by teenage girls who have had unprotected sex and now are scared they might get pregnant i had my son when i was nineteen so i know that unprotected sex equals possible pregnancy i'm not sure exactly what i'm asking here but why are all these questions asked when people already know the answer that yes it is possible not necessarily true in their case but possible i'm not saying i was smart by becoming pregnant at nineteen but if you can't deal with the consequences don't have unprotected sex people i agree absolutely but i suppose i take for granted the fact that i've had an education and a family i can turn to if i needed to ask these questions and didn't feel like the internet was my only lifeline what frightens me is when there's something serious medically going on eg i'm weeks pregnant and i've been bleeding for weeks what should i do and these kids are relying on questionable advice from randoms across the world and aren't running to their local hospital Sex education Pregnancy Abortion debate EastEnders Menstrual cycle Abortion Infantilism Friends Roe v.
