i'm an overly worried pregnant person do u think if i but a fetal dopler to hear heart beat will that make me more paranoid or relieve my paranoia paranoia is related to always thinking what if i have a missed abortion the kind where embryo dies and body does not pass it out and ywoman does not know she miscarried and walks around happily thinking she's still pregnant i'm weeks today i have rented a doppler with two of my pregnancies the doppler i have is the same thing my doctor has since the store bought ones very rarely work i lost two babies one was a missed abortion i went weeks to only find out the baby died at weeks and the other also an eight week loss i started bleeding at weeks so my anxiety can run high occasionally i am also considered high risk with my current pregnancy this is my th due to an inherited blood disorder therefore i asked my current doctor if i could get her approval to rent one she said that it would be fine esp if it helped me relieve some stress although with my nd pregnancy i was not considered high risk i hadn't been diagnosed with the disorder at the time i still rented a doppler with doctor approval and it was very helpful for me i recently got the doppler a couple weeks ago when i was weeks pregnant and it's been really nice to hear the heartbeat esp when my anxiety runs higher than usual the only other issue as you probably already know is that no matter what you do sometimes things happen there is no way to have complete control and it is natural to worry about your baby the only thing i think of is if something bad is going to happen i'd rather find out sooner than later it was terrible to go weeks thinking your pregnant when i lost the baby at weeks so do what feels right get your doctor's approval as you may have questions about the baby's heart rate when you check it and besides according to the fda you need approval one more thing just today i checked my baby's heart beat and it was in the high 's to low 's bpm which is completely normal but for a moment the heart rate dropped to and i did start to get concerned you know the standard anxiety fears of oh no something is wrong or somethings wrong with the baby's cord etc worry just pops up sometimes as long as the doppler will give you more relief from the paranoia than add to it then i think it is a good choice good luck and lots of sticky baby dust Miscarriage Pregnancy Abortion Childbirth Anxiety Abortion debate Obstetrics Urinary incontinence Traumatic brain injury Folic acid Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Menstrual cycle Clinical depression Turner syndrome EastEnders Tocopherol Bipolar disorder Tobacco smoking Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Prostate cancer Oral contraceptive In vitro fertilisation Stroke Schizophrenia Abortion in the United States Post-traumatic stress disorder Breech birth Panic attack Human cloning Breastfeeding Sharon Tate Fertility awareness Neighbours Obsessive-compulsive disorder Poker jargon Shaggy dog story The Inside Unemployment Autism Androgen insensitivity syndrome Cerebral palsy Asthma Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Jam (TV series) Cephalic disorder Omega-3 fatty acid Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Hypoglycemia Birth weight Partial-birth abortion CPU cache Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an HIV test Psychosis Social rule Maprotiline Stuttering Twin Cancer Paranoia Transsexuality Diabetes mellitus Borderline personality disorder Intact dilation and extraction Congenital disorder Stomach cancer Birth control Migraine Friends Infantilism Jon Secada Multiple sclerosis Aspartame Heartbeat (television) Psoriasis Word of Wisdom Chronic fatigue syndrome One Tree Hill (TV series) Alcoholism Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Cardiac stress test Heart rate Knots Landing Chemical abortion Abortion in Canada Blood pressure Cytomegalovirus Prolactinoma
