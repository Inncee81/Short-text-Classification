pregnancy and paint fumes i'm kind of freaking out right now because i'm months pregnant and my husband painted the house this weekend he used oil based paint which someone just told me is harmful for me to be around i have spent two days in the house with these fumes with the windows open and sleeping at night not in the room that was painted but i could definitely still smell the fumes i know there's nothing i can do about it now but even though the paint is dry the house still smells have i just harmed my baby fumes can harm the baby and you shouldn't be in the house until it stopped smelling but since it happened you should go to a doctor to check the baby's heartbeat i think that you shouldn't have any problem but just to be sure good luck and relax Childbirth Pregnancy Urinary incontinence Humphrey Bogart Miscarriage Fume hood Knots Landing House of M Heartbeat (television) Sharon Tate Social rule Breastfeeding Jam (TV series) Spina bifida What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?
