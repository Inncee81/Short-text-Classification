can i get pregnant by ok so i had sex the other day and the guy used a condom but we ended up doing it more than once and the last time we wanted to see how it felt without a condom so we did that for about minutes then he pulled out we did other stuff and he came outside of me no where near my vagina i also was on the rd day of my period and my periods are usually days apart for only days is there a possibility that i might get pregnant and if so how much of a possibility any time he puts his penis in you you have a chance of getting pregnant if he didn't have on a condom no matter how long he could have pre ejaculated which means leaked a small amount of fluid he could neither feel nor control but which does contain sperm of pull out method users become pregnant each year so unless you want a baby please stop doing this until you are monogamous and on birth control as far as the time of the month it's doubtful for a woman to get pregnant on her period but not impossible if i just had to guess i'd say you only have maybe a chance of being pregnant this time because of the timing yyou'd be most likely to be fertile in the middle of your cycle around days after your period started but of course pregnancy is stil a possibility Birth control Fertility awareness Condom Sexual intercourse Oral sex Safe sex Menstrual cycle Oral contraceptive In vitro fertilisation Pornographic movie Orgasm Coitus interruptus Premature ejaculation Androgen insensitivity syndrome Abortion debate Obstetrics Douche Infertility Puberty Strap-on dildo Sexual reproduction Urinary incontinence Gonorrhoea Endometriosis Sexual abstinence Masturbation Miscarriage Emergency contraception Sex toy Breastfeeding EastEnders Menstrual cup Anal sex Genital wart Ejaculation Human sexual behavior Vagina Spina bifida Knots Landing Twin Human sexual response cycle Female ejaculation Tampon Phthalates Childbirth Sterilization (surgical procedure) Elephant Herpes simplex virus Fertilisation Maya calendar Semen Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Sex and the City Guinea pig Old wives' tale Friends History of sex Diaphragm (contraceptive) Prenatal diagnosis Premature birth Male reproductive system (human) Niddah Cytomegalovirus Man Penis Sex education Sperm Whale Testicle Jam (TV series) Herbert Garrison Breech birth Butt plug Abortion Drawn Together Monogamy Human sexuality Sex assignment Pregnancy fetishism Pelvic inflammatory disease Intersexuality Unsafe sexual practices Pre-ejaculate Kurt Cobain Crystal methamphetamine and sex Intersex surgery Sexually-transmitted infection Proper Condom Use Intact dilation and extraction Apollo 8 Vaginal lubrication Sharon Tate AIDS Piper Halliwell Days of our Lives Orgy George Costanza Kodocha Cervical cap Social rule
