how long do you think i should wait to take a hpt after my miscarriage i had a miscarriage on july th at weeks everything came out naturally i didn't have to have a d c so now i am waiting for my period it has almost been weeks since then and no period yet i have no symptoms of my period coming any time soon how long do you think i should wait to take another pregnancy test i had a previous pregnancy and everything turned out fine any advice would be appreciated my hcg level was on july th i am sorry to hear about your situation the time it takes for your period to return can vary some people get it like clockwork days later some wait for up to months for it to return i had a d c at the end of june and i just ovulated a week ago so that was and a half weeks since my time between ovulation and period is days i would say that my period would come about weeks after the miscarriage unless i get pregnant sooner if you're taking a p test to determine that your hcg level is back down after the miscarriage it took me a little over weeks to get a negative result if you had a natural miscarriage your hcg would have probably already dropped significantly by that time and i would think that you would get a negative even sooner as far as getting a true positive again it depends on when you ovulated but you could technically be pregnant again and get a result today i wish it was easier to tell i use dollar tree p tests because i tend to over test good luck Menstrual cycle Pregnancy Pregnancy test Fertility awareness Human chorionic gonadotropin Abortion Polycystic ovary syndrome Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Obstetrics Cytomegalovirus HIV test Breastfeeding Spina bifida Ovarian cyst Coeliac disease Ovulation Neighbours Folic acid Morning sickness Drug test Oral contraceptive Progesterone Abortion debate Twin Schapelle Corby Antiphospholipid syndrome Henry VIII of England Puberty Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Social rule Prostate cancer Urinary incontinence Pelvic inflammatory disease Ovarian cancer Niddah Prenatal diagnosis Emergency contraception Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Cephalic disorder Autism Human sexual behavior Explosive material Action potential Vitamin C Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Clinical depression Estrus cycle Aortic dissection Multiple sclerosis Group A streptococcal infection H5N1 Economic inequality Baseball Miscarriage of justice Prolactinoma The Inside Sea level rise Guinea pig One Tree Hill (TV series) Time Out of Mind A Clockwork Orange Melanie Wilkes EastEnders Experiment Tocopherol Big Brother UK series 6 Birth control Hurricane preparedness for New Orleans Chernobyl accident GED Religion and abortion Heartworm Debugging Lucille Ball Nuclear fallout Expert system Blood type Endometriosis Haloperidol Operation Market Garden Caffeine Teenage pregnancy Gynecologic hemorrhage Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome Inflation Graduate school Asian financial crisis Quicksort Flowering plant Insulin Gonorrhoea Withdrawal Stillbirth Infertility Diabetes mellitus Biology and sexual orientation Blackjack Chemical abortion
