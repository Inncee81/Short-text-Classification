how much did you gain with your first child okay i've always heard you usually gain more with your first child my doctor told me they recommend to gain around lbs i weighed lbs before and now at wks i weigh lbs just curious on how much other ppl gained with there first and if this is to much that i have gained i put on lbs i'm ' and almost broke lbs i think most of it was gained the first four months as i was pretty sick and had to eat every two hours to keep myself from getting worse and worse i still have or so to loose i wouldn't worry about it too much just stay as active as you can and once the baby is here get yourself into a gentle walking routine and build it as you heal and are able to do more Humphrey Bogart Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Milton H.
