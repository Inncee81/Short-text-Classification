question about cervic's thinning out sorry tmi is this my cervic's thinning out more i went to dr this last tuesday and he said i am about effaced tmi but i just went to the bathroom and on the tp there was snotty looking slime with a tinge of yellow would this just be my cervics thinning out more also i just dont feel good and it hurts to walk around very much dont know if there is any relation between the two though thanks it's most likely that you lost all or a portion of your cervical mucous plug it doesn't mean you're about to go into labor in the coming hours but it's just one of many signs that you are nearing the end the only relation between what is happening with your cervix and you feeling bad including that it hurts to walk is that you are very pregnant everyone feels like crap once they reach the end of pregnancy it's not a comfy feeling do what you can to get comfortable sit and rest if you need to you may want to get a maternity belt if you don't have one and you have to be on your feet some it can help support the added weight to your lower front putting less strain on your back when you're standing good luck you're almost there btw the mucous plug can begin to come out up to a few weeks before labor starts trish is thinking about when your water breaks if your water breaks don't take a bath go swimming or have sex until that point your baby is still safe in your uterus swimming in amniotic fluid after that point why would you be going swimming or having sex or even treating yourself to a bubble bath anyway Childbirth Cervix Pregnancy Abortion Fertility awareness Cervical cancer Diving Menstrual cycle Birth control Obstetrics Mojave people Gonorrhoea Miscarriage Amniotic sac Premature birth Oral sex Breastfeeding Atomic Kitten Friends Shaggy dog story Menstrual cup Aerial (dance move) Equine conformation Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Strap-on dildo Kurt Angle Sauna Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Endometriosis Prenatal diagnosis Backstroke Endometrial cancer The Shining (film) Swimming In vitro fertilisation Androgen insensitivity syndrome RuneScape Mini-Games Vertebral column Herpes simplex virus Sexual reproduction Craps Melanie Wilkes Sailing Professional wrestling holds Drowning Sexually-transmitted infection Shark Guinea pig Chris Jericho Autonomic nervous system Little Britain Cancer Diving suit Genital wart Diaphragm (contraceptive) Heinkel He 100 Safe sex Placenta praevia Cervical vertebrae Jennifer Lopez Chiropractic Urinary incontinence Ectopic pregnancy Sento Colposcopy Futurama (TV series - season 5) Three Mile Island Time Out of Mind Swimsuit Elephant Care Bears Medical analysis of circumcision Glossary of climbing terms Abortion debate Infertility Siphon Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Luck Knots Landing Japanese tea ceremony Sexual intercourse Psoriasis B-47 Stratojet Human papillomavirus Glen Jacobs Trish Stratus Frogman Bathing Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Sex and the City Tide Maverick (film) Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Breaststroke
