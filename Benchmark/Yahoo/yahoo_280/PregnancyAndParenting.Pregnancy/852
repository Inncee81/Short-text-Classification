what's going on i'm and started my periods just under a year ago they were very irregular to begin at first i didnt get another for months then since january this year i've had about but they havent been very regular but the past two times my cycle has been about days i am aware that they can still be regular though if my cycle was still to be regular i had protected sex condom a week before my period was due but weeks later my period still hasnt come my partner says he didn't ejaculate and i can't see how i can be pregnant if he used a condom and he didnt ejaculate what are the possibilities that you think i am pregnant im going to take a hpt but before that give me an idea say out of or something condom was placed before sexual activity it was checkde throughout to make sure it stayed on which it did then it was removed after sexual intercourse i'm leaning more toward hormonal problems is not unheard of but rare to start menstuating so late if he is lying and he did ejaculate then you could possibly be pregnant because no one form of birth control is effective save for abstinence if he is telling you the truth then there is no way you could be pregnant unless you had sex with someone else Condom Sexual intercourse Birth control Fertility awareness Safe sex Sexual abstinence Oral sex Pregnancy Premature ejaculation Oral contraceptive Puberty Menstrual cycle Orgasm Androgen insensitivity syndrome AIDS Medical analysis of circumcision Sex education Strap-on dildo Pelvic inflammatory disease Pornographic movie Sexually-transmitted infection Masturbation Prostate cancer Emergency contraception Sexual dysfunction Anal sex Infertility History of sex Child sexuality Ejaculation Proper Condom Use Herpes simplex virus Teenage pregnancy Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Human sexuality Abortion debate Barebacking Human papillomavirus Inhibited sexual desire Fasting Sexual revolution AIDS in Africa Sexual orientation AIDS pandemic Sex toy Acne Human sexual behavior Foreskin Breastfeeding Gay slang Hebrew calendar Homosexuality and transgender Pornography Statutory rape EastEnders Twin Neighbours Turner syndrome Gonorrhoea Julian day Genital wart Gender role Sexual reproduction Harm reduction Age of consent Cybersex Elephant Daylight saving time Orgy Diaphragm (contraceptive) Parthenogenesis Menstrual cup Sex assignment Endometriosis Psoriasis Niddah Miscarriage Crystal methamphetamine and sex Estrus cycle Sterilization (surgical procedure) Intrauterine device History of intersex surgery Solar variation Eddie Guerrero 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Tocopherol Childlove movement Pedophilia Masters and Johnson Sexual addiction Abortion Computus Bondage (BDSM) Matthew 1:18 Intersexuality Julian calendar Testicle
