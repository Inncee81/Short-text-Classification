cephallic free hey does anyone know what this means i know cephallic means baby is head down but does the 'free' bit mean engaged or not im weeks pregnant and this was written on my last ante natal class cheers cephalic means head down like vertex but according to my pregnancy book 'free' relates to the head being felt above the brim which is confusing me compared to what the rest of it says so i cant decide if it either means fully engaged or not engaged at all but head down how confusing yes it means that your baby it head down but the free bit means that your baby is not gone into the pelvis so u are not engaged yet when your baby engages it will say etc they feel the babys head in 's and however much of the head they can feel thats wat they write Pregnancy Cephalic disorder Obstetrics Friends Anencephaly Hey Jude Premature birth Breastfeeding Glossary of graph theory Melanie Wilkes Miscarriage Prenatal diagnosis EastEnders Equine conformation Knots Landing Astrology Neighbours Beatles for Sale Endometriosis Brain Everwood Childbirth One Life to Live Intact dilation and extraction Days of our Lives Infant Poker jargon Pregnancy fetishism Infantilism Hat Arm Pelvis John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Babe Carey And Maggie Makes Three The Beatles discography Elvis and Me Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Treehouse of Horror IX Ectopic pregnancy Craniometry Landing at Anzac Cove Characters in the Smurfs Trainspotting (novel) Sex and the City Nana Caesarean section Boston Public Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an She Loves You In vitro fertilisation Abortion debate Cytomegalovirus Scientology beliefs and practices Charmed Leo Wyatt History of As the World Turns (2000-present) John Berryman Natal chart Sharon Tate Birth weight Speciesism Jordan (model) Aesthetic Realism Seven (film) Teenage pregnancy Ant Queen of Wands Singlish Hollyoaks Head louse Shark Satanic ritual abuse Stewie Griffin Media circus Katie Holmes Max Martin Abortion in the United States Non-native pronunciations of English PlayStation 2 Sexual revolution Series finale Toxoplasmosis Wallpaper group Radeon X Series Steganography The Crying of Lot 49 Human sexual behavior Publication of Darwin's theory Tsetse fly Blue Heelers The Family from One End Street Sexual orientation Maprotiline W.I.T.C.H.
