pregnancy and dogs i am weeks pregnant and my dog stresses me out he is a little over a year old and he is very active i am constantly yelling at him to stop get down lay down etc i plan to get him neutered next week do you think that it will calm him down enough my bf loves him to death and i think it is mostly because he is very obedient around him as soon as the door shuts the dog is different what do you suggest i do not want to get rid of him because i love him too he just stresses me out sometimes especially within the past week thanks in advance neutering him may calm him a little but don't count on it i second the motion of taking him to private obediance lessons private because you don't want to be in the line of other misbehaving dogs when you're that pregnant it wouldn't be very lady like for you to have to kick some dog's butt because it got out of control funny but sort of serious analyze the behavior differences between you and your bf to see what you might be able to change to get more obedience from the dog you obviously can't wrestle around with the dog very much right now which might be part of the problem dogs often have hierarchies that are established by rough housing and other dominance games the dog very well might see you as lower on the food chain than he is take him for walks with a short leash and do some training with him using positive reinforcement and possibly some negative reinforcement you have to be able to follow up with punishment though if he doesn't listen you may just want to tie him up somewhere not fun for him so that he will realize that you have some control you don't want to abuse him obviously but show him that you're boss you will also want to book a dog sitter for just after the baby is born an overly active dog can be a serious danger to a newborn Obedience training Dog training Garfield Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dog Childbirth Jumpstart 3rd Grade Knots Landing Brian Griffin Hazing Housebreaking Reservoir Dogs Dog agility Schutzhund Neighbours Kodocha Swimming Infantilism Breastfeeding Urinary incontinence The Death Gate Cycle EastEnders German grammar The Fairly OddParents Futurama (TV series - season 5) Aerial (dance move) Sonic the Hedgehog Jennifer Lopez The Marshall Mathers LP Dilbert Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Guinea pig Joke Ferret Cat Reinforcement Insulin Boston Public Traumatic incident reduction Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an G-Man (Half-Life) Elephant Shetland Sheepdog Simone Weil Trailer Park Boys German Shepherd Dog Charmed Folic acid Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Bulgarian language Horse President (game) Humphrey Bogart The Price Is Right Motivation Invader Zim John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Abortion Ron and Fez Billboard Hot 100 The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Alexander Technique Eddie Guerrero Stewie Griffin Bene Gesserit Abortion debate Tai Chi Chuan Socialization Montreal Screwjob Rule of St Benedict Kill Bill Piccolo Junior Saga Hip hop collaborations Anne Boleyn Breech birth Theory of conduct Vegeta Combine (Half-Life 2) Lucille Ball Professional wrestling slang Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Buttocks Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Milton H.
