whats going on tissue with period i got my period yesterday which wouldn't be so odd except for i just got it two weeks prior the one i had two weeks ago was normal however this one has been sooo heavy and dark and ive been passing a ton of tissue i recently had a miscarriage in june this period reminded me of it so i took a prego test it was neg what do you think is going on is this normal ive never passed things unless i was miscarrying i have to be careful about going to the doc cause i have no insurance thanks for any insight on this oh and i should add that i completed my miscarriage july before i got pregnant and after miscarriages i had similar and irregular periods to tell you the truth i've had those types of tissue passing since my late teens it is frightening to see but happens to a lot of women and is just the lining of the uterus 'shedding' every month the lining forms to get ready for a baby and when you don't have one your body gets rid of it it's totally normal and has nothing to do with pregnancy it can take a while for your body to get back into a regular cycle after a miscarriage i went through three months of bleeding every weeks after mine i didn't see your addition so let me add the bleeding you experienced weeks ago could still have been due to the miscarriage and what you're having now could be your actual period i wouldn't rule it out but i doubt you had another miscarriage Miscarriage Obstetrics Abortion Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Childbirth EastEnders Fertility awareness Polycystic ovary syndrome Anne Boleyn Androgen insensitivity syndrome Coeliac disease Stroke Intact dilation and extraction Prenatal diagnosis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pelvic inflammatory disease Twin Neighbours Spina bifida Urinary incontinence In vitro fertilisation Breastfeeding Marilyn Monroe Stomach cancer Abortion debate Cancer Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Breech birth Infantilism Gynecologic hemorrhage Tocopherol Infertility Morning sickness Obstetrical hemorrhage Premature birth Pregnancy test Psoriasis Endometrial cancer Human cloning Stem cell Gynaecology Cephalic disorder Cytomegalovirus Vaginal bleeding Traumatic incident reduction Malaria Prolactinoma Chemical abortion Friends Turner syndrome Hulk (comics) Antiphospholipid syndrome Uterus Birth control The Inside Solar eclipse Stillbirth Human height Poker jargon Partial-birth abortion Prostate cancer Theory of conduct Batman Insulin Hair Gonorrhoea Ovarian cancer Jet engine Jon Secada Hollyoaks Vampire Progesterone Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Acne Ectopic pregnancy RuneScape quests Intersexuality Sharon Tate Billboard Hot 100 Von Willebrand disease Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Breast cancer Miscarriage of justice Meme Variable star Diabetes mellitus Heinkel He 112 Wound Dinosaur Out-of-body experience Time Out of Mind Life insurance Hilary Duff Battle of Kursk Genital wart
