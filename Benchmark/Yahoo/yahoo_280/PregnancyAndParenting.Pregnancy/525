is being induced safe and is it more painful than natrually giving birth i was induced with my son it is quite safe they just give you some medicine thru an i v the contractions dilation start they also had to pop my water for me so they may do that too as far as the pain when you go into labor on your own the contractions build gradually they start out mild then increase when you're induced you go from nothing to full on labor its really drastic to tell you the truth but i got an epidural so that really helped another benefit to being induced is that it goes much quicker since you get right into it i was given the meds at my son was born just after so it was under hours it only took that long because i was pushing incorrectly but by i was dilated centimeters in active labor there is no threat to the baby so no need to worry about that good luck in labor congrats on the baby hope this helps and no you are not induced because you've had a troubled pregnancy i had a problem free pregnancy but my son went days past his due date on the other hand my sister in law had a million problems when she was pregnant she went into labor naturally days before her due date Childbirth Abortion Breastfeeding Abortion debate Obstetrics Breech birth Intact dilation and extraction Premature birth Paracetamol Caesarean section Unemployment Abortion in the United States Asthma Epidural Traumatic brain injury Trade union Weight training Days of our Lives Local anesthesia Psoriasis Tocopherol Chronic fatigue syndrome In vitro fertilisation Folic acid Multiple sclerosis Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Urinary incontinence Birth control Heracles Charmed Oral sex Carpal tunnel syndrome Turner syndrome Spina bifida EastEnders Toxoplasmosis Androgen insensitivity syndrome Humphrey Bogart Salary cap Stroke Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Opioid Kodocha Inflation Mental retardation Paroxetine Melanie Wilkes Multiple birth Teenage pregnancy Knots Landing Coeliac disease National Football League Labour economics Swimming Medicine Diabetes mellitus Health issues and the effects of cannabis Gonorrhoea Roe v.
