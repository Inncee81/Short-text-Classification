case of pregnant or not pregant me and my friend are sitting her and she is scared because for the last couple of months her periods been a little off for some they normally are days aparts and days long and of course she is but july she had sex but her partner kept messing with the condom he say it was falling off bout days laters she had brown discharge and pink that following friday she had her period but started off really light and got a little heavy then light now bout a week or so after her period she having tummy and she feels sick and been having a off and on fever she has wite and clear dischage no itching no ugly smell but she going crazy because she read on some web site that you could be pergnant and still get your period she thinking bout checking her cervix but i say if she is it wont be good for the baby and we cant by a test she has no money and her mother works at the clinic that gives free pregnancy test her parents are strick and she afraid to talk to them whats can she do oh and is there a way to tell if you pergnant by your cervix or how your cervix should be and is it good for her to check her cervix thank you is young yes but it does happen it's one thing that mothers have to wonder while their daughters grow up will she end up comming home knocked up well like i said it happens even if two people are being as safe as they possibly can when just not having sex i would wait until next month when she's suposed to start again her period and if she misses it it's a good indication that she is probably pregnant but she needs not to stress because doing so can delay your period as well which could be the case in this senerio parents are alot more understanding then people give them credit for i mean she's their baby of course they will cry and yell and stomp their feet but it's only because they will feel like they didn't do a good job but deep down inside they will love this child because it is a part of her and she is a part of them i would like i said wait to see if she misses her next period but try not to stress while waiting if she misses her period she needs to trust in her parents and have faith in herself sex comes with consequences regaurdless of how safe you play it but if she worries about it too much she will fool her body into thinking she is pregnant if she isn't already well good luck i hope i have helped ease your friends mind a little bit god bless oh and by the way checking your own cervix isn't a good idea at all can cause infections it's best to allow a doctor to do so they know what they are looking for as we just think we do Pregnancy Childbirth EastEnders Friends Gonorrhoea Miscarriage Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Jon Secada Sharon Tate Milton H.
