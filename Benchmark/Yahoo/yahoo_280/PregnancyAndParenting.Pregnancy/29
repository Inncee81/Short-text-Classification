maternity bra question all maternity bra's have no under wire i know this is because it is much more comfortable because as you grow you dont have hard wire digging into your chest belly but i heard years ago that its also because the metal wire can be bad for the growing baby or something by seeping into the skin has anyone else heard something like this or any other reasons why maternity bra's dont have wire all the nursing bras i buy have underwire i haven't bought a specifically maternity bra though an incorrectly fitting bra underwire or not can block milk ducts also underwire bras can cause problems if you wear them to bed because you lie on your side and the wire can block the ducts close to the armpit however the wire is completely covered and there is no way it would absorb into the skin i am also pretty sure that it is stainless steel otherwise it would rust a higher grade of stainless is what they use for surgical instruments and implants because it doesn't break down Brassiere Breastfeeding Stainless steel Caprice Bourret Wire Mattress Professional wrestling match types Prostate cancer Childbirth Urinary incontinence Breast Dairy Tire Undergarment Welding Passenger car Steel Drill bit Naval mine Knife Radiation therapy Air-raid shelter Violin Volleyball Titanium Shirt Nipple Cookware and bakeware Comanche Corrosion Professional wrestling holds Glossary of climbing terms Piano History of corsets Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Electrical wiring De Lorean DMC-12 Terminal ballistics Rais massacre Artificial pacemaker Circuit design Ford Crown Victoria RuneScape quests Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Aluminium Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Poker jargon Gastroesophageal reflux disease Overhead lines Sin City Androgen insensitivity syndrome Wound Fecal incontinence Gas metal arc welding Insulin Equine conformation Conker's Bad Fur Day Medicine Combine (Half-Life 2) Pebble bed reactor Seismic retrofit Thermal power station Plastic Pubic hair Arc welding Abortion Iron Tocopherol Platypus Bra (Dragon Ball) Scoliosis Body piercing Suture Cape Breton Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia Bullet Barbed wire Commodity markets P-47 Thunderbolt Traumatic brain injury Hydraulic machinery Bone fracture Hand grenade Pioneer Zephyr Transformer Corset Surveillance Publicly funded medicine Electric guitar Humphrey Bogart Melanie Wilkes Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Mastitis Electromagnetic spectrum YuYu Hakusho Printed circuit board Niobium Earring Nile crocodile Breech birth Penis
