do you think this is unfair whenever anyone says i have a nice figure infront of one of my friends she tell them it's because i haven't had kids but some people including my mum keep their figure after they've had kids and my friend didn't exactly have a figure like mine before she had a kid so basically what she's saying is that i am going to lose my figure big time when i've had a baby is she jealous of my figure the woman in question is probably just jealous of you i met a lady today mid 's who had kids one set of twins too and still looks figure wise if she could compete in a miss teen contest upon my compliment to her she claimed she doesn't do anything special but has always eaten healthy balanced meals leads an active life and believe me those kids of hers especially the twins does keep her active and gets a lot of fresh air and exercises through hiking in the forests surrounding her home riding a mountain bike along with the kids exploring the country side etc so there is no reason that you would should loose your figure after giving birth yes you do stand a chance of loosing youthful elasticity but exercising to retain that by firming up your muscle tone would combat that for sure once you do become pregnant speak to a gym instructor and ask for help ps from a man's p o v regardless of how you look if you were the mother of my kids you'd still be the most beautiful women in the world for me all men feel that way until women start imprinting their insecurities about their figures on their spouses and soon the poor man believes his wife when se constanly tells him how ugly she is EastEnders Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Little Britain Humphrey Bogart Friends About a Boy Knots Landing Daredevil Abortion debate Urinary incontinence Social rule Weight training Nation of Islam Baby Blues Triathlon Lance Armstrong Bodybuilding Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Kodocha Theory of conduct Kyle Broflovski Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Sharon Stone One Tree Hill (TV series) Fecal incontinence Big Brother (USA TV series) Shaggy dog story Taken Sharon Tate Recurring South Park characters Romulus and Remus Mojave people Blonde on Blonde Camp Lazlo Adoption Aikido History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Haven (TNG episode) YMCA The Contender (television series) Teenage pregnancy Equine conformation 1919 World Series Survivor (novel) Charmed Darth Vader Alois Hitler The Human Stain Tai Chi Chuan Rei Ayanami Pok__mon (anime) Cross-dressing Care Bears Mountaineering Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Boston Public X-Men: Evolution Mary, the mother of Jesus Fugu Wolfrider FoxTrot Jam (TV series) Characters in the Smurfs Extreme Programming Something Positive Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Pok__mon Chronicles Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon Infantilism Ben Johnson (athlete) Pregnancy Hollyoaks Garth Brooks The Apprentice 3 Kill Bill The Lovely Bones Wonder Woman (television series) Biology and sexual orientation Koopa Kid Stock character Gwen Stacy Simone Weil Final Fantasy: Unlimited Insulin The Marshall Mathers LP The Emancipation of Mimi Jewish humour Macbeth Massage The Catcher in the Rye Glossary of partner dance terms Doug Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Athenian democracy The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius
