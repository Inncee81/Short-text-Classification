is it normal to be disappointed about not having a baby shower i am almost weeks which is pretty early anyway i don't think i am going to have a baby shower and i am a little disapointed my dad is very controlling and will be furious when he finds out i'm pregnant he has a serious problem with multi racial babies ignorant bs in my opinion i am sure he will not let my mother have a baby shower for me my sister doesn't know i'm pregnant but i doubt she is responsible enough to plan a baby shower most of my close friends and realitives live far away or out of the country my bf's family also lives out of the country i know its a shallow thing to be disappointed about but i always thought i'd gt a chance to celeberate my baby to the woman who went on about i haven t told anyone i m pregnant i believe i mentioned that my close family and friends are far away i have told all of the people it is safe to tell my sister is a bit gossipy and if my dad were to find out through someone else it would not be safe for my mother or me i live three from them but that isnt too far for someone who is a bit of a nazi to drive to knock me around sorry i did read all of her comment what the h ll do you think i am thirteen or something my bfs family knows i just got back from spending a month with them and i am religious about seeing my doc thanks ladies for all the encouragment if all else fails i think i'll throw my own shower i don't care much about gift though it would make thing easier financially i'd really just enjoy the company after all this bed rest and more to come nope i would be very disappointed if i didn't get one so i threw my own crazy right well if you knew my family you would understand why no one thinks of those things so if all else fails throw yourself one that way you know everyone you would invited and it could be exactly the way you want it to be congrats on the baby oh and there's nothing wrong with multi racial babies i know a lot people with multi racial babies and they are just adorable i think the reason people do have a problem with it is because of there lack of education nothing makes you more ignorant than not being able to see past colors Social rule Humphrey Bogart Avenue Q Sharon Tate EastEnders Shaggy dog story Theory of conduct Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Knots Landing Sin City Episodes of Lost (Season 1) W.I.T.C.H.
