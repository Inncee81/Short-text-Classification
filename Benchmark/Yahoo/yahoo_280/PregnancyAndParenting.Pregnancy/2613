high bloodpressure hi went to the docs for routine check up weeks tomorrow and was told i had some protein in my urine and blood pressure of so doc called the hospital and they didnt seem too worried just to come in tomorrow at am i feel fine just a bit tired adn very swollen but thought if it anything to worry about they would have taken me in today what should i expect tomorrow adn should i bring my hospital bag with me as well as babies bag thanks in advace x went to the hospital tonight and all was fine they thought i might have a urine infection so have given me some tablets and i have to go to the original appointment tomorrow morning thanks for all your answers my blood pressure went up when i was weeks to about for the rest of my pregnancy it was monitored every other day and i was allowed to have my home birth still although i never had protein in my urine they might send you to the hospital to be monitored but even if you do have pre eclampsia they will probably keep an eye on you before they do anything it is highly unlikely that you are going to be whisked in for an emergency c section without any warning my sister in law had severe pre eclampsia but she was still allowed home and monitored for a few days before she had to have a c section hope it goes ok Prostate cancer Breastfeeding HIV test Caesarean section Urinary incontinence Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Eclampsia Dialysis Miscarriage Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Stroke Insulin Kidney Diabetes mellitus Penis Diabetic nephropathy Diabetic retinopathy Psoriasis Ebola Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome EastEnders Tuberculosis Doxepin Marburg virus Herpes simplex virus Menstrual cycle Maprotiline Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Hypoglycemia Myocardial infarction Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Ben Johnson (athlete) The Contender (television series) Premature birth STS-62 HELLP syndrome Stomach cancer Turner syndrome Intravenous therapy Melanie Wilkes Malaria Diabetic ketoacidosis Soap opera Medical prescription Abortion Gonorrhoea Infant Cocaine Prenatal care Drug test Certified Nursing Assistant Urine Breech birth Urination Blood Hemorrhagic stroke Blood pressure Pneumonia Protein-energy malnutrition Group A streptococcal infection 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Haven (TNG episode) Nephrotic syndrome Coeliac disease Episodes of Lost (Season 1) First aid W.
