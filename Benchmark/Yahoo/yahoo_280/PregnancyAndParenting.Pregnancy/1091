i am weeks preg today i felt like i was wet and i was but it didn't seem like it was urine when i lay down the wetness seems to stop it's only when i am standing of sitting that i feel like i am getting wet with fluid and i don't know if this is normal or if something is going on that shouldn't can anyone explain if it is normal during a pregnancy to feel like you are getting wet with fluid and in fact are the amount is small but i am still concerned it could just be vaginal discharge which becomes increasing abundant during pregnancy the discharge may have accumulated in the vagina while you were lying down and then just spilled out into your underwear when you stood up sometimes this discharge can be thick and creamy and sometimes it s thin and slimy sometimes it can be clear like water alternatively it could be urine this stress incontinence can be common in early and late pregnancy practicing kegels exercises can sometimes help prevent involuntary urine flow if you find this continues to be a real problem you may want to resort to the use of sanitary napkins i would talk to your doctor to make sure everything is normal your doctor will be able to accurately identify what is happening and can provide you with the tools you need Menstrual cup Prostate cancer Fecal incontinence Obstetrics Menstrual cycle Sanitary towel Breastfeeding Fertility awareness Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Pregnancy Childbirth Casting Gonorrhoea Cephalic disorder Battery (electricity) Tampon Urination Condom Kimberly-Clark Corporation Human sexual behavior Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Puberty Nocturnal emission Dialysis Tobacco smoking Androgen insensitivity syndrome Birth control Urinary system In vitro fertilisation Sexual intercourse Vulvovaginal health Douche Abortion Japanese toilet Oral sex Anal sex Masturbation Kidney Hypertension Bedwetting Orgasm HIV Theory of conduct Insulin Unemployment Stroke Drug test Vagina Safe sex Skene's gland Penis Premature birth Intersex surgery Water Premature ejaculation Miscarriage Urine Endometrial cancer Herpes simplex virus Thermal power station Child sexuality Viscosity Cytomegalovirus Drowning Strap-on dildo Hamster Psychiatric hospital Opportunity rover Cystoscopy Transformer 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Psoriasis Dehydration Floppy disk Shaggy dog story Diseases of the honeybee Blood pressure Rape Power station Sex toy Spina bifida Chernobyl accident Cancer Female ejaculation Turner syndrome Volcano Infantilism Ice core Tesla coil Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Diaper Mount Pinatubo Diabetic ketoacidosis Pneumonia Prolapse
