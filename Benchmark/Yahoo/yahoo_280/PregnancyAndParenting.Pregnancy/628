my baby stopped kicking should i be concerned i am weeks and my baby boy is a kicker he is usually moving so much that i am hoping that he will stop but since last night i havn't felt him very much at all i feel little movements but not much is that normal while it is true that babies sleep run out of room get tired etc any change in pattern should be brought to your doctors attention i'm sure he is just fine but i have seen too many cases where there are problems that could possibly have been prevented or at least had the outcome be better if the mother had come in sooner i don't want to scare you but i do want you to call and ask your doctor his advice it's always better to seek advice and find out everything is ok than to wait and wish that you had good luck Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Breech birth Infantilism Prostate cancer Childbirth Urinary incontinence Breastfeeding Jon Secada Milton H.
