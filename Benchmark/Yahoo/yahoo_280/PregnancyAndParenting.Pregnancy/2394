is childbirth really that painful i plan on having a kid one day preferably a baby girl but like does it hurt that bad ok only serious answers so far what if u get that shot does that make it any better is there a chance that the epidural will fail and there will still be pain what exactly is an epidural um i know that i can't choose my baby's sex i meant that i'm just hoping to have a girl but i'd be perfectly happy with a little boy too and is there like risks of birth or medical complications when u get an epidural ahh i'm scared what is waterbirth like with the epidural how painful on a scale of would you say it was without the epidural i heard that rarely less than in a one thousand epidurals may result in death but thats so unlikely i'm not really worried about that umm well anyone with any further advice please instant message me this is my first and i am actually excited for some strange reason when you get pregnant look into a birthing class it will prepare you and put you more at ease it is unfortunately going to hurt either way no matter what type of breathing you do etc after you give birth you will eventually forget just how bad it was from what i have read and will be ready to do it all over again my mother said that her first was unbearable but with her second it hurt but there wasn't nearly as much pain get the epidural when you feel that you can't take it any longer i plan to wait as long as possible because i don't want to feel any tearing etc when actually pushing Childbirth Breastfeeding Epidural Jon Secada Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Caesarean section Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Abortion debate Kodocha Friends Knots Landing One Tree Hill (TV series) Traumatic brain injury Adoption Humphrey Bogart Obstetrics Ben Johnson (athlete) Urinary incontinence Premature birth Social rule Shaggy dog story Theory of conduct Avenue Q W.I.T.C.H.
