does anyone else find these people annoying some people have obviously not lived a very interesting life and are happy in their little bubbles but i would love it if they stayed there and didn't answer questions with stupid comments and asking questions like ooo have you heard of the latest teenage pregnancy i know its nice n comfy with your head up ur bum but really come on so what teenagers get pregnant some are great parents some are not same with everyone else the real problem with the world are self justifying people like these who need to reaffirm themselves by making stupid comments and gossiping about how disgusting other people are anyone agree yea ok some stupid girl somewhere asked if she could get pregnant from dry humping so that means everyone in that age group is stupid tell u what i meet this person the other day who believed that they smoking while the breast feed is relaxing she was so there you go all people in that age group are stupid i don't think so and there is everything right about a mother and child whatever age as long as they love and take care of that child many older people don't care for their children aswell believeing this is only teenagers and that being a teenage mum instantly makes you bad is really small minded by the way i'm ur remark about throwing stones in glasshouses applies to you aswell if you don't like the question then why don't you go read something else you look stupid also whats grammer got to do with what i'm saying if you couldn't understand what i was saying them maybe you need to go back to school thanks to everyone else who agrees and i'm not getting worked up lol just putting my point across i think its horrible how some teenage mums can be spoken about and treated when age really isn't the point and some are wonderful and your right its better to ignore small minded people and live your life your way yea i'm not saying that some aren't shit i think thats my point there are those who are but thats whatever age and i agree some teenagers shouldn't have kids there're not ready mentally at all i just don't like this being what ppl think full stop some are good as with all ages like i said aswell i'm so no its not because i'm a teenage mum i agree completly some teenagers get pregnant like a friend of mine who is now planning her third and are great mums some arent but it's the same with adults who have kids some are good parents some aren't Little Britain Theory of conduct EastEnders Social rule Humphrey Bogart About a Boy Teenage pregnancy Kodocha Futurama (TV series - season 5) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sharon Tate Episodes of Lost (Season 1) One Tree Hill (TV series) Pok__mon Live!
