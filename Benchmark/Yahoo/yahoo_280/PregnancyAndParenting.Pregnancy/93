my daughter is and half months pregnant can she take antidepressants she has boughts of irrational fits of anger and she scares me i think she could benefit from welbutrin or something like that i've read that these drugs pose little or no harm to the unborn baby yes some anti deps can be okay to use during pregnancy but it's usually only prescribed when the mother becomes a danger to herself or her unborn the newer drugs are safer to use but she really has to talk to her doctor he'll know exactly what to give her i have depression mainly because i've had miscarriages and i immediately stopped taking my anti deps some days it's an uphill battle but i think it's better this way there are no conclusive studies to proof that these meds do not harm the baby even a slight risk to me is more than enough reason to stop taking them anti deps can take up to six weeks to start working and every type doesn't work for every person it can sometimes take months to find the right combination of medication to restore the imbalance so perhaps it's better if she just waits it out until the baby's born if she's not suicidal then i feel it's an unneeded risk in the end she has to decide for herself to seek help until such time as it's completely safe for her to take anti deps perhaps counseling is a better option you can help by just staying calm when she has one of her 'fits' and be there for her when she feels emotional light exercise is also very beneficial take her for a daily walk as it releases feel good hormones some red bush tea at any health store and relatively inexpensive with milk and honey is also known for it's calming effects and totally safe to use during pregnancy so next time she has an outburst make her some tea and tell her to sit down drink her tea and tell you what's wrong sometimes just talking and having a good cry helps to relieve some of those angry feelings Breastfeeding Clinical depression Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Pregnancy Folic acid Abortion Bipolar disorder Prostate cancer Chronic fatigue syndrome Miscarriage Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Childbirth Abortion debate Antidepressant Borderline personality disorder Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Paroxetine Psoriasis Neighbours Schizophrenia Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Birth control Clomipramine Herpes simplex virus Autism Omega-3 fatty acid Suicide Multiple sclerosis Coffee Harm reduction Tobacco smoking Milk Guinea pig Stomach cancer Migraine Maprotiline Acne EastEnders Traumatic brain injury Food and Drug Administration Abortion in the United States Prenatal diagnosis Doxepin Cytomegalovirus Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Charmed Anorexia nervosa Stroke Word of Wisdom Arguments for and against drug prohibition Hypoglycemia Roe v.
