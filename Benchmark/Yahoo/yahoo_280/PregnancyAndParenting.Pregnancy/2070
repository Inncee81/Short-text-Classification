i'm pregnant now what ok i have been seeing this man for the past months one problem is that he is married but since we have been together he has separated from his wife i never got my hopes up i took it for what it was well now i am pregnant i did not plan this i am in a top nursing school and i already have a daugher i am taking care of on my own he has been talking about getting me pregnant since day one and i always said no i dont want any kids untill i am married well due to an allergic reaction to my nuva ring i ended up not being protected and here we are i told him and he was a complete ass he said that he is responsible for his kids but how is he going to explaine this to his wife he feels so low and cant believe he did this to her i understand and if he did not feel guilty that would mean he was a cold person i am just upset because he is blaming me and dumping his feelings on me when i am the one who is probably going ot end up alone with this baby i am just so sad i am glad that he is worried about hurting his wife because that shows he has some heart i just need him to realize that this happend and it is his fault as much as mine and i need support i am on the right track in life and now it is going to be delayed once again i will have the baby and i will keep it no question there i dont have it in me for anything else i am just devastated everyone is going to be so dissapointed in me including myself i dont even know how to express exactly what he is doing that bothers me i guess it is that he dosnt care about how i feel at all i tried to end things with him a long time ago but he insisted i be patient and that this was no fling i mean he left his wife i feel horrible first off i want no insults i am a nursing student and shit happens i am a great mother my daughter is a genius who went to school at the age of i have my own house and car and i am financially stable i will not abort or adopt anyone leaving mean ass comment will be blocked i want real advice thank you seperation does not equal divorce and she is still his wife they have very young children together so yes this affects her i know he feels guilty for having an affair but if he did the deed then he needs to be man enough to face his consequences if he's separated from his wife then obviously there are other marriage problems going on he needs to be honest with his wife and tell her he's been having an affair and now you're pregnant as for you being disappointed in yourself you should be you had sex with a married man and now are pregnant but cheer up if he's a good man he will do the right thing and even if he doesn't divorce his wife and come live with you or marry you doesn't mean he won't be there for his child he probably feels trapped and scared which i would to if i had an affair and got someone pregnant give him space and see if he comes around you can't force someone to be with you and if you got pregnant then it's your fault too and unfortunatly being the woman you have to take the brunt of both of your actions even if that means raising another baby on your own also if you removed the nuva ring because of an infection why didn't you use a condom anyway no matter what this man does regarding his wife you need to take care of you and that baby and try not to get too stressed out good luck EastEnders Knots Landing Days of our Lives Neighbours Abortion debate Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Kodocha Jam (TV series) Divorce Pitaten History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an One Tree Hill (TV series) Sharon Tate Theory of conduct Infantilism Everwood Sex and the City Melanie Wilkes Shaggy dog story Humphrey Bogart Phoebe Halliwell Jennifer Lopez Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Shit Fathers' rights Incarnations of Immortality The Inside Breastfeeding Social rule Laura Schlessinger Plame affair Alois Hitler Boston Public Hillary Rodham Clinton Marilyn Monroe Marriage Past characters (Neighbours) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Another World (TV series) One Life to Live The Marshall Mathers LP About a Boy Piccolo Junior Saga Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Adoption James I of England Eddie Guerrero The Smoking Room Marie Antoinette Hollyoaks The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Urinary incontinence Scenes from a Memory Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Dynasty (TV series) Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Psoriasis Avenue Q The Critic Little Britain Taken Sin City Anne Boleyn Pok__mon Live!
