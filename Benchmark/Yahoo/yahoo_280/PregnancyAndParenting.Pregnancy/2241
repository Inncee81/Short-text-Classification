i am almost weeks pregnant and i am itching down there really bad also i feel alot of pressure could this just be an infection or what should i do hi kerry a congratulations on your little one yes i'm afraid i must agree with the majority of replies but will tell you why when you become pregnant the baby will take from your body the things that it needs to grow that can leave you a bit depleted so vitamins are good most people have said a yeast infection and they are probably right because it is characterised by itching if you have had any antibiotics in the last year they kill the good bacteria in your body and then any sugar or yeast products ie bread that you eat will increase the like hood of getting thrush you can replace the good bacteria with inner health from a health shop or yougurt that hasnt alot of sugar in it also your bodys temperature increases when you become pregnant and that gives something like a yeast infection or thrush a boost as well in australia we can go to chemist shop and get clonea cream across the counter they will explain the use but best to get doctor to check everything when you go next if there is any possibility that you have an std then they can flare up when your body is under the added burden of carrying a baby if you think that it is then get to doctor because those infections can affect the baby all the best mother of five Psoriasis Breastfeeding Folic acid Gonorrhoea Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Coeliac disease Common cold Milk Pasteurization Sexually-transmitted infection Bacteria Foodborne illness Eczema Guinea pig Diarrhea Acne Pneumonia Lactobacillus acidophilus Chronic fatigue syndrome Nutrition Brewery Beer Cephalexin Marmite Bread Oral sex Methamphetamine Menstrual cycle Fecal incontinence Sake Malaria Prostate cancer Conjunctivitis Cheese Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Veganism Hamster Escherichia coli O157:H7 Alcoholic beverage Tuberculosis Fancy rat Crohn's disease Egg (food) Coffee Group A streptococcal infection Food Garlic Yeast Dairy Natt__ Pregnancy Abortion debate Vitamin C Domestic rabbit Overpopulation Genetically modified food Intravenous therapy Photosynthesis Anthrax Medical analysis of circumcision Raw milk Antibiotic Miscarriage Toxoplasmosis Allergy Ethanol Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Cytomegalovirus Premature birth Protein-energy malnutrition Rabies HIV vaccine Clostridium difficile Adjustable gastric band Cystic fibrosis Niacin Herpes simplex virus Infectious disease Cider Livestock Tooth enamel Homeopathy Honey Pet skunk Traumatic brain injury Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Vegetarianism Immune system Dandruff Tocopherol Yoghurt
