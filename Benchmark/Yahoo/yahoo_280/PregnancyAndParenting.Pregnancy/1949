how is abortion done ok i am just to start off here anyways i hear it is a vacume that tears the baby to pieces or is it done some other way as for me i don't have to worry about such a horrible horrible choice to make as i am not sexually active and i dont have a boyfriend so please explain to me how do they do it and what tools do they use it depends on how far along in the pregnancy the woman is and which method she would prefer in the earliest pregnancies the woman can choose to have a medical abortion where she is given a regimen of pills the first pill stops the flow of hormones and nutrients to the pregnancy the second causes the uterus to contract to dispell the contents of the uterus the surgical method used in the vast majority of pregnancies is performed by dilating the cervix this can be done through medication rods of steadily increasing size or a stick of seaweed different clinics may use different methods after the cervix is dilated a hollow instrument is inserted that is attached to a vacuum hose the vacuum has a very strong suction and effectively empties the contents of the uterus scraping the uterus is no longer necessary with any tool other than the vacuum tube because the vacuum technology used is sufficient enough on its own this has served to make surgical abortions safer than they have ever been before the vast majority of pregnancies occur at weeks gestation when the fetus is the size of a small pea the tube is big enough to allow the fetus to pass through whole it is only with later pregnancies most pregnancies after weeks are performed for a legitimate health life or genetic defect reason where the suction may remove the fetal limbs instead of the whole saline abortions have not been performed since the s abortions during the rd trimester where a health or life reason must exist in order to be able to have the abortion are either labor and delivery abortions or c sections peace jenn ps if you have any more questions feel free to contact me Partial-birth abortion Androgen insensitivity syndrome Menstrual cycle Stenberg v.
