would you have an abortion why and why not what if the father says hes not ready and tells you to have one he didnt leave you or anything but would you still be with him would you have an abortion or keep the baby well this did happen to me we got pregnant and my bf told me he wasn't ready and that he wanted me to have an abortion despite the fact that we are both in our s and have been together yrs anyway i told him that regardless of what he thought i simply could not kill our baby it was a very hard time he moved out for a few weeks and i faced the prospect of being a young single mother but i knew that no matter how hopeless the situation felt at the time i knew that when i had my baby i would be eternally grateful that i never went through with abortion just because it suited the circumstances our families were also putting pressure on me to have an abortion as we are not married both just graduated from university etc but i stuck to my beliefs every pregnancy happens for a reason and if a woman becomes pregnant it is her responsibility to keep her child contraceptives do not always work believe me if you have sex there is always a chance you can get pregnant no matter how careful you are luckily things have turned out well for me my partner came round to the idea we are stronger than ever and now we are both very excited about our little one coming in november however i would have kept the baby regardless of his opinion i am so glad that i did not have an abortion simply because i felt forced into it some guys may react like this at first especially if they are young but i believe that if they were worth it at all in the first place then they will support the mother of their child some just need time to come round to the idea if a man leaves you because you wouldn't abort his child then good riddance to him its just unfortunate that getting pregnant is what it would take to realize what kind of person someone is Abortion debate Abortion Pregnancy EastEnders Knots Landing Teenage pregnancy Friends Birth control Abortion in the United States Humphrey Bogart Marilyn Monroe Roe v.
