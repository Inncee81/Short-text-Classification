can someone help me please well i went the dr days ago a little side clinic for an ultrasound and i am only weeks pregnant i did an ultrasound and i asked to see the baby and the tech said hold on a second so when she turned the monitor around she said i am not a dr but something doesn't look right because i don't see anything there but your pregnancy test shows positive maybe it's too early but you should see your own dr or maybe you can just come back in ten days so i have been worried because i really want this baby i havenot even contacted my dr yet because i am scared of ehat they might say you sound young first off don't panic i'm going to tell you some things that may be the case but take them as possibles not definites as weird as it may sound there's such a thing as a growth that mimics pregnancy it turns into something else before it even has a heart just cells and it's harmless it's just dissapointing also did you know that medications can cause a false positive pregnancy especially synthetic hormone based medications even some birth controls check the labels any medications your taking it is also possible that you can have something blocking the ability to see the baby so don't panic seriously also and stay calm you may have miscarried i want to stress first that i have gone through a miscarriage in which the baby died and quit developing very early and the technicians were hesitant to tell me they made me come back in a week don't wait ten days if that's the problem i walked around with worry for a week and my baby still inside me it has affected me psychologically for years after that you may need a dnc to remove it if that's the case please remember that a lot of women miscarry without knowing they're pregnant you may be one of the few that found out first babies stop developing like that for a reason it is either that or an unhealthy baby i don't want to scare you really but go to your doctor and find out it is the safest thing and if it is something bad like a miscarriage and you need someone to talk to i have been there and you can talk to me my email is on my profile Miscarriage Pregnancy Abortion Obstetrics Prostate cancer In vitro fertilisation Childbirth Menstrual cycle Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Prenatal diagnosis Intact dilation and extraction Turner syndrome The Inside EastEnders Breastfeeding Psoriasis Stroke Folic acid Twin Prenatal care Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Endometriosis Androgen insensitivity syndrome Spina bifida Stomach cancer Coeliac disease Friends Social rule Prolactinoma Ben Johnson (athlete) Abortion in the United States Ectopic pregnancy Oral contraceptive Cephalic disorder Infantilism Breast cancer Insulin Cytomegalovirus Medicine Time Out of Mind Radiation therapy Knots Landing Anne Boleyn Theory of conduct Breech birth Clinical depression Neighbours Polycystic ovary syndrome Pregnancy test Surveillance Shaggy dog story Puberty Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Hypertension Boom Town (Doctor Who) Acne Birth weight The Parting of the Ways Cancer HIV test Morning sickness Melanie Wilkes Infertility Fertility awareness Chemical abortion Blonde on Blonde StarCraft: Uprising Piccolo Junior Saga Cryptorchidism Fecal incontinence Chronic fatigue syndrome Characters of Lost Caffeine Postpartum depression Emergency contraception Anxiety Everwood Avenue Q Gonorrhoea Diazepam Panic attack Traumatic brain injury Partial-birth abortion Father's Day (Doctor Who) Birth control Mental retardation Propranolol Arguments for and against drug prohibition Pitaten Ultrasound Human height Addiction
