why is it such a big deal i am not asking this question to get anyone mad or for them to be rude but i would like to know i am not sure as to why people make such a big deal telling their partners that they are pregant i never did anything cute or funny to let my husband no i always looked at him and said i am pregnant why do some people make it such a big deal i think women who waited a really long time to get pregnant or always wanted a family thought at one point they couldn't get pregnant or the husband wanted a child really bad make it a big deal because they are so happy and overjoyed with emotions and they want to surprise their mate i was like you with all three of my pregnancies i am pregnant and that was it but some women look forward to that day when they can have a little baby and share it with the man they love EastEnders Knots Landing Pregnancy Humphrey Bogart Friends Shaggy dog story Full House Jennifer Lopez Eddie Guerrero Lucille Ball Abortion debate Episodes of Lost (Season 1) One Tree Hill (TV series) Marriage Married... with Children The Smoking Room One Life to Live Mojave people Princess Marie-Th__r__se-Charlotte History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Whitney Houston Cliff Richard The Ashlee Simpson Show Melanie Wilkes Divorce Kodocha Miscarriage Good Times Neighbours Angel (vampire) Daredevil Teenage pregnancy Days of our Lives Liza of Lambeth Breastfeeding Charmed Origin belief Miss Saigon Childfree Care Bears Ron and Fez Sami Brady History of sex Baby Blues Ocean's Twelve Polygamy Sexual intercourse Dead Like Me Boston Public In vitro fertilisation Jesse and Angie Hubbard Joke Internet phenomenon Jon Secada HMS Pinafore Big Brother UK series 6 Heracles Anne Boleyn Spina bifida Sex and the City Night (book) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Incarnations of Immortality Identity Crisis (comics) Maury Ayyavazhi mythology Dynasty (TV series) Hera Jewish humour Cytomegalovirus Tupac Shakur Dorothy L.
