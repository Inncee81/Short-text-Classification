sleeping patterns in early pregnancy i just got a positive pregnancy test last week and ever since then i find it very difficult to fall asleep at night i am tired throughout the day but when it comes time to go to bed i'm just not able to fall asleep much of the time i don't even feel tired at bedtime i don't usually take naps during the day and i do sleep in a little in the mornings but i still average about hours a night when i typically need at least hours i am not overly nervous or anxious about this baby as this will be our fourth child so that shouldn't be a factor in keeping me awake is this normal in past pregnancies i can only remember being exhausted in the first trimester i can't remember ever having a problem with not sleeping thanks in advance for your answers i had a lot of trouble sleeping during the first trimester i'm weeks now i can't remember how often i had trouble actually falling asleep but every night i would toss and turn all night and not be well rested at all in the morning no matter how exhausted i was when i went to bed i think that everyone's bodies are affected differently by the pregnancy hormones so what is normal for one might be different from what is normal for another i think that you should try to get in a nap during the day though because your body does need a lot of rest with all the work it is doing as you know from having three other babies good luck Sleep Insomnia Miscarriage Narcolepsy Breastfeeding Social rule Obstetrics Lucid dreaming Childbirth Prostate cancer Delayed sleep phase syndrome Siesta Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Melanie Wilkes Breech birth Out-of-body experience Cephalic disorder Sleep debt Polyphasic sleep Dream Mattress Abortion in the United States Coeliac disease Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma EastEnders In vitro fertilisation Sleep apnea Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Philosophical skepticism Turner syndrome Bedwetting Androgen insensitivity syndrome The Amber Spyglass Clinical depression Shaggy dog story Premature birth Chronic fatigue syndrome Insulin Daylight saving time Autism Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Blankets (graphic novel) Grief Apollo 8 Diabetic retinopathy Canonical hours Cat Oh My Goddess!
