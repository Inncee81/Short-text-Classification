if i am pregnant what should i say my fiance and i had sex and he ejaculated inside of me for the first time we were only days away from getting married when it happened we are getting married in days now i am going to go to my doctor when we come back from our honeymoon but if i am pregnant from that one time how far along will i be told that i am my period is suppose to start on the th advice please i know what you are thinking why couldn't you just wait and i'll tell ya it was just a thing of the moment it was feeling so good and i wanted him to now i'm wondering what will happen i'm not regreting anything at all just trying to prepare myself and what i should say to my family if i do come out pregnant thanks by the way everyone that has answered my question is very sweet thank you so much for your advice you all helped tremendously and if i could i'd pick you all as best answer thank you if you're concerned about what other people would think should you turn up pregnant don't worry everyone will just assume you conceived during your honeymoon and will think it's super romantic so don't even worry about what to say to other people if i were you though i wouldn't tell anyone other than your soon to be husband until you're through with your first trimester by that time most people won't be doing the math anyway however given the dates you've told us you were probably past your ovulation period when you had sex so there's honestly probably nothing to worry about i wouldn't even go to the doctor unless you missed your period and don't feel guilty about having sex before the wedding back in biblical times being betrothed meant you were definitely getting married and it was considered acceptable to consummate it's not like you had sex and then thought you should get married you were just weeks away it's all good congrats on your upcoming marriage Pregnancy Friends Marriage EastEnders Social rule Neighbours Humphrey Bogart Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Good Times Phoebe Halliwell Anne Boleyn 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Piccolo Junior Saga Fertility awareness One Tree Hill (TV series) Father's Day (Doctor Who) Abortion debate Jennifer Lopez Jam (TV series) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Charmed Sharon Tate Jon Secada Game show Boston Public Theory of conduct Fiddler on the Roof Birth control Series finale Glen Jacobs The Apprentice 2 Sexual abstinence Marie Antoinette Prince Edmund (Blackadder) The Ashlee Simpson Show Futurama (TV series - season 5) Sexual orientation Leo Wyatt The nature of God in Western theology Boom Town (Doctor Who) Elvis and Me One Life to Live Survivor (novel) The Inside Days of our Lives About a Boy Menstrual cycle God Emperor of Dune Lauren Bacall The Catcher in the Rye Avenue Q Zhao Yun Ben Johnson (athlete) Negima Coming of Age (TNG episode) Milton H.
