boyfriend issues regarding pregnancy i am seven weeks pregnant this will be my second child as i have a year old from a previous relationship i am and my boyfriend of years is i have fallen pregnant while having a coil has now been taken out i told my boyfriend last week and yesterday he came round and told me he feels like he is having a nervous breakdown all he keeps thinking about is the pregnancy and how old he is and how when he takes the little one to school everyone will think its his grandad ect ect he said he feels like he can not cope i think he blames me i now feel really really terrible and guilty but i'm not going to have a abortion just because of him but i just feel so guilty has anyone been in this situation and whats the best way to handle it p s he has told me he is going to spend time on his own i have no problem with that i really didn't want to be in a situation where i have children by different dads and who's dads didn't want them pregnancy is seen as mostly a woman's thing few women believe that their partner really understands what's involved and the fact is many of us dads to be don't we talk about it we show interest we empathise without going overboard we even try to read about it at least a little but let's face it our experience of having a baby is fairly removed from the real thing until we're face to face with nappy changing and sleep deprivation no dad can possibly relate to the minute by minute close to the heart kick in the gut reality of carrying a baby to term but we can participate we can be there to listen to see the first scan and listen to the first heartbeat etc get him involved so that the miracle can sink in it sounds like he has concerns about his age i am an 'older' dad of a beautiful month old and it is the best thing that has happened to me apart from meeting my wife so reassure him that it isn't a problem do older men make better dads here's your double jeopardy question for the day what do donald trump rod stewart kenny rogers michael douglas david letterman larry king paul mccartney and kevin costner all have in common hint they share this commonality with a growing number of men and no it's not just that they are all male wealthy and in the entertainment business give up they all fathered children in their s s or s and that makes them all part of an interesting new trend in parenting older dads are far more common and mainstream a number of reasons for the increase are due mostly to society today delaying marriage and child bearing to jumpstart that career a high divorce rate and then older men are marrying younger women hmmmm i m not going there the wonders of science and medical advancements have also increased our life expectancies men are simply living longer and many are deciding to start families later in life think david letterman and there are more than a few men who are in a special category called s o d which stands for start over dads though i m sure their first wives might have another name for it and starting a second family altogether the fascinating part is that research suggests that older dads are actually better at fathering to be fair this is such a new phenomenon and all the data isn t complete but there's enough for us to review and believe me have some very interesting discussions over here are just three of the most titillating findings about older dads older dads are more involved in child rearing no more absentee dads here these men are visible and want to be actively involved in raising junior and that is a huge plus to the kiddies one of the highest correlations of children who do well in life is that they had actively involved fathers in their lives those kids generally have higher self esteem more confidence are more secure handle stress better and display more empathy older dads are more nurturing they are warmer more generous with affection and more nurturing to their kids some of this may be due to a drop in testosterone levels but regardless they are mellower more relaxed and appear to be much calmer in their parenting older dads are more willing to share child responsibility this one is sure to make mothers cringe especially their first wives and children but older dads also tend to share in more of the daily child rearing tasks in fact they are three times more likely to do so than younger dads most of these older dads admitted that during their first round of fathering they were too caught up in their careers and didn t spend time with their children suddenly the kids were grown and they d missed out on the most important role of their lives they vowed not to make the same mistake again whether or not others agree that men should father later in life research shows that these older dads are taking their parenting role very seriously and loving every minute of it for the most part they are also more patient nurturing and more involved with their kids than younger fathers or when they were first time dads themselves it also appears that with age comes wisdom i guess the real k question is why does it take so long to figure out that what really matters most in life is savoring the time with our kids and making every moment count here are a few tips for older dads be sure to introduce yourself as the dad just a firm confident hi i m the father of this great kid will do better to introduce yourself correctly than to have to point out that you re not grandpa don't stress the stuff you can't do forget camping out in that pup tent with your child on those scouting overnighters you ll hate yourself the next morning playing those rough quick games of hoops on the asphalt won t do much for your knees either don t stress over what you can no longer do with your child focus on activities you can share attend those musicals ballgames movies and dinners with your kids find and do the things you will enjoy together spend quality time together kids really spell love as t i m e together keep doing what you re already doing with your child the most effective quality of a good parent is the relationship he has with his child best wishes nx One Tree Hill (TV series) About a Boy
