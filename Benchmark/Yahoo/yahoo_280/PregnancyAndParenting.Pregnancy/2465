quick question about delivery i was just wondering how many people are allowed in the delivery room when you go into labor i know i asked my mom she said but then my boyfriends sister had people in her room i was just wondering if there was a limit or if it differs depending on the hospital you go to i have a doctor appointment on august th but i was just seeing if anyone could tell me anything before hand thanks weeks day pregnant first pregnancy my boyfriend mom i definitely want in the delivery room with me but my boyfriends mom sister want to come in too i mean i'd feel more comfortable with less people so i'm thinking i'm only allowing people in with me it does depend on the hospital you go to something to think about you might not want to let everyone know how many people are allowed in there because when you are actually in labor you might want everyone the heck out of there you don't want to offend them so you could just say only people are allowed in here with me that way your not the bad guy trust me you don't want a lot of people around chatting and laughing carrying on while you are trying to squeeze a watermelon through the opening the size of a lemon Pregnancy Friends EastEnders Childbirth Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Ashlee Simpson Show Breech birth The Doctor Dances Futurama (TV series - season 2) Publicly funded medicine Avenue Q Abortion History of As the World Turns (2000-present) One Life to Live Liza of Lambeth Little Britain Milton H.
