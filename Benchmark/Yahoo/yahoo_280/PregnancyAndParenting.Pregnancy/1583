implantation bleeding hi all my cycle has been strange this month a week after my last period i experienced some light pinkish staining whenever i wiped ive never had this before i didnt really think any more of it but my partner and i had sex recently using the withdrawl method i know stupid and sometimes condoms another week past and the same thing happened again its now about a week until my next period and that spotting was just a few days ago im pretty much like clockwork and im fairly sure i ovulate right in the middle of the month i dont think the spotting was from him being too 'rough' because it occured both times when we hadnt had sex for a few days im not on any birth control pills so i know its not that i have a seven month old daughter but im not breastfeeding never have i dont think i have a uti either so obviously im slightly baffled and wondering if pregnancy is the likely cause any helps appreciated could very well be implantation bleeding this normally occurs between days after you ovulate i hope you get what you want x x Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Pregnancy Birth control Oral contraceptive Emergency contraception Breastfeeding Childbirth Hormone replacement therapy (trans) History of sex Progesterone Ovulation Sexual intercourse Puberty Sexual abstinence Estrus cycle AIDS Depo Provera Medical analysis of circumcision Condom Miscarriage Oral sex Sexual reproduction Endometriosis Ovarian cancer Safe sex Solar eclipse In vitro fertilisation Gonorrhoea Abortion Ovarian cyst Psoriasis Sex education EastEnders Polycystic ovary syndrome Niddah Twin Infertility Eastern Orthodox Church Neighbours Hiberno-English Ectopic pregnancy Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Breast Intrauterine device Obstetrics Abortion debate Astronomy on Mars Folic acid Ovary Clinical depression Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) HIV Time Fertilisation Herpes simplex virus Vitamin D Tocopherol Laura Schlessinger Sexual revolution Space opera in Scientology doctrine Sauna Endometrium Soap opera Multiple birth Social rule Human penis size Acne Dead Like Me Dysfunctional uterine bleeding O scale Sharon Tate Hearing impairment Guinea pig Bleed Like Me Computus Gregorian calendar Castration The Gap Cycle Stroke AFI 100 Years series Chinese calendar Breech birth Gregory Goodwin Pincus Billboard Hot 100 Jaundice Tooth enamel Year Sin City Pregnancy test Hyperinflation Grammatical tense Alanis Morissette 2000 Australian Grand Prix Negima Scientology beliefs and practices Transsexuality Year of the Spider
