am i close to haveing this baby i am wks preg my doc swept my membranes days ago and said that i was cm dialated and very thinned out today i lost my mucous plug but i read that doesnt even mean anything especially if you just had a vaginal exam or sex which i have im also worried bc the doc said my baby's heart rate has dropped alot from what it usually is but its ok bc babies will do that right before they come out but he still hasnt so im worried there might be something wrong can anyone help me i would really like to have this baby soon bc my husband leaves in days to go back over seas do you think ill have the baby before then it could be anytime now but noone can know for sure our friends were induced because he was going to iraq the doctor had no problem inducing her weeks before her due date for that reason as long as you're dilated a little you can be induced if you're up for the induction go for it so you can have time together as a family our friend had to leave hours after his son was born best wishes to you all Childbirth Miscarriage Obstetrics Abortion Androgen insensitivity syndrome Strap-on dildo Pregnancy Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Condom Cervix Intact dilation and extraction Abortion debate Time travel Electrophysiology In vitro fertilisation Gonorrhoea Days of our Lives Ventricular fibrillation Caesarean section Breastfeeding EastEnders Neighbours Kodocha Back to the Future timeline The Venture Bros.
