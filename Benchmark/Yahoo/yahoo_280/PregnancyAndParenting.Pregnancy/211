i am weeks pregnant with my first and i have no other problems other than really bad acne any suggestions i had the same problem and i got me some proactive you can get a day supply for it worked wonders and i still use it years later there are some other things you can try as well wash gently with a mild soap or cleanser twice a day and if you use moisturizer make sure it's oil free don't scrub your face with a washcloth since scrubbing can make the problem worse instead use your hands to gently wash your face pat your skin dry rather than rubbing it which can irritate acne don't squeeze rub or pop your pimples it'll make the problem worse and could lead to scarring if you wear makeup use products that are water not oil based and are labeled noncomedogenic or nonacnegenic meaning they won't clog your pores and cause breakouts be sure to wash off your makeup before going to bed too Acne Cleanser Fecal incontinence Tattoo Psoriasis Eczema Rosacea Menstrual cup Skin Hand washing Scar Hard water Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Manicure Cosmetics Shampoo Dairy Yarrow Towel Wound Urinary incontinence Smoke-screen Glycerin TLC Breastfeeding Sento Scarification Bacon Dialysis Vinegar Olive oil Milton H.
