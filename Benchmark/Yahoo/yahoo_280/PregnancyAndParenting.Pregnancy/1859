i am weeks and days i have been a total witch lately has anyone else been like this what can i do i don't like being angry all the time my hubby could help a little we are remodeling our house and we have to be done by tuesday and he just keeps putting things off he says that he will finish it in time but he keeps saying i don't feel like it right now besides that our bills are piling up and its hard to remember all of them i am just a nervous wreck what can i do to relieve all this stupid stress there was a point in my pregnancy that i looked at my boss when she said something to me and i imagined myself doing that thing in mortal kombat yes i'm that old where the guy rips the other guy's head off and his spine was still attached gross i know but i knew at that point that it was time for me to leave work for the day seriously that's about all you can do walk away from the situation and just breathe when you feel yourself stressing out do a little meditative breathing take a walk look out the window etc whatever it takes to get you away physically or mentally from whatever's setting you off as far as your husband goes there's not much you can do nagging won't help and it's obviously not doing you any good either for bills try paying them online if you don't already and if you can try to pay them or schedule them for a later date as soon as you receive them then shred or file them or whatever gets them out of your sight so it's one less thing to worry about most of all just remember that most of this is hormonal and it will pass i promise you will eventually feel like yourself again EastEnders Sub-Zero Scorpion (Mortal Kombat) 1957 World Series Urinary incontinence Friends Social rule Humphrey Bogart Mortal Kombat Sin City Marilyn Monroe Tai Chi Chuan Jon Secada The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Shao Kahn Fatality Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Osteoporosis Blonde on Blonde Procrastination Anxiety Breastfeeding Meditation Reptile (Mortal Kombat) Clinical depression Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Bubble Bobble Piccolo Junior Saga Out-of-body experience The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Insomnia Qigong The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Big Brother UK series 6 Days of our Lives Video game controversy Pregnancy Theory of conduct Indianapolis 500 Aphrodite Tenshinhan Nine Inch Nails Sant Baljit Singh Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Tae eul ju Everwood Immortality Pitaten Infantilism Breath of Fire III The nature of God in Western theology Grief Transactional analysis The Amber Spyglass Panic attack Kundalini Unemployment Combat stress reaction Childbirth Paul Is Dead Mortal Kombat: Deception Ocean's Twelve Alex Ferguson The Sims The Subtle Knife Sant Thakar Singh Anorexia nervosa Mattress Futurama (TV series - season 4) Equine conformation Will & Grace Milton H.
