unplanned pregnancy question i see that i am not the only one asking about unplanned pregnancies and i'd like to ask people to refrain from angry pro life commentary that is very hurtful during an already difficult time from saying that i should have used protection i did thanks anyhow i am in a long term relationship and still a university student i am in a yr post grad education program that includes intense student teaching practicum i just found out that i am pregnant and my due date would be approximately a month before grad depending on the exact date i may have to return to student teaching nearly immediately but either way i would have to return to school asap my boyfriend would be able to stay home with the baby but i am wondering is this insanity i realize it would be hard and that i have other options i had an abortion about years ago which i have regretted being talked into but have come to terms with i am having a hard time appreciate any help people might offer i should note that there isn't really any flexibility in my program notably in the student teaching which i would have to return to almost immediately also there isn't any daycare as the baby would be a newborn but my boyfriend could somehow stay home i'm sure the main concern is the initial month having a baby and then directly back to school student teaching and final exams no flexibility in my program for scheduling and no leaves of abscence allowed without reapplying all together thanks again for all these answers and support i found myself pregnant engaged and still with one year of school undergrad left my then fiance and i wrote out everything that we could think of and up until they induced we were anticipating adoption you also have to realize that we were like you and were in a long term relationship my husband had a job but was laid off due to outsourcing and i was in the hospital at weeks with preeclampsia was induced and delivered at weeks and our son spent a month in the nicu thankfully we qualified for healthwave the best thing i can suggest is to just keep talking about it will it be hard you better believe it i had my son on september and went back to school on october or around there and yes i had a c section as long as you have people who will be able to support you it's more than possible of course think of the baby first but trust yourself too you are very strong and if you have a will then you can do it and yes there will be times when you don't think you can do it there will be times when it gets so rough that you want to just give up every parent has been there you just have to suck it up and push on through just prepare yourself for the stares and the whispers our church kicked us out just keep working on making your relationship stronger than ever and keep working on your communication skills you're going to need a strong relationship and amazing communication skills if you're going to make it Friends EastEnders Pregnancy Boston Public Abortion Graduate school Abortion debate Knots Landing Breastfeeding One Tree Hill (TV series) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Neighbours Kodocha Everwood Teenage pregnancy A Course In Miracles Childbirth Avenue Q Social rule Education in Germany Twin Sex and the City Laura Schlessinger Pitaten Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Education in the People's Republic of China Homeschooling Plame affair Hikikomori Education in Romania Days of our Lives Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Kurt Angle Phoebe Halliwell Sex education Premature birth Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Education in Portugal Eddie Guerrero Education in France God Emperor of Dune Kender Human sexual behavior High school Smallville (Season 4) SAT GED Tai Chi Chuan Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Teacher The Death Gate Cycle Obstetrics Roe v.
