so i can't get pregnant while on my period or can i i've been told you can't get pregnant unless you're ovulating is this true and does it mean you cannot get pregnant while you're on your period also how exactly do u know when you're ovulating thanks my daughter was conceived while i was on the last day of my period not only that but we were using a condom and i was on the pill i didnt miss a pill and the condom didnt slip anybody who wants to argue with that fact is an idiot because my husband was away and we only had sex once in a month span and that was the time we got pregnant despite all the unlikelyhoods sperm can live in you for up to seven days so even if you arent ovulating at the time you have sex when you do ovulate sperm that is still present in your body can impregnate you plus sometimes our bodies just do weird things and ovulate at different times typically you ovulate weeks before your period you cant really know when you are ovulating unless you take ovulation tests or learn how to chart your cycle take your basal temperature every day and learn how to check your cervical mucous its best if you just use protection every time and its smart if you use more than one method also if you wouldnt be willing to have a baby with your sexual partner than you have no business sleeping with them in the first place thats just unfair to your potential child obviously babies can happen no matter how careful you are because my daughter is proof of that but i was and am married so it was not a problem for me just be aware that you can get pregnant any time you have sex so you better be darn sure of that decision Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Birth control Pregnancy Oral contraceptive Ovulation Emergency contraception In vitro fertilisation Abortion debate Sexual intercourse Infertility Sexual abstinence Niddah Fertilisation Oral sex Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Puberty Gonorrhoea Herpes simplex virus Sexual reproduction Androgen insensitivity syndrome Polycystic ovary syndrome Pornographic movie Pregnancy test AIDS EastEnders Knots Landing Days of our Lives Bird Flowering plant Neighbours Breastfeeding Prenatal diagnosis Infantilism Friends Estrus cycle History of sex One Tree Hill (TV series) Sex education Sexually-transmitted infection Genital wart Childbirth Boston Public Marriage Human George Costanza Sex and the City Sharon Tate Apollo 8 Crystal methamphetamine and sex Human papillomavirus Methamphetamine Jam (TV series) Endometriosis Urinary incontinence Autism Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Medical analysis of circumcision Heracles X chromosome Cytomegalovirus Obstetrics Eugenics Sexual orientation Cervical cancer Guinea pig Pope Joan Clinical depression Transsexuality Premature birth Orgasm Dissociative identity disorder Bene Gesserit Andrew Sullivan Psoriasis Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Polyamory Social rule Incest Alanis Morissette God Emperor of Dune Paradox Health issues and the effects of cannabis Anal sex Sex assignment Malaria Sauna Artificial insemination Marilyn Monroe Elvis and Me Humphrey Bogart Moss Adoption Madonna (entertainer)
