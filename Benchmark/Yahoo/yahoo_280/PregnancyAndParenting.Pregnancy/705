sisters pregnant ok here's the deal my sister is she is about to go off to college in september and things were just starting to come together for her unitl she found out a couple of days ago that she was months pregnant our family doesn't believe in abortion so my sister is keeping the baby the thing is she hasn't told my parents and i know when she tells them that they are going to flip i'm pretty sure my dad will kill my sisters boyfriend and my mom is the kind of person who when she gets mad she gets really mad i'm afraid of what will happen when she tells them and it kinda upsets me cuz i know there is nothing that i can do to make it any easier for her my sister and her boyfriend are already engaged it's more of a promise ring so i don't think it's a big deal but it just sucks because she was just starting to do something with her life anybody else have similar experiences advice anything will do thanks im and months pregnant my mom kind of figured it out before i had the chance to tell her because for some reason the preg test triggered my morning sickness lol and im starting up school agian in about a month so your sister can still go on to school even though shes pregnant as long as its a normal pregnancy it'll just be a little more difficult as far as your parent flipping out theres nothing you or your sister can do and hopefully they eventually get over it and relize that your sisters an adult with her own life to live as she sees fit good luck to both you and your sister Friends Kodocha Pregnancy Abortion debate Charmed Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Knots Landing Phoebe Halliwell Abortion Grandview, U.S.A.
