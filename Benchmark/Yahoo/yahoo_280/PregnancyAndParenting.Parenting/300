my month old son is becoming a brat how do i discipline him he screams and cries when he doesn't get what he wants i'm a single parent and its tough being both mother and father what's the best way to make him understand that he can't get everything at months their little minds don't understand why they can't have everything they understand mommy is the person who is the center of their life and she does everything for them i always tried to distract my kids when they acted in such a way take them out of the situation to a different room or whatever also remember their verbal skills aren't very good at that age and frustration of not being able to communicate can cause bratty behavior my daughter taught my grandson hand sign language at that age so he was able to express himself more remember to pick your battles with him for example not climbing on the counter is more important then him staying up an extra hour to play Autism Milton H.
