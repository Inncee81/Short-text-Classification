if you were spanked as a child would you do the same to your children there is a research out today from univ of bristol uk that says that you are times more likely to use corporal punishment on your children if you experienced that during your childhood i don't really think so but what do you think ah there is a reason the bible says spare the rod spoil the child i think it's an effective form of discipline even though it shouldn't be the only form i was spanked as a child and i can say that it was very effective a parent has to be consistent in what they say and do when it comes to discipline and always follow up on their word when spanking it should never be done out of anger the parent must calm down and explain to the child that he she loves him her very much and must discipline them so they can grow up with good character also the child must always be informed clearly of why they are being spanked also a parent should never spank using their hands the child must see the hands of the parent as loving and accepting there should always be a median my parents used a thin rod from a tree or a belt and they hit just hard enough to where it hurt but didn't leave any kind of bruises or marks when a child is young they learn to fear the rod and not the hands of the parents god created our behinds puffy padded for a reason lol Spanking Punishment Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an James Dobson Paddle (spanking) Child time-out Infantilism Child abuse Caning Tai Chi Chuan Infant baptism Domestic violence John the Baptist Theodicy Birching Human sexual behavior Transactional analysis Religion Incest Pitaten Children of God Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Fred Phelps The Death Gate Cycle EastEnders The nature of God in Western theology Parenting Pony Education Hurricane Neddy Hazing Diving John Wesley Avenue Q Merit Theory of conduct Brian Close Ned Flanders Rocko's Modern Life Moral Politics Ageplay Creation science Serial killer Milton H.
