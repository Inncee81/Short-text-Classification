how do you discipline a child who just won't listen to you please read details let's say a yr old child isn't misbehaving i e s he isn't running around causing trouble or s he isn't doing anything bad but when you tell him her to do something such as pick up the toys or go outside to the living room they don't listen what should a parent do about this do you still use the naughty spot or naughty chair method additional details optional read i don't believe in spanking because my parents used to physically discipline me but when i got old enough to endure the physical punishment i stopped listening to them i don't want my kids to be the same way i want my kids to respect me rather than to fear me i used the time out method with my son when he was that age i remember two particular instances that i tried this with him one time he threw his cheerios all over the living room floor he was about at the time i told him a couple of times to pick them up and he wouldn't i sat him in time out and told him he could get up when he decided to pick up his cheerios he was still there an hour later another time he wouldn't pick up his toys after being asked a couple of times and i told him that if he didn't i would put them up and he wouldn't be able to play with them did he pick them up no he went and put them in the closet for me while these strategies worked with my youngest i could not put him in time out where he could still interact and see the rest of the family he had to be sat in another room in order for the time out to be effective on him i didn't spank them because of the same reasons that you don't want to but they knew that i meant what i said each kid is different and what works for one will not necessarily work for another my oldest is a why kid and so was i i have found that giving him a reason works best in getting him to do as i ask he doesn't really care what it is as long as he knows why he is doing it i have to use because i said so on my youngest you know your child best and what will most be effective in getting your wishes wants across to them sometimes you just have to do a little tweeking Theory of conduct Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Milton H.
