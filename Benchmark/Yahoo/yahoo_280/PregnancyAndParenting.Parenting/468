why do people have children and then expect the government to take care of them i have been a single mom to two beautiful girls who both have down's syndrome i do receive ssi for their disability but i work full time i take my kids to a decent daycare i do not receive food stamps according to the gov't i make too much i know a lady who has kids she is years old and literally lives off the government she does not work yes i know that she is pysically and mentally able to work and literally gets free money from the government from housing to food stamps etc the government needs to start helping parents who help themselves not the other way around they need to stop giving money away to people who do not want to work just to let you guys know i do know this lady and her situation she's proud of being a mom of kids different fathers and that she's living off the government i am not saying that everybody in this situation is abusing it it just aggravates me when i hear from her own mouth i live off the government because i can exact words i agree with you as long as every teen girl knows even before she's pregnant how easy it is to get wic medicaid child support and free housing for the next yrs the longer the system will exist how is it fair that a woman who gets an education and waits for marriage before getting pregnant has to pay full healthcare and or insurance costs but a girl who dropped out of high school and got pregnant with her boyfriend gets everything paid for and never has to repay it plain and simple even mothers should have to pay back what they take from the system Health insurance Publicly funded medicine Health care in the United States Freeters Divorce Laura Schlessinger Bond Economy of the United States Social Security (United States) Medicare (Canada) Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Abortion debate Medicaid Kodocha Flat tax Student loan One Tree Hill (TV series) Friends Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Humphrey Bogart Fathers' rights Married... with Children Anorexia nervosa Tax Unemployment Hillary Rodham Clinton Medicare (United States) Transsexuality Food Stamp Program Knots Landing The Wack Pack Social issues in the United States Child support Breastfeeding Social welfare United States Postal Service Audrey Hepburn Amish Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus EastEnders Domestic violence Democratic Party (United States) Down syndrome Japanese tea ceremony Androgen insensitivity syndrome Emperor Yuan of Han Eating disorder Kyle Broflovski Money Insurance National Health Service The O.C.
