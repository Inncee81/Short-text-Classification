would you let this uncle near your kids he has embarassed me in the past with belittling jokes that were continual and not funny to me has wrestled with my daughter and won't stop when told too be her or me argues with me over why i don't circumsize my newborn or thinks i'm weird for some paretning decisions and asks me to explain myself i finally sent him an email asking him to stop these things as they offended us he got very angry and defensive after a half a year of not letting him near me or my kids he got more angry and called me he said that 'he will walk on egg shells around me since that is what i want' i think that is his way of saying he will try and that if i dont' get over my issues i will be an old angry bitter person who dies alone he also called me up and was swearing and yelling i listened for awhile and than just hung up and let him yell to himself this is my perception of course but i don't want him near us even if he does try am i wrong not to give him another chance to disresepect us i should add that he is funny and good looking and can be really really fun he has alot of charisma and a professional job and lots of friends this is what happens when i call him on his behavior but he is not always angry unclehood is a privilege not a right if he doesn't earn the opportunity to hang out with your kids he shouldn't get it Social rule Trailer Park Boys Piccolo Junior Saga Teen Girl Squad The Marshall Mathers LP Grandview, U.S.A.
