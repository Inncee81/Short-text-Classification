when is the best time to tell my year old step son that i'm not his real dad his biological dad has never been part of his life i've been in his life since he was months old i don't want to wait too late and take the chance that he'll resent me or his mother but i think he's too young to understand now any advice i should probably elaborate he also has two olders sisters and who are also my step children just letting it go is probably not going to be an option note i am in the process of adopting him it should be complete in the next month or two i think he should lnow as soon as possible i wouldnt want him to find out when he is in his teens and has so many hormones rushing through him that he wants to analize it be hurt that you lied to him all this time and then wonder what he did at that point that you are telling him now he will resent you tell him young when his little mind and heart are open to everything so that it becauses something ordinary and your love and care for him and the attention you give him at this young age will show him step or not you love him i would also advise being as nice as possible about why his real dad hasnt been part of his life give him a nice truthful answer that he can live with when we told my sister when she was that she was adopted she acted like it was no big deal but as the days when on she would ask questions and we would answer when she was in her teens she was in alot of trouble and if we had waited till then to tell her then it would have seemed like we were telling her then cause she was being so bad that we wanted her to know she didnt come from us i think that kids should know as soon as possible so that it feels normal to them and not that you asked but when you tell him you should make him feel that he filled a void in your life that you had till you got him such as all my life i wanted a little boy and when your mommy came into my life with you i was soo happy to finally get to be the daddy i always wanted to be you've made me so happy and proud to be your dad thank you for letting me be pat Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Social rule Jon Secada Knots Landing One Tree Hill (TV series) Bon Jovi Kodocha EastEnders The McGuire Sisters Rocko's Modern Life Friends The Fairly OddParents The Adventures of Pete & Pete Pitaten Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Kurt Cobain Past teachings of Prem Rawat Situation comedy Humphrey Bogart The Catcher in the Rye W.I.T.C.H.
