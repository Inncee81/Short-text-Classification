sometimes i wonder how many people consider good advice in the art of parenting and maybe without this ticket sometimes despite the parent s love they can actually hurt the child a deep kind of love that they can t get over entirety there are so many things that are wrong and it worries me that we might be creating a ruinous society many of us adults say that we turned out fine but how is fine defined they are just so many troubled and depressed people in the world i wonder if their parents were just a bit more devoted or more patient or more serious about their duty as a parent then maybe those people would be happy and enjoyed life but then maybe most just aren t devoted as i am or have too many problems of their own i wonder if enough parents really and truly try to work on the following rewards the child for telling the truth then they are not frightened into lying tell the child when they make mistakes and what they learned from them can accept that they are okay even when they blunder pay attention to the child and spend time with them then they can believe that they are important and worthwhile help the child explore their unique interests talents and potential l in order for the child to be happy they need to be them do the things they want the child to do then the child has a good positive model tell the child by their words and actions that they love them then the child i will feel loveable and will be able to love themselves and others aren t afraid to be firm with the child they prefer it it makes them feel more secure don t let the child form bad habits they have to rely on you to detect them in the early stages don't make the child feel smaller than they are it only makes them behave stupidly big don't correct the child in front of people if you can help it don't make the child feel that their mistakes are sins it upsets their set of values don't make rash promises remember the child feels badly let down when promises are broken don't tax the child s honesty too much they are easily frightened into telling lies don't be inconsistent that completely confuses the child and makes them lose faith in you don't tell the child their fears are silly they are terribly real to them and you can do much to reassure them if you try to understand don't ever suggest that you are perfect or infallible it gives them to great a shock when they discover that you are neither don't forget that the child can't thrive without lots of love and understanding but they don't need to tell you that do they i really believe that if we all worked on this together we can bring about a better and greater society what are your thoughts i really believe that if we all worked on this together we can bring about a better and greater society what are your thoughts i really believe that if we all worked on this together we can bring about a better and greater society what are your thoughts listen to this if you please http www youtube com watch v m qfljben k http www youtube com watch v risdgcsji i just want everyone to be the best that they can be edit i want everyone to try to be the best that they can be i know that we are flawed but we should strive for a better society i think you've got good ideas but i also think you sound arrogant and naive we are all human and we are flawed some people are incredibly poor or needy or ill or unable to truly care for a child well even though they want desperately to do so some people were so damaged in their own lives that they are not capable of giving to a child or relating to a child in a healthy way even though they love the child enormously some people would sware that they are doing everything you listed and yet their children would not agree some parents are incredibly unlucky and have extremely difficult children that they can not cope with even though they have done everything you say i have healthy smart beautiful children i try really hard to not think that it is based on what i have done but more just who they are and how lucky we are i know that life can be really really hard and i just hope that i don't need to learn to love and appreciate my children the hard way the world is a very difficult place for a large number of people and your suggestions may sound simple or obvious but they are also naive and arrogant Social rule Microeconomics Goodness and value theory Infantilism Religion Humphrey Bogart Ethics Karen Horney Jon Secada Milton H.
