how much should i get paid each hour to babysit it depends where you live if you live in a larger city more likely you'll be paid more for child i'd generally say anywhere from an hour depending on the needs and age of the child also if you've had any training i e taken any cpr classes or babysitting classes or if you're babysitting from your own home and also your age and experience is taken into account each additional child will probably only be more than what you'd be paid for just one again you have to factor in the age of the children for example twin babies would be much more work than a and year old child i'm assuming you are talking about babysitting only occassionally if this were a regular thing like babysitting everyday for the same people or something like a daycare situation then a salary would have to be negotiated with the parents generally it's a good idea to have an idea of what you'd like to be paid going into it but give the parents a range in price ultimately they will pay you what they feel is the correct amount if you ask for too much then it's likely you won't be asked to babysit again Day care Economic inequality Supply and demand Capital accumulation Education in the United States Health insurance Law of value Insurance Microeconomics Progressive tax Graduate school Member of the European Parliament Theory of conduct Anarchism and capitalism Childbirth Labor theory of value Salary Social Security (United States) Gross domestic product Kindergarten Inflation The nature of God in Western theology Professor Surplus value Education in the People's Republic of China Salary cap Canadian Pacific Railway Education Goodness and value theory Wheel of Fortune National Kidney Foundation Singapore Productive and unproductive labour Mutual fund Tax Calvin and Hobbes Contract Education in Romania Large numbers Scientology beliefs and practices Annuity Everwood Taxation in the United States Efficiency wages RuneScape Education in Japan Adoption Labour economics Public transport Working class Flat tax Bureaucracy Price discrimination Dog agility National Insurance Hollywood Squares Mixed martial arts Publicly funded medicine Drowning Breastfeeding Minimum wage Drama Blackjack Infantilism Intelligence quotient Transformation problem Hearing impairment Sant Thakar Singh Bond Social rule Social psychology Education in Australia Super Mario Bros. television series Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Credit card Milton H.
