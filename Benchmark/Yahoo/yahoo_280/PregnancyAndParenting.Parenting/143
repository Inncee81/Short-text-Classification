do you require your children to be involved in certain activities sports music skills etc we have done seasons of t ball softball basketball soccer as well as years of dance all three of my girls are in orchestra at school as well as girl scouts as far a dance goes that is a year commitment my younger two daughters love it and have been dancing for years my oldest did one year and quit which was fine she tried it followed through with her commitment and found that it wasn't her thing when it comes to music we decided with the expense of an instrument involved it had to be a two year commitment on the girls part my oldest has been playing the cello for years my middle has been playing the viola for years and my youngest has just finished her first year of viola we are fortunate that the music program in our school district is amazing and we have a great director who teaches all the kids from th grade through in orchestra our middle daughter decided this spring that she wanted to learn how to play the piano she went through the local sale paper and found a piano free u haul and also found a piano teacher next to her dance studio that could schedule her in between her saturday dance classes and so it goes we try to give our children all that we never had and insist that they follow through for a certian time frame we don't require that they do all these activities and there are many a night that we wish they didn't have anything scheduled so we could just stay home but you can't deny all that they are learning by partisapating in these activities all three of our girls carry great grades in school and have never been in trouble in or out of school we live by the calandar on the refrigerator and yes i do color code it if it isn't on the calandar it just doesn't happen in our house sometimes we do have conflicts but usually they can all be worked out i love christmas vacation and july i try to sehedule nothing durring those times so we can relax and enjoy some serious quiet time Humphrey Bogart Sergei Prokofiev Physical education Education in the United States Memorial High School (Hedwig Village, Texas) The Adventures of Pete & Pete Pitaten EastEnders One Tree Hill (TV series) Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Bon Jovi Sandy Koufax Education in the People's Republic of China Caulfield Grammar School Suzuki method Lynbrook High School Musical works of Mozart Shaggy dog story Viola Philip Glass Football (soccer) About a Boy Cello Disco Hey Jude Mario Davidovsky Double bass George Crumb Avenue Q Recess (TV series) Scenes from a Memory The Beatles discography Johann Sebastian Bach Ralph Vaughan Williams Queen (band) Piano trio Boy Scouts of America The Amazing Race Timpani Satchel Paige The Emancipation of Mimi Sharon Tate National Football League Garth Brooks Igor Stravinsky Education in Germany New Morning Carey Baptist Grammar School Sonata (music) Authentic performance Pet Sounds Kodocha Raffles Institution Hopkins School Murdock-Portal Elementary School Janet Jackson University of Massachusetts Amherst Witold Lutos__awski Tiny Toon Adventures We Belong Together Great Teacher Onizuka Milton H.
