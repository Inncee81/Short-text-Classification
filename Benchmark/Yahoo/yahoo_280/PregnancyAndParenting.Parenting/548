about daycare thing what step should i take i changed my year old daughter s daycare a month ago because this one is more convenient for us to drop off and pick up at first she s not willing to the daycare she said i don t know the kids i said to her never mind honey you don t know them because you are a new one after some days you ll know them and make friends with them the other day before when i asked her things of her daycare she said slowly in a small voice i like anri but anri and lili are friends i said one can have many friends you can tell her can we be friends she said i told her she said no i told her never mind honey she don t want make friends with you just because you re a new one and she don t know you well when you re familiar with your classmates you ll make many friends i know it take time for her to be familiar with her new daycare and she will make some friends there but i still feel kind of sorry for her so how should i do for her in such a situation what will you do all children are uncomfortable when going to a new daycare especially if she was comfortable in the other setting don't dismiss her fellings validate them with something like i know you want to have friends at school i want you to have friends at school too talk to the teacher and the director for ideas in your particular situation because they see your child either interact or hang back from the other children think about when you are put into new social situations most of us don't jump in on the first day your daughter has to get the feelings of security and comradship with the other children in this new setting but don't minimize her feelings she's probably lonely and has to find a way to break into a set group possibly when the new school year starts at the end of august or beginning of september other new children will start and she will find someone to bond with think of what has just happened to your daughter she has had the equivalency of a divorce from one daycare and a remarriage at the new daycare only she doesn't and didn't have a say in who she remarried and the other children have already formed alliances even as young as two or three years old and are not yet ready to let another child in it will happen gradually but do validate your daughter's feeling and ask her what could make it better then talk to the teacher perhaps with the numbers of children in the classroom the teacher has not noticed how unhappy your daughter seems from your description children are resilient but sometimes need adult intervention and guidance for moving into a group that is already set and paired she really is telling you that she doesn't know anyone and possibly doesn't know how to try to get to know some of the children that is where the teacher woould be helpful if she could have one of the other children show your daughtere how everything works and where everything is kept the housekeeping area is one in which children can pretend and get to know each other but sad as it is there are already cliques in preschool so try to advocate for your daughter and listen really listen to what she says then encourage without dismissing her feelings because the fact is that is how she feels right now that nobody wants to play with her and she has no friends find books on going to a new school and read them with her you could also look for books like nobody likes me i have no friends or something to that effect and then talk with your daughter about what the book suggests as possible solutions think about what you would do if you were in a similar situation we as adults can cope a little better but nobody wants to be left out or have no friends at school or work Kodocha Social rule Friends Kindergarten About a Boy Shaggy dog story Pitaten The Giver Laura Schlessinger Time Out of Mind Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Marilyn Monroe The Lovely Bones Transactional analysis Milton H.
