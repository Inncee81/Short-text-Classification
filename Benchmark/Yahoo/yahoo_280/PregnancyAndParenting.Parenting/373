giveing the birds the bees talk to a yr old i was checking my email and opend this spam there was a couple having sex and the woman was giving a b j to her man my daughter was next to me i tryed to exited out as quick as i could she asked me what was happening and i just said there playing i was so relieved when she didnt ask any further questions she the asked yesterday what game there playing and asked me today if me and her father play it she know not much about it and wondering how can i give the talk to her shes five i didnt think i would give this untill she was maybe or help is not too young in my opinion we wait way too long to talk to our kids about sex think of what they could learn on the bus by age or i would tell your daughter that people who love each other have sex and that involves lots of different things like what she saw on the screen you don't have to go into all the details but the more she senses it's naughty the more she'll seek out information elsewhere teach her now what it is and when the other kids are giggling on the bus at age she will just roll her eyes and have a more mature attitude About a Boy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sharon Tate Little Britain Grandview, U.S.A.
