does it bother you when parents don't see their kids potential anyone you know give examples not telling a yo to use his words talking to kids like their babies not being involved in school work etc yes it bothers me and it makes me angry i've got a cousin he's years old and since he was old enough to walk and talk my aunt was telling everyone who'd listen right in front of him and him himself that he was her cross to bear in life he was diagnosed in childhood with epilepsy and frontal lobe defect minor brain damage that caused memory lapses and concentration difficulties his mother made this worse by not helping him out at school with his remedial therapy or ever helping him with his after school work all through his life she has told him that he can't do this can't do that it took him until he was when i drove him in there to sit for his driver's license because all my aunt ever said was that he wouldn't pass it because he wasn't 'smart' enough to sit a written test only months ago he got his first 'real' job because she was constantly talking about how he wouldn't ever get anywhere with a career and would just have to do any job he could no matter how degrading for him he was working with kids half his age who got more money than he did he's never had a girlfriend hardly ever makes friends and usually lives in his own world half the time all because his mother chose to believe that he was useless instead of believing in him and doing the hard yards to help him one thing i'm certain of my kids will always be told that they can achieve anything they put their mind to and i'll damn well be helping them every step of the way Neighbours Aphasia Pitaten EastEnders Milton H.
