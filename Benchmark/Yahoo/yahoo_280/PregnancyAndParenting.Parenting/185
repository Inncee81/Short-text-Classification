please can someone help me feel better my mum died just days ago of a heart attack i miss her so much i feel like i never get to feeling good again i wasn't ready to say goodbye to her she was the best mum and i just wish she was back here with me i'm only and it feels like its really unfair for her to die so young and i feel really alone now i dont have any sisters or brothers how can i start to feel better and my friends are being really weird to me because i don't think they know what to say to me sorry this doesn't make much sense i'm just so upset and have nobody to talk to i'm so sorry for your loss it's so hard to lose a parent especially when you're so close and still so young i lost my mum last october and it took me nearly a week to just be able to function 'normally' again eat sleep go shopping etc the best advice i can give you is to let yourself grieve i put a lot of pressure on myself to 'move on' when my mum first died and i didn't realise it was going to be so hard don't be surprised if it takes you weeks or even months to really move past the grief stage i know that may not help right now but try to remember that as time goes on in my opinion what you're feeling is completely normal i also didn't have any siblings and it's easy to feel isolated find anybody you can to talk to that may be a family member or a friend if your friend's don't know what to say to you ring your closest friend and tell her him you need to talk i'm sure they'll be more than happy to listen also remember that there's lots of different feelings to grief anger depression disbelief etc don't be scared to let yourself feel these things above all don't try to make yourself 'feel better' if you don't want to just yet take the time you need to do this there's no expiry date on your feelings feel free to email me if you want to talk to someone i'll be happy to help you if i can good luck try and take care of yourself now and remember to talk to somebody when you need to once again i'm so sorry Pitaten Social rule EastEnders Grief Friends Shaggy dog story Piccolo Junior Saga About a Boy Cliff Richard Kodocha Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Time Out of Mind Phoebe Halliwell The Catcher in the Rye One Tree Hill (TV series) The Ashlee Simpson Show Singlish Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Jon Secada The Amber Spyglass Blood on the Tracks K' RuneScape quests Stillbirth W.I.T.C.H.
