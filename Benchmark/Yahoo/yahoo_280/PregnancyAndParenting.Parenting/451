at what age did you tell your child how a baby is born not how they were made just how the baby gets from mommy's belly to being born my year old asked me today and i was not prepared how old is old enough how did you explain i guess i should add that i am months pregnant with my rd child and that my year old came home from school last spring after i found out that i was pregnant again and told me that a friend had told her excatly how babies were made too hello i have always said that honesty is the best policy because if you make up stories about how babies are born the children will just end up being very confused of course whatever you tell the child it should be age appropriate but is shouldn't be a lie like you were delivered by a stork i have always believed in teaching children as young as two years old what the real names of their private parts are i told my nephews when they were two that they have a penis and girls have a vagina it may sound shocking but if you give children nicknames for their private parts they will think that their privates are dirty or that they should be ashamed of their bodies i would go to the library and get some age appropriate books that deal with a truthful but child friendly way of teaching kids about the birds and the bees and all about childbirth too there are many wonderfully illustrated books out there that teach children everything about how babies are made and what the names of their body parts are without being too graphic or inappropriate for a child to learn about Childbirth Kodocha EastEnders Infantilism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an One Tree Hill (TV series) Sharon Tate The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Pregnancy Urinary incontinence Melanie Wilkes Alois Hitler Breastfeeding Friends Days of our Lives Sant Thakar Singh Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Hera AFI 100 Years series Humphrey Bogart Joke Pitaten John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Lazarus Long Jam (TV series) Baby Blues Androgen insensitivity syndrome Paradise Lost Gwen Stacy The writing of Principia Mathematica Incarnations of Immortality Obi-Wan Kenobi Sugo The Family from One End Street Rais massacre 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Vulva One Life to Live Charmed The Island (2005 film) Boy Meets World Oral sex Scenes from a Memory Comanche Avenue Q Stork Survivor (novel) Arjuna Miss Saigon Domestic violence Sexual reproduction Doug Sex and the City The Amber Spyglass Characters of Lost Theory of conduct The Jazz Singer Night (book) Neighbours David Blunkett Peter Pan Pornographic movie Boston Public Virgin Mary in Islam Ayyavazhi mythology Dorothy L.
