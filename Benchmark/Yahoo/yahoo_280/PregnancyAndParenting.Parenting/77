does anyone know how to get a mother to care for her child a mother of three went to england with the two normal children and left the retarded one in jamaica with her dad who is now dead which the mom is aware of but refuses to take resposibility for the retarded child who doesnt really have anyone to care for her the childrens homes says shes too old for them to take her how can i get the mom to leave england and care for her shes with an old lady who took her while her father was hospitalized now the lady is stressed out i am not in a position to help besides searching for info for the old lady the child is y o but she acts like a y o i gues thats the level her brain is at no one can contact the mom or the other two sisters in england when the dad died she changed her address and contact number so no one would be able to contact her neither of them are british citizens there is nothing that the jamaican government is willing to do to help or so they say i don't understand who is looking after the child now you say she was left with the father but he's now dead so who's looking after her now and how old is she and who is this mother in relation to you not enough info here sounds like a sad situation though edit ok so she's with a well meaning old lady who now has her hands pretty full that's really sad do some research into care homes for older children in the area there must be places who can take her if her own mother doesn't want to know there's nothing you can do to make her look after her if she's capable of abandoning her own child she's clearly not the kind of mother who would do a good job anyway there may be a way of making her financially responsible for the care costs however it might be worth getting some legal advice for the old lady who is looking after her now tell the lady to see a lawyer who might specialise in cases like this the fact that the mother is out of the country however will make it harder to enforce any rulings worth a try though Fathers' rights Hillary Rodham Clinton Adoption Divorce Intelligence quotient Unemployment Pitaten British nationality law Fathers' rights movement in the UK Kodocha 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Virginia Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom Grandview, U.S.A.
