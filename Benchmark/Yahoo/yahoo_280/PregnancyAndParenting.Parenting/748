how should i spend my final days before i get shipped off to boarding school my daddy is sending me to a strict boarding school against my will i am disgusted as my expectation was that he would be sending me somewhere posh and much more prestigious rather this school appears to be designed to break my spirit further there are no boys and we must wear uniforms take rotc and have roommates the school also warned me i better not give them any trouble or else my daddy said if he gets a call that i am screwing around and has to come out there it's like miles that i can count on getting one heck of an ss beating my daddy said i had my chance and blew it and this will teach me not to be so spoiled i don't think so i have to work the rest of this week and then i only get a few days of freedom i also need to break up with my boyfriend which should not be too hard as he only loved me for pleasure i will miss my friends so much and the once spoiled carefree life i leave behind how can i get the most out of my final days emawee herbie and victoria your answers are extremely sweet thank you and good day emawee guess what you have a new impostor it's someone named emmawee asking a bunch of lesbian oriented questions and her avatar looks like yours i have her in my q a emawee herbie victoria and gussie have all provided extremely good answers a couple of the others too this will be an extremely difficult decision to award best answer thank you and good day well lori it will seem strange to not see any of your questions i will miss you as strange as that may seem i think if i were you i'd try spend as much time with my friends and family as i could try to keep an open mind on this new venture and look at it as an opportunity to make new friends and experience new things i have a feeling nothing can break your spirit you seem to have a zest for life i think you are far more intelligent than some of your questions reflected i wish you well in all you do try to let us know that you are doing ok take care Friends One Tree Hill (TV series) Social rule Sin City Infantilism Billboard Hot 100 Little Britain Undergrads Max Martin Pitaten Avenue Q Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Shaggy dog story The nature of God in Western theology Spice Girls Kodocha Eric Cartman EastEnders Charmed Will & Grace Strap-on dildo The Amber Spyglass Rent (musical) Ken Jennings Herbie Hancock Socrates Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Tupac Shakur About a Boy Theory of conduct Scenes from a Memory The Beatles discography Fleeming Jenkin Goodness and value theory Love and Theft Hollyoaks Religious Society of Friends Knots Landing Game show Boston Public American Psycho W.I.T.C.H.
