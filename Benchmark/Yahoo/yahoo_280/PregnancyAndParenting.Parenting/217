a question for other mothers i have a friend who i see twice a week unavoidable contact this person is always wanting to visit us but she has a child with very bad behaviour and a lack of respect for my children's belongings and feelings my children do not want this child to come to our home but the message and hints seem to have fallen on deaf ears i do not want to offend her by telling her that the my children do not like her child's behaviour nor do i and this is why they are never invited she knows that other people are invited what do i do would you tell the truth i am a daddy i hope this is ok for me to answer my wife and i actually had this same situation come up we have great friends with an only child who is let me be nice somewhat wild my son who is the same age does not want to be that rough when he plays with this kid my wife and i decided that everytime we got together with our friends we always made our date at a public place we chose busy parks most of the time so my son could play with other kids if the need arose resturants are always best bets also most malls have some sort of indoor playgrounds for kids to play in when it is raining we did this for a while and i think it probably sunk in that we always went to someplace public and they got the idea i hope this helps and i feel for your situation Social rule Friends Infantilism Ethics Transactional analysis The Catherine Tate Show Autism Theory of conduct Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Domestic violence Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh Therion (band) Book of Isaiah Darwin from Insectivorous plants to Worms Good Times EastEnders Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Kender Liam Gallagher Avenue Q Ages of Myst Humphrey Bogart Seinfeld Sydney Riot of 1879 Shaggy dog story Sant Thakar Singh Charles Darwin's views on religion Care Bears Tupac Shakur Transsexuality Married... with Children Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) The Catcher in the Rye Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Little Britain The Contender (television series) Tenali Ramakrishna The Emancipation of Mimi Kimi Finster Cindy Sheehan Pitaten The Karate Kid, Part III The Smoking Room Situation comedy Hearing impairment Poker jargon Serial killer Big Brother UK series 6 Hercules Robinson, 1st Baron Rosmead One Tree Hill (TV series) Breastfeeding Jeopardy!
