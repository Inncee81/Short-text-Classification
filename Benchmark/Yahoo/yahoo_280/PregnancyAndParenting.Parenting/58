what is your opinion on the madd proposal to make it mandatory to equip all cars with breathalizers that won't let the car start until you have taken it and passed i don't know how any parent can object to this idea i personally love it i cannot believe people are saying things like there are ways to get around it of course there are going to be ways around it but isn't that the case with everything that is like saying we might as well legalize drugs because there will always be people who get away with using drugs without getting caught i think that some people know that they're driving drunk and do it anyway but i also think that there are many people who think that may be just be buzzed and not realize that they are in fact drunk this device can show the person that he she is indeed drunk and keep that person from driving true people can have their friends blow in it for them i don't think most people realize how drunk that person that they're getting into the car with actually is maybe if they driver asks the passenger in the car to blow in it for him her it will make the passenger realize how drunk the driver is and offer to drive instead who knows but why not give it a chance i am willing to support anything that can reduce the number of alcohol related deaths in our country if a person does not drink and drive then i have no idea why they would have a problem with a device like this Mothers Against Drunk Driving Drunk driving (United States) Driver's license Bus accident at Carrollton, Kentucky in 1988 Knots Landing Automobile Alcoholics Anonymous Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story One Tree Hill (TV series) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Bluetooth Speed limit Drug test Social rule Consensual crime Driving under the influence Alcoholism Floppy disk Road traffic accident Taxicab About a Boy Sin City Suicide methods Seat belt Manual transmission Chris Amon The Critic Mach kernel Airbag Ontological argument Personal rapid transit Initial D Indianapolis 500 Harm reduction Ayrton Senna Rules of the road Transsexuality Carburetor Drag racing Blood alcohol content Intelligent design Seat belt legislation The Human Stain Abortion debate Formula One regulations Jacky Ickx Hard disk Brian Griffin Expert system Driving Grandview, U.S.A.
