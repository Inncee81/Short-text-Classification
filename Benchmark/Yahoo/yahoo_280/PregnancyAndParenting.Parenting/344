at what point do you have the talk with your kids you know the dreaded talk is there a good age i don't want to wait until school breaches the subject but i don't know how long to wait before my children bring it up help anxiety i have just kind of answered questions as we go along for example when my son was he wanted to know why i was eating daddy's face lol we explained kissing in age apropriate language it has just kind of flowed over the years he is now and just comes to us when he has questions he wanted to know if i was going to poop his sister out when i was pregnant lol reproduction talk every kid is different and you have to cater to their learning styles my son just was and is a naturally curious kid and very upfront and honest so i am the same with him i think and is a good age to start talking about changes in your body and then go from there make sure you guys are in a relaxed enviroment like doing something together you both enjoy playing baseball or fishing whatever it gives you something to do with your hands good luck Shaggy dog story The Ashlee Simpson Show Humphrey Bogart Qiyamah Pitaten Social rule Game show The Fairly OddParents Friends Theory of conduct Milton H.
