biracial children i am happily married with beautiful children i am of italian heritage and my husband is african american we have been together years our children are getting older now and have many questions about their cultures and background although my husband and i provide a loving home and environment i sometimes feel that my children are forced to choose a side they tend to relate better to me and my family my husband sometimes takes offense but they are mostly being raised around my family since his family lives in another state i am wondering if anyone with biracial children are in the same situation how do you provide equal education regarding racial backgrounds i'm black white all my life i lived in the black culture the ghetto but never really was fit in there partly b c i had pretty hair lighter skinned so automatically i had jealousy which made me have low self esteem self absorption the other factor maybe from how my father pre conceived our perception from our black culture for ex he made us feel like we would never fit in w the black crowd the jealousy stares made that seem true so since then i've been feeling really uncomfortable foreign in the black culture i do consider myself in between its so weird foreign to me when most kids whose black white identify themselves as black mostly its' very hard for me to comprehend that it's like learning to like math when you just don't get it see what i mean my reccomendation would be to keep your mixed child in both cultrues at the same time never make them feel like they are part of them is missing making them feel that they still don't know much about themselves Black (people) Multiracial African American Hispanic White (people) Rastafari movement Sexual orientation Human skin color Economic inequality Marilyn Monroe Narcissism Polyamory Physical attractiveness Skinhead Color Adoption Free will Autism Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) African American contemporary issues Jon Secada Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Social rule Blacks and Mormonism Human Renaissance Domestic violence Asperger syndrome Marriage Jealousy Family name Colonial mentality Monster's Ball Culture of the United States Racism Social psychology History of South Africa in the apartheid era Novel Hikikomori The Ashlee Simpson Show Avenue Q Transsexuality Nationalism Ghetto Cliff Richard Milton H.
