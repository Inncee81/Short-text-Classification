if you other mothers out there are like me you think your children are hilarious my question is what have they done today to crack you up sorry dads i did not try to leave you out i would love to hear your stories as well recently my husband and i just laughed our heads off at things our yr son has said he was not around when we were laughing in fact we always keep a straight face in front of him when he comes up with these things but after he goes asleep we just laugh about the things kid say we were at a cafe an a woman walked by and my son says to us she did not look attractive when i asked why he said because she was showing her breast pockets my husband was like what's that and he said that's the space in the boobs where old ladies keep their money he meant her cleavage the other night we go kiss him goodnight and he tells us he can't sleep we asked why not and he said because he keeps jerking off in bed i was in shock when he said this since he's only my husband who understands this better asked him what he meant by jerking off my son said you know how you try to fall asleep and all of a sudden your body jerks in the bed i'm just laughing as i type this my husband had to explain to him that jerking off was slang for masturbation which then lead to what's that i guess my husband forgot to cover that lesson during their birds and the bees conversation this one is about my yr old niece the other day she's in her car seat smearing lip gloss onto her lips with her finger she turns around and tells her grandma who is sitting next to her here grandma and sticks out her finger grandma then wipes my niece's finger with her own and proceeds to smear her lips with the gloss my niece looks at her with this face and says real loud 'grandma that's my booger lol she was giving her a booger she had just picked and wanted it wiped from her finger yuck you gotta love 'em Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Amber Spyglass EastEnders The Shining (film) Russian joke Humphrey Bogart Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Catcher in the Rye Futurama (TV series - season 5) Phoebe Buffay's songs Sin City I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Dead Like Me Garfield Mojave people The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Knots Landing Social rule Out-of-body experience Teen Girl Squad Otello 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Milton H.
