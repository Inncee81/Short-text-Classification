how do you handle santa claus and all of the other holiday myths in your house i don't want to get into a debate but many people are now secularizing themselves away from religion many of the holiday characters especially santa claus are linked with christianity and other religions i wanted to know if you still raise your kids into believing in the easter bunny santa claus tooth fairy or you are not bothering at all with the fairy tale stories just curious to see what newer parents are raising their kids to believe i was raised on all of the myth fairy tale holiday characters and was quite devastated when i found out they were not real and i was lied to about all of this by my parents my son knows about all the holiday characters he believes in them whole heartedly and i really like that he does young children need something like that the look on his face christmas morning when he runs to the christmas tree to see what santa brought is priceless same thing this year when he told me what a mess the easter bunny made with his carrots and celery my parents let me believe in everything they never came out and told me these people didn't exist i eventually got older and lost the excitement in it all one year i told them i was all grown up and didn't believe anymore that was the end of it no tears hopefully the same thing will happen with my son religious or not it's still fun to believe Santa Claus Christmas Mythology Rankin/Bass Saint Nicholas Easter Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Sluggy Freelance The Fairly OddParents Wizarding world Shaggy dog story About a Boy Christmas television special Christmas tradition Christmas worldwide EastEnders The Young Ones (TV series) Avenue Q The Nightmare Before Christmas Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Silent Night, Deadly Night Ed, Edd n Eddy Holiday Fairy Laura Schlessinger Establishment Clause of the First Amendment Resurrection of Jesus Kodocha South Park One Tree Hill (TV series) Cliff Richard RuneScape economy Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Religion Tiny Toon Adventures Supernatural Fat Man and Little Boy (Simpsons) Joke The Lovely Bones Jesus Code: Lyoko Easter Bunny All My Children Costume The Catcher in the Rye Pysanka The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask characters Origin belief Canonical hours Hilary Duff Futurama J.
