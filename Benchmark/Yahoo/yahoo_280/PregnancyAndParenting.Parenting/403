attention single dads only i am a single mother and just wanted to say i am proud of all you single daddies out there and sorry but haven't given much thought that yes single daddies do exist until someone made a nasty comment on a post of mine to single moms as what do they do to relax when handling it all by yourself i don't even have time to think honestly and i didn't mess up to be the bad one in that relationship and i love my child more than life itself i will do what it takes to take care of her hopefully you dads are appreciated and i'm sure seeing smiles on your child children's faces alone does make you feel that you're doing a good job single dads thank you for recognizing them you're right they're out there let's not forget the stay at home dads too Social rule Shaggy dog story The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Calvin and Hobbes Hey Jude Laura Schlessinger Kyle Broflovski Friends Fathers' rights The Fairly OddParents Billboard Hot 100 S.H.E Cindy Sheehan Father Pitaten Humphrey Bogart The Adventures of Pete & Pete Doug Grandview, U.S.A.
