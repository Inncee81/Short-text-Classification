what is the best explanation for the kind of work done by the louis and mary leakey this is for my summer project and i would like a good answer please it would be easy to simply say that the leakey's were archaeologists but let me give you the inside scoop as a person who has actually worked in their family's domain and knows about the family's political meddling this should make your summer project much more interesting the work done by the leakey family is that of impeding research in east african archaeology many external archaeologists scientists don't even want to step foot in east african archaeology because it is well understood that the leakeys own the political backing of hominid research in east africa and as of such if a non leakey affiliated archaeologist were to find anything hominid then they are expected to report it immediately and evacuate the dig site so that the leakey's crew may then come in and take over the site on top of this the leakeys have also blocked other activities that sought to increase archaeological knowledge such as the suggestion that was made last year that national museums of kenya nmk should be allowed to circulate their archaeology collections so that other archaeologists scientists could have better access to it in better equipped laboratories and that such a relationship may reinvigorate other archaeologists to do more research in east africa once they are more familiar with the collections nmk's collections include the olduvai artifacts as the leakey's carried all of this material out of tanzania as it turned out the leakeys pretended that this would detract from tourism which is rubbish as i hardly think that other archaeologists make up the bulk of kenyan tourists also since the collections which are on display are actually just casts as regular tourists don't know the difference greater tourism is really not affected at all in fact if other archaeologists became interested in the collections if anything this process of circulating the collections would not just provide nmk more revenue to improve their own labs and facilities but it would also attract a nominal increase in tourism because of the few archaeologist who may in fact want to stand up to the leakey monopoly and try and make a footing for themselves in east african archaeology the valuable hominid collections of nmk are currently kept in a secure vault where few ever enter these days thus stymieing a continued research on these collections these vaults are not accessible to tourists so besides the rare hi jacked archaeological dig or university lectures at affiliated universities what do the leakey's do their largest contribution is playing political games that stagnate east african archaeological research concerning hominid remains the majority of external archaeologists working in kenya are instead studying the artifacts left by hominids such as stone tools cut marked bones and evidence of fire pits as to stumble upon an actual hominid remain promises to ruin their expedition and wreck the continuity of the data with which they were collecting when the leakey's crew barges in ps i will add that the political era of the leakey family truly began with their son richard leakey who even worked completely outside of archaeology at times and was even a major part of president moi's dream team for rehabilitating kenyan political structures and paristatals hence the families residual political influence meave who married richard to join into the leakey family is not bad and keeps her nose clean but their daughter louise leakey is a complete terror she and her father richard were the ones who blocked the idea of circulating the collections she also has a venomous relationship with jack harris who is the primary contending archaeologist in the koobi fora region and leads the koobi fora field school which is what gives him most of his clout in the area because of the field school's relationship with the department of home affairs and nmk which conveniently pays some nice salaries to some kenyans involved with the field school and thus affords jack a fraction of the political influence that the leakeys possess on a separate note louise is despised by the pastoralist indigenous populations of northern kenya their migratory routes frequently bring them to the edge or even slightly into sibiloi national park and it are not beyond louise to buzz their livestock in her plane causing the livestock to stampede out of the park frequently injuring themselves charging through the rough terrain of that area since livestock is the primary economy of these people you can imagine how hurting or even causing the death of their livestock tends to be quite inflammatory some of the dasenech which i met said that they are not reluctant to purposely shooting at her plane in the hopes of a lucky hit the politics of east african archaeology is insane Archaeology Plame affair
