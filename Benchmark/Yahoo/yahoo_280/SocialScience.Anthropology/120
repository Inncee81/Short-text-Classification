darwin are humans still evolving if not when do you think we have reached the peak on the evolutionary scale yes genetic researchers are following the ticking clock of gene mutation backward on the world's creatures to solidify document the fact of evolution human chromosome is little more than the fusion of chimp chromosomes the chimp having humans the recent reverse engineering of dna broken down by bacteria has led to a prediction of a complete sequencing of the neanderthal dna within to yrs having recovered some dna from the t rex fossiles it appears that dinosar was related to modern chickens the driving force in evolution is the survivability of offspring to the age of reproduction thus increasing the gene pool ability to adapt to changing situations advances in medicine culture have allowed many that previously would have died in birth or early childhood to pass on their genes rather than deevolving as some would suggest this simply increases the gene pool allows for increased mutations that may or may not enhance future survivability specialized life forms find it hard to adapt to changing conditions dna researchers have followed the human migration path out of africa documented relatively recent evolution the last yrs in africa the me europe asia evolution constantly changes the world's lifeforms Species Human Macroevolution Human evolution Reproduction Mutation DNA repair Y chromosome Biology Evidence of evolution Cell (biology) Race Genetic algorithm Human skin color Biodiversity Chimpanzee Cancer Genetic engineering Mitochondrial genetics Meme History of evolutionary thought Sociocultural evolution Natural selection Life Molecular evolution Dinosaur Genetics Creationism Chimpanzee Genome Project Neanderthal Senescence Human Genome Project Junk DNA Polymerase chain reaction Meiosis X chromosome Genetic disorder Xenomorph Cell growth Plant breeding Origin of life Transposon Neutral theory of molecular evolution Multiregional hypothesis Mitochondrial Eve Homology (biology) Memetics Barbara McClintock Common descent Extinction Francis Crick Human genome Evolution of sex History of creationism Gene therapy Botany Intelligent design Genome Chromosome Carcinogenesis Cloning Helicobacter pylori Darwinism Human cloning Fermi paradox Modern evolutionary synthesis Cradle of Humanity Baldness Androgen insensitivity syndrome Lac operon Telomerase Apoptosis The Selfish Gene Anglo-Saxons Red Queen Sexual selection The Origin of Species H5N1 Stem cell Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Eukaryote Antiretroviral drug Created kind Indo-Aryan migration Genetic code Common Chimpanzee Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Technological singularity
