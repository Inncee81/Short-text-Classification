should the irish pm have the right to destroy historical mounds and henges to build a freeway our past is important to me it proves who we are as a people and how far we've come for good or ill to intentionally destroy sites instead of building a freeway around them makes little sense to me i copied the following from the letter of petition to stop this from www tarawatch org it explains better than i can but i urge everyone to sign the petition it takes less than a minute and the e mail addresses are blocked to protect those who sign quote and unquote can anyone doubt the profound cultural importance of tara and its unique landscape a landscape honoured and revered by millions throughout the world today and countless generations of irish people gone before us nowhere else in ireland is there a landscape that can claim the tuatha de danann celtic gods and goddesses st patrick daniel o connell thomas moore heroes and high kings from fionn maccumhail to brian boru an archaeological complex of temples tombs enclosures and henges spanning five millennia and a continuous place at the centre of irish spiritual cultural political and literary history as part of it s fabric yet it is through the very heart of this landscape that meath county council the nra and the irish government wish to build a motorway which will impact at least known sites according to dr conor newman this is just the tip of the iceberg there's no way if they can't build around some of the most historical and sacred sites on earth let 'em walk Irish mythology Hill of Tara Early history of Ireland Lebor Gab__la __renn Tuatha D__ Danann Celtic mythology Dublin History of Ireland Irish people Stonehenge Lug History of Dublin Ireland Fionn mac Cumhail M__rr__gan Pretender Celtic polytheism Archaeology Mythological Cycle Brian Boru Irish calendar Ringfort County Meath World Heritage Site Shinto Milesians (Irish) President of Ireland Irish language Bohermeen Irish Houses of Parliament Henge Temple Mount Minoan civilization Celt Irish Rebellion of 1798 Irish poetry Angkor Wat Druid Brian Lenihan Judicial functions of the House of Lords Economy of the Republic of Ireland Waterford Conchobar Maenmaige Ua Conchobhair Newgrange N3 road Jack Lynch Northern Ireland Prehistoric Britain Easter Proclamation Brighton Dublin statues and their nicknames Book of Mormon Motorway Sl__ine (comics) Intelligent design Fomorians The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Art in Ancient Greece Charles Stewart Parnell Christianization Babri Mosque Lord Chancellor Hibernia Kennington Park Book of Revelation Constitution of Ireland Troy The Bible and history Jesus Choctaw Resurrection of Jesus Temple in Jerusalem Archaeology and the Book of Mormon Elam Dorset Neolithic Athens Burial Hurling Northumberland End times Saint Patrick's Day Avebury The Irish Times Boston College Birmingham Margaret Thatcher Religion New Testament Supernatural Patrick Hillery Thrissur St. Mary's Pro-Cathedral Traffic sign Dermot MacMurrough Appeal
