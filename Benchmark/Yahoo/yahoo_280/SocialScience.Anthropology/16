the future is in movies we humans come from some where nobody knows though but could we be the aliens on earth i believe that with creations of fantasy movies like star trek star wars and so on are really memories that are enbeded in our dna what have you of our past from billions of years i believe that our mind has all the knowledge of what we see on tv but is slowly developing the only way we can create these thing is on film moreless recording creating our past enginering capabilities im sure the human mind does not just think of such technology movies for entertainment though the human mind is to young to distinguish what is entertainment and what is really a development of our future they see it as a great movie i see it as a recording of what we will be let me know if im crazy are the creatures in these movies just a fantasy creation or are they really a species that we have encountered in the past that are enbeded in our memories dna i do believe dna holds memories just has not been proven i guess it could be almost right you see humans are made of several different organs and types of cell and everyone of those know exactly what will be his job and how to do it so it could not be that far fetch to believes that humans have a purpose to travel in the space to spread life on hostile environment but i do not think that its really a genetic memory of what have happened before but think that we are predestinate to fill such purposed life is strong and is much less random than we may believed Science fiction film Free will Evolution Human Borg Species Predestination Star Trek: The Motion Picture Predestination paradox StarCraft Secret Missions Jean-Luc Picard Computer Xenomorph Vulcan (Star Trek) Star Trek Fermi paradox Biodiversity Creationism Macroevolution Klingon Prime Directive Time travel Ork (Warhammer 40,000) Xindi W.
