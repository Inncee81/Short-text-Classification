new ebay member got account questions i have no idea what i am doing i am selling something on ebay it says that i have an account balance after i listed my item i did not put a credit card on there and i won't i am just wondering is there any way to pay that balance out of the money i make on the item can it come out automatically once the sell is final if so how do i set that up like i said i really don't have any idea what i am doing i am new at this ebay thing please help me if you can thank you one more thing can you explain paypal to me i am really not understanding any of this hi i'm rather new to ebay too and i have a paypal acount my paypal account is linked to my checking account even though my papaly account balance is zero when i want to buy something off ebay it stil can deduct from my paypal acount which then deducts from my bank account since ther isn't any money in the paypal account itself or i can transfer money into my paypal account from my bank account but i've never felt the need to do so if you've made money on the item where did that money go into your paypal account log into paypal and see if the money is ther after the item sells then leave the amount of money in the paypal account which would cover the fee then after days ebay should automatically deduct that money from your paypal account if there isn't any money in your paypal account when ebay tries to automaticaly deduct it i believe paypal will take the money from whatever it's linked to like a credit card or checking account and then it wil pay ebay i hope i helped and didn't confuse you more PayPal Internet fraud Credit card E-gold Phishing Electronic commerce Electronic money Something Awful Poker jargon Bank Advance fee fraud Liberty Dollar Neopets MapleStory Live 8 Skype Money supply EFTPOS Octopus card Mortgage Cheque Insurance Debit card Personal finance Taxation in the United States Flat tax Short selling Auction Mutual fund Wheel of Fortune Automatic teller machine Payroll Wal-Mart Finance FairTax Betting (poker) Monetary policy Surveillance RuneScape cheats Surplus value SmartRider Citigroup Topps London Underground Arbitrage $ale of the Century Health savings account Student loan Capital accumulation Derivative (finance) Microeconomics Matrix scheme United Kingdom corporation tax Baccarat ROM image Money Animal Crossing Productive and unproductive labour Primerica Financial Services Credit card fraud Food Stamp Program Bank fraud The Amazing Race Annuity 401(k) Western Union Bond Copyleft Micropayment Deflation (economics) Virtual economy Law of value Depreciation Online shop Corporation Supply-side economics Money creation Financial audit Gold standard Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Something Awful Forums RuneScape economy United States Postal Service Final Fantasy Tactics Advance Say's law E-ZPass Economics Logic Marshall Plan Fiat money GunBound MMORPG Backup Euro Tax SCO-Linux controversies Social Security (United States)
