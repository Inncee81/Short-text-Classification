question about starting a business i'm about to start a business with someone who is from a foreign country he has connections with a company that wishes to expand to the u s he does not work for them but they are using him as a representative he is not a citizen or resident but he is legal for a short period of time is it legal to put him down as a shareholder well it's not my business but i tend to wonder why the company he works with is using him at all if he's not a citizen and they're using him as a representative it just sounds like some nigerian scammer hmm i'm not an attorney but i believe you can sell shares of a company to someone from another country that would give him voting rights and possibly responsibilities but i've learned the hard way do not give trust expect others to earn it i don't know the nature of your business or the company you wish to work with but i do know that it's hard to sue someone in another country so i would suggest you not give your 'partner' total control of anything without your oversight and certainly no control over the books or the ability to take out any sort of loan in the corporate name without your consent hope my little rant helped Corporation Corporate governance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Stock Security (finance) Economy of Nigeria Advance fee fraud Divorce Microsoft Rupert Murdoch United Kingdom corporation tax SCO-Linux controversies Intellectual property Trademark Capitalism Trade union Government of India Act 1935 Privatization Democracy Classified information Law firm Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe Mutual fund Monarchy in Canada Monetary policy Polyamory United States House of Representatives Lawyer Google Mikhail Khodorkovsky Board of directors Nike, Inc.
