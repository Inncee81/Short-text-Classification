what is the best way to bargain for a better salary after you have initially blown it i was following up on some resumes and got the regional manager of an applebee's on the phone immediately a phone interview ensued for which i did pretty well until he asked me my salary requirements i blurted out feeling so mad that i had not researched before calling he said that the least he pays his managers is we have scheduled an in person interview and i wondered if offered the job future negotions are out of the question two things come to mind i have years management experience at a bakery and years as a server in restaurants also my degree was in psychology which is of lowrelevance but still applicable i entered in my experience at salary com and found the median for someone like me is around range within first standard deviation k k does this sound right for an applebee's manager if offered the job should i try to renegotiate if so what would be the most convincing way thank you when you're negotiating salary the important thing to ask is what is the salary range of this position in other words no matter what the job where is the start point mid point and end point for the salary paid for that job you know the start point is apparently k so now you need to know the other data points to determine if the offer they give you is fair based on your experience the point of knowing is to place yourself between start and mid point so that you are positioned well for growth and salary increases if you are successful unless you have oodles of experience going above mid point can be risky as it can both heighten expectation and limit growth best of luck Economic inequality Milton H.
