how can i sell my small easy idea and is there any point ive come up with a really simple idea using nothing but a magnet me and my friends think it could be a good idea to jazz it up a bit and trying sell it its an idea that belongs in a gadget mag like boys stuff the problem is i cant seem to find anything to help market the idea all i can find are sites for big ideas and inventions and mine just wont cut it there can anyone help me if you have an idea you think will really go over you can talk to a patent attorney and they can check and see if any patents exist for it as well as help you patent the idea if that is too much since you said it is a simple idea you can always try to sell the licensing to market the product to a small company that makes similar items and then just collect on the licensing fees while not having to have a hands on situation dealing with promoting or selling it also you can try to make a few of your item and sell it at a local event like a fall festival and see how it goes over or ask a local store to display it and see if they will sell for a portion of the profits Intellectual property Software patent debate Trademark Insurance Pretty Good Privacy MP3 Copyright Copyleft Patent Lionel Corporation Microeconomics Public domain Plastic Fountain pen Steve Wozniak Apple Computer My Little Pony Technology Amazon.com RFID Supply and demand Star Trek Customizable Card Game Hash table Timeline of computing 1990-forward RuneScape cheats BitTorrent Consensus decision-making Bank Neopets Palm OS Television Patent medicine Texas Instruments Thomas Edison American individualist anarchism Nintendo Monopoly GNU General Public License Pharmaceutical company Internet fraud W.
