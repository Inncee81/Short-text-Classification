how to convince parents to let me work on business long story short i'm recently got funding for a video game company i co founded this sounds childish but my parents will freak out because i quit college over it i can go back to school however i have no intent to a business requires many more hours than college so if i was lazy i would pick college i love learning i read over pages of business books a day and i have a crystal clear vision of what i want to do in the next years to come and that does not require a degree i want to bring this to parents so that they don't get hurt however i'm that my decision to quit school is correct thanks i'm out space brief accomplishments without parental assistance my parents are not entrepreneurs started my first business at selling collectible cards later started a inspirational magazine for young entrepreneurs and grew to columnists a year ago started consulting firm for charities i grew the firm to about people at you are an adult unless they were funding your college and you misused their funds there really isn't anything they can do about it though i understand that you want to break it to them gently even if you didn't need one to get the funding you got i'd write up a business plan always a good idea with a new business anyway and present the plan to them when you talk to them so that they can see this is not just a whim and that you are serious and are looking not only at short term goals but long term goals as well also join your city's small business association if having connections there would be helpful to you some business classes even if you don't intend to major in anything might be something you think about taking down the road to get information from experienced people it seems you have the drive to make something like this work if you have the right tools and connections you should go far good luck Extreme Programming Transactional analysis Pitaten Theory of conduct Consensus decision-making Requirements analysis Enterprise content management Education Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Milton H.
