can you reduce your income tax from a job if you are also a small business owner i recently started a salon spa business with a partner the business is incorporated since it is a new business it is very tough to turn any sort of profit in these early months i decided to also start work in my profession as an engineer at ats i am currently getting taxed very high at rate currently alot of my income from this job is going into my small business can i move into a lower income tax bracket with ats by indicating i am also a small business owner can i reduce my taxes from my salaried job from the expenses incurred from the spa how can i improve my situation please note i live in ontario canada so corporation and tax laws may vary with the united states i'm not in canada so i don't know your tax laws here's what i'd do in the us the us has a s corp business structure that allows protection of a corporation but the tax liability flows through to your personal income tax you don't pay corporate taxes you only pay personal taxes on the profit loss from the business in this case it would allow you to write off every year every penny of loss from the salon if you can find a legal structure for the salon that allows you pass through tax status to your personal taxes and still maintain the integrity of your partnership then i'd sell your partners on converting Corporation United Kingdom corporation tax Tax Taxation in the United States Insurance Income trust FairTax Flat tax Microeconomics Limited liability company 401(k) Income tax Life insurance Warren Buffett Lloyd's of London Value added tax Progressive tax Law firm Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Gross domestic product Capital gains tax Dividend Income statement Medicare (Canada) Credit card Tort reform Trickle down effect Unemployment Trade union Personal finance Tax cut Property tax Security (finance) Corporate finance Corporate governance Donald Trump Leasing Economic inequality Incorporation (business) Rupert Murdoch United States Postal Service Salary cap Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Trust (Law) USA Lawyer Health insurance Tax haven Publicly funded medicine Economy of the United States Bond Free trade Civil union Kyoto Protocol Accounting methods Supply and demand Mergers and acquisitions Tariff Legal tender Capital accumulation Protectionism Price discrimination Operating surplus Tax protester Paul Martin Apple Computer Gold standard Illegal drug trade Social Security (United States) Wind power Minimum wage Apprenticeship Investment bank Inflation Measures of national income and output Contract Reaganomics Accountancy Airline Privatization Labor-power Member of the European Parliament Economy of India Bulk vending Divorce Surplus value Fair use Intellectual property Inheritance tax Corporate personhood
