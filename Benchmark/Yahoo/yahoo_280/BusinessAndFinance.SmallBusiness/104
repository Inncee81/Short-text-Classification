is starting an e bay business as lucrative as they would have you believe or is it just a handy second income is it worth contemplating as a source of main income if products are sourced at the right price i don't think it is worthwhile if you are planning on selling lots of small value items a point touched on in st answer by vanessa there is little profit there and it can almost not be worth it when you consider the time and effort involved the overheads are surprisingly high mainly ebay listing fees ebay final value fees ebays cut when your item sells and paypal fees a lot of people also refer to risks and the negative aspects of buying on ebay but lets not forget selling can have its difficulties to for the most simplest transaction you can receive endless e mails and complications from the buyer for every or so customers you will probably get difficult one the other thing to be aware of is how time consuming it is taking digital photos of your items setting up auctions replying to auction questions and customers packaging posting etc it all starts to add up and you begin to feel like there is not enough hours in the day especially if you have a ful time job my advice is if you are selling on e bay go for higher value items that have a good chance of selling where you can make a good profit margin this won't tie you up all week long you should give it a try and see what works for you the experience you gain quickly will make you aware of the kind of routine you could manage for having an ebay business Internet fraud Electronic commerce Auction Arbitrage Illegal drug trade Ra (board game) Amazon.com MMORPG Live 8 The Apprentice 2 Neopets Citigroup Islamic banking Marketing Surplus value Tax Productive and unproductive labour Advance fee fraud Something Awful Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Mutual fund Extreme Programming Capitalism Supply and demand Capital accumulation Privatization Bulk vending Mergers and acquisitions PayPal Labor theory of value Economics Price discrimination Short selling Insurance Wal-Mart Mortgage Public good Dot-com Gross domestic product $ale of the Century Commodore International United Kingdom corporation tax Monetary policy EverQuest FairTax Final Fantasy XI Subscription business model Grey market Predatory lending Cable television Monopoly Relationship marketing Health insurance Commodity Flat tax Strategic management Stock Investment bank Venture capital Inflation Sears Holdings Corporation Prices of production Surveillance Tariff Google Breastfeeding Loss leader Warranty Bank Poker jargon Progressive tax Apple Computer Retailer Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Gmail Outsourcing Sampling (music) Labour economics Business-to-consumer electronic commerce Anarchism and capitalism ITunes Music Store Intellectual property Halliburton Margin (finance) RuneScape skills Warren Buffett MapleStory Inventory RuneScape Scientology beliefs and practices Electronic Arts Pricing
