what are the pros and cons of working for pampered chef i am looking into becoming a pampered chef seller and i need to know the pros and cons it's a big decision for me and i don't want to just jump in and lose money because of the start up cost and i choose not to do it any help would be appreciated i've been doing pc for years and have been a director for years my own personal experience has been excellent for a minimal investment of you get in product and supplies and as a new consultant you earn about per show at my current show average and as a director i'm earning about per show not bad for part time work i personally like to do about shows per week for the income i desire there is no hidden start up cost with pc i had a friend that was signing up with another direct sales company ds and when she met with her recruiter was informed that she had to come up with another and was told to get a loan start up cost is so little you can make that back in your first shows easy and as a host you can start for as little as no inventory if you do decide to stop selling you don't have a room full of inventory to get rid of i know of neighbor that had inventory from her ds business she had to take out a loan to purchase this inventory and she told me that even if she sold it all she would still not be able to pay off the loan as interest charges have accrued the biggest problem for me is that as consultants we can earn the new product that comes out twice a year for free i earned the entire set for free in june for our fall products and then earned another set as a director i'm running out of room in my kitchen to store my new products the nd set i'm giving away my sisters love me minimum monthly sales requirement i've heard of many ds companies that if you don't make the minimum monthly sales you are chased down to either sell what you need to make the requirement or pay for it yourself with pc there is a minimum sales requirement to stay active of every other month and if you don't meet it you will get a letter reminding you and then you go inactive you lose your career sales which of course you don't want to do but if you do that is your decision and no one chases you down or forces you to pay the difference you have months to submit in comm sales in month and you're active again i have teacher consultants that go inactive now and then during the school year and then reactivate during the summer and let's be honest every other month can mean a measly catalog show to stay active easy trips ok i thought i had to do shows per week to earn trips and be in the top level of management after all that is how it is with the ds companies i've read about in my first full year with pc i earned a trip to rome rome italy not rome georgia i've also traveled to alaska disney california mexico and the past trip i opted for the gift certificate as i had already been there and so i purchased a free laptop for myself and my family you do not have to be a director to earn a vacation with pc anyone can earn a trip and there are different levels you can earn an incentive by doing average shows per month top trips with just shows per month and let me tell you the trips are fantastic bookings i did a homeshow for a friend last year i had a guest sales show received in free product that same show with pc would have gotten me in free product half price items and unlimited at plus my choice of one of items at off i teach my team that you have to truly believe that our host plan is the best around people would be crazy not to book a show someone that is not getting bookings is not working their business the right away i have shows for september yes more than my usual per week but i want that london trip and i can rest when i'm in london the bookings are out there you just have to approach it the right way and they are there i make contacts per day no matter what the more people you approach the more confident you are and the more bookings you'll attract my mom was involved with a ds company when i was little the catalog changed every weeks and she had to hand deliver them with my dad waiting in the car in the cold snow and then when she paid for her order she kept the percentage she made she was concerned when i started pc and told me why with pc the catalogs change two times per year not times per month and i receive a real paycheck direct deposit times per month my mom said when she kept her percentage it was just going through her fingers and she was always having to buy supplies and throw out catalogs because they expired by the way my mom is behind me now i took her with me on my incentive trip a few years ago a trip to mexico which was an unbelievable trip for both of us how fun commission rate yes there are other company's that may have a higher commission rate but with pc i do not pay for any of my host benefits what the host gets for hosting her show is all paid for by the company and for me i have no deliveries everything is shipped directly to the host as for my yes you do have to do a little recordkeeping for your taxes but you will have that with any ds company i will say there are many tax write offs new recipes are out for the season i took a dish to my family reunion am trying one out on my family tonight all those i get to write off yes i get to write off part of my grocery bill there are many other tax write offs and so for me it has turned out that the money i would have paid in taxes has been offset by what i spent in expenses my business has never affected my tax situation negatively i wouldn't keep doing it if it did my mom is a tax preparer and can answer any questions you have about submitting your taxes for your pc business yes there are times when i don't want to get in my office to work or am tired and don't want to go to my show but my husband reminds me do you think they are going to pay you for doing nothing yes it is a job but even when i'm tired and am not in the absolute best mood driving to my show i get there and get started and i love it i have such a good time at my shows i used to sit at my desk in my office and dream of a flexible job that would pay good money and give me time with my family and i have it it allows me the opportunity to have my own schedule i'm able to volunteer at my daughter's school attend field trips take a day to go to the beach with my girls in the summer be home when they are off school with an illness the benefits way outweigh the disadvantages i had planned on going back to a real job btw i was a hr assistant had an office everything when my daughter entered full day kindergarten years ago but now they are busier then ever and i so enjoy helping out at the school and getting to know the teacher and their friends and being there for them when they get home from school at pm my husband has a day off next week during the week and we're taking our daughters on one day trip to a local amusement park i didn't have to ask my boss for the day off i am my own boss and i always say yes when i ask for the day off now i am a sahm but this business works for full time workers college students retired persons anyone and you don't have to know how to cook sometimes i still don't know how to cook we teach you how to prepare recipes and demo the products it's adult show and tell i understand your hesitation i remember years ago sitting in the kitchen talking to my husband about the exact same thing and his response was what do you have to lose you try it it is a minimal cost you get a bunch of free products you try a hand ful of shows and make commission what is so bad about that and it just might be your dream job i can tell you that standing looking at the coliseum in rome and sitting on a gondola with my husband in venice was certainly an indication that this was my dream job it could be yours too i hope i answered your questions and concerns i would be happy to help you
