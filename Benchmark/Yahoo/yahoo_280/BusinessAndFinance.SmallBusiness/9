does anyone know about health codes for opening a carry out restaurant i would like to open a carry out only mexican food place does anyone know what i need can it just be in a rented place with a stove and sink refrigerator etc or does it have to be a certain way are there rules firstly if you have no experience in the restaurant business i'd advise that you work in restaurants for the next six months or so doing everything from bussing tables and washing dishes to waiting tables and cooking if they'll allow you back there and if you have the skills this will give you some of the work experience that you'll need to understand and run a restaurant profitably if this is your first business venture i would strongly recommend that you talk to a business counselor before you do anything especially spend money i'd call the local office of score go to http www score org and input your zip code to find the chapter nearest you the advice is free ask for someone who has a background in restaurants and they'll try their best to match you with the right counselor the counselor at score will most likely advise you to write a business plan which is very good advice because it will force you to dig out all of the start up details and the costs of starting your mexican carry out restaurant and force you to also understand all of the aspects of this business including the customers you'll concentrate on your market and how you'll get them to find out and want to come to your fabulous restaurant the location of the restaurant is important but doesn't make it successful to prove that all you have to do is walk down a street in your town where there are several nice restaurants all in a row and you'll find one or two that are empty while the others are very busy it has to do with menu ambiance and your reputation at the beginning and over time you also have to have food handling licenses the right zoning the right city and county licenses and permits and you have to be skilled at negotiating with your landlord about who'll stand the cost of the build out or the changes to the premises to make it ready for your look and feel you also have to worry about the normal business planning and management issues related to starting up any business take a look and read some of the articles at http www ychange com small business consulting articles html especially the ones about a business plan and starting a business also try their blog and their bulletin board hope this helped Restaurant Kitchen OpenDocument Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus X Window System Mozilla Firefox Extreme Programming Software engineering Expert system Economics United States Postal Service Common Unix Printing System Microsoft Coffeehouse Cable television Domain Name System Cross site scripting Information Technology Infrastructure Library Privatization Wal-Mart World Wide Web Breastfeeding Prostate cancer SAS System Sears Holdings Corporation Electronic commerce The Apprentice 2 Volleyball Thomas Paine Information Services Procurement Library Super Size Me Animal Crossing CPU cache Ryanair Neville Chamberlain Poker jargon Citigroup Fast food Fischer Random Chess Software patent debate Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Food Enterprise content management Tesco Warren Buffett XML Unemployment OpenOffice.org Mozilla Application Suite Scientology beliefs and practices Telephone numbering plan Alex Ferguson McDonald's Wget Melvin R.
