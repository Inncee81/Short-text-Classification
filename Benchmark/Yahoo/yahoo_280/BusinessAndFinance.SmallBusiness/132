are you business owner i will like to know what mistakes you made at the begining of your busines and later which it was painfull i was a business owner my first lesson was about going into business with people who are not qualified do not give people the benefit of the doubt the team needs to be solid and all need to contribute as planned create documents and have people sign them we had a generic business plan but things did not line up as we planned everyone says location is everything and that's true i believe that's why our deli bakery did not work out we had established a great clientele but not enough to stay afloat also you need to protect yourself and have a back up plan in case things go sour i think i'm going to lose my properties because things went sour we had a general partnership although its more work form a corporation or something to protect your assets also have enough money set aside to cover the first year or two while you are building your business good luck Trust (Law) USA Trademark Capitalism Intellectual property Corporation 401(k) Construction Life insurance Enron Corporation Dividend Insurance SCO-Linux controversies Contract Wal-Mart Trust (Law) non-USA Value system Leasing Donald Trump United Kingdom corporation tax Corporate personhood Slander and libel 2000 Australian Grand Prix Privatization Warren Buffett Pretty Good Privacy Limited liability company New York Giants Treaty of Waitangi Property law Income trust Ownership Offshoring Copyright law of the United Kingdom Small business Sears Holdings Corporation PRINCE2 Easement Information Technology Infrastructure Library Anarchism and capitalism Capital accumulation Tax Property (ownership right) Microeconomics Berkshire Hathaway Economy of Russia Babe Ruth Enterprise content management American Motors Copyright Copyleft Chinatown, Los Angeles, California Bank fraud Extreme Programming 1919 World Series Incorporation (business) School of Salamanca Trade secret Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Plame affair Bread Public good Mortgage Institutional fund management Security (finance) Business Corporate governance Universal Studios Woodward's Numerology Guild Carolina Panthers Law of value Public domain Anarchism and society Real estate developer Goodness and value theory Samuel Goldwyn Financial services Amway Salary cap Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Digital rights management Corporate finance New Deal Bretton Woods system Productive and unproductive labour Wealth Unlawful combatant Kelo v.
