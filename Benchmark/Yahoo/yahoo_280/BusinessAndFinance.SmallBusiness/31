has your business failed if so why was it lack of demand not enough sales i have had involvement with businesses that have failed in the past lack of demand resulting in lack of sales is the primary cause of most business failure if you have good sales revenue you can make mistakes in other areas of your business but eventually make the enterprise a success if given enough time on the other hand if you have insufficient sales revenue your business will almost certainly fail no matter how brilliantly managed the other aspects of your business are many businesses fail because they cannot or will not react to changes in the marketplace one example is the payphone business which has been decimated by the widespread use of cell phones another example is the small office supply stationary store which has been largely killed off by the national office supply chains like officemax and staples as well as places like costco and sam's club another big killer of small businesses is over expansion a business is successful but thinks it needs to expand in order to capitalize on market opportunities it hires new employees rents additional space and starts to think like a big company greatly increasing overhead revenue does not increase in proportion to costs and eventually the company finds it is in over its head i don't have the stats to prove it but i think that the most common time for a business to close its doors is just after it has greatly expanded Wal-Mart Microeconomics Electronic commerce Costco Economy of Russia Mergers and acquisitions Privatization Capitalism Management information system Monetary policy Prices of production Surplus value Supply and demand Bulk vending Unemployment IBM Tesco Monopoly Law of value Customer relationship management Strategic management Economics Asian financial crisis OfficeMax Berkshire Hathaway Asset Eaton's Labour economics Network effect Intellectual property Sears Holdings Corporation Tax Outsourcing Taxicab Economy of Africa Corporate governance Supply-side economics FairTax Cable television Airline Marvel Comics Target Corporation Payphone Hash table Floppy disk Trademark United Parcel Service Xerox Hydrogen economy Vendor Managed Inventory Electronic Arts History of the United States (1918-1945) Extreme Programming Publishing Criticisms of socialism Economy of India Management Monetarism Manitoba Hydro Price discrimination Dot-com Industrial Revolution CPU design Venture capital Intermediate consumption South African Breweries NEC Corporation Pharmaceutical company Retailer Natural monopoly Rational Unified Process Business ethics Software patent debate New Deal Citigroup Corporate finance Apple II family Agriculture in Australia Tariff Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Economic history of Canada Monopsony Filling station Fuel cell UK Singles Chart Microsoft French Second Republic Economy of Poland Nintendo Entertainment System
