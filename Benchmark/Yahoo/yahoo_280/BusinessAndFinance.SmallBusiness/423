how would i best explain the difference of retained profits and goodwill in the dissolving of a partnership much to my dismay my business partner and i no longer see eye to eye we started a small cleaning business about a year ago and now i would like to sell my share of the business to her for every job we got paid for we put away of total earnings into a savings account to help cover taxes in the future we have seen an accountant and are in agreement on the numbers however she does not seem to understand that half of the we put away would be my retained income and that the amount i am asking for the business are two seperate things she thinks that if she pays me my retained income that she has paid me for my share of the business and that we can dissolve the partnership but by doing this she is essentially just trying to give me my own money to pay for the business does anyone have any suggestions on how i can explain this to her in simple terms she says she in confused and doesn't undestand where i am coming from thanks for your help well first i am a cpa the structure of your partnership is what needs to be understood if you are an llp or llc then you received a k at the end of the year and that profit was taxable on your personal return even if you dissolve the partnership you will have the same type of income this year to date from your partnership if you don't have a formal llp or llc and are just working together as it sounds like you are then it's pretty simple first you should have been making estimated quarterly tax deposits which it sounds like you were not just putting it aside isn't correct so basically the money that you 'put aside' for taxes is a part of the business value and you should get your half of it and all assets of the business when you sale it to her the tax issue should be well documented you can email me if you need more informatin United Kingdom corporation tax Limited liability company Corporation Gross domestic product Insurance Tax Income trust Warren Buffett Flat tax Life insurance FairTax Surplus value Microeconomics Mutual fund Capital accumulation Dividend Taxation in the United States Lloyd's of London Trust (Law) USA Bond Enron Corporation Income statement Law of value Progressive tax SCO-Linux controversies Leasing Finance Credit card Capitalism Bank Capital gains tax Personal finance Value added tax Monetary policy Labor theory of value Citigroup Mortgage Prices of production Microcredit Hedge fund Social Security debate (United States) Corporate finance Deflation (economics) Economic rent Tax avoidance/evasion Security (finance) Income Measures of national income and output Money Intellectual property Tax bracket PE ratio Inheritance tax Economics Economy of India Economy of Russia Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Bank fraud Double taxation Divorce Kyoto Protocol Law firm Asset Health insurance Timeline of the Enron scandal Internet fraud Airline Extreme Programming Unemployment benefit Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Productive and unproductive labour Ponzi scheme Principal-agent problem Plame affair Salary cap Theory of conduct Wal-Mart Tax haven Accounting methods Poker jargon Bretton Woods system Inflation Trademark Cost of capital Compensation of employees Contract Interest Derivative (finance) Tax protester Health savings account
