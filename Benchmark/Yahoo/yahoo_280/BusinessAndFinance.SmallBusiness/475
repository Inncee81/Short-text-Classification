need a company name for a welding business ok i just recently posted the same question and received alot of answers that were not professional enough to use for a company name let me give you guys a little more info and maybe someone can help me someone mentioned using initals with a company name if i used any intials in the name they would be cmp that of course is my husband initials someone else asked the question what kind of welding well it would be tig mig stick we can do any kind of welding you need done also what i failed to include in my last question is that my husband specializies in welding and is certified on any kind of welding you need but he will contract on other things as well for example we done a water meter project as a matter of fact several of them so we would not only do welding services we would be willing to do any work that we are skilled at i was the one that recommended initials in the other question in my opinion cmp is great initials for a welding company let's elaborate on that though since you are familiar with a bunch of welding and are pretty much qualified to do a vast majority of work simply keep in general and not go into much detail of what kind of work you will be doing with your company name let them inquire that to you when they call you or have it on a website or something cmp welding is basic and simply perfect in my opinion you could also use one of his names if you want something like c m preston welding or whatever your last name is then with your website or other forms of advertising i would list what you've done pictures of projects certifications etc at my metal fabrication job they had a huge database of contractors welders construction companies painters neons cathodes companies for installation etc your goal is to get into databases like that so when companies look for a welder they will call you up and ask if you can help or whatever business might be slow at first but once word gets out it will be easy to get business you will actually turn down projects if they don't pay enough or optimistcally speaking you can hire more welders Fabrication (metal) Gas metal arc welding Arc welding Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Theory of conduct Shielded metal arc welding Electrode Plame affair Ashton-Tate Advance fee fraud Corrosion Quicksort Enterprise content management Expert system Eastern span replacement of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Bicycle frame ISO 9000 San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Public domain Contract Software engineering BASIC programming language The Apprentice 2 Tag Gas tungsten arc welding Metalworking Toastmasters International National Kidney Foundation Singapore Microsoft Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus SCO-Linux controversies Electrical engineering Education in the People's Republic of China Sword making Extreme Programming Paralegal 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Underwater welding Emacs Theodicy Textile manufacturing Annuity Philosophy of language Time Out of Mind Pretty Good Privacy English grammar Tuff GED Swift Vets and POWs for Truth Computer United Kingdom corporation tax The Internet Movie Database Deck (ship) Construction Intelligent design Hello world program U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Java programming language OpenDocument Air traffic controller Scientology beliefs and practices Flag of Denmark Information Services Procurement Library Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 The nature of God in Western theology Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Jennifer Lopez Epistemology Martial art Unix The Apprentice 3 No Child Left Behind Act Risk management Hiberno-English Mach kernel Joke Mediation Democracy G__del's incompleteness theorem Violin Copyleft Carbon dioxide Patent Motion picture rating system W.
