vote should i return the deposit i have a entertainment booking business i have recently began requiring that customers pay a deposit because business is really growing and we are losing too much money on clients who cancel at the last minute keeping us from scheduling someone else the other issue is that the entertainer gets over to the neighborhood and then gets lost and when he she tries to call the host hostess they don't answer the phone to give directions and thus the entertainer gives up just as a survey how many of you think its justified to require a deposit and for me to keep the deposit if the client backs out at the last minute keeping in mind if its a legitimate emergency i can credit the deposit for a future re scheduled party this one is the tricky one what about if we should keep the deposit if we drive all the way to the clients area get lost and the host hostess won't answer the telephone to help us find the place and we lose the booking your opinion please thanks if the client cancels at the last minute you may and should keep the deposit since it prevented you from booking other work in the interim however the responsibility to find the client's premises falls upon your business it's not the client's fault that you can't find them and they're not responsible to answer the phone to give you directions either you and your workers need to develop a system with maps so that you know where you're going and so that you show up on time Insurance Domain Name System Credit card Call centre Telephone booth Corporate governance Voice over IP Customer relationship management Whois Family Feud Surveillance Skype Internet fraud Phreaking Telephone numbering plan The Amazing Race North American Numbering Plan Bank Password Opinion poll Microsoft Security (finance) Outsourcing Wal-Mart Prostitution Data retention Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?
