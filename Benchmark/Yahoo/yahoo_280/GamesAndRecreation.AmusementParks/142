six flags great adventure does any know if six flags great adventure has a water park and what are some good rides there six flags great adventure was awesome i went there last month and it was one of the best times i've had in a long time there is a water park that on the great adventure grounds it's a great way to cool off in hot weather the slides are fun but nothing compared to some of the coasters the water park would be fun for younger kids but both young and old would like it el toro is by far the best wooden roller coast i've ever been on it doesn't feel like a wooden roller coast it's very smooth like a steel coaster it's fast and impressive kingda ka is the worlds fast and tallest roller coast in the world i was intimidated at first to go on it for it's sheer height and speed but honestly it wasn't bad at all it goes so fast you don't even realize how high you go up superman the ride was great too it's unlike any ride i'd ever been on batman was an awesome ride too great speed and awesome drops all the rides there are exceptional but those are the ones that i remember by heart most of the rides require a heght limit but if you are average height for years old you should be able to get on it no problem i highly recommend if you go to invest in a flash pass it seems really expensive but it felt so nice not to have to wait a two plus hours to ride a ride on average we never had to wait more than minutes to get on any ride it was money well spent Six Flags Great Adventure Kingda Ka Roller coaster Cedar Point Launched roller coaster Six Flags Over Texas Hersheypark Six Flags New England Amusement park Millennium Force Top Thrill Dragster Thorpe Park Six Flags Over Georgia Intamin AG Wooden roller coaster Knoebels Bolliger and Mabillard Kennywood Six Flags Magic Mountain Valleyfair!
