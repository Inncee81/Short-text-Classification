rollercoaster butterflies the worst part of roller coaters are the drops for me can i get rid of these butterflies in my stomach during the drop the butterflies is the blood rushing up it's the best part of the rollercoaster ride and the only reason i go on them in the first place you get the same feeling in an airplane if it loses altitude quickly what you do is flex all the muscles in your body and you won't feel it as much plus your mind will concentrate on flexing the easiest way to do that is to scream i can't stand when people scream on rollercoasters because for me that would take out all the fun i guess different people enjoy the rides for different reasons Thorpe Park Roller coaster Professional wrestling holds Alton Towers Hersheypark RollerCoaster Tycoon Professional wrestling throws Ekadasi Shen Gong Wu Suplex Anchor Powerbomb Aerial (dance move) Bob Backlund Car handling Anatomical terms of location Knoebels Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Bicycle Fixed-wing aircraft Final Destination 3 Humerus California Screamin' Dreamworld Self-harm Six Flags Magic Mountain Amusement ride Wonder Woman (television series) Stomach The Inside Six Flags Kentucky Kingdom New York Giants Bodybuilding Equine conformation Spice Girls Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Jackass: The Movie Chessington World of Adventures Disney's Animal Kingdom Bondage (BDSM) Weight training DDT (professional wrestling) Parachuting Shock Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Breech birth Front crawl Backstroke Livewires Stomach cancer Backbreaker Six Flags Over Texas Blackpool Pleasure Beach Swimming Paramount's Kings Dominion Snake Decompression sickness Paragliding Insect Holiday World & Splashin' Safari Escalator Hitchhiking Social rule Archery Naruto jutsu Butterfly stroke Carburetor Breaststroke Geri Halliwell Game show Muhammad Ali Silver Dollar City Theory of conduct Scream (film) Funfair Tlingit Animal testing Happy Tree Friends Blood (computer game) F.K.
