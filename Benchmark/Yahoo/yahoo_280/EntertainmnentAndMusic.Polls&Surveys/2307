do you think seriously that you have ever seen a ghost angel i did look and i gave you a star guess i should have paid more attention to similar questions great minds really do think alike lol i was at the time of my first encounter i was laying fast asleep next to my little sister at the time she had claimed that she kept having a man wake up to her at night and shake her so mum sent her to sleep with me i had awoken to a strange noise and turned around the first thing i saw was our fan whiched seemed to of been lifted from the ground and the protection cover taken off it was facing my little sister as if the ghost was trying to harm her i stood still unable to fully understand what was going on i was frozen with fear but out of no where my father enters the room and turns on the light the fan drops to the ground and everything becomes normal my father said he woke up from a bad dream about my little sister dying and he came to check up on us to this day i still dont know fully what happend this night but this is my personal expereince i guess seeing really is believeing but i know what i saw that night and i will never ever in my life forget this even know when i watch ghost stories or with people who have claimed to of seen them a part of me doubts them untill i think back to that night Out-of-body experience Lucid dreaming Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Milton H.
