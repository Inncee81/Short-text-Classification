should i tell her first when i was a child i had to live with a very serious birth defect a third nipple now i am about to wed and am wondering should i tell my intended before or after the ceremony it is three inches long and believe it or not it kind of resembles whoopi goldberg it is is also situated just above my navel should i tell her at all or am i making too much of it living with this third nipple for all your life must have made certain situations quite uncomfortable for you you were probably quite self conscious of this at the public pool or while dressing down for gym class when you were younger you thought that this extra appendage was normal and just assumed that three nipples was the normal thing to have assuming that this three inch long nipple is located in the center of your chest i am amazed to think that your 'intended' has not yet discovered it how did you keep it secretly hidden from her during heavy petting and foreplay perhaps you have a lot of chest hair and kinda tuck it in or tie it in a small knot and pretend it is a mole if it resembles whoopie goldberg whom i much admire it would be priceless to sell it on ebay being situated right over the navel area i am wondering if it reacts to external stimuli when excited if it bothers you this much and think that it will cause some distraction on the honeymoon try tying a string on it to cut off the blood flow and eventually it will drop off on it s own that is if your lady doesn't object who knows she may like the extra appendage Breastfeeding Anne Boleyn Friends Brassiere Hair Salad Fingers Pitaten Calvin and Hobbes Human sexual behavior Ranma __ characters W.I.T.C.H.
