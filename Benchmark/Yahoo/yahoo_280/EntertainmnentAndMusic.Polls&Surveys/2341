asian women only please i quote the discussion with regard to the reason why asian women prefer dating white men some dude on y answer said the reason why asian women date white men is because of their low self esteem by dating white men which whom they consider superior they feel that they have accomplished something big in life and it makes them feel better about themselves i guest it's their ideal of thriving their are people with that mentality in every race but asian women seem to have a the highest percentage in my opinion people who love themselves and are proud of their heritage don't need white men to make them feel that they are really worth something also this mentality is common during the first few years in anyone who immigrates to the united states but again it appears that asian women never get over such mentality so asian women what is your take on this i think it's true White (people) Sexual orientation Interracial couple Objectivist philosophy Self-esteem Affirmative action Theory of conduct Colonial mentality The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Racism Social rule Transsexuality Humphrey Bogart Patriotism Jon Secada Demographics of the United States Simone Weil Generation X The Apprentice 2 Pedophilia Asian American Love Scientology beliefs and practices Socrates Homosexuality and Christianity Bosniaks Transgender Friedrich Schleiermacher Asian fetish Aesthetic Realism African American Abortion debate Physical attractiveness Equal Protection Clause Courtship Intelligence quotient Human sexual behavior Friends Democracy Homophobia Opus Dei Transcontinental nation Nation of Islam Arthur Schopenhauer White supremacy Rudolf Hermann Lotze Self-harm Turing test Narcissism Infantilism Mick Foley Ex-gay Abortion Derek Parfit EastEnders Peru Love-shyness Women in Islam Baldness Mojave people Philosophy of language Kimi Finster Economic inequality U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Filipino American Bertrand Russell Hispanic Philipp Melanchthon Elections in the United Kingdom Church of Christ The Fountainhead Duties of the Heart Bish__jo game Race (U.S. Census) Prostate cancer Zhao Yun Jennifer Lopez Mental retardation Left-handed Audiophile Strap-on dildo History of British nationality law Same-sex marriage in Canada Ethnic issues in Japan Laura Schlessinger Puerto Rican The Big Lebowski Little Britain Epistemology Political correctness Kyle Broflovski Discordianism Menstrual cup Billboard Hot 100 Abington School District v.
