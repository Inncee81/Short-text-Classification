when the air comes off the blase of a fan what angle does it come off at personally i think it comes off straight but im not sure anyone i mean blade not blase when the air is coming from the blades of the fan it is at various angles but mostly obtuse the blade is not a perfect mechanism so the main objective of most fans manufactured today is to cover more area than to drive air faster to drive air faster the fan will have to push it in a vertical direction but to cover more area the air is pushed in an obtuse angle so towards the center it will be vertical and towards the ends it will be obtuse Helicopter Fan (implement) Leaf Fixed-wing aircraft Propeller Scapula Flight controls Wind turbine Triangle Jet engine Angle Canoe Knife Table saw Billiards Autogyro Drill bit Tank Professional wrestling throws Radio controlled airplane Conic section Turbocharger Precession Equine conformation Mandible Supercharger Table tennis Railroad switch Saw Wave power Thermal power station P-61 Black Widow Pachypodium bicolor Steam engine Lathe Pachypodium baronii Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Temporal bone Volleyball Swingout Axial compressor Mooney M20 Steering Carburetor SR-71 Blackbird VHF omnidirectional range Pachypodium brevicaule Elevator Parabola Turbofan Eddie Guerrero Boomerang Sport rowing Lawn mower Parallel postulate Glossary of climbing terms Point groups in three dimensions Water turbine Microphone Model aircraft Car handling Sailing Chainsaw Internal ballistics Faster-than-light Diesel engine Casualty lifting Solar power Shadow Phonograph Pachypodium ambongense Brewery Strap-on dildo Skateboarding trick Pythagorean theorem Rotation Elbow-joint Luminiferous aether Stairway Wassily Kandinsky Anatomical terms of location Airsoft Airbag Torque Humerus Pinball Mouse (computing) T-64 Coriolis effect Map projection Professional wrestling slang Motorcycle Engine balance Backstroke Symmetry 24 Hours of Le Mans CarterCopter Movie projector Stealth technology
