do you know where life will take you in the next years i don't know quite where my life is leading yet and i feel a bit confused big smiles d in days of old one pretty much knew where their live would take them they would finish school and go to work at a local place and retire from there pretty cut and dry and a person would probably marry someone they grew up with scary thought now with people moving from job to job and location to location finding ones way can be a bit tough sometimes so perhaps my thoughts on the subject will help i'm within a few months of retiring medically and i have done just about everything there is to do on my list of i never expected to do that first i would suggest that you start thinking about what you want to do when you grow up it does not mean you will get to do that i wanted to be a micro biologist but i could not take college i hated the university system so i ended up following the path of most fun drove a truck for years served in the military from until present and will retire in january and i owned one awesome money making business with great employees and am debt free because i did not get money hungry my original plan was to become a micro biologist and study for the forest service or some other agricultural agency as i like the feild no pun i went to the university for years and was thinking i can't take this and micro was not panning out to what i was interested in and i can't stand letting bugs walk on me that was then not it does not bother me so entomology was out i took a number of jobs janitor made eye glasses made memory chips painted and did some fence work in college so i had a general idea of what was out there trucking was paying pretty well so i got into that logged my million miles joking i did not keep a log of that apart from iraq where i drove miles on the highways there but in uniform and well armed i got tired of working away from home i pretty much lost my wife because i was gone so much she found an old boyfriend and started an affair with him i decided to get into business for myself and so while trucking i started a part time business read all the literature talked to score retired businessmen who help new enterprises and my business took off i continuted ot drive for a time as i like getting out of town with that said sort of a biography lets break it all out i knew what i wanted a house got one paid off i wanted a family lost that option due to my wife not being faithful and me being gone that was about all i wanted a home and a loving family next was my choice of how i was going to get there i sellected trucking because i hated college so much so i had cash flow and bought a house found a great lady and got married my life was complete but where i goofed up was the cost of having all this stuff so decide what you want figure out what it will cost and how you are going to pay for it had i realized the cost i would probably have stuck it out in college and been at home at night and weekends instead of states away before free long distance calls on cell phones no internet either back then lady i'm and old dude huh next look at what you are interested in and try to find work that will be fun to you because you have an interest in it i do a job for the army and i'm considered the star of my brigade in my job because i do it so well it is because i have an interest in biology and medicine and i learned how to do the job from experts now here is the key to it all keep this in mind chart out what you want house family dog cat telescope for me anyway figure out how you will get these things go into debt for a life time or save up and buy as you have cash which is best and in all of this figure out what you are going to do for vacation i have really never taken a vacation because i don't like being alone and i always am i just work days a week until i was injured then i did not work for almost a year i bought my telescope at that time and started studying the sky and doing things i wanted now i'm working again but very little and i do the army stuff which i really love doing looking back i really wasted a lot of my life while people who look at me externally would see someone with lots of money and success as it were but i lost the only thing that mattered to me a wife and family be careful not to lose what really matters to you Avenue Q EastEnders Shaggy dog story About a Boy Humphrey Bogart 2000 Australian Grand Prix Pitaten Social rule Poker jargon Marilyn Monroe W.
