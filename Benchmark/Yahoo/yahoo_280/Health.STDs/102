does anyone know a few weeks ago i found out through my doctor that i had chlamydia well i was supposed to go back to the doctor on this past friday to make sure the infection was gone but something came up at work i've rescheduled my appt but it's not until the th of this month i've still been having this unpleasant odor so i'm not sure if the infection is gone i took the pill two pills at the same time on the th of july so has it been long enough for the infection to be gone or what how long does it take after taking the pill for the symptoms and infection to leave if anyone has experienced this or has experience with these kinds of situations please help me thanks in advance for your help and concerns also i saw this commercial for a product that helps detect vaginal infections by color has anyone else seen that commercial i was wondering where i could go in a store and purchase something like this test of cure for chalmydia a test after treatment to make sure infection is cleared is not routinely indicated if a recommended treatment is taken and symptoms and signs disappear and there is no re exposure to an untreated partner except where compliance with treatment was not complete if an alternative treatment was used in all pre pubertal children in all pregnant women if indicated test of cure should be done weeks after the completion of effective treatment earlier and you risk false positive results from the presence of non viable chlamydial bacteria it is recommended however for you to be screened months post treatment as reinfection risk is high you mentioned taking a single dose of medicine and the only drug for chlamydia fitting that description is azithromycin zithromax which is a prefered treatment for chlamydia meaning that a test of cure unless you fit one of the above exceptions is not indicated unpleasant odor is not a recognized symptom of chlamydial infection in women so you should be fine but if you are experiencing any odd symptoms you should be checked out by a healthcare practitioner who is familiar with stis hope this helps Sexually-transmitted infection Psoriasis Prostate cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Urinary incontinence Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Malaria Cancer Syphilis Breast cancer AIDS Folic acid Cytomegalovirus Asthma Homeopathy Ulcerative colitis Hypoglycemia Group A streptococcal infection Chlamydia Acne Tuberculosis Coeliac disease Colorectal cancer Multiple sclerosis Rabies Stomach cancer Chronic fatigue syndrome Herpes simplex virus Pneumonia Tuberculosis treatment HIV HIV test Heartworm Miscarriage Antiretroviral drug Medical analysis of circumcision Oral contraceptive Bipolar disorder Medicine Migraine Haloperidol Abortion Clinical depression Allergy Lung cancer Malignant melanoma Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Lymphogranuloma venereum Fibromyalgia Breastfeeding Quackery Guinea pig Common cold Traditional Chinese medicine Vitamin C Stroke Diazepam Ovarian cancer Autism Transsexuality Psychosis Schizophrenia Hepatitis B Androgen insensitivity syndrome Endometriosis Eczema Oral sex HIV vaccine Childbirth Alternative medicine Hypertension Chlorpromazine Decompression sickness Anthrax Anorexia nervosa Acute lymphoblastic leukemia Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Antidepressant Leukemia Growth hormone treatment Spina bifida Mesothelioma Turner syndrome Tocopherol Traumatic brain injury
