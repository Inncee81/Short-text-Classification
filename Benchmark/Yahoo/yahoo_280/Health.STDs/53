uti vs chlamydia okay so here i go two weeks ago i went to the doctor feeling a stinging pain when urinating i went to the doctor and she gave me a single dose of antibiotics for a uti the pain came back fairly quickly say days i went back to the doctor after popping endless cranberry supplements and drowning myself in h o she gave me a weeks supply of antibiotics and made me pee ina cup again she called today and said my culture was negitive for infection so i figured maybe i killed it what im truly worried about is that it was not a uti at all and i may have caught chlamydia anyone have any idea it sounds possible if your doctor gave you cipro as an antibiotic it should wipe out most std's along with the uti you might have to do a second or even third round of antibiotics to completly rid yourself of the infection from what you are describing i think it is already gone i wouldn't automatically jump to the chlamydia diagnosis as uti infections can be caused by many things you are already following a good treatment plan so don't worry too much about it Urinary tract infection Gonorrhoea Medical analysis of circumcision Pelvic inflammatory disease Endocarditis Group A streptococcal infection Lymphogranuloma venereum Urinary incontinence Pneumonia Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Penicillin Reiter's syndrome Prostate cancer Antibiotic Common cold Infectious disease Chlamydophila pneumoniae Non-gonococcal urethritis Hip fracture Cellulitis Epididymitis Conjunctivitis Ciprofloxacin Anthrax Syphilis Cardiovascular disease Bubonic plague Tuberculosis Mastoiditis Guinea pig Virus Cephalexin Childbirth Urine Lyme disease Sickle-cell disease Stomach cancer Hepatitis Penis Psoriasis Pharmacology Malaria Allergy Biological warfare Theory of conduct Peptic ulcer Legionellosis Cystoscopy Mouth ulcer Leptospirosis Irritable bowel syndrome Psittacosis Ehrlichiosis Protein-energy malnutrition Schistosomiasis Rabies Fancy rat Vancomycin Cancer Chu-Han contention Medicine Helicobacter pylori Diving Traditional Chinese medicine Breastfeeding Meningitis Acne Domestic rabbit Hepatitis C Hearing impairment Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Bone marrow transplant Smallpox Heartworm Crohn's disease Herpes simplex virus Rocky Mountain spotted fever Clostridium difficile Candidiasis Ebola Radiation therapy Traumatic brain injury Aspergillosis Gastroparesis Lung cancer Eczema Ben Johnson (athlete) Marburg virus Cystic fibrosis Upper respiratory tract infection Diseases of the honeybee Needle aspiration biopsy Pharyngitis Obstetrics Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder 1957 World Series
