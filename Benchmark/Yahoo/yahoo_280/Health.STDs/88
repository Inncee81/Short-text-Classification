i think i may have herpes i found a couple two or three whiteish bumps on my vulva that resembled ingrown hairs a week after having unprotected sex with a new partner who claimed to be clean the area itched like mad and the bumps were sore and lasted a little over a week at first i thought it was bad razor burn because i tend to shave down there without shaving cream the bumps never crusted over before going away which is something that every website i've checked says happens i went to my doctor but my blood tests came back unsure and my doctor wants me to retake them in weeks so now i'm confused about what to do and still unsure if this is herpes or not help herpes doesn't always have to crust over you can have areas that burn and itch and it can look like razor burn if your test came back inconclusive i would do what your md suggested get the blood test again in weeks in the meantime i would not have unprotected sex if you do have herpes you will be spreading it to other partners if you do have it you can take medication to decrease the outbreaks but there is no cure for genital herpes and remember if you do end up having it it is your responsibility to inform your partners and from then on you should always use protection Psoriasis Sexually-transmitted infection Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pubic hair Mouth ulcer Prostate cancer Chronic fatigue syndrome Stomach cancer Hepatitis C Oral sex Eczema Strap-on dildo Group A streptococcal infection AIDS Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Shaving Safe sex Depilation Acne Herpesviridae Transmission (medicine) Sexual dysfunction Malignant melanoma Fecal incontinence Scabies Cocaine Pseudofolliculitis barbae The Shining (film) Epilepsy Ebola Massage Razor Vulva Medical analysis of circumcision Hair Herpes zoster Syphilis Marburg virus Traumatic brain injury Anal sex Gay bathhouse Genital wart Homeopathy Baldness Aspartame Head shaving Female genital cutting Methamphetamine Crystal methamphetamine and sex Little Britain Sento Breastfeeding Big Brother UK series 6 Androgen insensitivity syndrome Conjunctivitis Atkins Nutritional Approach Pneumonia Colorectal cancer Same-sex marriage Waxing Human sexuality Virus Duesberg hypothesis Cirrhosis Allergy Carbon dioxide Multiple sclerosis HIV test Condom Kurt Angle Beard Occam's Razor Chickenpox Masturbation Bondage (BDSM) Anus Sex education Penis Cytomegalovirus Body piercing Lung cancer Crab louse Prenatal diagnosis Sex organ Hepatitis Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Acute lymphoblastic leukemia H5N1 Opioid Urinary incontinence Marilyn Monroe Castration Alzheimer's disease Vulvovaginal health Child sexuality Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Barber
