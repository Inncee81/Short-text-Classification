why are genetics questions apearing in the genealogy section is there not a science division the only reason i ask is because i can't answer genetic questions and would rather see people go to people who can in the science section lydia actually i know a great deal about genetics but this is a genealogy section while you are correct in stating that genetic makeup is important only your immediate family not strangers on a board can shed light on the specifics genealogy is about finding people in place and time thus it has more of a historical link than a scientific one knowing there's a cancer link in your family won't help you find your ancestors in if a person is new to yahoo questions and answers and a good part of our questioners are they mostly likely ask their question from the home page the yahoo system is set up to pick up certain key words and throw the question into a category now the questioner can change it before he she submits but if they are new they might not notice that we get a lot of questions on this board because of that i have seen two questions regarding a grandfather clock on this board no doubt the word grandfather caused it to come to genealogy i usually probe a person's avatar and look at their profile and the q a's they have and most of the time they are newbies are almost newbies Genealogy Newbie Young Earth creationism Species Biology Science Genetic fingerprinting Religion Genealogical DNA test Sexual orientation Theory of conduct Neopets Noah's Ark Jumpstart 3rd Grade Francis Crick $ale of the Century Cognitive science GED Race Creationism Scientific method Killian documents Validity of human races Intelligent design Transsexuality Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Molecular evolution Plame affair Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma DNA Emperor of Japan Gravity Identity and change Evolutionism Mitochondrial Eve Lamanite Ethics History of creationism Semitic Most recent common ancestor Entropy B3ta CPU cache Human University of Utah Hearing impairment Tic-Tac-Dough Test (student assessment) Now You See It Wheel of Fortune Goodness and value theory Autism Evolution Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Time travel Muhammad Falsifiability Philosophy of mathematics Epistemology Origin belief Free will Family SmartAsk Macroevolution Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs SAT Nature versus nurture Internet troll Intelligent design movement Abraham Sociobiology Joseph Smith, Jr. G__del's incompleteness theorem Expert system Predestination paradox Paradigm Biology and sexual orientation Ashkenazi Jews Legal research Deluge (mythology) Creationist cosmologies Determinism Meme Anthropology Supernatural John Titor Human cloning Solar system Corporate personhood Western philosophy Flood geology Karl Popper AIDS reappraisal Geometry GunBound Fifteen to One Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 6 Contract Psychology
