is there a way to get birth records online without having to join something or pay for something i've been looking for my birth records and every time i get close to getting them the site i'm looking at always asks for credit card info and i'm always a second away from my records on every site can anyone help you can order birth records on line but there will always be a charge another thing birth records are closed documents so you can only order your own or your childrens from the clerk of the county municipality in which you they were born many times there are services online that will charge more than if you ordered from the records office directly most of the places you would order from would have to mail you your records i don't know of any that would provide you a digital copy online the reason is that for a birth certificate to be any good many places require that it be a certified copy you can't certify a copy online most localities have a special paper with a seal that they print the certificate on i hope that this helps Identity theft Notary public Internet fraud United States Postal Service Public-key cryptography Pretty Good Privacy Bank fraud Credit card Single certification Mail Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Open access Enterprise content management Direct marketing Royal Assent Xerox Census Surveillance Legal research Postage stamp Digital signature We Belong Together Windows Vista Trusted computing Post office Information Technology Infrastructure Library Offices in Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth Copyright law of the United Kingdom Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Mac OS X Copyleft Paralegal Monopoly (game) Accountancy Micropayment Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act GED Records management Passport Wi-Fi Apple Open Collaboration Environment Ebook Identity document Electronic commerce Credit card fraud Silver Certificate 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines E-mail spam Cross site scripting Appeal Douglas DC-8 ZIP Code Nurse Moss v.
