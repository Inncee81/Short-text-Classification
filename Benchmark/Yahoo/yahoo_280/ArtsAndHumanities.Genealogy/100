how do i find my grand father i grew up in canada but was born in germany my mother and father are divorced and my grandmother and grandfather also divorced when my father was i cannot get any information on my grandfather besides his first and last name no date or place or birth and no last known residence half of my family is missing i have daughters and would love to be able to let them have a family history your first replies on the question maybe don't realize that there is a genealogy section here http www cyndislist com germany htm here's a list of resources for german research it tends to historical info but at the same time networking with those sources can lead you to contacts in germany by the way cyndi's list is my favorite for all research resources not just germany i would also suggest reviewing the adoption area for ideas you don't have an adoption situation but the process and tips can be of use i think there is one location relating to german adoption although you did not specify it seems that your parents were also born in germany it can be harder to locate info on people who are alive you didn't say your age not that you should but a lot depends if it is likely that either dad or grandparents are alive without questioning reasons etc if you located dad's birth certificate it should indicate names of both grandparents in addition where they were located at time of dad's birth is a clue as to where to start do you know dad's age you can estimate that grandpa was probably between age when dad was born standard suggestion to new researchers is always talk to family we have to remember that not all of us have that option for starting with due to real life situations like yours obviously if mom has hostility towards dad's relatives that is not something to raise up without careful thought and tact here in the us finding records opens up when it is assumed or known that the person is no longer alive i'll share a personal thought with you while i urge you to act with caution depending on your personal details is it possible that the grandparents are still alive i have grandchildren who are being sucked away due to a family conflict and don't see i hope that there comes a day when they are adults that they choose to find me of their own choice it is a deep hole and pain for me you are welcome to send me a private note through my profile if you like Family Genealogy Divorce Fathers' rights Adoption Friends Who is a Jew?
