how do you go about doing genealogy research at a courthouse what is the procedure what do they have in there and do they just let you go in and sort through it all my experience is different from holly's the majority of court houses that i have been to will show you where the appropriate files are many times they are busy with current business and not available to help in some courthouses they are less than willing to allow access to books but it may depend on the type of record since some are not as public as others i think a lot depends on the actual size of the courthouse and their attitude towards research i have found some to show annoyance and others are cordial most of the records i have wanted to see are much older records often stored in basements or dusty rooms dress accordingly remember that their purpose is not genealogy per se there will be marriage books probate files and land records copying is usually restricted to the clerks once you find what you want Genealogy Probation officer Password Courthouse RISC MAME Computer Computer virus Copiah County, Mississippi Las Vegas, Nevada NTFS File system Legal research Trademark Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Appeal Public domain Mach kernel Expert system Library (computer science) Census Backup Easement Same-sex marriage in Canada Appomattox Court House Hampton Roads System/36 Malware New Hampshire Supreme Court Fair dealing Cosmic dust Mineral County, West Virginia Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana Romney, West Virginia Patent Scientology beliefs and practices Temple (Mormonism) Publishing Linked list Redundant array of independent disks CPU cache Courtroom Battle of Appomattox Courthouse House of Lords Albany Academy Same-sex marriage in the United States Library File sharing Copyleft Tort reform Basement Copyright law of the United Kingdom ITunes File Allocation Table Usenet Memory Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Forth programming language Book of Mormon Copyright Something Awful Forums Hash table Trinity College, Dublin Abortion Librarian Robert Byrd Floppy disk Taunton, Massachusetts Master Control Program Xenu Canadian House of Commons Virtual memory Ministry of Magic Excommunication System/34 Laboratory Bristol Grammar School Spring operating system Divorce XML Battery (electricity) Royal Assent Intellectual property Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Open access Windows 2000 Software license Rainey Bethea Reverse engineering Urban sprawl ROC presidential election, 2004 Life extension Animal Crossing I Want to Hold Your Hand C plus plus Wallpaper group Bankruptcy United States Postal Service Restoring the Lost Constitution Marketing research
