charlemagne decedents anyone here have resources that could help me trace a family name back to charlemange i have been unable to trace it directly from charlemange so i was wondering if i could work backwards it's extremely expensive to do the primary research your own snooping through records that no one else ever documented and prove your lineage to charlemagne the last project i'm aware of that did so was the catherine de baillon research project about years ago three extremely well respected researchers spent several thousand dollars and several hundred hours of research to get the documents needed from the various departements of france to prove the lineage of catherine de baillon back to charlemagne it was very tedious and took them several years to locate the records then months for the boxes to arrive and more months for them to read through everything organize it and prove that one of their three working theses was correct now if you descend from catherine de baillon and jacques miville dit desch nes you can use the dulong research to tie into charlemagne's lineage http habitant org baillon index htm if you believe you descend from another major or minor european royal you can check through the published research to see if any ties you into charlemagne there aren't many research projects outside of the nobles and royals that will tie a commoner into the merovingians Genealogy Franks Computer Chinese surname France in the Middle Ages Hundred Years' War Jacques Cartier Nobility Common Unix Printing System Graduate school Catherine of Aragon History of the Internet Commune in France Early Modern France Wget Bioinformatics Medieval French literature Kingdom of Navarre History of Germany Thesis Extreme Programming Domesday Book HyperText Transfer Protocol Open access MMORPG Daylight saving time Henry VII of England Legal research The Da Vinci Code XML Jean-Jacques Rousseau Mach kernel Montreal Tetrapod Democracy Count Fournier Sleeping Murder Counts of Toulouse CPU cache Catherine II of Russia Jewish history European Union Enterprise content management Refugee Scientology beliefs and practices Nation of Islam Armenian Genocide Chronology of the Ancient Near East Emperor of Japan Wikipedia Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Evolution Floppy disk Black (people) Michel Foucault Voltaire Social Security (United States) Tennessee State Constitution Funeral E-mail spam John F.
