how do i find a birth record if the person was born before they started keeping record the place in de kalb indiana says they did not start keeping records of births until the person i'm looking for was born any suggestions about how to obtain this there is a fine distinction between a birth certificate and a birth record and no it isn't at all unusual for there to be nothing at city hall the majority of states did not require anything before it all depends on the specific state is pretty good anything that contains the information is a record for her it could be the death certificate it may be the census that can be iffy since it has many errors it can be a bible record it can be the tombstone baptism records are good obituaries may also be available what you are looking for is an explicit birth record when actually the fact or info will come from other sources try to find several sources and be prepared for contradictions that is standard operating procedure in research that's when you decide which source is most likely to be correct but your note will also include a statement ie tombstone shows but she was shown as nine yrs old in census one bite at a time and it will start pulling together as you go Baptism Genealogy Census Pretty Good Privacy Halting problem C programming language Legal aspects of transsexualism Scientology beliefs and practices Expert system Abortion Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Complexity classes P and NP Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Identity theft Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Software testing Information Technology Infrastructure Library G__del's incompleteness theorem Wyatt Earp Debugging Scientific method Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Binary numeral system Family history Pi Chronology of Jesus Purple Heart Alcoholics Anonymous Intelligent design Indian nationality law History of British nationality law Sarbanes-Oxley Act Copyright law of the United Kingdom Biblical inerrancy Probation officer Starfleet ranks and insignia Appeal MDAC Contract ISO 9000 Same-sex marriage in the United States Royal Assent C plus plus Geographic references New Testament Paralegal 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines ITU-T SCO-Linux controversies Book of Mormon Nontrinitarianism Bush v.
