why i need to refresh so often the internet pages need more answers when im accesing internet pages most often i get a messege 'the page cannot be displayed' but after i refresh it works why is happening this all the time downloading torrents might be the problem or even when im not downloading two possibilities are slow processor and a shortage of memory the web page can't be displayed until it is loaded into the ram so if you have the ram tied up downloading or other programs are using it the browser can't display the page everything you do has to go through the processor so its speed controls everything a third possibility would be a slow internet connection it has to send the data to your computer before it can be displayed Web crawler Sinclair ZX81 CPU cache Windows XP ZX Spectrum Sega Dreamcast CPU design Trusted computing Mandriva Linux Spyware PlayStation Portable Commodore 64 Game Boy Advance Computer BitTorrent File Transfer Protocol Domain Name System Dynamic random access memory Distributed computing Nintendo Revolution PlayStation 3 GIF Modem Super Nintendo Entertainment System Forth programming language Virtual memory Emacs Atari 8-bit family RISC Ajax (programming) Sega Saturn Web design Mac OS X v10.4 Internet Thread (computer science) Windows 2000 Computer virus Uploading and downloading Netscape Navigator Java programming language Microprogram Novell NetWare USB flash drive TRS-80 Color Computer AmigaOS Opera (web browser) Central processing unit Cell (microprocessor) Computer and video games Apple Macintosh PlayStation 2 Apple II family Google Sharp Zaurus Acorn Electron X Window System PowerPC MDAC Nintendo Entertainment System Windows Vista Programmable logic controller IBM PC compatible Cache Texas Instruments TI-99/4A NX bit System/34 Gmail IA-32 Internet Explorer for Mac Computer multitasking BBC Master Website Timeline of computing 1990-forward System/36 IBM PC ITunes Web application SETI@home Cray-1 System 7 (Macintosh) Web browser 64-bit TRS-80 TI-83 series Arabic alphabet Operating system Computer terminal Original Amiga chipset NeXT Parallel computing Random access memory Hyperlink Memory (computers) MOS Technology 6502 World Wide Web Word processor Mach kernel TI-89 series HTTP cookie Internet Explorer
