why do people prefer firefox over i e and opera okay here's the deal i want to know why use firefox when both ie and opera have been proven better tell me one thing firefox has that opera and or ie don't oh and you can't use anything thats been debunked by www firefoxmyths com off the bat this means no saying it's faster or more secure or saying that it has less holes or it has add ons while the other two browsers don't those are just the most obvious ones i wanted to put out there the rest are on the site oh and don't bother saying it has skins that's the least important feature for a browser i'm talking about security and userfriendliness etc p s firefox doesn't the pass the acid two test while opera does and this can even be proved yourself if you wish http www webstandards org files acid test html top it should be a smiley face if your browser passes i've tested it myself and ie and firefox both don't pass let's first go back to why firefox this is a mozilla project it would be against the law for multiple companies to collaborate to make the same product the whole idea is the develop a specification that everyone owns mozilla is that specification of how a browser can work so ie opera netscape sufari and countless other browsers were made to work following that mozilla standard firefox is the baseline development of that standard oddly enough there are many differences between browsers these are the tiny mistakes that designers make when inventing their own of course internet explorer added the activex crap that makes it unique it was in when spyware and adware really started to get rampant on the internet rendering ie nearly useless many windows users discovered that firefox did not have these problems because activex was the target of many of these problems but eventually ie caught up so the importance of firefox has dwindled but firefox made life easier for many windows oriented people so they are loyal to the product yes http www firefoxmyths com tells the story well but that does not mean that people would switch during the late s each version of internet explorer leaped over the previous version of netscape each version of netscape leaped over internet explorer opera gained ground during the ie vs netscape wars even today there are many netscape fans hey many people still hate ie it will take some time to grow i use ie and firefox at the same time i still use firefox to visit unknown websites it's just a habit good luck and happy computing Netscape Communications Corporation User agent Netscape Gecko (layout engine) Netscape Navigator Windows XP Cascading Style Sheets NPAPI World Wide Web Phishing Mozilla Macromedia Flash Ajax (programming) XML Web page Netscape (web browser) Domain Name System Internet Explorer for Mac JavaScript Pretty Good Privacy Mouse (computing) Java programming language History of the Internet Microsoft Gmail Timeline of computing 1990-forward Cross site scripting Unicode and HTML XForms USB flash drive Pop-up ad OpenBSD The Book of Mozilla Scalable Vector Graphics Tabbed document interface PNG Web design Microsoft Windows Common Unix Printing System Internet Uniform Resource Locator Greasemonkey HyperText Transfer Protocol Konqueror ReactOS Open-source software Mozilla Foundation International Phonetic Alphabet Digital rights management Copy protection Internationalized domain name Spread Firefox Rootkit Component Object Model Ruby character Favicon GIF About: Kazaa Safari (web browser) Computer Trusted computing Wiki Object Desktop AOL Instant Messenger Mandriva Linux X Window System HTML editor Stopping e-mail abuse Internet Relay Chat Internet security Internet privacy Konfabulator MNG Ebook Wget Mach kernel SAML History of Microsoft Windows Trojan horse (computing) HyperCard Blue screen of death RSS (file format) Extreme Programming Common criticisms of Microsoft
