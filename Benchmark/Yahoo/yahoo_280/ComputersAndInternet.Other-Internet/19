my dsl internet works on off i'm playing halo or surfing the web or whatever and then the internet will cut out on me it is getting super frustrating at first i thought and maybe it still is the cpu in the router getting overheated i had the dsl modem ethernet box placed on top of my router and it tended to get hot however it is starting to seem like something else as i've placed the router and dsl modem off of each other i've check the cables they're all plugged in everything seems fine sometimes i will have just turned the internet on and suddenly it won't work sometimes all the lights will be on on my modem but the activity light won't light up when i click on internet or turn on my xbox and thus i won't be able to go online any helpful ideas or info what a suprise my router is linksys coincidence why are the dsl modems and routers so sensitive to heat i actually have the a c going constantly now and the internet has been working like a charm i had a similar experience with my dsl modem a few years back it was overheating cutting out feel the underside of your modem see if it's very hot when it acts up if so then add some rubber feet to it place them over the small rubber feet that are there already to elevate it above the surface so it gets some air that did the trick for me as far as the router i've had linksys for years without a problem but everyone can get a bad unit so no matter the manufacturer go to their website check for firmware updates do this for both the router the modem oh remove the router from your configuration connect directly to your modem from your xbox or computer to see if this still happens if it does then it's your modem if not then it's your router or communication between the router modem good luck Router Modem Digital Subscriber Line Xbox Broadband Internet access Password PlayStation 2 Cisco Systems Ethernet Nintendo Revolution Nintendo GameCube Universal Serial Bus Cable modem Nintendo DS Denial-of-service attack Embedded system Laptop Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Xbox 360 Sega Dreamcast IMac Commodore 64 Multiplayer Halo 2 Cable television PlayStation 3 Atari 8-bit family Mouse (computing) Computer bus Asynchronous Transfer Mode Internet service provider AppleTalk Internet fraud IPod Computer hardware IEEE 802.11 Computer and video games MDAC Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Carburetor Wi-Fi Drill bit Differentiated services Nintendo Entertainment System Spyware Voice over IP NSA encryption systems Linux Softmodem Lag HomePNA PowerPC ZigBee Routing Dialer ZX Spectrum Internet security First-person shooter Broadband Sega Saturn Distributed computing Central processing unit Wireless LAN Alcatel WRT54G Network address translation Modchip Armored Core Local area network Tire Windows XP DOCSIS Spark plug Secure Digital card RS-232 USB flash drive Neverwinter Nights Thermal power station Serial port Prodigy (ISP) Internet Group Management Protocol Counter-Strike DVD Request for Comments World Wide Web Game.com Equine conformation Web crawler Communications protocol Copy protection ARPANET ALOHAnet
