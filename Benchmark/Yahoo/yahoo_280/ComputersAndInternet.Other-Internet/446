how can i convince my mother rather buying in an online store than in a normal store i wanna buy vista home premiium full version royaldiscount com for half the street store price but she says buying electronics in an online store is a bad thing because the return policy is too hard my recommendation is to calmly and confidently provide her with lots of evidence in support of royaldiscount com royaldiscount com has an overall rating of stars out of stars according to ratings on yahoo's vendor rating site which is really quite excellent http shopping yahoo com merchrating user rv html merchant id as for the return policy it seems very similar to most in store policies plus when you're working with software such as vista home premium once you've opened it most vendors won't let you return it because you could have opened it made a copy of the disk and written down the license key typically you can only exchange it for another disk in the event that it's faulty or scratched so you shouldn't really be focusing on the return policy anyway http www royaldiscount com privacypolicy html i think the good pricing combined with the high ratings and the fact that the return policy is a moot point should help sway your mother to consider shopping online perhaps she's just afraid of the security of online stores if so you can point out that all purchases from royaldiscount com are actually directed through the yahoo store which is well know and secure i hope this helps resolve any concerns your mother may have had gl Windows Vista Electronic commerce IBM PC compatible Windows XP Redundant array of independent disks Hard disk Microsoft Password Computer virus Floppy disk Microsoft Windows Online shop Linux MP3 Insurance AmigaOS Web crawler Bulk vending Windows 2000 America Online Atari ST Digital rights management HyperText Transfer Protocol NTFS Pretty Good Privacy Enterprise content management Surveillance Windows Server 2003 Atari 8-bit family HTML Internet E-mail spam History of Microsoft Windows HTTP cookie Warez Copy protection Wal-Mart Website Apple II family File Allocation Table Free software Everything2 Mutual fund Computer DVD Intellectual property Commodore 64 Opera (web browser) ZX Spectrum Mozilla Application Suite Microsoft Office Best Buy E-mail Xbox Hyperinflation Monetary policy OpenDocument Web browser Mozilla Firefox Cross site scripting Internet fraud OpenGL Files-11 Blue screen of death Computer forensics Neopets Uniform Resource Identifier World Wide Web Nintendo Microeconomics Contract Free trade MUMPS Lotus Notes Common criticisms of Microsoft Ebook Credit card GNU General Public License MS-DOS Amstrad CPC Gramophone record Open access Supply and demand Apple Computer Macromedia Flash Transport Layer Security Windows registry Steam (content delivery)
