how do i delete an email i have a hotmail email address and i was wondering how to delete it i want to because i get so much spam emails and i'm sick of it so if you could please give me step by step deletion for a hotmail account thank you well i dont think u can like immediately delete it if u dont pay it but with ur account click on help at the top right corner then where it says click your topic click your account policies then you scroll down until you see the blue options when you get to the blue options under related topics you click where it says close your account then the first set of blue highlighted words say close account page you should click that then you should probably read the paragraph about close account once you have read that click close account warning i cant remember if from this piont you can sign out but if you can press that if not do not visit hotmail for days or your account will still be activated so you have to wait for a month to make another account because if you dont sign into your account within days it will be permenetly deleted which i guess is what you want hope this helped i might be a bit confusing but i think i gave you the right information Gmail E-mail spam E-mail Internet fraud Hotmail Mouse (computing) Spam (electronic) Webmail Search engine optimization Phishing Stopping e-mail abuse Opera (web browser) Google Advance fee fraud HTTP cookie GameFAQs Cross site scripting Viral marketing Sender Policy Framework Plame affair The Standard Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Forum moderator Wheel of Fortune Password Denial-of-service attack Independent Media Center HTML element MSN Mozilla Thunderbird Malware Netfilter/iptables GameFAQs message boards Blue screen of death Web crawler Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Mozilla Application Suite Computer virus Make money fast Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act E-mail address EIA-708 Option key Yahoo!
