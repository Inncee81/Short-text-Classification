why is my high speed internet so slow how can i speed it up hi everyone just moved into my new apartment and set up rogers high speed express yesterday i am connecting via ethernet cable directly from the modem to my laptop problem ridiculously long load times solely with webpage browsing when it comes to connecting to a chat service or downloading via p p programs speeds are optimal even checking at speedtest sites yields results that indicate i'm getting close to mbps download speed and kbps upload speed i contacted rogers customer service and they pinged me with no issues they claim the problem is on my end a faulty network card or something of that nature although i connect fine elsewhere wirelessly and with ethernet i'm confused as to what the problem might be i have been running software to get rid of and detect and possibly spyware and its not bringing me any results either anybody know what i can do to fix the problem and get my webpage browsing up to par just installed firefox same ridiculous lags and slowness with webpages i am running windows xp just switched to usb connection between my modem and my laptop still same slow speeds with browsers somebody help alright updated the network drivers broadcom x integrated controller and the modem itself motorola surfboard sb usb cable modem still slow uninstalled internet explorer still slow i really didn't want to do this but i'll try the os switching method now did you try another browser firefox or safari i would try that and download a linux live cd you sound like you are a computer literate person the live cd does not require install it runs from the cd rom and as long as you set the bios to boot from cd rom it will run fine you do not need to install anything on your hdd and it will not mess up your partitions unless you try to install it on your hdd you just download an iso you burn it on a blank cd and boot from it you reboot take out the cd rom and it ends there back to windows i recommend knoppix or ubuntu ah yes and by booting from a live cd you will determine whether this is an os related issue or something else it sounds more like a browser http protocol problem to me for a list of live cds you can go to http www frozentech com content livecd php there are some speed up internet connection thingies but not all of them are reliable some are injected with trojans if you find one that works make sure it comes from a trusted site such as download com if you update your driver make sure that you install the latest drivers from your system manufacturer if you update them through the properties page in device manager you will install the ones windows sends you which may not be compatible with the oem hardware in your computer ok here is what i need you to do calm down call a friend and ask him to come over with his laptop have him connect did the problem go away yes it is your laptop no it is the isp so you can call them back and ask to speak to a higher level tech or a supervisor if it is your laptop you make sure you have the latest drivers installed on your laptop for the ethernet and wireless network cards from the system manufacturer and then if it does not work you try the live cd thing which i bet you did not try and if it works properly in linux you might want to consider re installing your os yes windows crashes ocasionally with no reason and in the weirdest ways ever best regards same me bloodklss http tsalife blogspot com PowerPC Internet Explorer OpenBSD Mac OS X IPod Web browser Mouse (computing) Xbox History of Microsoft Windows BitTorrent Broadband Internet access X Window System Domain Name System Laptop ZX Spectrum Transmission Control Protocol MAME Web crawler Gmail Steam (content delivery) Computer bus Skype AmigaOS MDAC Federal Standard 1037C User agent Windows Vista Malware Operating system Sega Dreamcast PlayStation 3 Proxy server Novell NetWare Windows Server 2003 Atari 8-bit family Stopping e-mail abuse Secure Digital card Apple Computer Internet Voice over IP HTTP cookie Perl ReactOS Blue screen of death ITunes SUSE Linux Personal computer ATI Technologies Mozilla Application Suite Virtual memory Digital rights management Phishing Embedded system GSM services HyperText Transfer Protocol AOL Instant Messenger IP Multimedia Subsystem Cable television FreeDOS Nintendo Revolution Musical Instrument Digital Interface DragonFly BSD AirPort Redundant array of independent disks Microprocessor Java programming language
