workplace internet is locked and i really need my personal email what can i do who knows about computers internet is locked you'd think people spend hrs maybe more days a week at their job and they can't even check their personal email i wouldn't even care as much if i could send email but to block it completely is really rude i'm frustrated i'm sorry i know personal time is not work time but there should be different restrictions or for certain workplaces i don't understand i have lotd of work during my work day but i also have some down time i'm not going to be looking up crazy things i know they don't know that but just to be able to look and read my email would be so much better opinions suggestions a bat to crack the computer haha well being that i work in the it field and it is part of my duties to make restrictions for people such as you that work for a company i must strongly advise that this is not a smart idea if you work for a company that does not want you to have internet access then i wouldn't risk it is it worth losing your job to just check your email wait til you get off do it at home not trying to be rude or anything but companies do it to keep people from doing stuff and keeping them away from their work that they are getting paid to do there aren't a lot of options depending on how strict your company is with their network E-mail Computer security Gmail Internet fraud Password Theory of conduct Advance fee fraud Plame affair Intranet Make money fast Stopping e-mail abuse E-mail spam Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Computer Transmission Control Protocol Redundant array of independent disks Pretty Good Privacy Web crawler Librarian Rick Santorum Denial-of-service attack Anonymous remailer Prostate cancer W.
