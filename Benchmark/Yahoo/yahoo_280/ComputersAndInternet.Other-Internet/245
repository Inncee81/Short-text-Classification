i have a feeling i'm getting scammed on an ebay auction what do you think i won a bag online i really wish i didn't now the winning bidder suppsedly did not pay up so she offered me a second chance offer in her auction she said that payment had to be received in days or negative feedback would be received and the first winner did not pay up but til this day she still hasn't let them neg feedback the seller said she sent it out on july st via priority mail it's the th and i still haven't received it i paid for her to insure the package and she did i called her out on if she actually sent the package and so she sent me a picture of the receipts she got at the post office the thing is she shipped from hawaii from i guess what was a contract station the receipt is stamped w the official post office stamp but the receipt was printed off one of those cheap registers that you can buy at walmart no post office address printed on it etc in the spot where the postman would write the postage amount on the insurance label she wrote it i have a feeling that she either works at that post office or knows a friend who does i want my money back i paid through paypal and it was she insists that i wait it out so she can file a claim w the post office after days but what good will that do me it is she who has to file the claim and is she who will collect the money from the claim correct i really regret buying from her she had great feedback and has been a member of ebay since i looked at her feedback and she sells a lot of authentic designer stuff but i noticed that my purchase was the biggest sale she's gotten i had a run in with a man whom i won a palm pilot and he sent me an empty box w delivery confirmation paypal said they couldn't do anything about it since he had proof that i received the package but i contacted the attorney general's office filed a police report and filed reported him to the post master for mail fraud do you think i'm in the process of getting scammed again it does sound like a suspect transaction i am on ebay all the time buyer and seller and frequent the answer center where many knowledgeable members help each other out go to ebay click on community answer center and pick a category post your question there and you will receive a lot of good advice the best news is that you paid with paypal so you have that protection the item was which means the seller better have gotten signature confirmation or else you will win the dispute paypal requires sig conf for over i would say wait a few more days then file the item not received dispute with paypal good luck PayPal Auction Advance fee fraud Mail Phishing Contract Neopets Electronic commerce Postage stamp Plame affair Microeconomics Postage stamps and postal history of the United States Mail fraud E-mail spam Live 8 Wal-Mart Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Life insurance Spyware Post office Liberty Dollar Lottery MapleStory 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Something Awful Forums Killian documents $ale of the Century Stamp collecting Bulk vending Trademark Dot-com Philatelic investment Mortgage Confidence trick Surveillance Security (finance) Tax Insurance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Google Taxation in the United States Spam (electronic) Online shop Real estate broker 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Credit card fraud Stock Oil-for-Food Programme MMORPG Short selling Mensal__o scandal Monopoly (game) Copyright ROM image Illegal drug trade Islamic banking Extreme Programming Medical prescription Downing Street memo ZIP Code Warranty Price discrimination Arbitrage Notary public Online auction business model Amazon.com Autograph Steganography Reputation management Annuity Craps Conveyancing FairTax Jean Charles de Menezes Skype RuneScape cheats Gross domestic product Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Topps SCO-Linux controversies Surplus value Halliburton Royal Mail Enron Corporation Mutual fund Charles Ponzi Wheel of Fortune RuneScape Tic-Tac-Dough Karl Rove ITunes Music Store Ocean's Twelve
