why do some advertisements online know where i am located i was just on mugglenet com and this advertisment said pete's bbq in my town texas obviously it didn't say my town it said the name of my town so my question is how does it know where i am every device connected to the internet must have an ip address your's is probably x x which is common to home networks your router uses a protocol call nat to convert your home ip address to a internet recognizable address this address is sent to the web server that you're looking so that it knows where to send the response these internet ip's are registered to the company that owns them and it's a simple matter to look up the location that they're coming from occasionally the registered address particularly with large isp's will be different from the office that actually issued yours which is why sometimes the ad's are 'aimed' at a location that's no where near you Voice over IP IP address Router Denial-of-service attack Domain Name System Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act E-mail spam Routing E-mail Session Initiation Protocol IPv6 Email authentication Transmission Control Protocol AppleTalk Streaming media Password America Online BT Group plc Data retention Uniform Resource Locator IP Multimedia Subsystem Novell NetWare MAC address Internet Group Management Protocol Spam (electronic) History of the Internet Windows Server 2003 Skype Netfilter/iptables Usenet Common Unix Printing System Whois Firewall (networking) GSM services MSN Messenger X Window System Windows XP Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Internet protocol suite Communications protocol Internet privacy Web hosting Internet Control Message Protocol Universal Plug and Play Phishing Open mail relay Internet Relay Chat Local area network Proxy server Domain name Border Gateway Protocol Internet fraud HyperText Transfer Protocol Wi-Fi Tor (anonymity network) PowerPC Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Web traffic Server Spyware Satellite internet Distributed computing IPv4 address exhaustion Simple Network Management Protocol BitTorrent AOL Instant Messenger FidoNet Internet censorship in mainland China Ethernet Peer-to-peer Cisco Systems Private branch exchange I-name Internet Protocol IPv4 Microsoft Ping Service Location Protocol Opera (web browser) HTTP cookie File sharing OSI model File Transfer Protocol MDAC The Standard Web crawler Internet security Cable television Internet Advertising Spam Prevention Early Warning System Broadband Internet access Grid computing Direct marketing I-number Open Shortest Path First Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol
