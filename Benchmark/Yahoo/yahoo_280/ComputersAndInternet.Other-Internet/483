what can you do in zwinky do you get a virus when you open that site you want to get anti spyware malware installed on your computer before you start surfing those little kiddie sites usually have some type of spyware attached to them i actually had to wipe clean some young girl's entire hard drive because she always went to those sites like bratz zwinky and those little dolls that the young kids are always into these days etc spyware isn't a virus but it can really slow your computer performance down spybot and spysweeper work well together one wipes out what the other missed so i would suggest downloading those the only catch is that some anti spy progs think other anti spy progs are malware and want to delete them so be sure to not accidentally delete it you're also going to want to get some anti virus as well the cons about an anti virus is that you can't shut it down without restarting your computer and it can really hurt your performance from the amount of ram that it uses if you have gb of ram you shouldn't really be worried though Computer virus Malware Spyware Trojan horse (computing) Kazaa Windows XP Spybot - Search & Destroy Adware Stopping e-mail abuse Anti-virus software Internet security Blue screen of death Rootkit Computer forensics Melissa worm Laptop Host file Trusted computing Peer-to-peer Timeline of hacker history Filename extension E-mail spam ILOVEYOU Hard disk Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Computer security Memory (computers) Spam (electronic) Random access memory Typosquatting Virtual memory The Sims 2 Steam (content delivery) Universal Century Nations and Factions Embedded system Microsoft Windows Booting Linux The Star Wars Holiday Special Back Orifice PaX Surveillance Indianapolis 500 NPAPI File sharing Bratz Computer surveillance Mydoom Mach kernel Denial-of-service attack Pop-up ad Windows 2000 CPU cache ReBoot Aerial (dance move) The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars CIH virus Treehouse of Horror V Knoppix Hacker (computer security) Emacs Computer worm Macintosh Finder World of Warcraft Star Destroyer Component Object Model Redundant array of independent disks MediaMax CD-3 Naval mine Common cold Internet privacy System/34 St. Louis Rams Little Britain The Shining (film) Screensaver FoxTrot To the 5 Boroughs Page table AOL Instant Messenger Gmail Intrusion-detection system Zone of the Enders: The 2nd Runner John Lott Spy Hunter Death Star Predestination paradox Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario New.net Thom Yorke Doll HyperCard Virus RuneScape cheats Computer PlayStation 3 Dominion War System 7 (Macintosh)
