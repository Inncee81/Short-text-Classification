please give me the steps to going from dial up connection to wireless i am not a machine whiz nor is my hubby we need instructions step by step thanx we have dish satellite system first you need to determine what broadband technologies and companies are available where you live you may or may not have much of a choice to make depending on the availability of service the choices will be between cable dsl and satellite you may have more than one company to pick from under any of these consider the plan options and speed for price dsl is big on this as many providers will provide you with more speed for more money be aware that whatever speed is advertised is not what you will achieve the speed advertised is the capability under utopia or perfect conditions perfect lines close proximity to the source etc i can't speak for the process on satellite but with cable and many dsl providers you can actually sign up with a local store such as best buy circuit city or even radio shack i believe they will set you up as a customer with the provider and then provide you a self install kit which is often free although sometimes you have to wait on a rebate from there you just follow the directions that they give you and that are included in the install kit box the software cd usually does most of the work for you other than that you just need to consider how much you want to spend and how important speed is to you assuming you live in an area where all types of broadband are available to you consider a few things dsl is a dedicated line meaning no one shares that line with you and it uses your existing telephone line however speed seriously depends on your distance from their station and too much distance may not give you much if any benefit over dial up cable is in a sense a shared line this means that if you and everyone on your block has cable and everyone is downloading videos at the same time you will see a decrease in speed you may also need to have your residence fitted for cable if it is not already you may also be paying more because you are not a customer of the cable company good luck Cable television Digital Subscriber Line Telephone exchange Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line Modem Telephone Internet service provider Ethernet Eircom Voice over IP WiMAX TiVo Power line communication Communications satellite Bluetooth North American Numbering Plan Verizon Wireless Xbox 360 Acorn Computers Asynchronous Transfer Mode Private branch exchange UK telephone numbering plan Digital television Satellite television CPU design Cable modem Nintendo GameCube AT&T Frame relay NTL Telstra Vertical service code Solar power Telegraphy IPod Surveillance CPU cache GSM services Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Telewest Broadband Integrated Services Digital Network Computer Central processing unit Teletext Air traffic control Network effect NorthwesTel Xbox Commodore 64 Capitalism Public transport Redundant array of independent disks Microeconomics Password Spyware Media in Canada Electric power transmission Television Alcatel Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Wi-Fi PDP-11 MIPS architecture Prodigy (ISP) NEC Corporation Router BT Group plc British Sky Broadcasting Radio PlayStation 2 Floppy disk Internet fraud Amateur radio Sega Dreamcast Computer and video games StarHub Telecommunications in the United Kingdom Dot-com USB flash drive Coaxial cable General Packet Radio Service Phreaking System/36 Predictive dialer Pirate decryption Satellite internet National Weather Service Television in the United States Tesco Nintendo Revolution ITV PlayStation 3 Oscilloscope
