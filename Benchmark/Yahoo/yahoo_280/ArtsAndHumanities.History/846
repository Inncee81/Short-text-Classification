would germany have won the war if they hadnt invaded russia if i reemmber right germany and the soviet union actually were allies in the 's and there was a military pact both would invade poland but the agreement stood that neither would then interfere with the other germany would have free shot at western europe and russia would stay out of the war this pact ended when germany needing oil invaded the ukraine so lets say germany never invaded russia and russia stayed neutral or at least from the europe war that would mean the only threat to germany was britian which was barely holding out untill the united states finally entered the war and whatever else allies from the west could germany have won the war i reckon they could have done also another vital mistake they made was calling off the bombing of the raf camps to attack random towns in revenge for our bombings this allowed the raf to regain it's strength and m ller the germans Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact World War II Participants in World War II Western betrayal History of Poland European Theatre of World War II Luftwaffe Allies of World War II Winter War Operation Barbarossa NATO Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II Eastern Front (World War II) Continuation War History of Poland (1918-1939) History of the Soviet Union (1927-1953) Soviet Union Axis Powers Polish-Soviet War History of Poland (1939-1945) Battle of Britain Katy__ massacre World War I Occupation of Baltic Republics History of Lithuania Timeline of World War II Joseph Stalin History of Germany during World War II Cold War (1947-1953) and its origins RAF Bomber Command Norwegian Campaign Napoleonic Wars Warsaw Pact Strategic bombing German reunification Former countries in Europe after 1815 Strategic bombing during World War II Military history of the Soviet Union League of Nations Russia Tripartite Pact Appeasement History of Europe End of World War II in Europe Battle of the Bulge History of Germany since 1945 Cold War History of Austria Military alliance Romania during World War II Causes of World War II Munich Agreement W__adys__aw Sikorski Eastern Question Blitzkrieg History of Belarus Prussia Curzon Line Iron Curtain Royal Air Force Treaty of Versailles Oder-Neisse line Poland Military history of Germany History of Estonia Operation Weser__bung Suez Crisis Joachim von Ribbentrop Military history of the United States Finlandization Battle of France Vichy France Yalta Conference Nazi Germany Aftermath of the Polish-Soviet War Red Army Adolf Hitler Eastern Europe Berlin Wall Russo-Japanese War Occupation of Denmark Leon Trotsky Anti-communism Germany History of the British Army Red Army Faction Archery at the 2004 Summer Olympics History of Germany History of the Jews in Poland J__zef Pi__sudski Berlin Blockade Greco-Italian War
