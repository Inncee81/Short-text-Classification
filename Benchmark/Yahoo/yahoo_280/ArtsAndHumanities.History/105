how did nationalism contribute to world war i and ii has it done more good or bad for the world just for fun remember nationalism can be traced back further than napoleon to the american revolution and the french revolution i would even put forth that nationalism could be traced back to the english civil war of and the treaty of westphalia in maybe nationalism is said to have started with napoleon bonaparte who forged france into a united country until then the french language was not even the national language there were at least local dialects it contributed to both world wars in the sense that people were united and encouraged to fight based on national goals or national affronts as in someone was trying to take away something that was rightfully theirs most usually land bear in mind that there are different flavors of nationalism including religious and ethnic i am refering here to nationalism based on citizenship in my opinion nationalism is a good thing when it is used to protect the people of a country for example people may unite in national sympathy when a natural disaster strikes or when the country is being invaded nationalism is a bad thing however when it is used i would argue misused to rally a people to take the offensive hitler did this as did nearly all the nations during world war i it could be argued that bush did this to convince the american people of the need to invade iraq and by the way dee sznutts doesn't know what nationalism and socialism mean if that's his true answer Jew State Napoleonic Wars Liberalism Nationalism History of Europe History of Germany House of Bourbon Democracy Germany Anglosphere French Revolution Axis Powers War of 1812 Franco-Prussian War Appeasement Napoleon I of France Property (ownership right) Patriotism Theory of conduct Iraq disarmament crisis European Theatre of World War II French Revolutionary Wars Pacifism Kurdish people Enlightenment Spain History of the United States France Goodness and value theory The UN Security Council and the Iraq war Romantic nationalism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Nazism Causes of World War I Napoleonic code Anti-French sentiment in the United States Participants in World War II French colonial empires Winter War First French Empire Flanders Allies of World War II World War I American Revolutionary War Religion Franco-American relations Civil war Second French Empire League of Nations Criticisms of the War on Terrorism Propaganda Military history of France Teach the Controversy Media bias George W.
