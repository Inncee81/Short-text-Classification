first in the americas we all know that it was not columbus who found the americas there is evidance that chinese egyptians vikings had landed far before who was the first then the native americans were there first and it's believed they crossed via the bering sea however there a number of contenders for the next wave of colonists the vikings did land in vinland newfoundland and probably got as far south as new york the chinese appear to have landed on the west coast in the 's more than likely in south central america there are other contenders too the welsh prince madog is supposedly to have traveled in the th century and landed near mobile bay alabama st brendan from ireland is also supposed to have made the same journey at about the same time however i think these are myths used by the english as a means of justifying the legitimacy of their claims to territories i doubt the egyptians managed to succeed however if you were to say the who was the first of the next wave of colonists to land on continental america i'd have to say it was john cabot like columbus he was looking for an alternate route to india columbus also never set foot on continental america he discovered the caribbean islands and theres fierce debate as to where kennewick man whose remains were discovered on the banks of the ohio river fit into the overall scheme of things since he appears to be of an earlier wave of colonisation than native americans the main thing with the success of colonisation is the technology gap the chinese vikings welsh etc had pretty much the same technology as the natives hand to hand weapons and bows so there was no real advantage had militarily however by the arrival of columbus and cabot weapons for them had progressed to firearms giving an increased stand off advantage Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact Americas Newfoundland Vinland Christopher Columbus Age of Discovery Madoc Indigenous peoples of the Americas Norse colonization of the Americas British colonization of the Americas Atlantic Ocean Viking Age Viking Colonisation History of the Americas England Maritimes European colonization of the Americas British Empire Pre-Confederation history of Canada South America History of Canada French colonisation of the Americas French colonial empires North America Native Americans in the United States James Cook Vinland map Wales Frontier Roanoke Island Indigenous peoples in Brazil Military history of Japan Appalachian Mountains Languages in the United States History of the World Thirteen Colonies Canada History of Quebec Kensington Runestone New France Narrow gauge Midwestern United States History of Scandinavia Barbados Geography of Canada First Transcontinental Railroad Richard Amerike Anglo-Saxons History of Ireland Norman Conquest of England United States Lebor Gab__la __renn Columbus Day St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador USS Augusta (CA-31) Transcontinental nation Francisco Hern__ndez de C__rdoba (discoverer of Yucat__n) Hern__n Cort__s Newfoundland and Labrador Zheng He Early history of Ireland History of the United States International League Battle of Leyte Gulf History of the Southern United States History of the British Army Italian American Hernando de Soto (explorer) Imperialism in Asia Seven Years' War War of 1812 Population history of American indigenous peoples British Isles History of Africa Second Bloody Valentine War Massachusetts Bay Colony Economic history of Canada Historic regions of the United States Brian Boru Ohio History of Western Australia 2004 Atlantic hurricane season History of North America Patagonia Thanksgiving USS Vincennes (1826) Nationalism 1421 hypothesis
