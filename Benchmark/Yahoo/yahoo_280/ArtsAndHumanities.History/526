was jack the ripper a member of the royal family what became of him hmmm why does everyone think that jack was part of the royals it's quite disappointing to see so many people tricked by the foolery the media portrays the theory you are possibly thinking of is the royal masonic conspiracy and is one of many theories the idea of the 'ripper' being of royal blood or had dealings with royals is absurd the idea and basis of the theory for those who do not know is that prince albert victor and the story goes that he impregnated an 'unfortunate' a woman a prostitute this infatuation would bring albert to ruin and the child being bred from royal blood would legally gain heirship to the throne this couldn t be done so the royals along with the freemasons would contrive to rid the truth they employed the royal doctor sir william gull as albert was unable to perform the murders himself due to illness to murder those who knew of the truth the infatuation and the child these just happened to be polly nichols annie chapman liz stride catherine eddowes and mary kelly now with the theory explained let me get to the logical bias of this theory first of all the idea of william gull making his way through the streets of whitechapel alone can be dismissed as that as his stature promotes wouldn t have known about the layouts pf the east end the ripper' however clearly knew whitechapel east end and its slums so why not have sir william travel by carriage with an accomplice by the name of netley logically wouldn t someone have heard the loud noise of wheels rolling on cobblestones in the claustrophobic streets of whitechapel yet no one noticed these sounds or made mention of them at the time of the murders another interesting thing to note is that at the time of dark annie's murder a woman saw miss chapman outside hanbury street the place she was killed negotiating with a man most likely the 'ripper' in case you haven t caught on yet the witness saw one man not two she also saw no carriage would it help if i mentioned that the man she saw didn t match any of the royals okay another thing is that if the theory was correct all of the victims knew each other and had a regular friendship it is a known fact that none of the victims knew each other doesn t this throw the theory into shaky realism so why do so many movies such as the comic book adaptation from hell and the earlier tv miniseries 'jack the ripper' base there story and plot on this theory simply because it has the most dramatic interesting and playful affect they make the theory their movie because of the plot value not for truth and accuracy there was never a grape vine found at the scene of the murders mary kelly did in fact die inspector abberline did not know mary kelly no mention or evidence of laudanum or opium was found if i were you i'd do as much research as you can and find a much more worthy and reliable suspect i found one he goes by the name of francis tumblety tumblety the first and earliest notion of this subject came from one of the police officials on the case a mr littlechild who later wrote a letter describing his thoughts and theory and presenting his idea of who the murderer was this letter was only discovered in the twentieth century when a literature collector and librarian was cleaning out his books ridding of any to be sold he came across the letter and dismissed it as another hoax however when he sent it to a ripper collector and ripperologist stephen evans who later sent it for analysis which found the ink and paper to be authentic this letter later became known as the 'littlechild letter' and is the absolute basis of this theory tumblety himself and american doctor or 'quack' as referred to in the letter was known to be a hater of women a misogynist this man made regular visits to london one of which was in at the time of the murders known to have disguised himself on various occasions now for the interesting parts strong evidence against him was that tumblty collected uteruses preserving them and such annie chapman's uterus was taken more interesting to note is that on the night of the double murders of stride and eddowes upon tumblety's returning to his lodge house the lodging lady discovered that his clothes had visible bloodstains on them he was arrested on november th on charges of gross indecency and indecent assault with force and arms against four men between july th and november these eight charges were euphemisms for homosexual activities tumblety was then charged on suspicion of the whitechapel murders on the th suggested he was free to kill kelly between the th and th tumblety was bailed on november th a hearing was held on november th at the old bailey and the trial postponed until december th tumblety then fled to france under the alias frank townsend on the th and from there took the steamer la bretagne to new york city tumblety fits many requirements of what we now know as the serial killer profile he had a supposed hatred of women and prostitutes the abortion with the prostitute dumas his alleged failed marriage to an ex prostitute his collection of uteri etc tumblety was in london at the time and may indeed have been the infamous batty street lodger he therefore may have had fair knowledge of the east end environs tumblety may have had some anatomical knowledge as inferred by his collection of wombs his medical practice and his short term work with dr lispenard in rochester he was arrested in the midst of the autumn of terror on suspicion of having committed the murders there were no more murders after he fled england on the th november if one counts only the canonical five murders chief inspector littlechild a top name in scotland yard believed him a very likely suspect and he was not alone in his convictions tumblety was fond of using aliases disappearing without a trace and was the subject of police enquiries before his arrest scotland yard and the american police had been in touch numerous times concerning tumblety s flight from france to new york one of the three detectives inspectors assigned to the case was sent to new york at the same time perhaps to pursue tumblety tumblety evaded capture in new york city once again tumblety had the wealth necessary for frequent travel and could afford to change his clothes frequently should they have become bloodstained he was an eccentric but shrewd he had a tendency toward violence at times and his career may have included other offences both at home and abroad several acquaintances of his in america believed it likely that he was the ripper when interviewed in as a sidenote i have to mention that patricia cornwell's sickert theory is rediculous she bakes up many ideas that she forgets to support and base them and make truth out of them do not beleive it anyways i'll leave it here before i make this a ripper book hope it helps in any way cheers 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Constitution of the
