what was the black hole in the history of india the black hole of calcutta was a small dungeon where troops of the nawab of bengal siraj ud daulah held british prisoners of war after the capture of fort william on june john zephaniah holwell claimed that following the fall of the fort british and anglo indian soldiers and civilians were held overnight in conditions so cramped that a large proportion of those held died from suffocation heat exhaustion and crushing he claimed that prisoners died out of prisoners held doubt has been cast on both the numbers alleged and on whether the incident happened at all and some modern historians have suggested the incident was fabricated by holwell as a piece of propaganda to blacken the image of siraj the british established fort william to protect british east india company trade in the city of calcutta in the region of bengal in implicitly with a latent dream of colonizing bengal as well as all of india and explicitly in preparation for anticipated skirmishes with french forces the british began building up fort william's military strength and defences the nawab of bengal siraj ud daulah was unhappy with the british company's direct politico military interference with the internal affairs of his country and perceived a direct threat to the independence of bengal as the ruler of bengal he ordered an immediate stop to the fort's military enhancement but the company did not heed his order as such siraj organised his army and laid siege to the fort whose defenders took many casualties the garrison's commander organised an escape and left a token force in the military fort under the command of john zephaniah holwell a one time military surgeon who was a top east india company civil servant desertions by allied troops mainly dutch made even this temporary defence untenable and the fort was taken holwell wrote an account of the incident in which he claimed that of prisoners suffocated when imprisoned in the tiny room his version of events which was not challenged by other survivors was widely accepted at the time in britain indian soldiers took the surviving defenders prisoner who numbered from to together with an unknown number of anglo indian soldiers and other persons of mixed ancestry many of them civilians who had been sheltering in the fort during this period some prisoners were able to escape and others attacked their guards according to holwell the troops apparently acting on their own then packed the prisoners in a guard room measuring by ft by m and locked them in overnight prisoners begged for water or escape growing delirious from heat exhaustion as time passed men collapsed from heat stroke suffocation or trampling the prisoners were not released until morning when siraj ud daulah awoke by then certain modern historians believe some members of the garrison were dead or missing for other reasons but because so many non combatants were present in the fort when it fell the number that died cannot be stated with any precision the corpses were thrown into a ditch holwell and three others were sent as prisoners to murshidabad the rest of the survivors obtained their liberty after the victory of a relief expedition under robert clive the black hole was later used as a warehouse and an obelisk feet m high was erected in memory of the dead the following description from a encyclopedia portrays holwell's point of view vividly the dungeon was a strongly barred room and was not intended for the confinement of more than two or three men at a time there were only two windows and a projecting veranda outside and thick iron bars within impeded the ventilation while fires raging in different parts of the fort suggested an atmosphere of further oppressiveness the prisoners were packed so tightly that the door was difficult to close one of the soldiers stationed in the veranda was offered rupees to have them removed to a larger room he went away but returned saying it was impossible the bribe was then doubled and he made a second attempt with a like result the nawab was asleep and no one dared wake him by nine o'clock several had died and many more were delirious a frantic cry for water now became general and one of the guards more compassionate than his fellows caused some to be brought to the bars where mr holwell and two or three others received it in their hats and passed it on to the men behind in their impatience to secure it nearly all was spilt and the little they drank seemed only to increase their thirst self control was soon lost those in remote parts of the room struggled to reach the window and a fearful tumult ensued in which the weakest were trampled or pressed to death they raved fought prayed blasphemed and many then fell exhausted on the floor where suffocation put an end to their torments about o'clock the prisoners began to drop off fast at length at six in the morning siraj ud dowla awoke and ordered the door to be opened of the only including mr holwell from whose narrative published in the annual register for this account is partly derived remained alive and they were either stupefied or raving fresh air soon revived them and the commander was then taken before the nawab who expressed no regret for what had occurred and gave no other sign of sympathy than ordering the englishman a chair and a glass of water notwithstanding this indifference mr holwell and some others acquit him of any intention of causing the catastrophe and ascribe it to the malice of certain inferior officers but many think this opinion unfounded holwell's account included a summary of the alleged victims list of the smothered in the black hole prison exclusive of sixty nine consisting of dutch and english sergeants corporals
