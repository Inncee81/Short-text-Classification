how has life affected the average german since the fall of the wall the world i have been going to germany a few times now and have been to the former east many times and i was curious what life was like compared to the west and how life has changed for everyone since the wall was taken down it was correct my german friends have mixed feelings i have friends on both sides of the wall and zones life during the wall i only know from what they told me it was very quiet compared to now and their were far more children youth programs which i tried to tell them were propaganda festivals but we always have small debates and discussions over these things because though they know they were a nation controlled from the kremlin they are no longer for many years now and yes life was tough for many years right after the wall fell econonomically for the whole country the west grew envious and began to hate the east because costs began to rise due to the mass influx of people on their government programs it nearly busted their system fortunately within ten years they managed it and began to turn the east into a productive area which the west is not envious in a different way jealousy they have newer and better places and equipment soon the whole country will act as one again as the generation that were the kids to tear the wall down have total control of the government life was a stuggle for about a decade but they over all are happy in the east in most ways the freedom to see other countries they could not see before now the west germans have mostly felt that the east was getting special privelages at their expence i just hope that it all balances out someday for that country John Howard Yoder German reunification East Germany History of Germany since 1945 Siegfried Line Berlin Wall Germany Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact Western Roman Empire Telephone numbering plan Daylight saving time Economic relations of Japan Fox News The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie GDR border system Occupation of Denmark West Berlin Warren Buffett Inflation Freedom of speech Olympic Stadium, Berlin Social Security debate (United States) Fahrenheit 9/11 Social Security (United States) Central processing unit The Wall Jon Secada Consequences of German Nazism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Marshall Plan Great Depression in the United Kingdom Russia Humphrey Bogart Monetary policy Propaganda Obi-Wan Kenobi Nazi Germany Iago Equine conformation Climate change Floppy disk Appeasement Geography of Africa One Tree Hill (TV series) Sea level rise Canadian and American economies compared Alignment (role-playing games) ITV The Amber Spyglass The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Overpopulation Economic inequality Media in the People's Republic of China Voter turnout Domestic AC power plugs and sockets German student movement Theory of conduct Wind power Brave New World Expulsion of Germans after World War II Inventory Milwaukee, Wisconsin Rei Ayanami Johnny the Homicidal Maniac BBC television drama T-34 Kodocha Sigmund Freud Germany national football team Religious Society of Friends German language Battle of Berlin Bangladesh Liberation War France in modern times End of World War II in Europe National Socialist German Workers Party Eastern Front (World War II) First Battle of the Atlantic Gordon Banks Total war Democracy Divorce Winter War Irish Republicanism Iron Curtain The Contender (television series) People's Republic of China History of the German Democratic Republic Karen Horney Music radio Stairway White flight Classified information Hera Public Broadcasting Service Hitler in popular culture Ramallah
