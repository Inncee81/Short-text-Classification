what was the boston tea party the boston tea party was an act of protest by the american colonists against great britain in which they destroyed many crates of tea bricks on ships in boston harbor the incident which took place on thursday december has been seen as helping to spark the american revolution the stamp act of and the townshend acts of angered colonists regarding british decisions on taxing the colonies despite a lack of representation in the westminster parliament one of the protesters was john hancock in hancock's ship liberty was seized by customs officials and he was charged with smuggling he was defended by john adams and the charges were eventually dropped however hancock later faced several hundred more indictments hancock organized a boycott of tea from china sold by the british east india company whose sales in the colonies then fell from pounds kg to pounds kg by the company had large debts huge stocks of tea in its warehouses and no prospect of selling it because smugglers such as hancock were importing tea without paying import taxes the british government passed the tea act which allowed the east india company to sell tea to the colonies directly and without payment of any customs or duties whatsoever in britain instead paying the much lower american duty this tax break allowed the east india company to sell for lower prices than those offered by the colonial merchants and smugglers american colonists particularly the wealthy smugglers resented this favored treatment of a major company which employed lobbyists and wielded great influence in parliament protests resulted in both philadelphia and new york but it was those in boston that made their mark in history still reeling from the hutchinson letters bostonians suspected the new tea tax was simply another attempt by the british parliament to squash american freedom samuel adams wealthy smugglers and others who had profited from the smuggled tea called for agents and consignees of the east india company tea to abandon their positions consignees who hesitated were terrorized through attacks on their warehouses and even their homes the first of many ships carrying the east india company tea was hms dartmouth arriving in late november a standoff ensued between the port authorities and the sons of liberty samuel adams whipped up the growing crowd by demanding a series of protest meetings coming from both the city and outlying areas thousands attended these meetings every meeting larger than the one before the crowds shouted defiance not only at the british parliament the east india company and hms dartmouth but at governor thomas hutchinson as well who was still struggling to have the tea landed on the night of december the protest meeting held at boston's old south meeting house was the largest yet seen an estimated people were said to have attended on thursday december the evening before the tea was due to be landed the sons of liberty thinly disguised as mohawk indians left the massive protest meeting and headed toward griffin's wharf where lay dartmouth and the newly arrived beaver and eleanour swiftly and efficiently casks of tea were brought up from the hold to the deck reasonable proof that some of the indians were in fact longshoremen the casks were opened and the tea dumped overboard the work lasting well into the night was quick thorough and efficient by dawn lbs tons of tea worth an estimated had been consigned to waters of boston harbor nothing else had been damaged or stolen except a single padlock accidentally broken and anonymously replaced not long thereafter tea washed up on the shores around boston for weeks this act brought criticism from both colonial and british officials for instance benjamin franklin stated that the destroyed tea must be repaid and he offered to repay with his own money the british government responded by closing the port of boston and put in place other laws that were known as the intolerable acts also called the coercive acts or punitive acts however a number of colonists were inspired to carry out similar acts such as the burning of the peggy stewart the boston tea party eventually proved to be one of the many causes that led to the american revolution at the very least the boston tea party and the reaction that followed served to rally support for revolutionaries in the thirteen colonies who were eventually successful in their fight for independence as far as tea drinking itself was concerned many colonists in boston and elsewhere in the country pledged to keep away from the drink as a protest turning instead to balsamic hyperion made from raspberry leaves other herbal infusions and coffee this social protest movement away from tea drinking was not however long lived the boston tea party is known around the world and has been inspirational to other rebels for example erik h erikson records in his book gandhi's truths that when mahatma gandhi met with the british viceroy in after the indian salt protest campaign gandhi took some duty free salt from his shawl and said with a smile that the salt was to remind us of the famous boston tea party War of
