do you like or hate marie antoinette i just wrote a page research paper on why should not have been executed and that she is one of the most misuderstood figures in history just wondering what people's thoughts of her were in the present day thanks thanks your answers are excellent i just wanted to clear up the whole let them eat cake thing the original the french is qu'ils mangent de la brioche it has been suggested that the speaker's intention wasn't as cynical as is generally supposed french law required bakers to sell loaves at fixed prices and fancy loaves had to be sold at the same price as basic breads this was aimed at preventing bakers from selling just the more profitable expensive products the let them eat brioche a form of cake made of flour butter and eggs would have been a sensible suggestion in the face of a flour shortage as it would have allowed the poor to eat what would otherwise have been unaffordable it's rather a mouthful so to speak but if the phrase had been reported as 'let them buy cake at the same price as bread' we might now think better of the french nobility i believe that marie antoinette was near oblivious to the times surrounding her she was infatuated with having the best clothing the best mansions the best everything and she had her husband wrapped around her finger doing everything to please her you combine that with very violent and overly militant army of starving peasants anyone will obviously see why she was killed however i think that her actions though neglecting the interest of the common public did not merit death the militant peasants were much more violent and almost oppressive than were our american forefathers in the american revolution the french sought utter domination and retribution our forefathers sought independance and separation they had swung all the way from a monarchy to a mobocracy marie antoinettes should have been held prisoner and sentenced by a jury of her peers that would have been just to her and would have fulfilled what the french were looking for in their revolution to protect the rights of man Marie Antoinette French Revolution Microeconomics Capital punishment Cultural Revolution Plame affair British monarchy Democracy Experiment Pizza Freedom of speech Finnish Civil War Sharon Tate Parliament of the United Kingdom Supply and demand Salic law 613 mitzvot Property (ownership right) Aztec Domestic violence Famine Grammatical mood Russian Revolution of 1917 Wal-Mart Chocolate Karl Marx Joseph (Hebrew Bible) Anarchism First Amendment to the United States Constitution Gettysburg Address Theory of conduct IBM PC compatible Libertarian socialism British House of Commons French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Royal Assent Japanese cuisine EastEnders Hiberno-English House of Lords Honor__ Mirabeau Jewish cuisine Divorce Breakfast American Revolution Capitalism Gold standard Pancake Shewbread Free trade Capital accumulation Trademark Head of state Babylonian law Origins of the American Civil War Political correctness Bagel Anne Boleyn Intellectual property Louis XV of France History of the British constitution Jacques-Louis David Communist Romania American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Palestinian National Authority Bengali cuisine Women in Islam Father Divine Grammatical aspect Decapitation Potato Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Socrates History of the Netherlands Dim sum Anarchism in Spain Two Treatises of Government Arab-Israeli conflict Parliament of Canada Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Shit American individualist anarchism Second Sudanese Civil War Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Public good
