what kinds of difficulties were faced by irish convicts in the early colony of australia what does this have to do with sectarianism and the church role of english ministers if you can tell me but primarily the above question please thank you firstly pretty much like anyone else the colony nearly starved in the first few years as the soil around sydney is too poor for farming then when the second fleet arrived it had been run by private contractors and many of those on the ships were dying or starving unlike those of the first which had been a british navy job with relatively few deaths and most convicts arriving in decent health the problem for some of the irish was that there were no catholic priests until some years had passed and to some extent they were discriminated against by other convicts and the marines however some of the governors like phillip the first and macquarie probably tried to reduce this as much as possible the problem for the irish was that they were predominantly catholic protestant england had very nearly been invaded in by a huge spanish fleet which had sailed with the pope's blessing for years or more england had seen the catholics in their midst and in ireland as potential traitors and their suspicions were borne out on some occasions even in the newly formed united states of america some people wished to exclude all catholics the situation of convicts varied a lot there were no gangs with people chained together except in punishment squads for those who had committed extra crimes in one case a convict arrived with his free wife on the same ship he was released into her custody and they started a business in the new town supplying ships since convict transportation continued for almost years there is no quick answer to your question policies and attitudes changed as time went by and some places were very much worse than others some of the commanders must have been nearly psychopathic when you read of norfolk island and macquarie harbour on the other hand the main prison at port arthur had central heating and a small private cottage was built for a political convict who i think was irish you probably would have to do a lot of reading to get to the reality of this and not take the first book you read as being the final word robert hughes the fatal shore has a lot of good stuff in it but he puts a bleak spin on a good deal of it Arthur Phillip Sydney Elizabeth I of England Norfolk Island History of Australia before 1901 History of Ireland Parliament of the United Kingdom Eamon de Valera Second Battle of the Atlantic Irish Republicanism Spanish Armada Sinn F__in Constitution of Ireland Philip Gidley King Lachlan Macquarie Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II British monarchy Roman Catholic Diocese of Honolulu Capital punishment History of the United Kingdom Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849) Australia Irish Confederate Wars Australian English Unionists (Ireland) Crime in Australia Provisional Irish Republican Army Separation of church and state HMS Sirius (1786) Roman Catholic Church Appeal Hercules Robinson, 1st Baron Rosmead Northern Ireland Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus British Empire Nine Years War (Ireland) Aubrey-Maturin series Plantations of Ireland Timeline of Australian history History of Melbourne Civil rights Same-sex marriage in Canada Theory of conduct Confederate Ireland Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom Humphrey Gilbert Irish Civil War Jacobitism Fianna F__il Irish Free State Philip II of Spain Unreformed House of Commons Williamite war in Ireland Mary I of England William Balmain Vichy France Royal Ulster Constabulary The Influence of Sea Power upon History Henry VIII of England Irish Canadian Anglo-Irish War Battle of Trafalgar Third English Civil War Sydney Hospital John of England USS Wyoming (BB-32) History of Singapore Colonial America Northern Ireland peace process John Wycliffe Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford Norwegian Campaign About-Picard law Sectarianism History of Adelaide Royal Assent Convictism in Western Australia Capital punishment in the United States History of Northern Ireland USS Missouri (BB-63) Maritimes John Henry Cardinal Newman Freedom of speech USS William B.
