did you know the st president was a black man john hanson research it he's on the back of the bill yes i have heard this one over and over again we did not have a first president for real until we had beaten the british no president of the country was named until after the revolutionary war sure their was a president of the continetal congress but that is hardly the president of the usa or country even today the congress has its leaders that are not our president so yes their is truth to this but it is a bit inter twined with truth and fiction he certainly lived and was a part of it as the site says but of the whole usa no only the congress which was disbanded and reorganized when the constitution was written so during the war maybe yes but we were not a true nation yet we were fighting for our independance he most certainly was important but washington is the first true usa president that is why he gets the title he was never president of the congress just of the usa a minor difference in symantecs but your information is good and fairly accurate it just leaves out that our nation was not official until after we won the war of independence he definitely deserves recognition as one of hte first presidents of the continetal congress but not the nation United States Politics of the United States Congress of the United States John Hanson Articles of Confederation Library of Congress President of the Continental Congress President of the United States George Washington United States Senate American Revolutionary War Irish Republicanism United States House of Representatives Death and state funeral of Ronald Reagan Yugoslavia History of the United States Constitution Downing Street memo Gettysburg Address Supreme Court of the United States History of the United States (1789-1849) Soviet Union Movement to impeach George W.
