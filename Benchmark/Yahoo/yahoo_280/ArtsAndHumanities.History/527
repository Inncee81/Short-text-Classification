if the world war i and ii never occured what kind of world would we have today would it be better or worse would we have advanced to information and atomic age today when do you believe the world war would occur what causes it then without the great war there would have been no nazi movement in germany or fascist control in italy so it's safe to say that without the first world war the second would not have taken place at least not as it did i would argue that had the wars not taken place the world would be a much more dangerous place we're assuming that atomic energy jet propulsion and the like were only reached because of the large amount of money and science devoted to military endeavors during the war but the largest breakthroughs came in the pre and post war period science with or without the wars marched on let's not forget that the great age of industrialization was just before the first world war if anything the first world war coupled with the great depression changed the united states from an rural to an increasingly urban society but this war probably slowed economic and industrial development in italy and france and certainly had a devestating effect on the progression of industry in germany and austria hungary not to mention russia fascists would not have won support in italy as the government had so badly bankrupted the country and thrown away the lives of some italian soldiers in a practical stalemate with austria without the fascist movement in italy nazism would not have the effect on a humiliated german public mr hitler would have led a normal life as would have had millions but this assumes that the triggers of world war i would never occur i doubt this if not these triggers elsewhere the growing web of super alliances would have pulled all of europe into a war if it wasn't the serbs to assassinate archduke ferdinand then perhaps a young czech or croat would have five years later perhaps had tsar nicholas remained in power in russia a like minded anarchist would have killed him as they had his grandfather russia was in a state nearing the collapse of the state prior to the war there is no telling how much longer that system would have held fast germany had far outgrown the limits of her borders and vied with great britain for industrial dominance by the turn of the th century without the first world war i think it would be only a matter of time before germany and france warred over the territories lost in the franco prussian war italy and austria would have fought over the south tyrol polish nationalism would have pushed for a new revival as the serbians had americans may have went to war with mexico again with no terrible war in hindsight to bring out a respect for pacifism world war i changed the way we view ourselves and our nations before hitler's obsession with levels of racial purity we evaluated each other by hundreds of races a sicilian race a scottish race and an anglo one without the war would ireland have successfully won its independence or would london have resorted to bloodshed to keep it before the war a country's strength was judged by its population citizens were very much disposable in the case of a national emergency such as a war that was primarily because such a massive loss of life in ridiculously futile trench warfare hadn't created the respect for individual life that we have today among the nations of europe the great war wasn't the first world war several could be called such it was just the one that caused the greatest loss of life i don't think anything could be done to prevent such wars from occuring we'll certainly experience them again for whatever reason whatever just ness is behind the war i think the general trends would have still occured had we not had these great and altering wars perhaps medicine would have lagged in the surgical arena but the constant search for innovation would have propelled it in other areas maybe flight would have still been only a novelty in the s and s but certainly the globalization taking place would have led the aviation industry to realize the potential for travel in the skies a nucleur age maybe not but if not a nucleur weapon definately a bigger and worse weapon that could deter one's enemies i just think the destructive nature's of the wars and in a sense their futility led us into an age where we see war as the last resort rather than as an effective diplomatic tool without the wars we'd see the worldview with our great grandfathers' eyes Appeasement Austria-Hungary Nazism History of Europe
