were there such things as these in the dark ages i hear alot about it in simple games involving the dark ages like thiefs warriors archers mages pff yea right but i did hear some great storys of real time thiefs back in thous areas of time were there such thing and just as exciting games about thieves or are they just game made charatures and made up storys warriors archers and theives certainly were around duing the dark ages and you could argue that mages were too in the form of alchemists and practitioners of old pagen religions and or witchcraft but the presentation of these types of characters you'll find in games are highly romanticised versions of the real people they're loosely based on things people actually did sort of during that time period but only very loosely and really if you get into the history far enough what people were actually doing is just as intersting as the characters in the games Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Ragnarok Online MapleStory Final Fantasy XI Final Fantasy character classes Final Fantasy X-2 Final Fantasy Fable (video game) Conan the Barbarian Baldur's Gate series MegaMan Battle Network Magus Final Fantasy (video game) Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones Races of Final Fantasy 8-Bit Theater Warcraft II Final Fantasy Tactics Final Fantasy III RuneScape DragonQuest Wizard White Mage Quest for Glory Necromancy Mercedes Lackey Ryo Bakura Final Fantasy X First-person shooter Thief (computer game) MUD Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Character class Mage: The Ascension Sly 3: Honor Among Thieves Genesis LPMud Forgotten Realms: Demon Stone Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Final Fantasy magic Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles The Hobbit Witch-hunt Final Fantasy Tactics Advance Rave Master Legacy of Kain Differences between editions of Dungeons & Dragons Kingdom Hearts II Pools of Darkness Ragnarok The Animation Christian views on witchcraft The Dark Eye RuneScape locations Drizzt Do'Urden Witchcraft Dungeons & Dragons: Shadow over Mystara Thief (character class) Tamriel Mage Knight Jonathan Archer Yu-Gi-Oh!
