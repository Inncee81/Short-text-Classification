whats the difference between the states and the union territories they have seperated the states as and the union territories as in what way how canada has a constitution the constitution act of the constitution talks about all sorts of things like what our official languages are and what our individual rights are the constitution works together with our system of laws to make up the rules of the country the constitution also indicates what provinces are a part of canada and what the powers of those provinces are for example provinces have jurisdiction over education and the environment territories on the other hand are created by federal law that means the territories have a bit less power than the provinces they still have representation in the federal government but don't have provincial governments the biggest difference is that the provinces get to vote on changes to the constitution but the territories do not are you sure that's right up until canada didn't have a constitution instead we had something called the british north america act this act functioned the same way as the constitution does but reflected our continuing close ties to great britain up until most changes to the british north america act had to be passed by the parliament of great britain in under prime minister pierre trudeau the constitution act was passed this act did two main things it added a charter of rights and freedoms and it made the process of changing the constitution something that canadians could do on their own canada's constitutional documents including the british north america act this is a bit detailed younger students will likely find it goes a bit over their head i've tried to simplify things as much as possible note up until everything was known as the british north america act the constitution retroactively changed the names of everything constitution act formerly known as the british north america act after the war with the colonists in the united states queen victoria decided it would be in the best interests of everyone involved to consent to the formation of a parliament within canada this parliament made decisions and laws for canada like great britain it had a house of commons and a senate however the crown's the queen's representative called the governor general had the 'power of disallowance' this allowed him to revoke any federal law within two years after it was enacted he could also withhold assent from a bill for a period of two years ultimately preventing it from becoming a law the provinces of united upper canada ontario lower canada quebec nova scotia and new brunswick were recognized as forming the dominion of canada the crown's representatives for these provinces were called the lieutenant governor one per province

constitution constitution act part of the canada act includes the charter of rights and freedoms includes the notwithstanding clause this allows the governments to suspend parts of the charter of rights for a period of years at which time it must review the suspension in december quebec invoked the notwithstanding clause related to bill its language law bill required signage outside stores to be french only even thought that violated canada's charter of rights you could not have an english sign in quebec in a report that bill violated the international covenant on civil and political rights was released by a united nations human rights committee since then quebec has allowed french english signs as long as the french is predominant the act was signed by of the provinces the quebec government has never signed it despite this the act is legally binding in canada why didn't quebec sign there is a strong 'separatist' movement in quebec including a strong provincial party that usually makes up the majority of the government members at the time this party was in power and did not wish to sign the constitution of canada because they don't want to be part of canada why do they want to separate this movement wishes to be their own country apart from canada the main issue is language and culture they are concerned their french speaking culture is being overshadowed by the majority english speaking culture of canada in there was even a 'referendum' vote of all the people in quebec about whether the people wished to separate the vote to stay part of canada won by a very small majority no one knows what would have happened if the majority had wanted to separate the vote simply reflected the wishes of the people and was not legally binding however in a democratic country like canada the wishes of the people have great influence proclamation bringing into force the constitution act can the document that the queen signed at parliament hill making the
