unlawful deduction of wage my daughter has been working at a local childrens' day nursery for mths each month always seems to be a struggle for her employers to pay the staff salary it's often late or paid in installments my daughters salary was not paid into her account on monday when it was due approaching her employer yesterday she was told that she had no money and didn't know if or when she would be able to pay her and the rest of the staff that she may have to give them all notice but as yet has not done so what concerns us more is this person owned three nurseries and one has recently become insolvent leaving a lot of angry unpaid parents and staff we are worried that my daughter may end up losing her whole months pay does anyone have any advice they could offer us that could help my daughter recover her wage fairly quickly thanks a contract of employment most people think is just a thing that employees have to follow but it is in fact applicable to both sides sumarrising what both sides agree to fulfill even if she did not sign her name on a line there is still a contract in force one of the standard terms of employment is that the employer will pay wages in a timely manner the fact that the employer has not had bills paid is not the fault of the employees so the employees cannot be held liable small claims court is possibly a latter resort but your daughter needs to tell the employer that they want money or none of the staff will work the employees are legally entitled to get paid Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Insurance Article One of the United States Constitution Wal-Mart Apprenticeship Life insurance Anarchism and capitalism National Kidney Foundation Singapore Contract Taxation in the United States Child support Civil rights Health insurance Credit card Microeconomics Employment Unlawful combatant Plame affair Appeal Surplus value Social Security (United States) Employment in Hong Kong Education in the People's Republic of China Student loan Salary cap Tax 2005 trial of Michael Jackson LiveJournal National Insurance Affirmative action Flat tax Divorce Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Compensation of employees Unemployment Day care Deflation (economics) Labour economics Minimum wage Annuity Satchel Paige Stock Conscription Economic inequality Salary Law firm Karl Rove Unemployment benefit Surplus labour Working time Payroll Capitalism SCO-Linux controversies Neighbours Tennessee State Constitution National Football League Progressive tax National Minimum Wage Act 1998 Bruce Johnson Efficiency wages Corporation Gross domestic product Wang Mang 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Operation Market Garden George W.
