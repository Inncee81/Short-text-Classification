are there any lawyers that i can talk to on thursday i got suspened for something i didnt do and wasnt aware of the problem theres word around that on monday when i got back from my suspension that they are going to fire me i know i didnt do anything and they dont have any grounds of firing me can something be done if i do get fired on monday you are more than likely in an employee at will state meaning you can be fired for anything as long as it doesn't violate any state or federal laws you say you didn't do it do what when they brought you into the office to suspend you did they discuss there investigative methods and how they determined it was you who did it unless you are the minority where you work only female or latina chances of pursuing anything is zilch the bigger issue here is collecting unemployment again since you do not mention what the suspension was over it is very difficult to say if you can even collect if you are being accused of theft it means they had grounds to terminate you and they can fight your claim on these grounds not to collect you can collect unemployment if you were terminated without cause if there is cause insubordination violence theft excessive lateness or absences etc your employer can request a protest form with anyone of these grounds and you can be very much denied by the department of labor unemployment insurance board unfortunately there is nothing you can do based on the little information you have offered Plame affair Unemployment Treaty Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Capitalism Inflation Microeconomics Insurance Divorce Civil rights Article One of the United States Constitution Supreme Court of the United States Life insurance 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Wal-Mart Annuity Anarcho-capitalism Lawyer 2004 U.S. election voting controversies, Ohio Tom DeLay Classified information Social Security (United States) Mediation American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Labour economics Trade union American individualist anarchism Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Article Two of the United States Constitution Democracy NAACP Minimum wage Human rights in the United States Bill Clinton Plame affair timeline Judicial review Iran's nuclear program Child support 1992 Los Angeles riots Ernst Z__ndel Israeli Arab Able Danger Capital punishment New Deal Michael D.
