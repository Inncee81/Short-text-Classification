robby fined nascar has announced its fine for robby grodon k and probation for the rest of the year pretty light if you asked me but i think its nascar admitting they had a part in the whole thing if they felt they were right nascar would have slapped him much harder thoughts hmm that's an odd amount it's like we have to fine him more than k because we suspended him but we probably shouldn't have penalized him at all so let's make it look semi legitimate with a fine maybe nascar nation won't figure it out and we can discretely move on with the season that's what that says to me anyway probation that's the biggest joke of a penalty that nascar has who isn't on probation right now other than maybe jeff burton and bobby labonte have you ever seen a guy on probation that actually got in deeper trouble because of it Tony Stewart Richard Childress Racing Hendrick Motorsports Kevin Harvick Roush Racing NASCAR Rookie of the Year Chip Ganassi Racing Bill Davis Racing Dale Earnhardt, Inc.
