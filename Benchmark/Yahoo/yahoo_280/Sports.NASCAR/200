nascar ps or ps is it worth buying a ps for nascar is it way better then the ps version can some one please tell me the difference between them well besides the graphics the ps version has the draft wake i have draft wake for my xbox and the only way to play the game is to get a wheel so figure in another or so not sure how much the logitech wheel costs for the ps but that's what the xbox 's wheel runs if you don't have an hdtv then there isn't any reason to spend that kind of money if you plan on getting hd you can drop about on a nice t v lcd is the only way to go when it comes to gaming in hd if you're a hardcore gamer and you are going to get gta and some other games coming out this fall i guess that's cool but think very hard before you drop on a new system and if you were thinking about doing it just for nascar i think that's a horrible mistake i made the move but it was for more than one reason and went out and bought a hdtv i honestly don't think it's worth buying a ps just for nascar it's a great game but holy crap that's a lot of money if you don't have an hdtv then i strongly suggest not doing it if you have hdtv and want to drop that kind of money i guess that's cool but make sure it's for more than just the sake of getting nascar and if you are going to do it get a wheel it's the only way to go hope this helps Xbox High-definition television Grand Theft Auto III Nintendo Revolution Craps Wheel of Fortune Monopoly (game) Computer and video games Sega Dreamcast Mouse (computing) Theory of conduct PlayStation 3 Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX America's Army Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Poker jargon Baseball Stars Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Counter-Strike Xbox 360 Halo (video game series) Nintendo Entertainment System Enhanced remake Rockstar North Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 2 Shit $ale of the Century Roush Racing Blackjack Sega Saturn Nintendo Match Game Microeconomics Winning Streak Stormfront Studios Warez ATI Technologies MMORPG PlayStation 2 The Joker's Wild Advanced Squad Leader Inflation Computer role-playing game Galactic Civilizations Console wars IBM PC compatible Windows Vista 2000 Australian Grand Prix Electronic Arts United States dollar Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Dale Earnhardt Game show GeForce FX Conker's Bad Fur Day Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Tic-Tac-Dough Xbox Live Sega Game controller MAME Console game Hyperinflation Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Dead or Alive (video game) Philosophical skepticism 3dfx Final Fantasy XI Late Night with Conan O'Brien Joe Gibbs DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution Green Day Overclocking Star Wars: Galaxies Roulette Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Rare (video game company) The Sims 2 Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories Baroque chess Sega 32X Pump It Up Sim racing DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution Britpop Puyo Pop Fever You Don't Know Jack Scrabble (game show) Skateboarding trick Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?
