what is mikeys problem we went to pocono and had pit passes we saw mikey on a cart and i asked him to sign my book he turned to his driver and said speed up all the other drivers were very nice and stopped to sign stuff i don't know what his problem is he was quite rude wow you know i love michael waltrip because he has been such an awesome spokes person for nascar but i too had a bad experience when i had the chance to meet him the infineon race i asked him if i could have my picture taken with him and he hardly smiled and was in my opinion kind of snobbish it's not like he has a millions fans chasing after his autograph it kind of hurt my feelings and i had a bad taste about if for a while and then i thought to my self well he is under a lot of pressure now that he is on his own and it was prior to his qualifying so i let it all go but now hearing what has just been said i have to wonder he is under tremendous pressures now even more than last year but how hard can it be to stop and sign some autographs and be personable to fans i really do not like kurt busch at all but i must say that he is not at all like most all the cup drivers i have had the experience in meeting in i broght my young cousin to qualifying day infineon and that girl know every driver cup busch and she was so excited we were sitting down on pit lane as all the drivers had to come out of the garages to get into there cars and qualify and she approached everyone she saw they all of course obliged her and stopped to get there picture taken with her but were very rushed kurt actually stopped crouched down to her level and asked who was taking the picture and was very sweet about it so in that aspect i respect kurt david gilliland was really awesome that day too he was sitting down there on pit lane just waiting for his turn out this was before he was full time cup driver my son chatted with him for a good minutes and when my cousin asked him for his autograph my son said do you ever get tired of that he said not yet and smiled it was awesome he was the very last car to qualify and he made the show he is one my new fav's go david NASCAR Hendrick Motorsports Tony Stewart Penske Racing Indianapolis 500 2000 Australian Grand Prix NEXTEL Cup Darrell Waltrip Craftsman Truck Series Kevin Harvick Shaggy dog story Greg Sacks Ernie Irvan 2005 United States Grand Prix NASCAR Thunder 2004 Evernham Motorsports Robby Gordon Dale Earnhardt, Jr. Kyle Busch Chris Amon Lake Speed Dale Earnhardt, Inc.
