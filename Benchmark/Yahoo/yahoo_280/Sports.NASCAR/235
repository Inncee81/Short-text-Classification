is espn really this bad or do they just not care what i'm speaking of is espn's coverage of nascar i could sit here for a long time talking about certain things they do wrong or dont do at all commentators cameramen reporters coverage and a few more things i cant think of right now in my opinion espn and not just them has turned the nba into a dunk contest mlb into a home run derby until new drug guidelines and the nfl into a end zone dance contest when you think about it that's how you get on sportscenter anyway i dont really think they dont care it just seems like they dont where the problem lies is in management thinking that they know what what you want to see even if you dont it's obvious that they think nascar is boring too long or something i guess that's why they have to spice it up some almost all die hard nascar fans know what i'm saying i love nascar dont kill it because its taking over embrace it i think that they are just really bad come on a basketball player for a commentator let's get real rusty wallace was not a great personality in racing and he isn't one now one of the best announcers they have is alan bestwick and he is relegated to pit reporting dr punch has some idea but i don't see him as host and those girls they have do not have a clue andy petree is okay why every time that something happened were they in commercial break why were we sitting there when they came back wondering what the cautions were for too many commercials or just no sense i for one really hate their broadcasts they also cut short after race interviews to go on to the next show please espn we like to hear what some of our drivers have to say after the race heck i watched one race that they covered on abc and they cut away before carl edwards even did his backflip when he won they didn't even go to the winners circle how lame is that ESPN NASCAR Bristol Motor Speedway Rush Limbaugh Major League Baseball television contracts Whose Line Is It Anyway?
