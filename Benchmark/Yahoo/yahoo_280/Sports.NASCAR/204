any bowyer fans i'm a huge clint bowyer fan and i was wondering if there were any others out there d sorry not a clint fan my faves were set in stone long before he came on the scene a couple years ago but i really wanted to say the guy is mature beyond his nascar exp i get so irratated with some of the newer racers who have been provided the very best of everything and then they gripe about teammates pit crews crew chiefs and anything else they can think of boyer is so the exception he just races and is th in points he also stays out of trouble when he does secure his first w he will gain so much confidence he will be a bigger threat then any of the youngsters currently in the chase and i for one can't wait for that day he deserves it and i believe his fan club will take off from there Richard Childress Racing The Amazing Race NASCAR 24 Hours of Le Mans Hendrick Motorsports NASCAR Rookie of the Year Days of Thunder Indianapolis 500 Newcastle United F.C.
