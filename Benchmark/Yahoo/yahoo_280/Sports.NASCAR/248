geez espn is bad man i can't stand that network and theres lots of reasons but what i hate the most is after a race like that they can't get away fast enough no post race interviews to speak of and its on to yankee highlights i know a b c and espn are both owned by disney but do any of you think it might get better at least abc wont have to cut to sportscenter seconds after a race thoughts i agree i just sent and e mail saying the same thing to them and also re mined them that nascar requires the top to stick around for media interviews and here the main network has to go to sport center that is broadcast all night i would rather put up with dw if it meant hearing the top and how about carl i would love to hear how his ride was in the gravel and still ending up th espn sucks they used to be so good when they st did it but now they are more interested in something else i bet the sponsors are not to pleased either the drivers don't get say who they are tony didn't even say home depot car and jeff never said the dupont car brian france i s more interested in getting the most amount of money for the least amount of coverage ESPN Major League Baseball television contracts Hendrick Motorsports Tony Stewart NASCAR MLB on FOX Roush Racing SportsCenter Dale Earnhardt Indianapolis 500 NFL on television American Broadcasting Company Keith Olbermann Tobacco advertising Auto racing Rush Limbaugh Dream Job (Season 2) Indy Racing League Bristol Motor Speedway Pardon the Interruption Darrell Waltrip Avenue Q Poker jargon SPEED Channel TSN The Jim Rome Show Penske Racing Time Out of Mind Babe Ruth 2000 Australian Grand Prix John F.
