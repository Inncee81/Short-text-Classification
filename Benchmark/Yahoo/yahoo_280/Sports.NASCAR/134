what is so entertaining about nascar i think it is really dumb you just go round and round and then somebody crashes and gets hurt plus it pollutes too much well i guess for me i like racing period ama wsb moto gp f irl outlaws usac asa hooters cup v supercars and nascar cup and busch cup and bucsh are about the same thing anymore with all the nascar drivers running in it i'm not as much as a fan of nascar as i once was because of all the changes that have taken place in the last years but i do watch the better tracks meaning i don't watch any of the new market cookie cutter tracks and if you are wanting to become a fan of nsacar i wouldn't watch those or you will be bored and not understand the popularity three of the next five races could be good watkins glen bristol and richmond try those with an open mind and come back in five weeks if you can stand it and let it be known how you feel then Tony Stewart Watkins Glen International Penske Racing Roush Racing Hendrick Motorsports Rusty Wallace Bristol Motor Speedway Indianapolis 500 Stock car racing Jeff Gordon Ernie Irvan NEXTEL Cup Carl Edwards NASCAR Thunder 2004 New Hampshire International Speedway Terry Labonte Lake Speed Robby Gordon Dale Earnhardt, Jr. NASCAR Video Games Richard Childress Racing Talladega Superspeedway Kevin Harvick Auto racing Busch Series Kurt Busch American Championship Car Racing Bill Davis Racing Darrell Waltrip Jimmie Johnson NASCAR Realignment Lowe's Motor Speedway Evernham Motorsports Geoff Bodine Casey Atwood California Speedway Riverside International Raceway Richard Petty Dale Earnhardt, Inc.
