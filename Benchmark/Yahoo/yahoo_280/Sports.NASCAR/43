why doesn't nascar seperate busch from nextel cup i am trying to understand why robby gordon was benched in his nextel cup race for something he did in a busch race that just doesn't make any sense to me how do the rest of you feel someone please explain drivers get one nascar license not one for each series as a result of his actions nascar pulled robby gordon's license for remainder of the weekend meaning he could not race in the cup series race that is the same thing they did with kevin harvick when he was penalized for rough driving in the truck series nascar took emergency action as allowed in the rulebook and pulled his license its not any different when crew chiefs are suspended either when the crew chiefs serve suspensions they can not be involved in any nascar event not just in nextel cup Kevin Harvick Richard Childress Racing NEXTEL Cup Tony Stewart NASCAR Dale Earnhardt, Jr. Craftsman Truck Series NASCAR Rookie of the Year Kyle Busch Roush Racing Robby Gordon Lowe's Motor Speedway Penske Racing Busch Series Dale Earnhardt, Inc.
