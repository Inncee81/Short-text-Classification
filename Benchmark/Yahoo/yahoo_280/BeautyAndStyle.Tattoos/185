does anyone know what the borneo rose means i really really want this tattoo but i want to make sure i know what it means before i permanently stick it to my body any links and or information would be appreciated the following is info from a tattoo message board about the meaning of it check the link and you can decide who's right and wrong what i pasted below sounds most promising a lot of what has been said is wrong i actually come from borneo and i have the bunga teruong on my shoulders i hate to see it bastardised by people who don't understand the meaning or significance of it for starters there is no borneo tribe there are many different tribes some of which practice tattooing and some that don't among many there are the kayan kenyah kelabit murut berawan penan iban etc etc the tribe that are the most prominent at tattooing are the iban this is where the bunga teruong or borneo rose comes from the spirals in the middle are meant to symbolise the life cycle some villages say that it originally came from the spirals on the belly of tadpoles and when you actually go find a tadpole as i have done you can see this pattern the bunga teruong is supposed to guard the wearer from evil spirits some of the other tattoos on different parts of the body are for different purposes they used to tattoo the hands if they were headhunters the bunga teruong should always be done in pairs they can be on the back buttocks shoulders and or chest never should they be done singularly they are supposed to protect both sides of the body from evil just getting one would be silly as to the number of petals whilst they are all from the iban or dayak tribe different villages would have slightly different designs to the guy that said something about the polynesian war i don't know what the hell you're talking about borneo is not in polynesia and we have never had polynesians invade our land in fact polynesians mostly originated from borneo and the surrounding islands and travelled the seas to reach polynesia please don't get this tattoo unless you truly understand the symbolism behind them i and my fellow countrymen get furious when we see silly westerners with these ancestral designs who know nothing about the way we live nor our culture if you truly respect our culture and have some proper reason behind wanting to get the bunga teruong then please do the required research and get it done properly i know there are good westerners out there who take things seriously and respect us but there are many who know nothing and destroy the meaning behind our culture because they respect nothing stop ruining that which you don't own please show us some respect Tattoo Dayak Polynesia Borneo Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist One Piece minor characters Malay people Iban Theory of conduct Aerial (dance move) Irezumi RuneScape quests Polynesian culture Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Shaggy dog story Social rule Gesture Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an RuneScape gods Volleyball Animism Force (Star Wars) Earring Violin Tai shogi M__ori Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Equine conformation Vegeta Professional wrestling throws The nature of God in Western theology Strap-on dildo Sin City The Death Gate Cycle French Polynesia Hazing Anthropology Milton H.
