any tattoo ideas i have a small tribal tattoo across my lower lower back that is black and then i have a large background peice for it that stretches almost to the center of my back the background peice are large stargazer lillies in magenta purple blue white yellow green the primary colors are magenta and bright blue i want to get another tattoo on my back somewhere that represents my love for my month old daughter i am a single mom and struggle to keep things intact i am only years old and am fighting just to keep my sanity at times i feel torn but i always have hope and i want something that corresponds with the tattoo i have right now and represents all this at the same time or something that can incorporate her initials or name madelynn please let me know if you have ideas i have a good friend that does them for free he is a professional tattoo artist thanks so much it may sound unusual but if there is a bug or bird or something that you're daughter seems to be particularly amazed by try adding that on one of your flowers or something or if she has the qualities of something like a butterfly delicate and beautiful hummingbird hyper and hard to take your eyes off of something like that it would look fitting to be incorporated into your existing tattoos but would have a meaning for you Color Dragon Booster Gamut Primary color Tattoo Pysanka CMYK color model Color Graphics Adapter Wassily Kandinsky Blue Technicolor Red Namie Amuro Unreal Color printing Light-emitting diode Irezumi The Emancipation of Mimi Bruce Dickinson Good Charlotte Color space Atari 8-bit family Dallas Cowboys Oz (TV series) Colours, standards and guidons Koi Snooker CIE 1931 color space Piet Mondrian RGB color model My Little Pony Toronto Blue Jays The Beatles discography Vanilla Ninja The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Criminal tattoo The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll Out-of-body experience Tattoo You Common bean Pigment Billiards Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog The Adventures of Pete & Pete Grace Cossington Smith Clothing Kodocha Academy Award for Best Cinematography Cascading Style Sheets Purple Angelina Jolie Art Chaos Emerald Vowel Donovan Yoshi Pixel Picts Diamond International Phonetic Alphabet Memento (film) Super Sonic Spider Pok__mon Snap Shaggy dog story Pok__mon Abilities Wood carving Yohoho!
