where would be the best place for a girl to get a tattoo i mean on her body im not sure where i want it because i dont want a place where it will look bad when i get older to be honest with you thats something that would be up to you it's your body but i can tell you this i recently got a tattoo on my upper back right below that weird neck bone that sticks out anyways i got it there because if i'm out on the beach or something wearing a tank top or a bikini it's cute and visible but if i'm at work even though they don't care that i have a tattoo i can easily hide it with a t shirt or blouse but as everyone has warned it will be with you forever and it might not look the same when you get older so don't get something so detailed if you want it to be small the more detailed it is the bigger your tattoo is going to have to be in order for it not to blob together in the future and anyone who tells you they can do a detailed tattoo in a small size is just wanting to do it for money years from now when it's all blobbed together they're not going to care they got your money years ago Tattoo Shirt Brassiere One Piece minor characters Bikini Comanche Undergarment Pitaten Earring Sin City Violin Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Characters of Naruto YuYu Hakusho The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Okashina Okashi Avril Lavigne Aerial (dance move) Conker's Bad Fur Day Characters in the Smurfs Vanilla Ninja Pok__mon Snap Namie Amuro Manhunt (video game) Angelina Jolie Debra Marshall Buttocks Double bass Equine conformation Homestar Runner The Legend of Zelda series enemies X-Men: Evolution The Who Sell Out Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Invader Zim Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Swimsuit Sperm Whale RuneScape quests Samurai Deeper Kyo Beachwear Dinosaur One Tree Hill (TV series) Pazyryk Scarification Unreal Tag Bob Jones University The Parting of the Ways Clothing Surveillance Jennifer Lopez Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Pok__mon Live!
