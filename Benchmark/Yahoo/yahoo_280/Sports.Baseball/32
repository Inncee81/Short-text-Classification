why do people hate on barry bonds so much all the steroid talk when he's never failed a test the reason which any real student of baseball will understand for his success lately is simple he hogs the plate has his right elbow all over the plate he has owned the strike zone the last years and gets walks for every homer he hits his right elbow sits right over the plate why people don't knock him back i'll never understand but they don't so he feasts on strikes down the middle he doesn't swing at the ball unless he can knock it out of the park and if he gets fooled he'll still make contact walks in a season homers a year and fewer strikeouts than homers steroids don't give you that kind of performance statistically he's locked in period they are jealous that he is so good Barry Bonds Baseball Sandy Koufax Hank Aaron Babe Ruth World Series Pedro Mart__nez St. Louis Cardinals Baseball statistics Volleyball 1957 World Series Major League Baseball Detroit Tigers 2004 World Series Gary Sheffield Strike zone Home run Satchel Paige History of baseball in the United States Softball Mark McGwire 2005 World Series Joe Morgan Jason Giambi Ty Cobb Professional wrestling attacks Stolen base Major League Baseball television contracts Mixed martial arts Rickey Henderson Fast bowling Pitcher Andr__s Galarraga Manny Ram__rez San Francisco Giants Mo Vaughn October 5 in baseball Greg Maddux Boston Red Sox Oakland Athletics Professional wrestling aerial techniques Strikeout Sammy Sosa ESPN25 Rafael Palmeiro Miguel Tejada 2004 American League Championship Series Baseball scorekeeping 2003 World Series Baseball Stars Wrigley Field Adam Dunn Ted Williams Cricket Jos__ Canseco Eddie Guerrero Dave Kingman Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Double bass Ice hockey Los Angeles Dodgers Babe Ruth's Called Shot Kirk Gibson Theory of conduct Intentional base on balls October 19 in baseball Roger Clemens New York Yankees Treehouse of Horror V Punch (strike) Fenway Park Professional wrestling holds Tina Turner Ken Griffey, Jr. Carl Yastrzemski Alex Rodriguez David Ortiz October 4 in baseball Equine conformation Terminal ballistics 2001 World Series Swingout Ted Kluszewski Shot Heard 'Round the World (baseball) Pete Rose Troy Glaus Major League Baseball Players Association Baseball slang Homer Simpson Nolan Ryan Pinball SBC Park Aerial (dance move) Chicago Cubs October 15 in baseball Albert Pujols Bob Feller Grover Cleveland Alexander
