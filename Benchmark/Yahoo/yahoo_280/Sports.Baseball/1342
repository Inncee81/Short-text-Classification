what's the deal with all of these dr players and latinos cuba etc and flat out lie how old they are now that we have come to like many of them as fans how do we know what the real age of the guy who it is we are routing for is prime example new york mets pitchers el duque orlando hernandez the mets roster says he was born in which would make him this year but birth certificates from his native country say i mean this is identity fraud you can go to jail it americans did this none of these latinos are really americans maybe a rod manny raffy guys who grew up here but also had latin roots i don't think this issue is covererd enough is pedro martinez really or is he no one knows he certainly isn't pitching like a to which is relatively young my point is how do we know that yunievsky bettancourt the solid mariners ss from cuba is only i mean the guy looks also miggy tejada for the o's he's only he looks stuff like this is critical becaue if they keep lying about their age they can play way longer than they then they should of and stretch their careers years longer because of lowering their age and thus if they are good like miggy and el duque keep on pitching and playing and making millions hey i'm and work as a computer tech but have a full time family now and full time job i only have a bs from the uw i would love to change on my resume that i also have a masters degree and possibly a phd which would make my salary skyrocket but that is fraud identity fraud and cheating and most normal citizens like myself aren't allowed to do this only unionized members of the major leagues have these priviledges to make themselves younger man put me in a time machine so i can go see the last grateful dead concert in but it isn't going to happen mlb is such a joke a fraud and fans should boycott all of these players lie cheat steal cheat on their wives take drugs to beat long helding clean records ruth maris aaron enough is enough i'm out lying about one's age is not identity fraud unless you're doing so to try and collect social security or something many of the players used to lie about their ages so they'd be viewed as better prospects i e a year old hitting is going to be viewed more favorably than a year old the practices has mostly died out over the last few years because of more stringent work permit and travel requirements put into place after Baseball New York Yankees New York Mets Manny Ram__rez World Series Alex Rodriguez 2004 American League Championship Series 2004 World Series Barry Bonds Baseball Stars Salary cap Andr__s Galarraga International League Red Sox Nation Oakland Athletics Major League Baseball Seattle Mariners Detroit Tigers Roger Clemens Reggie Jackson Montr__al Expos Hank Aaron History of baseball in the United States Tris Speaker September 20 in baseball Knots Landing Orlando Hern__ndez Ichiro Suzuki Lou Gehrig Home run October 4 in baseball Softball October 5 in baseball Blackjack 1986 National League Championship Series Carlos Beltr__n Sammy Sosa November 2 in baseball Negro league baseball October 22 in baseball 2005 World Series October 16 in baseball Major League Baseball All-Star Game 1957 World Series Babe Ruth Bank fraud Minor league baseball Houston Astros Internet fraud Major League Baseball television contracts Earned run average Baltimore Orioles October 20 in baseball Craps Randy Johnson Sandy Koufax Pete Rose Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Poker jargon Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry Passport Tax Cincinnati Reds Identity theft Pittsburgh Pirates Cleveland Indians Cuba EastEnders Miguel Tejada San Francisco Giants Baseball statistics Babe Ruth's Called Shot Atlanta Braves 2004-05 NHL lockout Designated hitter Stolen base October 13 in baseball 1986 World Series No-hitter Criticism of libertarianism Password Curse of the Bambino Chicago White Sox Bon Jovi Ted Williams Florida Marlins David Cone Satchel Paige June 8 in baseball October 26 in baseball W.
