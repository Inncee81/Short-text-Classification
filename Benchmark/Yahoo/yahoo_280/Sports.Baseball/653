how much is a rod's th hr ball worth anyway i just read today's ny papers that greedy little sob who caught a rod's th wants thousand dollars he was offered ten thousand and a signed shirt the team offered to kick in signed memorabilia from other players including clemens the guy's favorite yankee no deal he wants thousand the man wrestled it out of the hands of about people and now he is holding the ball hostage i say shove it the only thing a rod should offer him is a can of wd to grease the path no way a rod should give that creep grand he has the bat and the uniform let the loser have the ball i don't care who hit it it isn't worth grand alex i love you madly if i caught it it would have been yours for free i think most fans felt the same way we were just glad to see you hit it and proud of you let the selfish pig have his baseball don't give him a dime pax c anything not just a baseball is worth as much as someone is willing to pay for it the value is something measured on a completely different scale i agree with the first guy if he can get what he is asking for it then more power to him do you know that mark mcgwire's th home run ball initially sold for million when was still the record or did you know that barry bonds' rd home run ball sold for such memoribilia like a players st home run ball th or major record breaker which by the way the th was as a rod was the youngest ever to hr are far more desired than say a th or th ball just to break it down for you at million a year a rod collects over a day that is every day of the days in the year not just the season or if you wish to put it in terms of the pay he collects per game say for the season that is over per game even if it were to cost him to get it he still could pocket well over for playing a game so have you ever bought something that would cost a day and half of work's pay was it worth it how can you paint a guy with the greedy brush who is looking for a one time payoff while on the defensive side of a guy who makes as much in a day as some people may not make in a year or two if not more something about that seems a bit mixed up to me Baseball Tris Speaker Home run Barry Bonds Mark McGwire Boston Red Sox Oakland Athletics Toronto Blue Jays Glossary of American football Softball Alex Rodriguez Pete Rose Sammy Sosa Lou Gehrig Poker jargon Reggie Jackson Willie Mays Baseball Stars Seattle Mariners World Series Los Angeles Dodgers Roger Clemens Chicago White Sox Troy Glaus Hank Aaron Alex Ferguson 1957 World Series Tennis Manny Ram__rez Babe Ruth's Called Shot Houston Astros October 4 in baseball Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Satchel Paige 2005 World Series Baseball statistics Batting average Mois__s Alou Cincinnati Reds Don Mattingly Wrigley Field 1994 baseball strike Pittsburgh Steelers Jimmie Foxx American football Table tennis November 3 in baseball New York Mets Ty Cobb 2003 World Series Rugby union positions Yankee Stadium Major League Baseball Cincinnati Bengals Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry Jos__ Canseco October 1 in baseball Detroit Tigers Robin Ventura Paintball National Football League Billiards ESPN25 San Diego Padres Baseball scorekeeping Pittsburgh Pirates Rickey Henderson Ted Williams Sandy Koufax Super Bowl XXVI Baseball (object) Football (soccer) Pedro Mart__nez Gary Sheffield Super Bowl XVII October 22 in baseball National Football League Lore Super Bowl XXVII Minor league baseball Tag New England Patriots Canadian football Topps Texas Rangers (baseball) Volleyball
