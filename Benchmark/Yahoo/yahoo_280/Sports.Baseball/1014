will it be easy to get in a high school baseball team in high school in oakland california like will tryouts be a breeze what u have to do serious answers only or ill report u getting on a baseball team depends on two things your skill level and the skill level of your competition i e the others trying out based on the tryouts at my high school i can say that they will not be a breeze my tryouts were spaced over several days with each day devoted to a specific area like hitting running and fielding with hitting they first had us bat against a pitching machine then later on against a live person and had us run it out like it was live fielding they had us take every defensive position and hit to us over and over with only a second or two between they judged us on the amount of balls we fielded and the accuracy and speed of our throws to the target running they had us run from home to first first to second second to third and third to home in spurts and timed each they then made us round the bases at full speed and timed it they made us steal second from first on a live pitcher and catcher they also made us run the perimeter of the entire field so be preparred to do a lot of work durring the tryouts also if youre a little rusty with your baseball skills i would recomend spending a few days every week untill tryouts getting back into baseball shape because if your school is anything like mine was competition will be fierce my best tip would be to try and relax and have fun if you stress yourself out at the try outs youll be a lot more stiff than normal and you wont perform as well i now its easier said than done but if you can manage it youll have a leg up on the competition Baseball Softball Pitcher Baseball statistics Sandy Koufax Batting average Tris Speaker 1957 World Series Detroit Tigers Batting (cricket) Ty Cobb Cincinnati Reds Cricket Fast bowling Chicago White Sox Stolen base New York Mets Baserunning Reggie Jackson Volleyball Box score (baseball) 2004 World Series Baseball Stars San Diego Padres Baseball scorekeeping 1986 World Series Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Boston Red Sox 2005 World Series First baseman New York Yankees October 16 in baseball Babe Ruth Interference (baseball) Major League Baseball San Francisco Giants Minor league baseball October 22 in baseball Barry Bonds October 4 in baseball Pete Rose St. Louis Cardinals October 5 in baseball Gary Sheffield Sabermetrics International League Baseball positions October 14 in baseball Pedro Mart__nez Ted Williams Ichiro Suzuki 1919 World Series Out (baseball) Los Angeles Dodgers Babe Ruth's Called Shot Tag Sammy Sosa Hank Aaron Strike zone Andr__s Galarraga Oakland Athletics Fielding (cricket) Dog agility October 8 in baseball October 27 in baseball Houston Astros Seattle Mariners Robin Ventura October 10 in baseball Toronto Blue Jays History of baseball in the United States October 20 in baseball Bill James Carlton Fisk Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Satchel Paige Laws of cricket Rudy York Paintball National Football League October 12 in baseball Moe Berg Willie Mays Texas Rangers (baseball) Vin Scully October 17 in baseball Marching band Mike Piazza Bunt Major League Baseball All-Star Game Origins of baseball Luke Appling Water polo Bullet Rogan Catcher
