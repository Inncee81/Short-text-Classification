mickey mantle last night i watched the special on mantle that hbo did that guy could feet further than steroid bonds one hit the top of the facade at yankee stadium while still on the way up and was estimated at feet and he could run much faster than the pre steroid bonds i loved watching a real baseball player your thoughts it wasn't a movie fool it was a documentary with all real footage if mantle was on steroids he could hit one from san fransisco to oakland mrkeeth is so lame mantle still has the record for home to first base at seconds batting left handed he tore up his knee protecting an old dimaggio as a rookie and didn't try to steal as much as he could have becuse of the injuries that guy knows nothing about baseball if he doesn't know that mantle could run like a deer i'm talking mike vick speed here carnaby mantle was a physical freak he was totally ripped his legs were like earl campbell's and his forearms were like popeye's and i doubt if he even worked out he had by far the greatest bat speed we have ever seen just a freakin' blur look at the pictures of his swing and you will see muscles bulging like freaking conan even neck muscles would pop out mickey mantle was the greatest switch hitter in the game ever he had mad power especially left handed because he had an upper cut swing he could run in center he was one of the greats in his day luis aparicio was the stolen base king with an average of steals a year mantle often got or but was rarely thrown out steals just weren't part of the game then he invented the drag bunt could fetch them in center with the best of them and lost his lifetime average with bad years at the end of his career he had the longest measured home run ever hit in washington at ft he also lost about home runs a year to the cavernous yankee stadium center field he played years there so with a normal center field add hrs to and you get beats ruth except of course ruth played there too it's no wonder he is still considered one of the truly really uncommonly great players of all time Home run Joe DiMaggio Baseball World Series Hank Aaron Ty Cobb October 4 in baseball New York Yankees Lou Gehrig Rickey Henderson Reggie Jackson Alex Rodriguez Pete Rose Tris Speaker Baseball statistics St. Louis Cardinals Gary Sheffield Willie Mays Detroit Tigers Boston Red Sox Toronto Blue Jays September 20 in baseball Oakland Athletics Chicago White Sox History of baseball in the United States Robin Ventura Baltimore Orioles New York Mets Yankee Stadium Seattle Mariners Luis Aparicio San Francisco Giants October 20 in baseball Roger Maris Troy Glaus Satchel Paige Sandy Koufax October 7 in baseball Major League Baseball television contracts Hal Trosky October 22 in baseball Houston Astros Dave Kingman Curse of the Bambino San Francisco 49ers October 5 in baseball 2004 World Series Softball San Diego Padres Vin Scully Jos__ Canseco Atlanta Braves Mark McGwire Jason Giambi Chipper Jones Babe Ruth's Called Shot October 15 in baseball Shoeless Joe Jackson Equine conformation 2005 World Series Cincinnati Reds October 3 in baseball Batting order (baseball) ESPN25 October 16 in baseball No-hitter Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Volleyball 2004 American League Championship Series Dixie Walker Switch hitter Mike Schmidt Miami Dolphins Baseball Stars International League Mois__s Alou National Football League Lore Stolen base Pittsburgh Pirates Pittsburgh Steelers Ken Griffey, Jr. Fast bowling Fenway Park October 10 in baseball June 8 in baseball September 2005 in sports American football Batting (cricket)
