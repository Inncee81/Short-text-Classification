breaking records in baseball i'm not a baseball nut but i do enjoy going to the games with my husband i was watching a documentary about cal ripken jr and the record he now holds and it just seems to me that baseball don't want any of their records broken as they prefer the pastime players holding on to them i understand the recent years as steriods plays a large role but cal ripken jr didn't do steriods and is a good guy so why try to screw up his record breaking attempt not to mention roger maris who seemed to be a good guy as well like i said i don't know that much about baseball but it just seems to me that baseball don't approve of their records being broken i always thought records were meant to be broken please enlighten me as i would like to understand why record breaking seems to be a bad thing in baseball ripken in my opinion was pretty selfish i think sometimes him trotting out when he should have taken a day off to rest his injured body he played i think he hurt his team sometimes that's pretty selfish although i admire the record i would call anybody who broke it to be selfish as well in baseball they play games that's almost every day play cal was injured many times he played and at the time i thought it was cool but as i got older and understood how you could hinder your team it lost it's luster and to answer your question i agree records are made to be broken some people do not like the fact that people are using enhancements to break them i agree however every era has had this issue the name just wasn't steroids it was amphetamines and gambling tainting the game Baseball Lou Gehrig Major League Baseball Cal Ripken, Jr. History of baseball in the United States Troy Glaus Satchel Paige Miguel Tejada ESPN25 Babe Ruth Baltimore Orioles St. Louis Cardinals Tris Speaker Pete Rose Detroit Tigers Poker jargon Goodness and value theory New York Knicks Toronto Blue Jays Roger Maris Evil September 20 in baseball Nolan Ryan Olympic Games Los Angeles Dodgers Nine Inch Nails 1981 baseball strike Ty Cobb International League Sandy Koufax San Francisco Giants Hank Aaron Jim Rice Bud Selig Home run New York Mets Sydney Riot of 1879 Transactional analysis September 6 in baseball Brian Close Plame affair Jos__ Canseco Batting average Minor league baseball The Fairly OddParents 1919 World Series Altruism Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Chicago White Sox The Ashlee Simpson Show 1957 World Series Kasparov versus The World New York Yankees Baseball statistics Cincinnati Bengals Cleveland Indians Yogiisms Laws of cricket Origins of baseball National Football League Oakland Athletics Stolen base Pittsburgh Steelers Humphrey Bogart The Apprentice 2 Bodybuilding Rickey Henderson Norway national football team October 22 in baseball Babe Ruth's Called Shot Cricket Boston Red Sox Reggie Jackson Carl Yastrzemski 2004 World Series Major League Baseball All-Star Game 1994 baseball strike 2004-05 NHL lockout Tour de France Ultimate (sport) Dave Kingman Boston Bruins EastEnders Barry Bonds Playoff Negro league baseball Softball Don Drysdale Seattle Mariners Major League Baseball television contracts Professional wrestling slang Billy Ripken Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 World Series Pawtucket Red Sox Casey Stengel Consensus decision-making
