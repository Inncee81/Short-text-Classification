have you ever wondered about this whenever barry bonds hits a home run the giants end up losing the game however when he doesn't hit a homer they win the game it's just something i noticed over the last few months most of the time it turns out like this though there are times it's the other way around i just wondered if anyone else noticed as well oh and i'm not asking about steroids so please keep it clean i don't follow baseball that much so this is just an on a whim type question same thing has happened recently with a rod when a rod was just hitting everything the yanks were losing then during his for or whatever number streak the yanks were winning there is a theory about this that teams do better without their star when the star is not producing or is not there it takes pressure off the team as a whole i know that does not make a lot of sense but it seems true sometimes the rest of the guys don't have to deal with everyone cheering for their star player and they know they can not depend on the star so they all step it up a bit barry has been the giants best hitter this year not just because of the home runs but i have no doubt the giants would probably be in contention if barry would not have come back how is a team suppose to relax and play with all that has been going on maybe they will now World Series Barry Bonds Troy Glaus New York Yankees Hank Aaron St. Louis Cardinals Boston Red Sox October 4 in baseball San Francisco Giants Home run Willie Mays Oakland Athletics Babe Ruth Ty Cobb 1957 World Series Tris Speaker Cincinnati Reds New York Giants Satchel Paige Toronto Blue Jays Reggie Jackson Mois__s Alou Chicago White Sox October 16 in baseball Yankee Stadium Miguel Tejada Mark McGwire 2005 World Series Alex Rodriguez Pete Rose October 20 in baseball Batting average Pittsburgh Steelers Gary Sheffield October 5 in baseball Dave Kingman Ted Williams Robin Ventura October 19 in baseball October 3 in baseball Andr__s Galarraga Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Baseball Major League Baseball Pittsburgh Pirates Seattle Mariners Sammy Sosa Atlanta Braves Volleyball Detroit Tigers October 17 in baseball Don Mattingly October 22 in baseball Polo Grounds Jos__ Canseco November 1 in baseball Chicago Cubs Interleague play 2004 World Series October 21 in baseball Major League Baseball All-Star Game Baseball statistics International League Avenue Q June 8 in baseball Negro league baseball Darryl Strawberry 2001 World Series Casey Stengel June 12 in baseball Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Blackjack October 15 in baseball Jason Giambi October 13 in baseball October 27 in baseball Baseball scorekeeping Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry September 6 in baseball NBA Finals Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1945 Top 500 home run hitters of all time 1981 World Series 1919 World Series October 7 in baseball Jeff Kent Curse of the Bambino Social rule November 3 in baseball Shot Heard 'Round the World (baseball)
