why does everyone assume that babe ruth and hank aaron were clean nobody tested them they could have been heavy into speed or something else that could have helped them the babe certainly does not seem above breaking the rules not sure about hank i just find it funny that everyone assumes that these guys were clean and bonds is dirty yet neither one can be proved just to clarify my question i am not trying to rationize or justify barry being dirty and by clean i do not mean clean from steroids i meant clean from anything that would be considered dirty today such as the speed i mentioned amphetimines have been around a long long time i was just curious if i am the only one that sometimes thinks hmmm how do we know those guys were totally clean not standing up for barry a rod is going to break the new record anyway within years so barry's record will be gone then anyway but will anyone claim that a rod is dirty because he slept with some dirty girls lol actually you're thinking is right on track in hank aaron's book he admitted to using greenies amphetamines at one point in his career to break out of a slump he doesnt insinuate that he used them for an extended length of time just long enough to break the slump these guys that are saying that steroids weren't around or weren't mainstream until the ' s give me a break steroids were around in the 's they were used by the russian weight lifting team just because they didnt sell them at the grocery store doesnt mean that hank aaron or others from that era didnt take advantage of them dont forget they were designed for athletes if olympians could get them then baseball players would definetely be able to get them just because the public didnt know doesnt mean that baseball players werent using them look at these designer steroids that are out now those werent mainstream until the grand jury testimony was leaked Barry Bonds Home run Hank Aaron Babe Ruth History of baseball in the United States Major League Baseball Reggie Jackson New York Yankees Baseball St. Louis Cardinals Rafael Palmeiro Mark McGwire Jos__ Canseco Hank Greenberg Nolan Ryan World Series Lou Gehrig September 20 in baseball Rickey Henderson Ben Johnson (athlete) Ty Cobb Joe DiMaggio EastEnders Tris Speaker Baseball Stars Alex Rodriguez Jimmie Foxx Sammy Sosa Olympic medalists in athletics (men) Atlanta Braves Oakland Athletics Jason Giambi Toronto Blue Jays San Francisco Giants Minor league baseball Grunge music Sandy Koufax Major League Baseball titles streaks Gary Sheffield October 22 in baseball December 2004 in sports Top 500 home run hitters of all time Robin Ventura Designated hitter Bj__rn Borg W.
