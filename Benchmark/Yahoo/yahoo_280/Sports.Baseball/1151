do you think college baseball should switch to wooden bats isnt it a little dangerous my bad isnt it a little dangerous with aluminum bats is what i meant without question division i baseball should yes there is an expense to it but at the very least wooden composite bats should be used which last much longer than wood and perform closer to wood than aluminum mlb should be behind this as the signing bonuses of these guys gets higher and higher and the biggest unknown is whether or not they can hit with wooden bats as a former college baseball player myself i know plenty of guys personally who signed and got decent to good bonuses who where out of the game or only still in it because of the signing bonus they got but could not hit in the minors because they were not hitting with aluminum i am amazed that in the year i believe div colleges were to use composite or wood which was later changed before the season started but division i players which obviously have the best chance of getting drafted are still using metal bats granted i know some of these guys are playing in wooden bat leagues in the summer but at best they get seen for a few weeks and that is after the draft also if you look at the numbers from those leagues hitting stats are way below season numbers for all those guys Major League Baseball Baseball Minor league baseball Baseball Stars Baseball statistics Batting average Pete Rose Tony Gwynn Andr__s Galarraga 1981 baseball strike Dave Kingman National Football League Toronto Blue Jays Rickey Henderson Lance Berkman Troy Glaus Brian Roberts 1981 World Series Sammy Sosa Alex Rodriguez Albert Pujols Barry Bonds Babe Ruth Edgar Renter__a Ichiro Suzuki Ernie Banks Steve Yeager Baseball bat Tris Speaker Satchel Paige Robin Ventura Seattle Mariners Scott Podsednik International League 2005 World Series Reggie Jackson Khalil Greene Don Mattingly Darryl Strawberry Lou Gehrig Willie Mays David Ortiz San Diego Padres New York Yankees Hank Aaron Salary cap Cleveland Indians Pittsburgh Pirates World Series Chicago Cubs Milwaukee Brewers Edgar Martinez Boston Red Sox Julio Franco Softball Wheel of Fortune Luis Gonzalez (baseball outfielder) New York Mets Cincinnati Reds Roger Clemens Baltimore Orioles Sandy Koufax Washington Nationals Mark McGwire Major League Baseball All-Star Game Luke Appling 1919 World Series Japanese baseball Playoff Home run Hank Greenberg Dave Concepci__n Ted Williams Los Angeles Dodgers Felipe Alou John Olerud 2004-05 NHL lockout Texas Rangers (baseball) Negro league baseball Kirby Puckett 2005 English cricket season Houston Astros Manny Ram__rez All-Star Baseball Jason Bay Randy Johnson Luis Aparicio Kansas City Royals Derek Jeter Kerry Wood (baseball player) Designated hitter Branch Rickey George Sisler Cricket Carlos Baerga
