why don't left handed hitters bunt or slap the ball near the rd base side when a shift is placed on them i see shifts being put on bonds big papi and hafner i know that a lot of times they have success hitting the ball up the middle or pull the middle and try to middle the ball on the bat but during critical junctures of the games why won't these guys bunt near the rd base line or slap the shot near the rd base this could disrupt the defense and runners on base could move up the hitter could get on base and maybe an error might be commited are they not skilled enough and can't handle the bat to hit the ball the other way in the infield or what pitchers are pitching them away so why won't these guys do it i mean look at hafner his team could be running away with first place in the al central if theywon more close games if he could come thru and play smart like that when a shift is placed on him in critical close games he's having a bad year not hitting for power or average why can't he do this and contribute to his team why can't lefties like him and others do that lefties are taught trained to be pull hitters in most situations with runners on base the conventional wisdom is to put the ball in play to the right side of the field thus we have this emphasis for lefties unfortunately for most lefties it means that half of the field is not utilized offensively if properly executed on a semi regular basis this tactic would keep defenses honest and open up the right side again for a powerful lefty 1957 World Series Softball Volleyball Babe Ruth Ty Cobb Tris Speaker 1919 World Series Batting average 2004 World Series World Series 2005 World Series St. Louis Cardinals Fast bowling First baseman Boston Red Sox Home run Chicago White Sox Pete Rose Fielding (cricket) Toronto Blue Jays Glossary of American football Interference (baseball) Sandy Koufax Los Angeles Dodgers BASEketball Baseball Stars Baserunning Designated hitter Baseball positions Stolen base Hank Aaron New York Yankees Laws of cricket Andr__s Galarraga Cricket Table tennis Manny Ram__rez Ted Williams Out (baseball) 1986 National League Championship Series Shoeless Joe Jackson Satchel Paige 2004 American League Championship Series Pitcher Moe Berg Houston Astros San Francisco Giants Pittsburgh Pirates Seattle Mariners October 9 in baseball English cricket team Ichiro Suzuki No-hitter Pedro Mart__nez Bert Campaneris Rugby union positions Ravi Shastri American football Cincinnati Reds David Ortiz Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1946 San Diego Padres Atlanta Braves Alex Rodriguez 2003 World Series American football strategy Appeal play October 4 in baseball Marius Russo October 10 in baseball Perfect game Tag Paintball Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 October 20 in baseball Shortstop New York Giants Oakland Athletics Lefty Grove Barry Bonds Babe Ruth's Called Shot Rugby union Super Bowl XXI 1993 World Series October 1 in baseball
