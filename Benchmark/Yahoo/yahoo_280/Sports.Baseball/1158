give me your take on barry bonds' record tainted not tainted there are a lot of people in the steroid era of baseball who take steroids or have taken some kind of hgh how many of those players can you name have hit now homeruns none so lets not figure in the fact that whether he took steroids or not he is a great athlete and nobody else could do the things he can now i am not a fan of bonds at all but you should at least respect the fact that the guy can play baseball he sees the ball well and has great mechanics and a very fast bat speed that allows him to hit home runs if he was taking steroid how do you explain the longevity of his career since steroids tears up your body in the long run hell steroids has been in sports forever and it's just now that people are trying to take action everybody used to turn the other cheek just saying well its only one person and he isn't doing any harm and now because records are being broken it is a huge ordeal i honestly dont care the guy can play baseball and they can put an asterisk at the end of the number if they want but no matter what he is the new home run king Barry Bonds Home run Babe Ruth Jos__ Canseco Gary Sheffield Mark McGwire St. Louis Cardinals Softball Boston Red Sox Toronto Blue Jays History of baseball in the United States Baseball Stars Rafael Palmeiro Mois__s Alou Ty Cobb Reggie Jackson Cincinnati Reds Jason Giambi Chicago White Sox Lou Gehrig Troy Glaus Rickey Henderson Willie Mays Hank Aaron Ted Williams Alex Rodriguez 1957 World Series Mike Schmidt Baseball statistics New York Yankees New York Mets Satchel Paige Pete Rose Ben Johnson (athlete) Derek Jeter Baseball scorekeeping Tris Speaker Miguel Tejada Batting (cricket) Table tennis Theory of conduct San Francisco Giants Sammy Sosa Human height Seattle Mariners English cricket team Jim Rice ESPN25 Cricket Vince McMahon Pittsburgh Pirates Ken Griffey, Jr. Mickey Mantle Nolan Ryan Laws of cricket November 3 in baseball Manny Ram__rez The Jim Rome Show Jimmie Foxx Indianapolis 500 Hal Trosky Baseball (object) Vin Scully 2004 World Series Oakland Athletics Lenny Dykstra Anabolic steroid Ken Harrelson 1919 World Series Los Angeles Dodgers Dualism (philosophy of mind) SBC Park Roger Maris Ichiro Suzuki Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Fast bowling Sports timeline Ernie Banks Mike Greenwell American football Brian Close C__sar Tovar Torii Hunter October 22 in baseball Stolen base Baseball slang Professional wrestling slang Polyamory Detroit Tigers August 2005 in sports Bodybuilding
