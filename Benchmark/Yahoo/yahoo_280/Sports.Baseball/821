why do people let their emotions sway their answers to sports questions i am a die hard yankee fan and always will be i can still admit when the red sux are playing better or have better talent i understand that people hate the yankees but i can't understand why they don't back it up with facts there are so many people posting how the yankees won't make the playoffs simply because they hate the yankees face it they are the hottest team in baseball is it really that hard to admit that whoever your team is you don't want to play the yankees right now i think the yankees will catch the red sux but they will both most likely make the playoffs it's really not that hard to use your head to answer a question instead of the heart people just dont like the yankees the main non stat reason is the payroll thing because the yanks have a bloated payroll everyone says their wins are because of that but the wins isnt true i picked this up off of usa today payroll mill payroll mill payroll mill in the yankee payroll jumped to mill and has risen since but they havnt won a world series since so i think i proved money doesnt buy 'chips the yanks are the hottest team in baseball right now and they will make the playoffs every stat in the game shows this go yanks New York Yankees Boston Red Sox Oakland Athletics New York Knicks 1957 World Series Reggie Jackson Salary cap World Series Detroit Tigers Cleveland Indians Major League Baseball television contracts Curse of the Bambino Pittsburgh Pirates Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Don Mattingly San Francisco Giants Atlanta Braves 2005 World Series Los Angeles Dodgers Babe Ruth 2004 American League Championship Series Alex Rodriguez Los Angeles Kings New York Mets Pete Rose Baseball Stars Playoff New York Giants Ty Cobb Damn Yankees Seattle Mariners Bernie Williams International League Cincinnati Reds Curt Schilling Chicago Cubs San Diego Padres NBA Finals MLB on FOX Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry Red Sox Nation 1981 baseball strike Joe Torre American Football League Cincinnati Bengals Cleveland Browns History of baseball in the United States Texas Rangers (baseball) Interleague play October 9 in baseball October 4 in baseball St. Louis Rams Charles O.
