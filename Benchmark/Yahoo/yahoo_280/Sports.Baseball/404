if dusty baker can announce sports why cant jimmy the greek they basically made the same comment except the greeks comment was based on a study that had been done and bakers was based in total ignorance not to mention espn could have gotten more out of a turnip during last nights cards padres game i know what you are referring to and both baker and the greek's comments were stupid i believe the greek was intoxicated when he said his which i don't know if that makes it better or worse i agree it was not stellar announcing last night but we got to learn about baker's experience in the arch and how he had been stuck in an elevator elsewhere and that baker had no clue that pujols won last year's gold glove hell i get to see so few cardinal games i wish the announcing could have been better but oh well at least i got to see that run inning but your original point is well taken i think the comments were stupid but not firable in either case so i think the greek got a raw deal but i am not so sure that he hadn't rubbed executives the wrong way that they were not looking for an excuse World Series 2004 World Series San Diego Padres St. Louis Cardinals October 2004 in sports Major League Baseball television contracts San Francisco Giants Barry Bonds New York Giants Paul Is Dead Ty Cobb Hank Aaron Sammy Sosa Monday Night Football October 2005 in sports Pete Rose Andr__s Galarraga Houston Astros Wayne Gretzky September 2005 in sports 2004 American League Championship Series Bob Gibson 2003 World Series Don Drysdale 2005 National League Championship Series Jack Buck August 2005 in sports World Wrestling Entertainment October 7 in baseball Sandy Koufax November 2004 in sports New York Yankees Al Michaels Detroit Tigers 2005 World Series Troy Glaus July 2004 in sports October 17 in baseball 1991 World Series Alex Rodriguez October 16 in baseball Tim McCarver 1987 World Series Miracle on Ice October 4 in baseball Sin City Blackjack The Contender (television series) Cluedo Ted Williams Robin Ventura Monty Hall problem Satchel Paige NFL on television Softball 1986 World Series Ken Jennings The Joker's Wild Montr__al Expos 2002 World Series 2001 World Series Philadelphia Phillies Elvis Costello Chicago White Sox Roberto Alomar The Catcher in the Rye 2004 National League Championship Series New York Mets Vin Scully Chicago Cubs Toronto Blue Jays Joe Morgan September 20 in baseball Jerry Coleman Game show International League Baseball Red Sox Nation Announcer IBM PC compatible Jimmie Foxx Gary Sheffield Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1946 Home run Brian Close October 1 in baseball Mahjong Dilbert June 2004 in sports Boston Red Sox Curse of the Bambino Cindy Sheehan Amiga Power September 2004 in sports MLB on FOX Theory of conduct Boxing Major League Baseball All-Star Game
