do the cardinals have a shot at the post season my opinion is yes they're games back in a weak division they still play a bunch of games against the cubs and brewers their pitching staff is kinda sorta gaining momentum the brewers are realing and the cubs are cursed i'd give them a shot right now what do you all think right now it's pretty hard to say i will say that you can never count them out the brewers are young and seem to be struggling as of late you also have to look at milwaukee's road record also injuries to ben sheets and tony graffanino don't help either as far as the cubs go i don't think they'll be seeing the postseason this year they've also been falling apart as of late they were just swept by the houston astros also alfonso soriano is on the dl for at least the next month so the cards have a better chance than some might think the good thing is that st louis has six more games against milwaukee well that could potentially be a bad thing considering that the games are in milwaukee Chicago Cubs World Series 2005 World Series Detroit Tigers National League October 4 in baseball 2003 World Series Chicago White Sox Atlanta Braves October 12 in baseball Toronto Blue Jays Florida Marlins October 15 in baseball San Diego Padres October 3 in baseball Major League Baseball television contracts New York Knicks Hank Aaron October 9 in baseball Los Angeles Dodgers Satchel Paige October 2004 in sports October 5 in baseball October 10 in baseball 2005 National League Championship Series Oakland Athletics Scott Podsednik Pittsburgh Steelers Baltimore Orioles Tony La Russa Harvey Kuenn Cleveland Browns New York Yankees Seattle Mariners Babe Ruth November 3 in baseball October 1 in baseball Interleague play Roger Clemens New York Giants October 31 in baseball Cincinnati Bengals Texas Rangers (baseball) New Jersey Nets Los Angeles Clippers John Smoltz San Francisco Giants 1982 World Series Joaqu__n And__jar November 1 in baseball Wrigley Field October 13 in baseball Indiana Pacers Wild card October 2005 in sports NBA Finals 2004 World Series Philadelphia 76ers Davey Lopes Randy Johnson Nolan Ryan Terry Francona Houston Rockets September 2005 in sports MLB on NBC Pittsburgh Pirates Ben Sheets Perfect game Red Sox Nation Alex Rodriguez Don Sutton Albert Pujols History of baseball in the United States October 21 in baseball 2004 National League Championship Series October 11 in baseball Milwaukee Admirals Mark Bellhorn October 17 in baseball October 27 in baseball MLB on FOX Babe Ruth's Called Shot Mario Lemieux September 22 in baseball Ty Cobb Grover Cleveland Alexander September 20 in baseball New York Mets
