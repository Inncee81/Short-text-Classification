why is hank aaron not considered one of the greatest players of all time i mean for someone who broke what people are calling greatest individual record in american sports he seems to always get marginalized by babe ruth willie mays ted williams mickey mantle barry bonds etc i'm wondering why he never seems to match these guys statistics welcome so long as they're relevant and accurate thanks so much to everyone who's answered so far but i guess what i'm looking for the real reason why aaron is overlooked i don't buy the new york center field bias since its been long enough for baseball experts to re examine his status objectively yet he still seems to rate second fiddle was there something he was necessarily not as good at as the guys i mentioned before is there an ops total bases slugging parameter that keeps him out of that measure thanks good question and you are getting some solid answers i read your additional details and think you are still underestimating the east coast bias and the fact aaron did not play centerfield aaron never had a home run or average season or great world series catch so there isn't that great single season accomplishment so again look at who you are comparing him to in your answer ruth baseball immortal who once outhomered the entire league mays major media market at start of his career considered one of the best defensive outfielders of all time williams season east coast market mantle major media market involved in the home run chase in several world series rings bonds home runs hof career before then so i agree with you in that aaron is wrongly left out of this company and i think it comes down to the following though the braves won the series and the braves appeared the average fan does not remember these as historically great teams the last years of his career the braves did not make the series and only the playoffs in aaron did not have the natural charisma of some of the other players he also was not in an east coast market and i do think that matters aaron did not play a premier defensive position so i think either you need to be willing to rethink your opposition to some of the arguments presented or we are all wrong great question though and i think stan musial also gets left out of that exclusive list of players you gave but take a look at his numbers some day i think some of the same arguments would apply 1957 World Series Willie Mays Atlanta Braves Baseball Babe Ruth Boston Red Sox Mickey Mantle Ted Williams Manny Ram__rez Lou Gehrig Tris Speaker St. Louis Cardinals Reggie Jackson Sammy Sosa October 4 in baseball Jim Rice Major League Baseball September 20 in baseball Ken Griffey, Jr. June 12 in baseball Polo Grounds October 7 in baseball Ty Cobb October 5 in baseball Major League Baseball All-Star Game Baseball statistics History of baseball in the United States Major League Baseball television contracts Baltimore Orioles Roger Maris Stan Musial Oakland Athletics Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Pete Rose Pittsburgh Pirates Detroit Tigers National Football League Rickey Henderson Major League Baseball titles streaks Cincinnati Reds Gary Sheffield Los Angeles Dodgers Rogers Hornsby Alex Rodriguez Sandy Koufax Hank Greenberg Don Hoak San Diego Padres 2005 World Series October 20 in baseball October 3 in baseball Seattle Mariners Bowie Kuhn Baseball Stars Pittsburgh Steelers Batting average Robin Ventura Nolan Ryan Curse of the Bambino Playoff Lance Berkman David Ortiz Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry Milwaukee Brewers Cincinnati Bengals Cleveland Indians Toronto Blue Jays 2004 World Series Bernie Williams November 2 in baseball October 22 in baseball Babe Ruth's Called Shot Negro league baseball June 8 in baseball Ron Gant 2003 World Series Joe Adcock Major League Baseball titles leaders September 6 in baseball Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2005 Satchel Paige Topps International League Sabermetrics October 15 in baseball Mois__s Alou Minor league baseball Philadelphia Phillies Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1945 Top 500 home run hitters of all time October 14 in baseball
