is baseball going down the tubes does mlb think that you have to score runs a game and have hr hitters to be good they already took away most of the strike zone and the fences are way short and lowered the mound etc now they suspend clemons days for retaliating on plunkings these guys are allowed to crowd the plate way too much these days anyway they should get plunked like the old days hell bob gibson wouldn't be allowed to play at all under these pro offense rules it's disgusting artistic that was one of the best and truest answers i've ever seen on this forum great job i agree with you that the game is more about offense now then it used to be i think that the reason that such an emphasis is put on scoring a ton of runs is that the for the casual fan that is more exciting baseball just like a casual fan of football can't appreciate a people that do not know the game can't appreciate a well played ballgame nowadays we live in an era when most people get there knowledge of the game from tv for a good number of these fans sportscenter and baseball tonight are where they learned the game and what makes the highlights home runs and diving catches you very seldom see a well executed sacrifice bunt or a lightning fast on these shows i think today's fans particularly the younger ones through no fault of their own just simply do not know the game as well as some of us who have a few more years behind us that's not to say that a person in their 's can't be just as knowledgeable about the game as someone in their 's but their appreciation of the game is different i think baseball would be better off helping to educate its' fans rather than dumbing down the sport Baseball Babe Ruth Softball 1957 World Series World Series Baseball statistics Major League Baseball Major League Baseball television contracts Satchel Paige Batting average Toronto Blue Jays National Football League St. Louis Cardinals New York Giants Boston Red Sox Baseball scorekeeping 1986 National League Championship Series Pete Rose Chicago White Sox Detroit Tigers Los Angeles Dodgers Tris Speaker Ted Williams ESPN Houston Astros 2005 World Series Alex Rodriguez 2004 World Series Volleyball American football International League Robin Ventura Vin Scully Sandy Koufax Barry Bonds St. Louis Rams Fenway Park Willie Mays Dog agility Salary cap 2004 American League Championship Series 1986 World Series 1994 baseball strike Home run Strike zone Cincinnati Bengals Lou Gehrig Reggie Jackson 2001 World Series 1993 World Series Cricket History of baseball in the United States San Francisco Giants 2003 World Series Negro league baseball Baseball Stars Nolan Ryan Shot Heard 'Round the World (baseball) Japanese baseball Manny Ram__rez Major League Baseball All-Star Game Playoff Interference (baseball) Australian rules football Wrigley Field Yankee Stadium Stolen base Pittsburgh Steelers Andr__s Galarraga Kirk Gibson Cleveland Browns 1988 World Series Jack Buck Earned run average Designated hitter Pedro Mart__nez Box score (baseball) History of Test cricket (to 1883) Ted Radcliffe Babe Ruth's Called Shot Cleveland Indians MLB on FOX Randy Johnson American football strategy Atlanta Braves Rugby football ESPN25 Hank Aaron Charles O.
