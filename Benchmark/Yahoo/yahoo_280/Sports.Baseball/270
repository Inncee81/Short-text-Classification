is baseball really a sport come on i mean a player sit downs for half of the game right no physical activity the chances that an out fielder gets a fly ball its really low sometimes they never catch or run for a baseball because it might not hit their area for an entire game the game is super slow games a season is that too much that means they dont get tired well maybe because they dont do much physical activity like football or basketball would david big papi ortiz can run for minutes in a row he is one of the best players on the game but can't run for minutes in a row ok blah i could keep going but not going to stress myself out i just think the game is sooo slow they players can run for like seconds for a ball and then rest for the next maybe the entire game i mean foreal just because somebody can throw the ball mph or hit the baseball hard doesnt makes it a sport a sports is constant physical activity you telling me that a hitter can direct his baseball to an specific place they just hit it hard and hope to get out of the field they dont say i am hitting it left or right but w e a sports to me is basketball eventho they sit on time outs they r in constant movements soccer it is tennis and swimming are the most complete sports in history but w e i am not here to argue just make a point whoah did somebody says poker is a sport so hot dog eating contest is too it appears on espn whoah i dont think so lmao good points but you shouldn't come to the section and bash the sport not in good taste Baseball Volleyball Baseball statistics Home run David Ortiz 2004 World Series American football Boston Red Sox Sandy Koufax Batting average New York Giants Sport Barry Bonds National Football League Lore 1957 World Series Baseball scorekeeping Softball Major League Baseball Baseball Stars Water polo Sports timeline Tag Tris Speaker Sports in Puerto Rico Basketball Ultimate (sport) Rugby league Fast bowling Football (soccer) Yankee Stadium Mois__s Alou Reggie Jackson Poker jargon Rugby union positions Sudden death Comparison of Canadian and American football October 2004 in sports Manny Ram__rez Ty Cobb Moe Berg 2004 American League Championship Series Fielding (cricket) Al Michaels Polo Grounds Australian rules football Gary Sheffield Super Bowl XVII Box score (baseball) Donovan McNabb Cincinnati Reds BASEketball Super Bowl XXI National Football League Satchel Paige Super Bowl XXXVI Super Bowl XXIII 1986 World Series Babe Ruth 2005 World Series Red Sox Nation Detroit Tigers Origins of baseball Super Bowl IX Batting (cricket) Wrigley Field Andr__s Galarraga October 2005 in sports Seattle Mariners Hank Aaron Atlanta Braves Pedro Mart__nez Cleveland Browns San Diego Padres Super Bowl XIV Glossary of American football Tennis Chicago White Sox Rounders St. Louis Cardinals Super Bowl X Super Bowl XXXVIII New York Yankees Larry Bird Super Bowl XVIII No-hitter Canadian football Toronto Blue Jays Carolina Panthers 1919 World Series Tony Gwynn April 2005 in sports
