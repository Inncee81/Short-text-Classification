why don't fans or baseball execs care more about badly defined strike zones the rulebooks clearly state the strike zone limits but many umpires neglect this in favor their own little zone i'm just wondering why this doesn't bother fans more and why anyone except sandy alderson seems to care in the mlb offices i can't imagine umpires arbitrarily calling balls fair or foul or runners safe or out so why an arbitrary strike zone i know you can argue that fair foul and safe out are more clearly defined but the strike zone too is quite clearly defined in the rules so why isn't this more of an issue the different strike zones that umpires have has bothered me for years it really irritates me to hear an umpire refer to it as my strike zone i don't always agree with joe morgan but i did when he said it's not your strike zone you need to have the same strike zone as defined in the rule book the rule book says that the strike zone comes to the top of the letters but it is rarely called however pitches that are sometimes several inches off the plate are called strikes remember eric gregg in the nlcs where livan hernandez was throwing strikes a foot outside what's worse today's umpires particularly the younger ones are very confrontational players or managers can't question them not to mention argue without the umpire getting in their face and being thrown out of the game young pitchers are squeezed and even veterans who depend on location struggle for the first couple of innings as they try to see what the home plate umpire will give them simply going by the strike zone as defined in the rule book would make it more fair for both the pitcher and hitter i think a consistent strike zone should be more of an issue umpires need to understand that the fans are not there to see them interfere or to have an effect on the game i know that umpires are only human and make mistakes but the strike zone should not be up for debate they should not have their own individual strike zones as for sandy alderson his going to san diego was a loss for mlb when he was in charge of the umpires he made sure that they were made aware of their mistakes they were sent footage of their calls so they could avoid the same mistakes in the future now that he is no longer working in the mlb front office it's been a huge loss as long as these arrogant confrontational umpires are allowed to keep using their strike zones these problems will persist 2005 World Series 1957 World Series Strike zone World Series St. Louis Cardinals Interference (baseball) Cricket Detroit Tigers 2004 American League Championship Series Pitcher Barry Bonds Toronto Blue Jays Boston Red Sox Major League Baseball Umpire (baseball) Chicago White Sox Babe Ruth San Francisco Giants Houston Astros Perfect game No-hitter Sandy Koufax Satchel Paige 1919 World Series Home run Major League Baseball television contracts Laws of cricket 1986 National League Championship Series 1986 World Series October 14 in baseball Reggie Jackson Don Denkinger New York Yankees Major League Baseball All-Star Game 2003 World Series Jerry Coleman Baseball Stars Wrigley Field Sammy Sosa Vin Scully Box score (baseball) Volleyball Cincinnati Reds San Diego Padres Pete Rose Nolan Ryan Tris Speaker Ty Cobb Batting average Roger Clemens Stolen base Basketball Oakland Athletics New York Mets October 20 in baseball October 19 in baseball Pedro Mart__nez October 12 in baseball History of baseball in the United States October 10 in baseball American football Hank Aaron Baseball scorekeeping Atlanta Braves Bill Lee (MLB pitcher) 2005 National League Championship Series Out (baseball) Fenway Park November 3 in baseball 2001 World Series MLB on NBC Appeal play Sydney Riot of 1879 Ted Williams First baseman October 16 in baseball October 4 in baseball Andr__s Galarraga Los Angeles Dodgers Football (soccer) 1903 World Series Baserunning Knuckleball 1984 World Series June 8 in baseball Baseball slang October 15 in baseball Shoeless Joe Jackson Baseball field Bunt 1983 World Series
