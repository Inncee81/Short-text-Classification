barry bonds fiasco i really don't get the whole outrage with barry bonds is people say that he cheated because of steroids there is no proof that he even was on steroids also what about all the other players out there that took steroids as well i don't see the outrage with there stats you can't have it one way and not the other if one wants to take away from barry's accomplishments than all of baseball is tainted because if he did take steroids he wasn't the only one there were pitchers and catchers and batters as well so baseball would be tainted not by barry alone also i think everyone would agree that there is no question that he is still using steroids with all this controversy and he is still hitting hr so whats with all the fuss with barry bonds i just don't get it be mad a mlb for allowing their players to use steroids cuz if barry used them he wasn't the only one also why aren't people mad about wrestling almost all of the wrestlers use steroids just look at that guy who killed his family and then himself bc of steroids and there are like other wrestlers who have died because of steroids if you are looking to place blame on steroid use its in the wwe people are singling out barry bonds for one reason and one reason only because he set the single season home run record if barry had never broken that record no one would care whether or not he took steroids or not and the resentment for him kept growing as he climbed up the ladder towards home runs i've heard that fans want barry's home runs taken away but what about all of the pitchers who have actually tested positive do we take their wins away and what about bonds's walk record he got that record during the time that he was on steroids do we take those away too does taking steroids also help you get walks where do you draw the line it's getting ridiculous who cares if barry took steroids what do steroids even do for you anyway they help you build muscle mass what does muscle mass have to do with hitting home runs you still have to have great eyesight to determine whether the pitch is a ball or strike then you have to have a perfect swing to connect the right part of the bat with the right part of the ball in order for it to go over the fence how does steroids help with any of that maybe it helps you hit the ball a few feet further but when most ballparks are feet shorter than they were years ago it wouldn't matter anyway people just need to get over it already and move on with their lives who cares if barry took steroids what people need to worry about is who is cheating now this season not years ago who the hell cares Baseball statistics Major League Baseball St. Louis Cardinals Softball Ty Cobb Baseball Stars Pitcher Pete Rose World Series Chicago White Sox New York Yankees 2004 World Series Nolan Ryan New York Mets Baseball scorekeeping Mark McGwire International League Tris Speaker Los Angeles Dodgers Satchel Paige San Francisco Giants History of baseball in the United States Boston Red Sox Batting average Oakland Athletics Jos__ Canseco Gary Sheffield Rafael Palmeiro Professional wrestling slang Sandy Koufax 1957 World Series Ted Williams Sammy Sosa Stolen base 2004 American League Championship Series October 4 in baseball Cricket Mike Schmidt Andr__s Galarraga Houston Astros October 19 in baseball Fenway Park Strike zone Reggie Jackson Baltimore Orioles Ichiro Suzuki Chicago Cubs Major League Baseball television contracts Toronto Blue Jays Major League Baseball All-Star Game Cincinnati Reds Earned run average Professional wrestling match types 2005 World Series Wrigley Field Randy Johnson Washington Nationals Wes Ferrell Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim No-hitter 1981 World Series Vin Scully November 4 in baseball Seattle Mariners Alex Rodriguez Box score (baseball) Texas Rangers (baseball) 1919 World Series 1981 baseball strike Montr__al Expos SBC Park Troy Glaus Shot Heard 'Round the World (baseball) November 3 in baseball Japanese baseball Ben Johnson (athlete) Roger Clemens Professional wrestling aerial techniques October 27 in baseball June 8 in baseball October 22 in baseball Baseball bat Professional wrestling Catcher Greg Maddux
