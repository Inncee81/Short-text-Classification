is babe ruth the real home run king im curious compared to his total at bats if my figures are correct babe had abs where as hank had an amazing and bonds haz more than so technically then comparing there ab seems the only logical way to see who hit more in less time ruth had far more than anybody im i correct why do so many disregard this this is an answer of mine to a similar question aaron and bonds each had careers that lasted a similar amount of time to truly answer the question of home run king look at a more compelling set of stats aaron has a career total of homeruns in at bats that is an average of homeruns per at bat bonds at the time of this writing has homeruns in at bats for an average of hr ab ruth however had homeruns in at bats this averages to a whopping hr ab average so aaron and bonds have more career homeruns but it took them mor abs to reach their marks to put this in perspective look at it this way if the babe had as many abs as bonds he would have finished with homeruns and if he had as many abs as aaron he would have had homeruns so i do think it is safe to say that though bonds and aaron were great home run hitters the great bambino was and is still the home run king Home run Babe Ruth Hank Aaron Barry Bonds Alex Rodriguez Baseball Baseball Stars Boston Red Sox Troy Glaus Ty Cobb Baseball statistics Batting average Andr__s Galarraga Gary Sheffield New York Yankees Curse of the Bambino Top 500 home run hitters of all time Jim Rice Atlanta Braves Reggie Jackson September 20 in baseball World Series Tris Speaker Lou Gehrig Mark McGwire Jimmie Foxx David Ortiz Rudy York 2004 World Series Hal Trosky Manny Ram__rez Rickey Henderson 1957 World Series Mickey Mantle Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry Runs created Jos__ Canseco Babe Ruth's Called Shot Nolan Ryan Albert Pujols Rogers Hornsby St. Louis Cardinals Toronto Blue Jays October 22 in baseball Sadaharu Oh Todd Helton Shoeless Joe Jackson Batting order (baseball) Dave Henderson Cincinnati Reds Eddie Mathews Sammy Sosa History of baseball in the United States October 9 in baseball Yankee Stadium October 16 in baseball October 4 in baseball Herbert Sutcliffe September 6 in baseball Ralph Kiner Baltimore Orioles George Brett (baseball) Johnny Mize Perfect game Robin Ventura Major League Baseball titles streaks Ron Gant Mois__s Alou June 12 in baseball Baseball scorekeeping George Sisler Biblical inerrancy Red Sox Nation Willie Mays No-hitter Carl Yastrzemski W.
