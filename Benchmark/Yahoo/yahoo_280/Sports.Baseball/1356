in mlb do both leagues use designated hitters what is the difference between a pinch hitter and a designated hitter first of all i must tell you the history of designated hitters originally both leagues had the pitchers bat but in the 's most games were low scoring and a lot of american league teams were in small markets to keep fans in small markets coming to games the american league teams and the commisoner of baseball decided to try to make games higher scoring without changing the game too much they found that pitchers had low batting averages and that having another player hit would lead to more scoring so only american league teams use a designated hitter except in interleague play it depends on who the home team is a pinch hitter has to replace a player while a designated hitter plays the whole game and when he replaces him he has to play the field you can also have pinch runners who take someones place on base instead of hitting for them there can be more than one pinch hitter but not more than one designated hitter Baseball Designated hitter Batting average Baseball statistics Lou Gehrig Boston Red Sox Major League Baseball All-Star Game Major League Baseball Tris Speaker World Series Manny Ram__rez No-hitter 1919 World Series Barry Bonds New York Mets International League John Olerud St. Louis Cardinals 2004 American League Championship Series Box score (baseball) Pete Rose Interleague play Japanese baseball 2004 World Series MLB designated hitter statistics 1986 World Series Babe Ruth Robin Ventura Chicago White Sox Shoeless Joe Jackson Sammy Sosa 2005 World Series Bert Campaneris David Ortiz Reggie Jackson Willie Mays Volleyball Alex Rodriguez Ichiro Suzuki Hank Aaron Baseball scorekeeping Dave Kingman Detroit Tigers Jim Rice San Diego Padres New York Yankees Andr__s Galarraga Milwaukee Brewers Mike Scioscia Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Negro league baseball Edgar Martinez Jeff Bagwell Pittsburgh Pirates Mark McGwire Casey Stengel Pitcher Oakland Athletics Batting order (baseball) Edgar Renter__a Ted Kluszewski Sabermetrics Melvin Mora Troy Glaus Montr__al Expos Mike Schmidt Seattle Mariners Carlos Beltr__n Rickey Henderson Derek Jeter Texas Rangers (baseball) First baseman Jimmie Foxx Bobby Abreu Satchel Paige Torii Hunter Rocky Colavito San Francisco Giants Fenway Park October 4 in baseball Cap Anson Cincinnati Reds Scott Podsednik Bunt Playoff Shawn Wooten Perfect game Sandy Koufax
