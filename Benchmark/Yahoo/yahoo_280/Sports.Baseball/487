is it time for the red sox to be really worried about the yankees back and it's only the beginning of august i personally would not write off the yankees until they are out of both the al east title and the wildcard the reason the yanks have closed the distance boils down to a couple of factors all have to do with hitting david ortiz has had some knee problems that date back to late last year and will require surgery his production has suffered partially for this j d drew is not earning his money mill for years on a so called no batter who is batting like a fourth outfielder still not sure why they ranked him a must have he also hurt our chances of jermaine dye due to dye having to share the starting job with drew julio lugo for years at million he is pulling out of it but the slump hurt badly for so long wily mo pena has not emerged as the right handed power hitting people thought he could become he is also a liability in the field so they can't afford to play him at anything more than dh that and he strikes out a lot so they can't give him too many at bats manny's power numbers have been down but that could be due to the lack of production around him in the long run the red sox pitching will be great for years to come their bullpen has been one of the league's best thus far the short term the sox problem has been scoring runs they are leaving too many runners on base yes the yankees are all hitting the years old barrier with greater frequency but they can hit and produce runs in the now they aren't getting the same pitching the sox are but they aren't leaving runners on base this is even without sheffield the red sox fans that said that the yankees were done in may and june were crazy then no one should be writing of the yanks until oct i still think the sox will win the division but the yankees are still in striking distance and could very well take the wild card Chicago White Sox 1957 World Series 2004 American League Championship Series World Series 2004 World Series Toronto Blue Jays Babe Ruth New York Yankees Baseball Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry Manny Ram__rez Home run 1919 World Series Satchel Paige Cleveland Indians Alex Rodriguez International League 2005 American League Division Series Robin Ventura Seattle Mariners St. Louis Cardinals Pedro Mart__nez Reggie Jackson Softball 2003 World Series Tris Speaker Florida Marlins Chicago Cubs October 4 in baseball October 12 in baseball Cincinnati Reds David Ortiz New York Mets Moe Berg October 22 in baseball October 10 in baseball San Francisco Giants 1986 World Series Baltimore Orioles Gary Sheffield Ty Cobb San Diego Padres Curse of the Bambino October 16 in baseball Philadelphia Phillies Houston Astros Interference (baseball) Baseball statistics Oakland Athletics October 7 in baseball 2001 World Series Los Angeles Dodgers Wade Boggs Texas Rangers (baseball) Roger Clemens Batting average Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Pete Rose October 2005 in sports October 5 in baseball Major League Baseball television contracts Fenway Park Yankee Stadium Sandy Koufax Lou Gehrig No-hitter Hank Aaron October 3 in baseball Bernie Williams Red Sox Nation October 13 in baseball New York Giants October 15 in baseball Baseball scorekeeping October 27 in baseball Dick Williams October 1 in baseball Cricket English cricket team Minnesota Twins Bill Lee (MLB pitcher) October 11 in baseball October 9 in baseball Fast bowling September 28 in baseball 1981 baseball strike Pittsburgh Pirates October 19 in baseball 1986 National League Championship Series Atlanta Braves
