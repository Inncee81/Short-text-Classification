in baseball if you're not cheating you're not trying baseball is investigating bonds and who else can you name others who tested positive for performance enhancing drugs and other illegal drugs like amphetamines if cheating is so bad why do we ignore everyone but bonds investigating not catching i know if you get caught now you'll be suspended i'm asking about investigating what happened prior to steriod testing and the new policy in mlb can't do anything with barry bonds and others regarding drug use bud selig can't magically change the rules to show that he made hgh and steroids illegal back then the issue is already old and beaten to death by millions of people trying to prove various points here if prescription drugs are prescribed by a doctor how can that be considered cheating or being a junkie like a lot of barry haters are trying to prove if taking drugs that are not banned or illegal considered a crime or cheating then why don't they come up to my face and tell me i'm a criminal for treating my asthma with steroids which are the only effective drugs for that condition i take steroids for asthma but cannot hit a baseball over ft or pitch a ball over mph my muscles are not built i can't swing a bat faster than barry bonds and my eyesight is not as sharp as a hawk's the only thing that steroids have done to me is just help me retain water that's the only symptom not enhanced performance in sports i'd probably get no replies from the barry bonds haters because they have no proof as to why they hate him they just call him names just because the media says so also they think they know george herman babe ruth and henry aaron personally to know that they're angels which is false because the babe was into alcohol and henry was into amphetamines as he confessed to the atlanta press in the 's Barry Bonds Major League Baseball History of baseball in the United States Babe Ruth World Series Baseball Ben Johnson (athlete) Hank Aaron Anabolic steroid Drug abuse Drug addiction Ty Cobb Baseball Stars Tour de France St. Louis Cardinals Boston Red Sox San Francisco Giants Asthma Illegal drug trade Lou Gehrig Major League Baseball television contracts New York Yankees Rafael Palmeiro Shane Warne Methamphetamine October 16 in baseball Rush Limbaugh Amphetamine Reggie Jackson Mark McGwire Darryl Strawberry Chronic fatigue syndrome Arguments for and against drug prohibition Baltimore Orioles Growth hormone treatment Clinical depression Fast bowling Homeopathy Olympic Games Atlanta Braves Satchel Paige 2005 World Series Tris Speaker Pete Rose ESPN25 Babe Ruth's Called Shot Cricket Methylphenidate Cannabis (drug) Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Addiction Prohibition (drugs) Duesberg hypothesis October 22 in baseball Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Bowie Kuhn Plame affair Gary Sheffield Blackjack Knots Landing Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Tom DeLay June 2004 in sports Psoriasis Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Curse of the Bambino Baseball (object) Pharmaceutical company October 5 in baseball The Ashes Baseball bat Sports timeline Volleyball Folic acid Baseball Hall of Fame Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Medical cannabis December 2004 in sports August 2005 in sports Up the Down Steroid Psychosis Weight training GoldenEye 007 Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Melbourne gangland killings Dale Murphy Sammy Sosa Stolen base Eczema Willie Mays September 20 in baseball Rape Bipolar disorder Hillary Rodham Clinton
