does the career home run record include postseason home runs i assume that it does i also assume that it does not include any exhibition or spring training games but here comes my real question can the single season home run record include postseason home runs i believe babe got his in regular season games marris got his in regular season games and that mcgwire and bonds got their records in the regular season also but suppose someone tied bonds at on the last day of the season and then continued on to the playoffs and world series to get several more would that player be considered the single season home run king or would he remain tied with bonds in the record books or would he get credit for first place but then get an asterisk beside his name indicating that some hrs came in the postseason i figured the single season record would not include post season but thought it was an interesting predicament given the possibility of someone hitting more than in postseason so i asked but some of you are disagreeing on career home runs does that include postseason i would think it does can anyone cite some evidence for their answer no postseason stats are counted separately i have only ever once seen maris credited with home runs in and that was specifically for his one hr in game of the world series and it was a bit jarring reading that i don't remember where it was long ago of course that never stops yankees fans from spouting that the team a true juggernaut went nice multiples of numbers when the season record was which is hard to imagine isn't good enough on its own merit honestly i have never before nor since encountered this sort of add the october games in sort of nonsense Home run 1957 World Series Toronto Blue Jays Reggie Jackson New York Yankees 2005 World Series Boston Red Sox Los Angeles Dodgers St. Louis Cardinals Babe Ruth Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Chicago White Sox Major League Baseball television contracts October 4 in baseball Hank Aaron Barry Bonds Rickey Henderson Derek Jeter Oakland Athletics 1981 World Series October 7 in baseball October 3 in baseball 1981 baseball strike David Ortiz Playoff format October 5 in baseball Pete Rose New York Knicks Baseball Roger Maris Atlanta Braves Troy Glaus Lou Gehrig International League Mark McGwire Alex Rodriguez Pittsburgh Steelers Wrigley Field National Basketball Association Chicago Cubs Cleveland Indians Robin Ventura Red Sox Nation 2001 World Series Curse of the Bambino Houston Astros Don Mattingly Boston Bruins Cincinnati Reds October 9 in baseball Miami Dolphins Cincinnati Bengals New York Giants Mariano Rivera Willie Mays 1987 World Series 2004 World Series Theory of conduct Florida Marlins Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry San Francisco Giants October 16 in baseball Jack Buck Cleveland Browns 1986 National League Championship Series Kansas City Chiefs October 18 in baseball Mario Lemieux Leo Durocher Pedro Mart__nez Tris Speaker Major League Baseball Dave Kingman No-hitter Alan Trammell Wayne Gretzky 1994 baseball strike Seattle Mariners Indiana Pacers Donovan McNabb MLB on NBC Houston Rockets Detroit Tigers 1975 World Series Tino Martinez Dick Williams Manny Ram__rez
