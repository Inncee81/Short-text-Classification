no facial hair rule for the ny yankees good idea or bad idea i think it's bad you have to let the players be themselves johnny damon was way better when he had the long hair beard jesus look with the red sox now he just doesn't seem like himself and his stats show it same with giambi in oakland he sported long hair and a goat tee george made him shave that thing as soon as he got to nyc sure he had a few good years but he still probably wanted to grow the beard back he hates shaving same with damon also when clemens was able to sport a goat in toronto he had his best years ever i say lose the no facial hair rule and if the yankees bring in joe girardi who is the biggest jarhead marine style guy ever he probably gets his flat top trimmed every week there will be no chance of the no facial hair rule being over turned i believe willie randolph and the mets have the no facial hair long hair rule also but i believe those are the only teams in the majors with such rules the mets yankees can have mustaches who wants one of those besides boomer and semi side burns but that's about it always remember baseball is a game that is built upon routines and superstitions if a players isn't shaving and getting a hit in every game then he will want to continue not shaving till he breaks the streak but in ny they would make you shave after about days to the last guy who said you have to be all clean cut to be corporate i have one word for you microsoft i live in seattle and have worked there before they accept people with long hair short hair purple hair tats piercings sandles you can even bring your dogs to work as long as you can do your freaking job that's all that matters i totally agree w u man i think they should choose it is there face let them do what they want w it Boston Red Sox New York Mets Beard Dick Williams New York Yankees Red Sox Nation San Francisco Giants World Series Babe Ruth Seattle Mariners Johnny Damon Rickey Henderson October 4 in baseball Chicago White Sox Chicago Cubs Florida Marlins Cincinnati Reds Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Alex Rodriguez St. Louis Cardinals Barber October 14 in baseball Cleveland Indians Hair 2005 World Series 2004 American League Championship Series Detroit Tigers 1986 World Series 1981 baseball strike Baseball Los Angeles Dodgers Major League Baseball television contracts Atlanta Braves November 2 in baseball Haircut Curse of the Bambino History of baseball in the United States Curse of the Billy Goat Houston Astros International League MLB Comeback Player of the Year Award Manny Ram__rez October 17 in baseball Baltimore Orioles 1957 World Series Moustache October 10 in baseball Philadelphia Phillies October 22 in baseball 2004 World Series Shaving Baldness October 21 in baseball October 16 in baseball October 26 in baseball Tris Speaker Robin Ventura June 8 in baseball October 3 in baseball Pedro Mart__nez Texas Rangers (baseball) Cincinnati Bengals November 3 in baseball Home run Poker jargon Roger Clemens 1981 World Series June 2 in baseball October 18 in baseball October 27 in baseball Pittsburgh Steelers Lou Gehrig November 2004 in sports October 2005 in sports October 2004 in sports 1919 World Series Tim McCarver Nickname No-hitter New York Giants 2003 World Series Randy Johnson Darryl Strawberry Minnesota Vikings Milwaukee Brewers Nolan Ryan September 6 in baseball Depilation San Diego Padres
