how does one boycott barry by attending giants games i heard about a bunch of idiots wearing boycott barry t shirts at the giants v dodgers series in los angeles recently and though i'm into people protesting and all that good stuff if they want the whole thing is rightfully very contriversial that particular slogan only works if you're not going to the games it's also not just people buying the shirts and going to the games it was the head of the company so does he they not know what a boycott is am i missing something actually it is simply the choice of slogans that i have a problem with the fire millen people i actually am completely with that is an attempt to make some sort of a noticable statement it is hurt by the fact that they paid for the tickets but i completely get the train of thought my only issue is to wear a shirt that says boycott barry and do the exact opposite of it certainly express yourself but that is just nonsensical at least the fire millen guys didn't have boycott the lions signs and shirts they are actually supporting a team they care about and making a statement bonds totally emo actually all jokes aside he kind of is he's definately moody self centered and dark this is the first i have heard about it since i don't know the particulars i am only guessing one way this group could protest would be to show up at the game in their bb t shirts and then all leave at the same time like in the middle of the game the detroit lions had a similar group fire matt millen sadly for lions fans millen still has a job it might seem like a waste of time by the idiots because they already paid for their tickets still if there are enough of them it does send a message of sorts to bud and mlb because potentially it can be embarrassing the problem is that not enough idiots are willing to shell out the jack and then leave early btw barry bonds is soooo emo dude San Francisco Giants Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Los Angeles Dodgers Pittsburgh Steelers Oakland Athletics Major League Baseball television contracts World Series Cleveland Browns New England Patriots American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Barry Bonds Los Angeles Clippers Babe Ruth Boston Red Sox Family Guy New York Giants Married... with Children Detroit Lions Los Angeles Kings Vin Scully Satchel Paige History of baseball in the United States Houston Astros Opie and Anthony New Orleans Saints Beavis and Butt-head Willie Mays Shit Rugby union positions New York Mets Detroit Tigers The Amazing Race Cincinnati Bengals Oakland Raiders Torquay United F.C.
