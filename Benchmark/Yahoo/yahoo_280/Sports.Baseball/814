how often does a pitcher in an mlb game have an at bat before he throws the first pitch this question only applies under national league rules and would only apply to a pitcher on the visitors team of course though it is conceivably possible for a home pitcher other than the starting pitcher to bat before he pitches i think what you're getting at is why doesn't the visiting team begin the game with a position player listed as the hitter in the lineup just in case they bat around you would have a better hitter up rather than the pitcher the thing is this batting around in the st inning may only happen once or twice a year it would not be worth burning a position player every game for the rare occurance that he might hit in the st Baseball Baseball statistics Pitcher Designated hitter Major League Baseball All-Star Game Batting average 1919 World Series No-hitter World Series Sammy Sosa Softball Toronto Blue Jays Boston Red Sox 1957 World Series Box score (baseball) 2005 World Series Pittsburgh Pirates Stolen base Hank Aaron Home run Starting pitcher Tris Speaker New York Yankees New York Mets Barry Bonds Baseball Stars Major League Baseball Pete Rose Manny Ram__rez Andr__s Galarraga Roger Clemens Nolan Ryan Don Newcombe Randy Johnson October 16 in baseball Earned run average Babe Ruth Sandy Koufax San Diego Padres St. Louis Cardinals 2004 World Series Houston Astros 1981 World Series Reggie Jackson Sabermetrics October 4 in baseball Alex Rodriguez Pedro Mart__nez Atlanta Braves Detroit Tigers Ichiro Suzuki Luis Tiant Dave Concepci__n October 3 in baseball Lou Gehrig Early Wynn Batting order (baseball) November 4 in baseball International League Chicago White Sox Satchel Paige Washington Nationals Ty Cobb David Ortiz 1986 World Series Derek Jeter November 3 in baseball Seattle Mariners Robin Ventura Edgar Renter__a Chicago Cubs 1983 World Series Interference (baseball) 2004 American League Championship Series Cincinnati Reds Bo Diaz Mariano Rivera Julio Franco October 22 in baseball Bill Lee (MLB pitcher) Volleyball Cricket Negro league baseball Texas Rangers (baseball) MLB designated hitter statistics 1975 World Series October 21 in baseball 1903 World Series Ted Williams Switch hitter October 26 in baseball Bunt Los Angeles Dodgers
