what stand should i take with barry bonds and the home run record i asked a question earlier similar to this wasn't convinced with the answers here i go again dude just accomplished something phenomenal he broke the all time home run record i'm a huge sports fan as you can see from the top contributor badge in baketball and i used to own one in baseball lol but here's the thing i'm only i know nothing about what went on years ago who and wat do i believe barry used steroids and acknowledged that but does he still use it did he knowingly cheat you and i don't know so how can we say he cheated after all he wasn't the only one who did it right but here's the thing i think cheating is cheating and those who dishonor the game in any way should be punished but how do i know what barry did back then was wrong or not if steroids weren't even tested back then or weren't considered a way to cheat or gain an unfair advantage well people say performance enhancement what about lazer eye surgery doesn't that improve people's eyes and isn't that performance enhacement why can't they just wear glasses im totally lost and confused with this thing i have mixed feelings about it and i don't know where to take a stand on this issue usually im do my research and im pretty firm in what my opinions are im no bandwagoner but im a true passionate sports fan especially baseball and basketball and it sucks to watch all this crap going on not knowing what is right what is wrong and who to believe and who not to believe christian rollindo what about the referee betting scandal in basketball that sport ain't clean either but then again all major american sports have come under a lot of fire this year ref in nba bonds in mlb and vick and dogfighting in nfl phashant my friend i read this question earlier and i too am very mixed myself so i am going to talk a little about everything here we go barry used steroids please don't argue this do you want to know how i know give me one reason why his trainer is in jail refusing to testify if he doesn't have something to hide about barry using them why would his trainer allow himself to sit in jail and rot for months if he didn't have something to hide is he just bored and wanted to hang out with some of his friends in jail obviously not see there is no reason he would choose to be in jail rather then testifying and keeping his freedom he is there because he is hiding something remember everyone he admitted used the arthritis cream and flax seed oil which obviously was the cream and the clear he just said his trainer lied to him about what they really were yet why would the same trainer lie to him about that and allow himself to be held in contempt by protecting barry and refusing to testify on the matter because he knows something personally i don't barry he skips autographs sessions and shows little respect for the fans this is not only from my experience at giants games but from many people around him including his teammates sports journalists books and newspapers articles and fellow baseball players but that is just my opinion my biggest problem is with baseball the game i loved as a child i grew up watching and reading anything about it i've been to a number of games including in the world series game of the dodgers athletics series when kirk gibson hit that home run of dennis eckersley and in watching ichiro suzuki break and set a new mlb record for most hits in a season i have been to dodger games mariner games giants games angels games padres games a's games rockies games and diamondback games i still love baseball but my deep passion for it is gone watching barry bonds mark mcguire sammy sosa gary sheffield jason giambi rafeal palmeiro all weasel and squirm their way through the court proceedings made me sick not one of them was man enough to admit they took them mark cried sammy faked a lack of understanding of the english language and communication funny he has no problem understanding the english language during interviews hmmmm and the rest of them lied you could see it on their faces those guilty looks it just made me sick and i lost respect for all of them so to me hank is still the home run champ and i will continue to respect the rest of baseball's record for now finally i have to comment of a few things said above just because some people cheat doesn't excuse a person from being responsible not to cheat themseleves and no one is saying bonds wasn't a great player in the early and mid 's but people are suspicious when his numbers started going up in when most players career would have been on the decline because of his age and the fact that is head and body magically ballooned in size that is it i am tired of typing p s players don't wear glasses because of safety concerns no one wants broken glass in their eye many still wear contacts even though some have gotten eye surgery since contacts do pop out and get dirt in them and no i don't believe lasic surgery counts as performance enhancement actually that's kind of funny Hank Aaron San Francisco Giants New York Yankees Major League Baseball television contracts Reggie Jackson
