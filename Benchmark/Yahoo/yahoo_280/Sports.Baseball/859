will kei igawa be traded to the padres this weekend and for whom i heard that the padres have put a waiver claim for igawa how close are they to a deal and will it get done who are the yankees looking for in return it doesn't matter if it's past the trade deadline all that was was the non waiver trade deadline meaning that a team does not have to put a player on waivers before they can trade him and what not i doubt anyone will pick igawa up off waivers so hopefully they deal his pathetic arm somewhere Boston Red Sox Manny Ram__rez San Diego Padres Hanshin Tigers Florida Marlins Detroit Tigers Randy Johnson Bush v.
