who was supposed to cover rd on this play and is this a managerial error or risk about a week ago during a nat's and reds game manny acta shifted the nat's defense way over to the right side of the field the shift was so far to the right that ryan zimmerman was playing the nd base position at the time of the shift phillips of the reds was on first base two pitches in phillips get the steal sign and takes off for nd base zimmerman gets the ball but there's no one to throw to because the shortstop is in between him and the st baseman phillips then cruises on to rd base easily with no one covering is this a major screw up by acta or was the pitcher supposed to cover rd base the natural reaction for the pitcher as it should be is to to head for st base on a ground ball but there is no place for him to go on a steal on a steal the rd baseman should be headed for his base instinctively the catcher just threw the ball so it'd be hard for him to cover rd on every play players have to know where to go and who is covering what base if they are going to do a shift like that there has to be a plan on what to do in those situations i think it was a mangerial screwup in that he didn't have the players practice the play so it would be instinctive i would try to train the pitcher to cover third or get the rd baseman over there good question Baseball Softball Pitcher World Series First baseman Baseball positions Baseball statistics Tris Speaker 1957 World Series Chicago White Sox Andr__s Galarraga Stolen base Baseball scorekeeping Sandy Koufax Second baseman Ty Cobb Boston Red Sox 1919 World Series Reggie Jackson Pete Rose Babe Ruth 2004 American League Championship Series Houston Astros Alex Rodriguez Third baseman Cincinnati Reds Shortstop New York Mets October 14 in baseball Toronto Blue Jays Nolan Ryan Detroit Tigers New York Yankees Hank Aaron October 4 in baseball Interference (baseball) Red Sox Nation San Diego Padres No-hitter Manny Ram__rez Box score (baseball) International League Baserunning Glossary of American football Volleyball October 16 in baseball Moe Berg June 2 in baseball Robin Ventura October 27 in baseball Perfect game October 22 in baseball Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Negro league baseball September 20 in baseball History of baseball in the United States 2005 World Series November 2 in baseball Chico Carrasquel Bunt Roger Clemens Left fielder Tag Derek Jeter Cleveland Indians Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1945 Designated hitter St. Louis Cardinals Unassisted triple play Seattle Mariners Satchel Paige Roberto Alomar Ted Radcliffe San Francisco Giants Texas Rangers (baseball) Squeeze play (baseball) Lou Gehrig Jackie Robinson David Ortiz October 26 in baseball October 13 in baseball Pedro Mart__nez October 10 in baseball Canadian football 1986 World Series Edgar Renter__a November 3 in baseball Water polo October 5 in baseball October 25 in baseball Curse of the Billy Goat 1986 National League Championship Series October 20 in baseball Fielding (cricket) Home run
