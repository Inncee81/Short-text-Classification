i saw father christmas once no lie as a child a couple of days before the event i was drawn out of bed and i pulled the curtain aside and saw a cartoon image of father christmas reindeers and slay in the night sky it was confusing at the time and i'm not a believer of anything but what i saw was a moving image i tell you straight has anyone else seen this too i lived in the sticks at the time and there was no giant decorations or even a street light the image was very high in the deep blue clear cold sky and it used to snow every christmas time and my windows had frosty patterns on them even on the inside bbrrh cold i believe you moley because the child mind is so ripe with imagination and innocence and our creativity hasn't been beaten into submission yet when i was a kid the shadows coming through my bedroom window against the streetlight used to become a guy and a girl 's style sharing a giant single microphone and singin' and dancin' it was vivid not just kinda which leaves the question are these things really happening on some level and as we grow older we lose the sensitivity in our perception and the other question was this santa you saw a jolly fat white guy in a red suit or a giant laughing blue mole with a pajama cap on his head i never told my childhood vision story to anyone please don't make fun of me moley Santa Claus Christmas Milton H.
