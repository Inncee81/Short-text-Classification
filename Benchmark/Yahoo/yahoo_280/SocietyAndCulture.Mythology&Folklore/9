my witchcraft friend told me some spells she knows and uh theyre pretty freaky one of them she said is to throw some grape vines on someone and where they hit the body somethin bad will happen to that part another one she said is to stare in front of mirror in a dark room with a candle and u will then see who ur future love will be is this true i kind of want to try the mirror one but im scared lol do you want the honest opinion from a witch who has been practicing or about years spell casting is nothing to play with and no witch or aspiring witch would do such a spell as you have mentioned to me this person is coming off more like fluffy bunny wannabe trying to get attention by frightening you or trying to impress you the mirror thing is possible if you believe and can gaze into the mirror with honesty it may be a simple form of scrying sort of like using a crystal ball and many witches do use mirrors in darkness but what you see may not be what you expect as it is difficult for a novice to channel that specifically don't be afraid of it because it can't hurt you but if you see an image it may not be your future love it could be of a current or future event in your life bb o Wicca Witchcraft Macbeth One Tree Hill (TV series) Spice Girls Smallville (Season 4) Theory of conduct Phoebe Halliwell Magical objects in Harry Potter The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Marilyn Monroe Cardcaptor Sakura The Shining (film) Magic (paranormal) Milton H.
