making the band whne is the season finale of making the band i cant wait any longer this is the first whole season i have watched and i love it donnie is sooooo hottt but i liked dan too and mike the big guy and willie is good too but honestly some of those guys cant even sing diddy has no idea what he is talking bout diddy is just caught up in himself thinking he is great but really he cant even rap and knows nothing bout music from wat i see on the show he thinks he owns everyone but w e thats just me but i have watched so many re runs and cant wait for the finale but idk when its on so plezzz if u know tell me cuz i really want to know thanx also if you know i was wondering what the name of the song was that they play in the beginning of the show idk what it is and i dont know if they will only release it when they choose the band but w e i just want to know so thanx in advance the finale is supposed b live on the th of this month i agree about diddy not knowing what he's doing watch his videos if you can stand to and see where he has room to tell anybody else they cant dance then he makes some of them sacrifice something very important to them their hair with no guarantee they will make the band just because that's the look he wants for his band i think he should have left them how the females liked them like brian h said he's tryin to clown them he shouldn't try to make the guys look better he needs to work on himself all of them look sing and dance better than he does only thing he has is the money The Ashlee Simpson Show Sean Combs Jennifer Lopez Remix Brian Griffin Friends MTV Video Music Award Time Out of Mind Usher (entertainer) Hip hop rivalries Shaggy dog story Meat Loaf Journey (band) Selling out Therion (band) Kelis Quarashi Avenue Q Diddy Kong The Emancipation of Mimi Timeline of trends in music from the United States (1970-Present) I Am the Walrus Roxette Marvin Gaye Pok__mon Live!
