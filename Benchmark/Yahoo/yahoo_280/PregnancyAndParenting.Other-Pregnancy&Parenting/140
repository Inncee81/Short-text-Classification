what is your reminder when your baby is in the back seat so you do not forget them having read another story of another baby who died because they were forgotten in the back seat in this summer weather and then was found dead i thought of a simple idea as a reminder using a velcro strip through a pacifier we fasten it on the steering wheel to make absolute certain that we would never forget that beloved baby when our minds were elsewhere what do you do our lives are so busy these days it is amazing how we can forget the most important things in our lives most of us thiink this would never happen to us and of those it has happen to i am certain they thought it would never happen to them but when your baby is sleeping and good as gold and your mind in thinking of a million things it obviously can happen and i do not believe it only happens to bad parents i understand the ugly responses but we all need to remember any of us can make mistakes since i never left my children and they are adults now and their children are nearly adults i just felt if this reminder saved one little one any where it was worth the arrogant responses it never hurts to err on the side of safety i like putting the purse or briefcase in the back that would be a great reminder i would like to be like everyone else and say that i could never have forgotten my baby in the car but i'm not entirely sure that's true i never did forget him in the car but i might have there is one morning in particular that i'm remembering i have a long commute to work and my son's daycare is on the way he was almost two when one day i just forgot to drop him off at daycare i don't know how i forgot i just did i suppose i was thinking about something and just forgot to turn off the road and drop him off it was such a part of the routine that it's impossible to distinguish one memory of dropping off from any other anyway i was already miles down the road pulling off the expressway to go to my job when he started babling at me at first i didn't think anything of it i'm a single mom and my son is with me so constantly that often i see him in the rearview mirror or hear his voice even when he's not really there this time though it wasn't a passing laugh or something like that he kept babbling at me and i realized that i had forgotten to drop him off i was so embarassed i had to go in and tell my boss i was going to be a couple of hours late because i had to go all the way back to the daycare at the same time i was so relieved that he hadn't fallen asleep on the trip or something like that i was so convinced that he was already at daycare that i may not have noticed he was asleep in his carseat my son is three and a half now so that was ages ago yet i still find myself checking his seat several times on the way to work each morning to make absolutely sure i rembered to drop him off i'm super paranoid about it now Time Out of Mind Shaggy dog story Social rule Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Jon Secada Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The Amber Spyglass Paul Is Dead About a Boy Pitaten Friends Milton H.
