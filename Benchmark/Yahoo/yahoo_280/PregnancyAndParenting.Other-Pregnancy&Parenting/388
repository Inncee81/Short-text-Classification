for anyone who is or has ever been pregnant as stupid as this sounds i've read that in order to have a female child you must get pregnant by sperm that has been in the cervix for several hours before ovulation and that you will have a boy if you have sex while you're ovulating because the sperm that produces male children swim faster and will fertilize the egg before the female sperm how true is this statement i had sex either right before or while i was ovulating and i would like to think my chances of having a girl are equally as good as my chances of having a boy does anyone know where in their cycle they had sex when they became pregnant did you have are you having a boy or a girl any and all opinions are appreciated thanks that is actually the only gender determining wives tale that has any scientific merit however it is still a wives tale it comes from the fact that male sperm swim faster but die sooner and female sperm swim slower but live longer if you have sex two days before you ovulate this theory says that you will probably have a girl because all the male sperm will have died off and the female sperm though they took a couple of days to get to the egg were able to survive oppositely if you have sex when you ovulate the faster male sperm should be able to beat the slower female sperm to the egg and fertilize it first i believe there have been studies done that show this still will not determine gender any better than chance Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Pregnancy Sexual reproduction In vitro fertilisation Puberty Fertilisation Birth control Oral contraceptive Ovulation Ovary Sex Abortion debate Intersexuality Old wives' tale Emergency contraception Twin Sex assignment John Money Androgen insensitivity syndrome Gender role Female reproductive system (human) Semen Spider Orgasm Sexual intercourse Miscarriage Homosexuality and medical science Moss History of intersex surgery Woman American lobster Cross-dressing Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Transsexuality Sexual differentiation Ovum Gender identity Niddah Leatherback Sea Turtle Gender Sex-selective abortion and infanticide The Handmaid's Tale Housefly Kakapo Drosophila melanogaster Hermaphrodite Bird Order of succession Alternation of generations Infantilism Sexual selection Biology and sexual orientation Non-human animal sexuality Sexual orientation Marchantiophyta Ploidy Meiosis Flowering plant Estrus cycle Laura Schlessinger Sexual attraction Sex organ Chimera (genetics) X chromosome Flower History of sex Gamete Homosexuality and Christianity Sexual identity Queen bee Conifer cones Pregnancy test Religion and sexuality Speed of light Platypus Pedophilia Octopus Fibonacci number Male reproductive system (human) Multiple birth Jam (TV series) Sexual dimorphism Sex and intelligence Gender-neutral language Earthworm Married... with Children Economic inequality Reparative therapy Sexual abstinence Bisexuality Child sexuality Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Prostate cancer Recumbent bicycle
