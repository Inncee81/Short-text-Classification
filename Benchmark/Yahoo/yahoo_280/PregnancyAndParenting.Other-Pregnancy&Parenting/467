why do you think you can judge a single mom theres all these people who sit around passing judgement on single moms and i dont get it just because you do it the right way what gives you any right to judge someone else some of us dont chose to be single parents i was with a sweet guy who i thought was a good person i got pregnant not planned and he ran away like a coward and you people who judge us single moms do you have any idea how hard it is any idea how rewarding it is or any idea how strong it makes you i personally think that im doing a damn good job being a single mom my son has made me a more loving caring comapssionate strong person i dont know if i would have ever become this person if i wasnt a single mom and it makes me so mad for people to judge me because they have no idea what its like i just wanted to see what other people thought on this thank you all for your positive comments i totally appreciate it i needed to see something positive my mom was a single mom to me all of my life my dad left when i was a month old we havent seen him since i recenttly met my sister my dads kid and after hearing some of the stuff our dad tells her im glad i was raised by a single mom while i wish my son knew his dad i cant change that his dad left on his own i know that my son will grow up to be a strong respective man i doubt his father could teach him that more power to you then i dont get why anyone would judge you i personally admire the strength of single moms who do a good job i am pregnant for the st time am getting married i know it's going to be hard i cant even begin to imagine if i was on my own i really wish the best for you all single moms god bless you Humphrey Bogart Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity EastEnders Fathers' rights Kyle Broflovski Recurring South Park characters Springfield Elementary School Doug Justification (theology) Summa Theologiae Friends The Marshall Mathers LP Salvation Cartman Joins NAMBLA Hey Jude Grandview, U.S.A.
