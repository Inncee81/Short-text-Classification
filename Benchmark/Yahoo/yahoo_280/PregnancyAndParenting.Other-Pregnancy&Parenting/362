i will be flying with my month old daughter soon any advice on safe travel flying i have never flown with a child let alone a baby before i am worried about the germs and her getting sick from being on the flight the flight is hours nothing to worry about most colds spread in the thanksgiivng and christmas travel season make sure you take her car seat with you for the flight and for the car rides once you're where you're going even if you haven't bought a ticket for her chances are huge that you'll find two seats next to each other on the plane so she can be safe in her seat next to you flight attendants are very cooperative about this also make sure you have a bottle with you with juice a bottle with really small holes so the baby can drink on take off and landing to avoid ear pain from the cabin pressure changes if you breast feed then that's fine too but during landing or take off it would put the baby without any restraints so use juice just during landing and take off while baby is strapped in safely good luck it will be easier than you think he she will probablt sleep most of the flight o Breastfeeding Car safety Decompression sickness Knots Landing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Mohamed Atta al-Sayed Howard Hughes EastEnders Gliding Pan Am Flight 103 Comanche Air New Zealand Ron Weasley Childbirth Baby bottle Humphrey Bogart Baby transport Airport The Catcher in the Rye Public transport United Airlines Flight 93 Cabin pressurization Low-cost carrier Airbus A380 Characters of Lost Premature birth Parachute B-47 Stratojet Champagne (beverage) Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia Fixed-wing aircraft Soft drink Social rule Airbag Airport (film) Lockheed U-2 Elevator Bat Boeing 747 Wheel of Fortune Infant Russian joke Milk Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Indianapolis 500 Saturn V Gaia Online Cruising (maritime) Grumpy's Three Wishes Southwest Airlines Bong Coffee MN Airlines, LLC Paragliding Oplan Bojinka Neighbours Ejector seat USS Wasp (CV-7) Apollo Command/Service Module Air safety Diving regulator TAM Linhas A__reas Concorde Clyde Pangborn Space disaster The Amazing Race Cider STS-61 Urinary incontinence Fecal incontinence D.
