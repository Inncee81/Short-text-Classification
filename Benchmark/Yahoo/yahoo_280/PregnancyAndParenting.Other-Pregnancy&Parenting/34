maternity clothes where do you where did you get your maternity clothes from and what sorts of clothes would you recommend i like blooming marvelous first time round they did roll top trousers that i found to be the most comfortale round my waist i ended up with pairs i also liked the breast feeding tops in jojo maman bebe if you live near south wales consder looking in their factory shop as things were a fraction of the price i found that wrap tops with a v neckline flatted my fuller top half although this was not a style i would have bought in the past i would buy a sleeping bra to aviod leakage even if you don't intend to breast feed but don't buy too many bras right at the start i went up for a month after the birth i have only shrunk back down gradually and only worn the expensive ones i bought at weeks for about weeks in total i didn't like dorothy perkins someone bought me some trousers that were a lovely fabric for winter but the extension buttons were not nearly enough they only lasted about weeks in total next time i will do the going up a size first i thought this was a waste of time as i didn't think they would last long but i didn't account for the fact that months later they were perfect on the way down so i got seasons out of them rather than the one that i expected i would look at nct sales for some so that i had plenty in my wardrobe and then just buy a couple of really nice pieces to complement them everyone seems to find some things that suit them and others don't depending on the shape of your bump and how it develops you can buy and sell back at minimal cost and see what suits you as you grow you will find a lot that have hardly been worn just because the pruchaser grew and didn't get the sizing right staying the same size all the way through definately didn't work at the end Brassiere Mattress Skirt and dress Breastfeeding Upholstery Microeconomics Suit (clothes) Shirt Equine conformation Kimono Textile manufacturing Poker jargon 2000 Australian Grand Prix Sari Strap-on dildo Social aspects of clothing Aerial (dance move) Trousers Puberty Dairy EastEnders Solar cell Supply and demand Little Britain Breast Social rule Tire Corset Swimsuit Clothing Overall Shaggy dog story The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Mary Phelps Jacob Hash table Elvis Presley Extreme Programming Diving suit Mutual fund Violin A-ha Capercaillie Customs and etiquette of Japan Tesco Caprice Bourret UK Singles Chart Beatles for Sale Hey Jude Investigation into the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 History of corsets Humphrey Bogart Menstrual cup Zipper Law of value R.
