should i call cps my brother in law and his girlfriend have an month old baby girl cps took her away b c she got skull fractures no one is sure how my brother in law is a convict with a known temper for the past months the baby has been in foster care no one in the family wanted take her long story that makes me mad but the state gave her back her parents i have since gone to visit the baby and the mother feeds her macaroni cheese that she blends in a sauce as well as pieces of cheeseburgers also the parents got in a big fight and broke their only source of communication a cell i dont understand how or why they got the poor baby back but should i call cps i'm only but if this baby is in danger im willing take custody of her and have my parents help out i live with them how is it possible that they got the child back and what actions can i take i have the feeling im not hearing the whole story also the grandparents from both sides didn't want take her no one did so she ended up in foster care heartless i know i'm wondering if this may be why they got her back i don't agree that an month old child should only eat such un nutritious foods sure she could be capable of it but they should try feeding her gerber or fruits something healthier junk food isn't good for anyone at any age especially an infant who is developing as far as the food im worried about them being uneducated about what to feed her because this is all they feed her the father has a violent history which is why he is a convict he broke the phone in a fit of rage i'm worried he will hit the baby again it sounds like the parents are uneducated a major problem in today's society some babies will not eat gerber after they have a taste of regular food nutrition is key but not a reason to call cps keep your eyes peeled watch for signs of abuse or neglect then call without a home of your own cps will not allow you to foster a child though your intentions are good and you'd probably do a better job the laws in all states are firm your parents on the other hand can petition to take the baby they would have gotten her back if the results after many home visits were unfounded the parents along with the first one took some form of a parenting course in my experience without due cause a child will be returned this is one reason i got out of the field good luck to you and keep your eyes peeled for abuse or neglect Kodocha Breastfeeding Child abuse EastEnders Fathers' rights Adoption Terri Schiavo Knots Landing Hamster McDonald's Sharon Tate Roy Meadow Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Domestic rabbit Infant Hamburger Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sudden infant death syndrome Vegetarianism Yusuf al-Qaradawi Shaggy dog story Feral child About a Boy Education The Shining (film) Pitaten Social rule Eating Potato Humphrey Bogart Apple Milk World Communist Movement Nutrition Androgen insensitivity syndrome Family Transsexuality Theory of conduct Hall & Oates The Catcher in the Rye Unemployment YuYu Hakusho Domestic violence Pizza Folic acid Good Times Divorce Cephalic disorder Jam (TV series) The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Abortion in the United States Egg (food) Daredevil Sant Thakar Singh Sin City Charmed Jon Secada Foster care Rape Pet skunk Emperor Xuan of Han Trainspotting (novel) One Tree Hill (TV series) Ron and Fez Bread Veganism Poker jargon One Piece minor characters Anorexia nervosa Sesame Street Singlish Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma FoxTrot Child sexuality MRE Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Generation Y John Peel Tocopherol Tofu Baby Blues Surveillance Donovan Guinea pig Science Something Positive 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Insulin Banana The O.C.
