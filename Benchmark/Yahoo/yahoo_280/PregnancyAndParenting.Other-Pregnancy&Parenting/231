why do some couples try so hard to have kids i don't get it why do you have to try why don't you just make love with each other and if it happens it happens if it doesn't it doesn't why are some people so determined to give birth if you keep having sex and you don't end up with a baby then so be it you can always adopt a baby or child as far as i know there is no shortage of orphans in the world and never has been or are these people so egotistical that they must continue their dna maybe some feel empty or unaccomplished if they dont procreate i dont know but there are alot that seem to try to hard i think sometimes that when someone cant maybe they should think about why that is i remember when i was i was told i couldnt have children i was sad but i accepted it years later well now i sit here writing with a th child growing inside of me none of my children were tried for or helped they were all just pleasant surprises of which were added to my house by marriage but they are my children in my eyes they are not my dna they are my husbands we may be a blended family but we all have the same last name in this house tech this is my rd child by birth if its such a big deal for some to have children they maybe they should look into adoption first over fertility methods and i do mean adoption within their own country not like these movie stars that think they look like saints for adopting a child from china or some other third world country since they are now adding another person to the national debt here in america taking a wonderful loving home from a child that needed it here in their own country that child will now remain parentless possibly in a foster home all their lives due to a selfish choice someone else made thinking it was more beneficial looks better for them to get a child elsewhere sorry for the ranting on that end there have a wonderful day good question Adoption Kodocha Sant Thakar Singh Marriage Abortion debate Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Friends Jennifer Lopez Angelina Jolie EastEnders Pitaten Theory of conduct Survivor (novel) Polyamory John the Baptist Sex-selective abortion and infanticide Humphrey Bogart Melanie Wilkes Transactional analysis Same-sex marriage The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Infantilism Socrates Incarnations of Immortality Extreme Programming Time Out of Mind Fecal incontinence Coming of Age (TNG episode) Piccolo Junior Saga Social rule Cliff Richard History of British nationality law Fiddler on the Roof 2004 Republican National Convention Current teachings of Prem Rawat Jon Secada Transsexuality Scientology beliefs and practices British nationality law Order of succession Family name Surveillance Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Justification (theology) Evil Blonde on Blonde Laura Schlessinger Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Religion and sexuality Hollyoaks Rich Mullins Aladdin (1992 film) Polygamy Simone Weil Avenue Q Care Bears Juliana of the Netherlands The McGuire Sisters Emma Hale Smith Mnemonic Moral Politics Korean adoptee Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Frankie Laine Eugenics John Howard Yoder Meaning of life Overpopulation Love and Theft The Ashlee Simpson Show Breastfeeding Theodicy Diving The Big Goodbye (TNG episode) Pet skunk The Shining (film) Knots Landing Grace Cossington Smith What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?
