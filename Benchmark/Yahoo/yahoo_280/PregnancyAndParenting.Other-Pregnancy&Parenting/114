is it selfish to go back to work help after staying home months while pregnant and now years with my daughter i just really want to go back to work however i feel like i am being selfish and i should stay another year home well what do you think i am currently a stay at home dad i left my job seven months ago when my daughter was born about a month ago i decided to look into the possibility of going back to work for about a week i could not even look my daughter in the eye i had this tremendous feeling of guilt after talking to some people i came to realize that perhaps it was best to put her in daycare she would socialize with other kids and perhaps crawl and walk faster becasue babies learn from other babies so if she sees other kids doing it she wants to as well the longer you stay at home the longer your daughter will become attached to you going back to work will also make the time you do have together extra special i know my wife loves her one on one time where as i take my time with our daughter for granted becasue i am with her all day the reality is that by you going back to work you are giving your daugher a better life regardless of the amount of money your spouse makes two incomes is always better than one depending on your financial situation perhaps you should consider going back part time give yourself some time to get used to the fact you are leaving your daughter with someone else part of the day slowly build up to full time a lot of companies out there are extremely flexible with schedules i know some mothers at my wifes company work part of the day in the office and part of the day at home some also work three days a week at home and two days in the office you really have a lot of options if you would like some flexibility in your schedule Friends Days of our Lives Charmed Everwood About a Boy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Kodocha Laura Schlessinger Knots Landing Divorce Scenes from a Memory Hollyoaks Random Harvest The Shining (film) Phoebe Halliwell Kurt Cobain Abortion debate Avenue Q Grief Episodes of Lost (Season 1) John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Pregnancy Alois Hitler Rosa Parks Breaststroke Sant Thakar Singh 401(k) Social Security (United States) Mina Mongoose Breastfeeding Boston Public Michael Garibaldi United Kingdom corporation tax Paige Matthews Shaggy dog story The O.C.
