how much do parents spend on child daycare per month i've been hearing that it costs over a thousand dollars little old me only thought it would be like a hundred per month i really need to get my butt back into college if that's true if i ever want to have a kid and if it does cost that much then should i open up a daycare i think it would be a fun job do you know where i should begin or do you have any advice comments please educate me it depends on the age of the child the older they get the less it cost typically for an infant it cost about dollars a week the price goes down with each stage my son is now in grade school before and after care can still cost as much as a week it just depends i have him in a school program and its only a week but over the summer it was a week kids are expensive yes go back to college it cost a lot to raise kids not just the daycare but when they are infants all the things they need diapers and formula its really really expensive and then when they go to school all the money on school supplies and clothes it is an hefty life time commitment well worth it though as far as opening your own daycare there is a lot of commitment there too you have to be very reliable for the parents you can't decide i don't feel like working today because the parents depend on you there is a lot of cost for overhead and from parents who don't pay or are slow to pay lots to think about but i would definitely go back to college and get a degree first Day care Inflation Laura Schlessinger Education in the United States Education in Germany Kindergarten Microeconomics Infantilism Education in the People's Republic of China Adoption The Apprentice 2 Insurance Social rule Breastfeeding Child Student loan Divorce Diaper Wal-Mart Child support Parenting Culture of the United States Supply and demand About a Boy Education in France Economic inequality Social Security (United States) No Child Left Behind Act Education in England Capitalism Tariff Infant Childcare Philosophical skepticism Tax Personal finance Arguments for and against drug prohibition Education in Australia School choice Education in Japan Efficiency wages National Kidney Foundation Singapore Opportunity cost Broadband Internet access Pitaten Software patent debate U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution Illegal drug trade Tuition Economy of Russia The Catcher in the Rye MMORPG Education in Romania Canadian and American health care systems compared Kimberly-Clark Corporation $ale of the Century Androgen insensitivity syndrome High school Aerial (dance move) Hydrogen economy Abortion debate Economy of the United States Outsourcing Early childhood education Capital accumulation Childbirth Audiophile Emperor Xuan of Han Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Credit card Freeters Warren Buffett Mutual fund Cost accounting Growth hormone treatment Unemployment Advance fee fraud One Tree Hill (TV series) EastEnders Elimination communication Labor theory of value AIDS in Africa Ra (board game) The Amazing Race Saved by the Bell United States dollar Emperor Yuan of Han Centrelink Pregnancy Yield curve Arbitrage Labour economics Paul Martin Limp Bizkit Just In Time
