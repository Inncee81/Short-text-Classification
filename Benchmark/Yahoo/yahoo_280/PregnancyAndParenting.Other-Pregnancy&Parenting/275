mini pill and breastfeeding i had my baby six weeks ago and just got prescribed the mini pill i started my cycle again though i am breastfeeding is it safe to start the mini pill mid period i don't know if i'll even have another one according to the doctor i haven't started the pill yet besides i know some women have a period even while on the mini pill w the mini pill you start it the same way you do regular pills you start taking them the sunday after you start ex you started your period today fri you would start taking them on sunday you start your period next tues aug you wouldnt start taking them until sun aug if you start your period on a sun then you start the pill that same day the mini pill is very sensitive you have to take it everyday at the same time or you can get preg i would still use a condom while using the mini pill it's really pointless to take if you ask me b c instead of there being estrogen and progesterone there is only progesterone the estrogen dries up your milk just remember to take it everyday at the same time if you are unsure if you will have another period or not it is ok to start taking it mid cycle sundays are easiest to start on though since that is when the week starts Oral contraceptive Emergency contraception Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Breastfeeding Progesterone only pill Birth control Progesterone Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Hormone replacement therapy Breast cancer Pregnancy Estrus cycle Urinary incontinence Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Migraine Morning sickness Breast Childbirth Fecal incontinence Prolactinoma Intrauterine device Baldness treatments Psoriasis Vitamin D Endometriosis Depo Provera Nipple Estrogen Embryo transfer Julian day Ovarian cyst Ovulation Prolactin RISC Ectopic pregnancy Antidepressant Hebrew calendar Obstetrics Mammary gland Polycystic ovary syndrome Hyperprolactinaemia Folic acid Hormone Computus Nutrition Alanis Morissette Androgen insensitivity syndrome Full moon cycle Testosterone Puberty HIV Calendar Year Tocopherol Premenstrual stress syndrome National Football League Sleep Androgen Anabolic steroid Menstrual cup Swyer syndrome Sunspot Frankie Laine Osteoporosis Carl Djerassi Neighbours Lactose intolerance Mid-Autumn Festival Dominical letter Sunday Sexual revolution Gregorian calendar Breast milk Sexual abstinence Brassiere BBC Radio 4 Leeds United F.C.
