why does everyone name their kids the same thing i know people are also obsessed with giving original names if i was going to have a kid i'd check the list of the top baby names of the past year and not use them i've noticed everyone naming their kids grace lilly etc there is going to be classrooms full of kids with the same name like about years ago when there was hunters or when i was kid with jennifers but on the other hand there is some bizzare names people are using now ok the first two answers don't you wonder if the rest of your lives people are going to say your name is marissa and she'll have to be like no or the other one it looks like mila sounds like vanilla except just with a m lacy d exactly what i'm talking about it i can't even say your kids names i hope you know they are going to be coming home in tears while i appreciate the efforts of some parents to create unique and special names for their children i always think back to the first day of school the teacher is trying to take roll call they have to try and pronounce these names that is what is going to happen to their children for the rest of their lives correcting spelling and pronunciation of their names for a lifetime seems sometimes more bothersome than special and unique my kids have somewhat common names on the popularity scale kind of about halfway down the top list Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Jon Secada Current teachings of Prem Rawat Hangul Episodes of Lost (Season 1) AFI 100 Years series International Phonetic Alphabet That '70s Show Scenes from a Memory Kodocha Teachers (film) Jennifer Lopez Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Hiberno-English The O.C.
