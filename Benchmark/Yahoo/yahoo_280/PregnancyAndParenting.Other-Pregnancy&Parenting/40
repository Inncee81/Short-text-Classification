parents how would you feel about this ok this happened a couple of years ago but i was just wondering what you all thought about this my cousin married a woman that had children one lives with them the other with his dad my cousin has child from a previous relationship and they now have one together a blended family anyways his wifes son the one who lives with his dad started calling my cousin dad well his dad found out and got mad and said something about it to my cousin my cousin said listen together we have children all of the others call me dad i love your son and i don't want him to feel left out by having him call me by my name instead of dad what difference does it make if your son loves one more person and one more person that loves him it will just give him one more person to rely on and look up to the other guy agreed and said that he was sorry for getting all upset he saw my cousins point of view how would you of reacted in this situation my cousin really does love him he use to help with his homework but now he is so smart that no one understands it anymore and he doesn't need help anyways he is now and my cousin is teaching him how to drive a stick and lets him drive his car takes him places and goes to his school stuff just like any other parent it would be painful at first to have my daughter call another woman mom but if the woman has my daughter's interests in mind and loves her too i really can't complain Friends Grandview, U.S.A.
