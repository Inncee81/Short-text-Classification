inducing what do you think okay well i am weeks now my fiance is a truck driver so he's only home once maybe twice a week if we're lucky yes its hard we moved to a diff state right before we found out we were pregnant again i have a month old daughter so i don't know anyone i have no friends and no family here so i am here alone with my daughter my concern is if i go into labor i have no one to care for my daughter unless i plan it ahead of time that and no one to take me to the hospial if i go now i would have to search for someone to watch my daughter and drive myself to the hospital that cant happen so i'm hoping to be able to make arrangements and take my daughter to daycare and go in with my fiance so i was going to talk with my dr on tues about inducing what do you think is this a good enough reason in the beginning he brought it up and said he wont induce until weeks after my due date but this is a serious matter to me any experiences i was induced with my st so i know what to expect shes my daughter not my sibling i'd say go ahead and speak with your doc about it it sounds like a legitimate reason for induction to me and your baby should be healthy because of how far along you are right now i don't blame you for wanting to plan this out since you have limited resources and a limited time frame with your husband good luck and congrats on your new little one Abortion debate Friends One Life to Live Pregnancy Days of our Lives Knots Landing Abortion Day care Baby Blues Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Back to the Future Poker jargon Jean Grey Social rule Back to the Future timeline Humphrey Bogart Childbirth Good Times Health insurance Luck Car handling Time travel Terri Schiavo Infantilism Theory of conduct Unemployment History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Romulus and Remus Pitaten Characters of Lost Spice Girls Mojave people Abortion in the United States Breastfeeding Neighbours 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Prostate cancer Charmed Ron and Fez Megan Griffin Obstetrics The Lovely Bones Sant Thakar Singh AFI 100 Years series Rais massacre Jon Secada Rod Stewart Another World (TV series) Laci Peterson Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Melanie Wilkes Anne Murray Hollyoaks Luke and Laura Spencer Cindy Sheehan The Shining (film) Ty Cobb John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Bob and George RuneScape quests Bringing It All Back Home Street-Legal Marie Antoinette Laura Schlessinger Zone of the Enders: The Fist of Mars Shaggy dog story Avenue Q Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Reservoir Dogs Daylight saving time She Loves You Guiding Light First Battle of the Atlantic The Emancipation of Mimi Mail-order bride Estoppel Joni Mitchell 2004 Republican National Convention R.E.M.
