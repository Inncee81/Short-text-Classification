long story what do you think am i preg i think that i may be pregnant but i am not sure yet let me tell you my story ok so i had my last period on june th i am on a day cycle and wasnt expecting my period until aug st on july th around the time i was ovulating i had sex with my b f and we used a condom it had spermaside on it but when we finished we couldnt find the condom after looking around for min we gave up well about an hour later i went to the bathroom and pulled the condom out from inside me it was empty so i assume that the sperm was inside me well on the of july i had some light brown spotting the next full day i had the same thing but then on the th i started what i thought was my period well it was a bit lighter than my normal period and it only lasted days then went back to two more days of spotting do you think i could be pregnant i never spot between periods and i usually have a really heavy one but this wasnt like that and i have been having a constant ache in my lower back i have felt a bit sick on and off have been having some breast tenderness also i took a first response hpt yesterday and it was negative but i didn t take it in the morning so my hcg levels were probably very low i took one again this morning and it was also negative do you think that i am not prego or should i wait and test again if i am pregnant then i would be about weeks along thanks girl i feel your pain i found this on the internet hope it helps many women experience spotting at some point during their cycle be in after the major bleeding period in the middle or days before their period is due there are times when it's perfectly normal to spot and there are times when spotting is an indication of something wrong be it minor or major first let's define spotting spotting is when a bit of blood is passed through the vagina normally it doesn't reach the underwear but rather is swiped with toilet paper after a bowel movement or urination the blood can be pink tinged mucus rusty brown or bright red spotting can be a one time occurrence or it can last for several hours or even several days spotting does not define the first day of menstruation the first day of menstruation should always be the first day of actual bleeding normal spotting normal spotting is what may occur at the very end of your bleeding days a day or two of spotting after to days of bleeding is normal and just the end of the bleeding period spotting that occurs in the middle of your cycle or spotting that occurs some ten to fourteen days prior to the start of the next cycle is normal too this spotting may occur during ovulation seeing a spot of blood during ovulation is considered an excellent fertility sign it is thought that mid cycle spotting occurs for one of two reasons first reason is possibly that when the egg bursts through the follicle a little bleeding may occur this blood will then make its way out and show up as spotting or during ovulation the level of estrogens rise and this sometimes prompts the uterus to shed a bit of lining which shows up in the form of spotting spotting that occurs about a week before the cycle is due and only lasts for less than one day is possibly considered implantation spotting this happens as a result of the fertilized egg burrowing into the uterine lining or another reason for seeing implantation spotting may be due to a slight rise in estrogen and drop in progesterone before the corpus luteum takes over the production of progesterone the corpus luteum takes over the production when the implanted fertilized egg signals the body that pregnancy has occurred and that the lining must be maintained keep in mind that spotting that continues for days is not implantation spotting abnormal spotting abnormal spotting shows up at times other than the above mentioned times abnormal spotting lasts for days it's abnormal to spot days before your menstrual cycle is due the causes of abnormal spotting vary one common cause of spotting several days before the menstrual cycle is due is low progesterone it's the hormone progesterone that helps to maintain the uterine lining for pregnancy and when progesterone level drops the menstrual cycle occurs in women who are deficient in progesterone they will see spotting several days to a week before their cycle is due this can also cause minor infertility and early miscarriag another reason spotting may occur could be uterine fibroids which are fairly harmless but need to be kept an eye on endometriosis birth control pills are a few other reasons spotting may occur the most harmful reasons for spotting are possible sexually transmitted diseases and some cancers it is advisable if you have re curring spotting each month to have your healthcare provider to exam you just to rule out possible harmful reasons for it and to help you to deal with and or cure the reasons behind the spotting Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Gynaecology Lipoid congenital adrenal
