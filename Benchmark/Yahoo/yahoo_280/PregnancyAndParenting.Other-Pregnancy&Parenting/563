my girlfriend is pregnant we have been together for months i'm and she is i'm figuring out how to deal with this scenario i know i will be a great dad my question is if the time is now luckily we have support frm our families i'm afraid this will make us separate because i don't feel it's my time for having a baby congratulations edu i imagine a lot of men feel this way even if they had planned to have a family since they have no control short of preventing it of the whole process of conception and pregnancy it all happens in your woman's body according to her body's unconscious rhythm but don't worry just like falling in love having a child is all about letting go of control you're mature your career is established or at least on its way and you're not on your own a miracle has happened to you and your life is changing just like a butterfly growing out its chrysalis you and your girl are changing growing and developing and you need to go with the flow pick out names wite a journal take photos dream imagine and wonder parenthood is not something you do like all the other strivings in your life it's something that happens to you and later there will be many many opportunities for you to play a very active role in your child's life Cliff Richard Pregnancy Jon Secada Abortion debate Menstrual cycle Transsexuality Incarnations of Immortality Child sexuality Birth control Breastfeeding Carl Jung Sharon Tate Knots Landing Milton H.
