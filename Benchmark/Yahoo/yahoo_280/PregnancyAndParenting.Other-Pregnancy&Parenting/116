severe seperation anxiety help my yr old son and i are very close i nanny and he attends work with me everyday and has recently started sleeping in my bed he refuses to sleep unless i lay with him although we move him back into his bed if we can manage to stay awake while trying to get him to sleep he will remain asleep there until am or so i basically do not spend a single moment of my day wihtout him by my side often i have no choice he is getting to the point to where he tells me no when i i have to use the restroom and will sometimes try to push me off the toilet or make me hold him while i am on the toilet punishement is doled out for the former offence i am not sure what to do i have tried ferberizing i have tried no cry solutions my poor dear will scream until he shakes violently and uncontrolably it scares me and i am not a mother who scares or gives in easily i am pregnant with my second and need to do something now before the next one arrives thank you for all your help my goodness you do need help no one can live like you are living you need alone time to recharge your mommy batteries during the daytime when you need to be apart from your little one if it's for just a minute or a few hours the logic is the same he is screaming and crying because he knows mama will give him what he wants when you need to use the restroom set him down and say mommy will be right back in one minute then simply walk away if he screams and cries and tries to hold on to you ignore him he will learn that these actions will not be rewarded then when you return reward him for his independence give him a warning say if you don't let go of mommy and let me do the dishes use the bathroom etc then you will sit on time out for minutes then let him decide same basic principal for nighttime it is plain and simple don't give in if you give lots of hugs and kisses and then place him in bed and then ignore him for the rest of the night i promise he will not cry for hours he will probably cry until he realises that he's not getting what he wants and then he'll go to sleep then if you reward him in the morning for sleeping independently he will learn how to please mommy which of course is what every child wants you sound like a wonderful mom and i'm sure he's a wonderful child if you follow my advice carefully i promise that before long you will have moved past this separation anxiety and insecurity and on to the next thing as parents we always seem to move right from one thing to the next Urinary incontinence Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story The Shining (film) EastEnders Dog training Milton H.
