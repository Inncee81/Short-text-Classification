playstation vs xbox pick one and tell me why i should choose that system both systems have pros and cons but i prefer the ps to start with it has the ability to output video in p format the highest definition currently available using a hdmi port in the back while it also supports component composite and s video outputs this gives the ps much higher capabilities for great graphics another great reason to get a ps is that it uses blu ray discs as opposed to the which uses normal dvds not only does this allow you to watch hi def blu ray movies but it allows ps games to be both higher definition and longer this is because dvds can only hold up to gigabytes while blu ray can hold up to gigabytes and hd dvd blu ray's rival can hold up to gigabytes despite what some people say the cannot play hd dvds without a special add on costing about the ps can play blu ray right out of the box the ps also uses the cell processor it has seven cores where as most high end pcs have only this allows for more onscreen objects motions characters and animations other features include tilt sensitive controller built in web browser free online gaming service built in hard drive on all models and support for bluetooth headsets keyboards and mice overall the ps hardware goes far beyond the capabilities of the the is currently the leader in the games department but with a few great games already out for the ps such as resistance and motorstorm and many more on the way such as lair warhawk and metal gear solid the ps is by far the best choice PlayStation 3 PlayStation 2 Xbox Xbox 360 Sega Dreamcast Nintendo GameCube PlayStation Portable Mouse (computing) DVD Blu-ray Disc Laserdisc Atari ST High-definition television Computer and video games Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Amstrad CPC Bluetooth Mac OS X Sega Saturn Video game music Super Nintendo Entertainment System QuickTime Windows 2000 Computer IBM PC compatible History of computer and video games Personal computer Handheld game console Television Atari 8-bit family Windows XP Game controller TiVo Apple II family AmigaOS IMac USB flash drive Sound Blaster Windows Vista IPod PC Engine Commodore 64 Sega Hard disk Enterprise content management TurboGrafx 16 Amiga Microsoft Console wars Apple IIGS Modchip 64-bit Radeon X Window System Apple Computer ZX Spectrum Game programming Game programmer Mac OS X v10.4 Nintendo DS Resident Evil (video game) Pump It Up Counter-Strike Gmail Desktop computer SCART Console game Computer and video game genres Final Fantasy XI History of Microsoft Windows RISC Apple Macintosh The Sims 2 Digital rights management Game Boy PowerBook Universal Serial Bus Nintendo Entertainment System Screenshot Grand Theft Auto III H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Unicode GeForce 6 Series Intellivision Pinball NVIDIA Sprite (computer graphics) Copy protection IBM Personal System/2 Secure Digital card Def Leppard IBM PC
