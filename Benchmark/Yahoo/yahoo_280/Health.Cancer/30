if somebody came up with a cure for cancer couldnt they put a patent on the cure and sell it for billions of dollars to big companys like blue cross blue sheid that would not be illegal would it i do not belive they would be breaking any laws would they how many millions of dollars has been invested into finding a cure for cancer and still no cure i find that hard to belive i smell a conspiracy yes they could patent it and sell it for billions however the patent would only be valid with the us other subscribing countries so it is likely offshore clinics would be started the medical brass is there to make money it will be costly everywhere because its an inelastic market use or die keep in mind that cancer is just an umbrella term for any overly divisive cell we are not talking about one disease we are talking about thousands if not more billions have probably been invested i'm betting you've never been involved in research there is a reason why we don't live forever and have flying cars the stuff takes time for example doing a protein assay to find mutated surface protiens using electrophoresis in my old lab took anywhere between and hours we could determine the concentration of like two or three protiens before we had to run a new gel now consider that applied to dna which took like a decade or two to just map let alone comprehend and all the protien derivatives there are faster methods but most labs can't afford them we just aren't smart enough research is freaking tough slow and expensive there is no conspiracy if there were a cure for all cancers it would be on the market it might be selling at a million bucks a pop but it would be there nonetheless basically get off your anti corporate high horses and face the facts don't be ungrateful the people researching are breaking their backs why don't you go work in a cancer research lab there is no conspiracy nature had billion years to obfuscate the problems we have had less than fifty years to get the untangled Cancer Polymerase chain reaction Prostate cancer Microeconomics Illegal drug trade Insurance Pharmaceutical company W.
