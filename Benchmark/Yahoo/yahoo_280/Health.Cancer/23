could this be cancer i am a year old female and about months ago i noticed that i had a knot junt uner the skin not visible to the eye that was in the middle of my lower abdomen it dose not cause me any pain but i noticed that it has gotten bigger i thought that if i would leave it alone that it would go away but it seems to have grown it is about the size of a fifty cent piece now do you think that this could be something serious should i visit my doctor and possibly have an x ray and labs or do you think that it will eventually go away thank you for all your help no one can really answer what this is but keep this solidly in mind my healthy athletic year old asked me one day what this small lump was he could feel in his abdomen i said i didn't know and we ignored it exactly one month after that conversation he was diagnosed with high grade and advanced stage iv abdominal desmoplastic sarcoma by the time we got around to investigating this the tumor was the size of a volley ball had grown its own blood supply and had seeded literally hundreds of malignant cells into the abdominal cavity was on the liver in the spleen in the chest wall spots on lungs large and small intestines lymphs nodes and had caked both diaphragms we weren't even sure he would survive the first month fortunately he had signficant response from high dose chemotherapy p protocol and has done much better than most but he is still at high risk my advice see a doctor immediately and be persistent healthy young people do not look like they have cancer so general practitioners routinely dismiss their concerns our pediatrician was absolutely horrified that he had missed what is now so obvious i don't think i've ever seen a doctor so upset within the span of a sports physical in december and the first of march my sons cancer grew quickly and aggressively and metastasized throughout the body don't wait any longer to have this checked it is better to be wrong and have it turn out to be nothing than it is to wait to see if it goes away and than deal with advanced cancer my son is now years old has had three major surgeries and extensive chemotherapy he had over a hundred plus various sized tumors and he is now down to an inoperable cm pelvic tumor currently he is asymptomic can do anything any other young person can do and is living with his cancer Lung cancer Soft tissue sarcoma Colorectal cancer Testicular cancer Malignant melanoma Endometrial cancer Hodgkin's lymphoma Radiation therapy Esophageal cancer Chemotherapy Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Renal cell carcinoma Cervical cancer Folic acid Medicine Acute lymphoblastic leukemia Gastrointestinal stromal tumor Leukemia Brain tumor Thyroid cancer Oncology Chronic fatigue syndrome Osteosarcoma Wilms' tumor Androgen insensitivity syndrome Cancer of the larynx Cirrhosis Endometriosis Hypoglycemia Cryptorchidism Autonomic nervous system Pneumonia Acupuncture Breastfeeding Tuberculosis Breast Obstetrics Babe Ruth Aortic dissection Tobacco smoking Hernia Multiple myeloma Vomiting Tocopherol Abdominal pain Multiple sclerosis Group A streptococcal infection Urinary incontinence Vitamin C Organ transplant Cannabis (drug) X-ray Darryl Strawberry Spider Growth hormone treatment Equine conformation Penile cancer Gynaecology Traumatic brain injury Intersex surgery Atherosclerosis Diarrhea Puberty Stem cell Carcinogenesis Krukenberg tumor Nutrition Apoptosis Schistosomiasis AIDS reappraisal Tasmanian Devil Human anatomy Radiosurgery History of anatomy in the 17th and 18th centuries Hyperthermia Ionizing radiation Diabetes mellitus Obesity Peritoneum Experimental cancer treatment Kidney Intravenous therapy Fancy rat
