what is up with the mona lisa today i was exsaming the mona lisa portriat i was browsing the net on who she might be my theory is that she is leonardo de vinci s grandmother her name was monna lucia i belive that he drew her to where she looked younger any other theory s the theory that its leo himself is not too hard to imagine although it is all speculative leo could have easily been a transvestite and the mona lisa both a tribute to his granny and a self portrait signalling his trans nature but in the not so revealing form of communication of painting it can also be considered for other reasons leo may have been just posing as a woman in the tradition of theatre actors at the time who were mostly men even when female roles came up they were usually performed by men dressed as women all this stuff about it being a portrait of lisa gherardini wife of a famous florentine merchant is not at all in contradiction with the theory that it is also a self portrait any one who has studied art or is an artist knows that one art work can be many things at the same time yes you could be painting your best freind and also be portraying yourself at the same time Mona Lisa Leonardo da Vinci The Da Vinci Code Raphael Renaissance Portrait Mona Lisa Smile Paint The Scream Sandro Botticelli Drawing Appropriation (art) The Last Supper (Leonardo) Andrea Mantegna Diego Vel__zquez Raphael Rooms Actor Drag queen Looney Tunes: Back In Action Artemisia Gentileschi Niccol__ Machiavelli Louvre Italian Renaissance Transvestism Girl Pontormo Cross-dressing Leonardo DiCaprio Michelangelo Salvador Dal__ Images of Jesus Amedeo Modigliani Hans Holbein the Younger Archibald Prize Art forgery Michael Caine Frans Hals Rembrandt Painting Art theft L.
