are you a painter who works from a planned idea or do you work intuitively allowing the painting to emerge and develope as you are working on it making discoveries along the way have you tried both if so which works best for you and why by planned idea i mean by using an already drawn out plan as in a drawing or having a system by which you already have down and work by planned idea i also mean from a very conceptual approach here is what has worked for me for years now because i would quickly get bored doing paintings in the same style over and over again and because i hate waiting for paint to dry on specific paintings i usually start work on at least two and most often three paintings at the same time the first painting will be one that i have already conceived in my head and pretty much know before hand what it will look like this is usually a figurative realistic painting the up side to doing a painting that i already know what it will look like is that i am almost always pleased with the finished work the down side to such paintings are that there aren't any fun or inspired 'surprises' in doing these the second painting and often the third too will be something i've been wanting to try to play around with and only have a vague idea of what i will be doing with it these works are always fun to do because i like the sudden surprises they sometimes offer and i allow for sudden changes of direction or content tone the down side to the vague idea paintings is that every once in a while the painting ends up looking like crap and ends up getting painted over the third painting will be one that comes purely from the sub conscience meaning i simply start working on it without any idea what it's going to be what it's going to look like i call the ones i paint in this style my 'sub symbolism' paintings because they really are works that come from somewhere just below the surface that come from the sub conscience funny thing is quite often i'm more amazed by and end up liking more these paintings than the ones that have been pre planned from the beginning Drawing Craps Mathematics Philosophy of language Jacques-Louis David Ontological argument Milton H.
