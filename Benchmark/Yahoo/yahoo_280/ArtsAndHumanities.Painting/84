mixing paint colors what color do you get when you mix gold with green it depends and differs slightly if you are using acrylic paints or oil colors but all in all this is especially the case in oils because gold as well as silver and bronze does not usually mix well with most earthy pigments the result will be the almost total loss of luster and shine coming from the gold and the mixture turning into a murky kind of brown if you must go for this use the lightest green possible and the brightest gold possible and of course use acrylics the reason behind this phenomena is that the pigments in both colors are not really compatible since the golds are usually made out of fully synthetic materials while the greens are more natural this incompatibility leads to a disruption of light absorption in the final mixed color making it murky and uneven Paint Color Pigment Color theory Ultramarine CMYK color model Acrylic paint Plastic Primary color Eye color Petroleum Material properties of diamond Gesso Garnet Pastel Diamond cut Silver Diamond simulant Paper marbling Georges-Pierre Seurat Bong Blue Tempera Turquoise Alkane Stucco Human skin color Watercolor painting Polymethyl methacrylate Diamond Fast bowling E85 Explosive material Iris (anatomy) Hair color Diamond enhancement Cat coat genetics Light-emitting diode Sun Textile manufacturing terminology Tofu Pointillism Melanin Gasoline Food coloring United States dollar Drawing Color vision Yu-Gi-Oh!
