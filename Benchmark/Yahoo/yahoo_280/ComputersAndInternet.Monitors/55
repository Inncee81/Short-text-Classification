power off monitor when my computer is totally shut down do i still need to power off my monitor manually or can i leave it power on so it will go off anyways without a sync i have been wondering this for years it depends on how old the monitor is if the power light on the monitor goes off or changes color when you shut down the computer you're ok the monitor is powering almost everything down itself and only stays awake enough to sense the computer coming back on if the power light stays green it's an old dumb monitor and you should turn it off with the computer Liquid crystal display Embedded system Personal computer Color Gamut Thermal power station Traffic light CMYK color model Computer display Original Amiga chipset Canon T90 Cathode ray tube Escape from New York RGB color model IMac Stereoscopy Apollo Guidance Computer Server The Arsenal of Freedom (TNG episode) Fire alarm control panel Color theory Hybrid Synergy Drive Desktop computer Toyota Prius Mercury Atlas 6 Floppy disk Television Pixel Daylight saving time Computer animation Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Blue screen of death Digital photography Commodore 64 KIM-1 Hybrid vehicle Cypher (The Matrix) Dumb & Dumber System/36 Composite video Commodore 128 Laptop Component video World War Three (Doctor Who) SCART The Ark in Space Nintendo GameCube Out-of-body experience DV Plasma display Nuclear reactor Raster graphics Computer case System/34 Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Color space Color Graphics Adapter Swingout Fischer Random Chess One (Voyager episode) HSV color space Extended display identification data Video game console Altair 8800 Ethernet Inferno (Doctor Who) Apollo 8 Computer and video games Digital camera Death Comes to Time STS-86 Knight Rider Rendering (computer graphics) Frame rate Mega Man & Bass Danger Hiptop Color temperature Lighting Furnace Mouse (computing) Tag 2001: A Space Odyssey Surveillance Commodore PET The Parting of the Ways Waveform monitor Computer forensics 2003 North America blackout Commodore International Warriors of the Deep Single certification Mainframe computer Sugar push TRS-80 Color Computer Computer graphics Universal Serial Bus ARPANET Starsiege: Tribes Elevator Atari ST
