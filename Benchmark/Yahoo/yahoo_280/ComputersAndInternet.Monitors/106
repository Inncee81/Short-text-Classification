x vs x is this change resolution like the change from x vs x i liked the change to x because the icons got smaller which i did not mind and i had more room to play around with it this the same from x to x does going from a ' with x res to a ' with x res really pay off in the end and look better well for one thing you will have that much more 'desktop space' to work with at that resolution and screen size you should be able to comfortable operate windows side by side much in the same benefit that using a dual screen setup would give you using x screens you have to be aware though higher resolution higher resource cost processing graphics etc the x is probably the native res of that monitor meaning running in lower resolutions to play video games will make them look slightly blurred which is why its best in that case to be sure your card can run the game in the higher res and my god it just looks better if your upgrading from a to a keep them both dual wide screen view the thought makes me salivate also if you find the icons get to small for your liking go to the display options and under the appearance tab there are some advance options you can use to increase or reduce the size of your default fonts and icons Windows XP Windows 2000 Laptop Apple Computer IBM PC compatible Atari 8-bit family Blue screen of death Floppy disk AmigaOS Digital photography Video Graphics Array Color Graphics Adapter Windows Vista History of Microsoft Windows Mouse (computing) RISC High-definition television Pixel PowerBook Blackjack System 7 (Macintosh) Apple typography PostScript Screenshot Radeon Microsoft Windows Natural Selection (computer game) IMac QuickDraw Apple IIGS Opera (web browser) Portable Document Format ATI Technologies Final Fantasy (video game) Xbox 360 Apple II family Game Boy Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Oscilloscope Amiga Atari ST X Window System TrueType Mac OS history Stereoscopy Palm OS Redundant array of independent disks Computer wallpaper Computer display Sinclair ZX81 System/36 Icon (computing) EIA-708 Advance Wars: Dual Strike IPod Handheld game console Amstrad CPC Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Console game Extreme Programming History of the graphical user interface Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Commodore 128 CPU design Windows Server 2003 Nintendo GameCube Typeface Nintendo 64 Commodore 64 Graphical Environment Manager Linux Window Maker Beatmania IIDX Policy Debate Neopets Game Boy Advance Cascading Style Sheets Apple Macintosh Public transport Final Fantasy In The Groove (game) PlayStation 2 Desktop computer Graphics card 3dfx Computer and video game industry Refresh rate Image file formats Windows Mobile Macintosh Finder
