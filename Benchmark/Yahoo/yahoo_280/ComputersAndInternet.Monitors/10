what have i done wrong hello guys thanks for reading this my computer room is getting decorated and so i moved all my computer stuff out disconnecting the things from the computer ie monitor keyboard mouse printer etc and carrying them to the room as i went along when i had carried everything back into my room i reassembled it admitted i have little experience hooking things to computers but i think i did it justice that is until i turned my monitor on and it complained of no signal i made sure all connections between monitor and computer were ok and secured in the wires but that made no difference i also tried a different plug when i take the cable out it recognises this and says cable not connected power is definitely going to the monitor though and it is plugged in my monitor is months old like my computer and is the aoc lm lcd monitor model help would be really appreciated computer's on no response from monitor i'm on windows xp sp thanks connor normally that is because the monitor is not plugged in properly check if it is well connected if it is well connected try another monitor if it does the same thing again the no signal message indicates that the monitor is working but the computer is not your monitor is not gettting a valid signal from your video card you have either knocked a component or connector loose or have moved a connector from where it should be possibly you have done both you need to consult the motherboard manual for your pc or download it from the motherboard manufacturers website if you haven't got it and check that all wires and connectors are correctly attached to the appropriate pins you then need to check that all expansion cards and cable connectors are firmly and securely pressed 'home' in their sockets good luck D-subminiature Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Commodore 64 SCART Personal computer Ethernet Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Computer bus Television Nintendo Entertainment System Advanced Technology Attachment Jack plug Desktop computer Digital Visual Interface Modem Windows XP Oscilloscope Enigma machine IMac S-Video Laptop Musical Instrument Digital Interface Atari 8-bit family DVD Motherboard BS 1363 USB flash drive Cheating in Counter-Strike ZX Spectrum Amiga Gender of connectors and fasteners Xbox Serial ATA XLR connector RCA connector ATX Sinclair ZX81 Sound card Serial port GSM services FireWire IPod PC motherboard Commodore 128 SCSI Coaxial cable Amstrad CPC ACCESS.bus Computer hardware TRS connector Gender DIN connector IBM PC compatible Windows 2000 Registered jack Burglar alarm Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Apple IIGS Wi-Fi 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Altair 8800 Computer surveillance System/36 Computer Adapter Internet Digital photography Overclocking Floppy disk Loudspeaker Computer forensics Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Xbox 360 Category 5 cable Apple II family BBC Micro Spyware Computer and video games IBM PC Parallel port Spark plug Microsoft Windows Computer display ATI Technologies MDAC Computer case
