nintendo roms and emulators i recently came across some websites where your able to download nes and snes roms and emulators this all seems way too good to be true since you can literally download every single nes or snes game on the pc for free it just seems like it wouldn't be legal or legitamate before i download any of these i'm just wondering if downloading these games is legal or what the deal is thanks wrong wrong wrong first of all the one thing that was correct is that the emulator itself is perfectly legal this is because an emulator is something that a person programmed to act like a system since it's created privately and not by the major gaming company the person who created it has every right to offer online for download the roms however are different you have privately made roms which are completely legal however for commercial roms ie anything that was once sold in a store the program is actually taken from the cartridge or disc itself and so originated from the gaming company because of this if you download a rom even for a game you own you are still acquiring information that you did not pay for the only exception would be if you were the one to rip the rom from your own copy which would then be illegal only if you distributed it as for outdated roms don't count on it the original super mario bros has been out for more than years and yet the mario trademark is still nintendo's admittedly it's unlikely that someone will come busting down your door just because you downloaded a more obscure game like burger time but the point is if someone does own the rights to it they legally would have the right to come after you also keep in mind that everything here is just what's legal and what's not it's kind of like driving ten miles over the speed limit it's not necessarily that they will go after you every single time but if for some reason they do you are technically in the wrong Nintendo ROM image Nintendo Entertainment System Console emulator Nintendo Revolution MAME Video game music Nintendo 64 Read-only memory Game Boy Advance History of computer and video games Nintendo DS Super Mario remake series Rare (video game company) Super Mario Bros.
