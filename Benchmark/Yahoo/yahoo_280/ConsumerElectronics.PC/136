my problem is that my game age of empires conq wont install it says empires not installed on my pc man when this program gives problems it really gives problems i'm not sure if i can help but i can give you a generic answer that may help with everything related to programs you have to have a lot of patience you may have to do this for hours on end until you get it you've also got to have a lot of optimism that you can succeed i've lost faith before not realizing that i already had the solution all along if it's already installed but not working uninstall it and re install sometimes it works read the box for hardware requirements if this is a new version of the program it may require a d graphics card and a kajillion gigabytes of ram if you have an older computer and even if you install a bunch of ram it may still not work because of the way your computer handles ram if you have xp but haven't updated your service packs or updated your operating system it may need that you can go to microsoft the the latest updates of course it may not help b google or yahoo the game title to see if anyone else is having the same problem if you have multiple drives and you installed it with dvd drive d but you're trying to play in cd drive e it won't work because it was installed in one drive and your computer will only allow you to play it on that drive only if you're trying to install a dvd on a cd drive it won't work the good news is dvd drives are cheap and easy to install don't buy the cheapest one and do research before you buy one pay attention to all error messages when you're attempting to play or install these sometimes give you the answer if it's not legal software it may not install because they have disabled your install software when you go online the software tries to get a required file from the manufacturer you have to register to get it if you bought an oem version you may have gotten ripped off or the manufacturer received your name from the oem dealer for a price they let you run the software up to a point of addiction and then they disable it so cruel there's more suggestions but i need sleep good luck you can do it Windows 2000 Windows XP Windows Server 2003 PlayStation 2 Microsoft Windows AmigaOS Spyware Apple Macintosh Windows Vista Copy protection Microsoft Hard disk PlayStation 3 Atari 8-bit family Knoppix DVD USB flash drive Xbox Xbox 360 64-bit Computer virus Amiga ZX Spectrum Blue screen of death Modchip Linux Commodore 64 ATI Technologies IPod Radeon Apple II family PlayStation Portable Computer and video games History of Microsoft Windows Virtual memory Windows 3.x Modem System/36 3dfx Computer software Patch (computing) Nintendo GameCube Atari ST Mac OS X TiVo System 7 (Macintosh) CPU design Timeline of computing 1990-forward MDAC NX bit Motorola 68000 Anti-virus software CPU cache Computer security Steam (content delivery) Amstrad CPC OpenGL Embedded system Gmail PLATO MSN Messenger Laptop Sound Blaster CP/M Thread (computer science) Apple Computer Ethernet IBM PC Apple IIGS NeXT IMac Google Digital rights management PDP-11 RISC Spam (electronic) Expert system Sega Saturn DOS Personal computer Perl Debugging File system Sega Dreamcast Copyright infringement of software Extreme Programming Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis The Sims 2 Sega Portable Document Format Nintendo Entertainment System TurboGrafx 16
