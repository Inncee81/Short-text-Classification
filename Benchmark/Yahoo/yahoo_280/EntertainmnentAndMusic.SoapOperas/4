y r fans what do you think of these does anyone besides me see the potential creepiness of devon having feelings for lily i'm sick of nick and his amnesia i wish someone would bonk him the head again and he can remember his feelings for phyllis anyone agree with me you make an excellent point i remember way back when dru brought devon into their home as their foster child devon was showing his feelings for lily then neil noticed and set devon straight about lily being off limits i don't think devon ever lost those feelings for her i don't see lily even remotely becoming interested in devon he's in for one big hurt if he pursues those feelings plus neil will hit the roof as for nick and his amnesia the only thing he is guilty of is terrible writing and having to say those awful lines i never could stand nick and the way he is acting now is the reason why he a sour puss and a jerk when he hooked up with phyllis i enjoyed watching him he was funny nick and phyllis had great chemistry so now nick and sharon are locked in a bank vault instead of the usual elevator they've already started taking off items of clothing we all know what's gonna happen they'll end up making wild passionate love sharon will get pregnant then we'll have to play who's the daddy again stay tuned we are in soap opera land The Young and the Restless Blood on the Tracks Days of our Lives Friends History of As the World Turns (2000-present) All My Children Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Spidey Super Stories Sin City Sharon Tate Shaggy dog story Cliff Richard Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Another World (TV series) Torquay United F.C.
