can u get a virus watching myspace videos same as above because sometimes i watch trailer park boys or south park with myspace videos is it kinda like youtube no myspace allows you to upload a video file and then they create whats called a flash movie file even if an extremely gifted hacker managed to find a way to embed a virus to a video which in itself is near impossible it would be neutralized during the conversion from a regular video file to a flash video file MySpace Computer virus Macromedia Flash PlayStation Portable Prank flash BitTorrent Perl Hackers (film) Dance Dance Revolution Web page MegaMan Battle Network (video game) ITunes Music Store Read-only memory Cyberpunk Peer-to-peer .hack David Firth Virus Internet ROM hacking Malware Google Video Nine Inch Nails Web traffic Undergrads Warez Anime GBA Movie Player Video game developer Bluetooth Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Streaming media The Cursed Videotape Wikimedia Commons Uploading and downloading Teen Girl Squad OS/2 Hackers (short stories) Debian ITunes Haunted Apiary Resident Evil: Apocalypse CIH virus Trailer Park Boys USB flash drive Microsoft Word The Menagerie Portable Document Format Computer animation Advertising Operating system Digital photography William S.
