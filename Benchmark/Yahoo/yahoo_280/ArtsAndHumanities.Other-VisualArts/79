what size portfolio case after a few years in the graphic design field i'm in the process of updating upgrading my portfolio question is what size portfolio case do i use right now i have an x case since graduating from college now it has been advised that i get a smaller one but how much smaller considering i have a few posters and magazine ad campaigns ads per campaign what would be the ideal size i use a profolio that fits my x pages it's small enough to carry around and is not bulky at all any of my projects that are too big to fit posters t shirt designs etc i potograph or scan and show representations of them printed in x this size works perfect because that's the size most people are used to seeing and it makes your portfolio easy to pass around if you are in a panel interview and gives each interviewer more of a chance to have a personal experience viewing your portfolio U.S. Electoral College Requirements analysis Widescreen Apple Macintosh IBM PC compatible Billboard (advertising) Drew Struzan Killian documents Floppy disk Graphic design Graphics Windows Vista Laptop Chartered Financial Analyst William Eggleston Manga Windows 2000 Firearm Product Lifecycle Management Single Transferable Vote CPU cache Opera (web browser) Sorting algorithm Winning Streak El Lissitzky Compact disc Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma USB flash drive F-16 Fighting Falcon Krag-J__rgensen M4 Sherman Digital photography M16 (rifle) Model (abstract) Equine conformation Government of Australia Appeal Anamorphic widescreen Statistical survey Redundant array of independent disks Spyware Performance poetry Advertising Apple IIGS Cascading Style Sheets Portable Document Format Super Size Me Cessna T-37 Plame affair RISC Cathode ray tube Circuit design Enterprise content management Stereoscopy Second Battle of the Atlantic Galileo spacecraft Atari 8-bit family Federalist No. 10 Tank The Price Is Right Privatization Yearbook Nintendo GameCube Quicksort Windows Server 2003 Undergarment DragonFly BSD IMac General Dynamics F-111 Linked list IPod Super Mario 128 Election File Allocation Table Flag of Hong Kong UTF-8 Species Extreme Programming Logo programming language Graduate school Experiential education Advertising agency Sudoku View camera Royal Assent Computer Astrophysics Data System Charles Haughey Campaign finance reform Hustler Magazine v.
