any advice for selling paintings i work full time in an office environment however i spend whatever free time i have painting and now the winter will be starting i will have more time i do still life mainly however dabble in landscape i wanted to make some money our of my pictures and was wondering if there was anything i should know even tax wise etc advice anyone could give me to help me on my way i have sold two paintings to close friends so i know that they have some value although they are biased thank you work out how much time you spent doing the picture and times that by the amount you want to earn per hour then double it to cover the time you spent drawing tools wear and tear and time spent shopping for the materials now add the cost of materials to the picture ok so say i was selling a by canvas x in acrylics that took about hours work to finish x x now it used up about in acrylic paint and in clear archival spray varnish there were p worth of copper eyes and thread to hang it on and the canvas cost thus my material costs would be so i would add this to the and round up a bit to make of course if the picture was really good or more detailed than usual it would be reflected in the price having taken longer to complete the few i don't want to sell because i have an exhibition coming up and need work i add on an additional to the price but i also ask buyers if they would consider letting me use the work in my next exhibition for which you invite them to the varnishing party this is a good way to calculate price and you can see that the more expensive materials do very little to the final price so its always better to use the best materials you can buy of course is your starting price as soon as you get to exhibition spaces they will add a commission to this price thus you raise your price of all your work so you are not selling the stuff cheaper than the gallery i currently add to this price because that is the highest commission i have been charged however i do not exhibit too often and most rural galleries charge up to some london galleries can charge commission thus my painting is now if i were up to commission then it would be and should i ever get to cork st it would be a massive but fame eludes me lol avoid e bay you get no feed back like you would in a real gallery and only idiots buy art from a photograph the best place to start is a local restaurant you can offer to decorate the walls and if anything is sold allow the owner to take for taking the money have paintings ready to replace the sold pictures and offer to deliver the work in person so you can meet the new owners you need to invite them to your next exhibition which will have a party before hand they will be your best advert and printing invitations for them and their friends will ensure willing fans to your next event with a couple of good restaurant shows under your belt start contacting the local arts centres to arrange exhibitions you need about thirty pictures to do this and its worth having a few to replace sales with the arts centres will want to interview you and plan about six months ahead so when you have your first date go out and get somewhere to move the work onto in a neighbouring region art selling is about networking you need to get the next exhibition ready and start again keep all the good contacts in a little blue book and invite them to every new exhibition Christo and Jeanne-Claude Microeconomics Francis Bacon (painter) Tax Mortgage Inflation MMORPG Futures contract Poker jargon Capitalism Advertising Supply and demand $ale of the Century Hyperinflation Wheel of Fortune Wal-Mart Drill bit Price discrimination Paint Life insurance Grace Cossington Smith Insurance UK Singles Chart Henri Cartier-Bresson Mid-levels ITV Paintball Vincent van Gogh Tire Oxford English Dictionary Japanese tea ceremony Andrea Mantegna Gross domestic product Georgia O'Keeffe Taxation in the United States Gmail Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus London Congestion Charge Brett Whiteley The Amazing Race Solar cell The Apprentice 2 Alex Ferguson Satchel Paige Bulk vending Digital photography CPU design Mattress Laserdisc Warren Buffett L.
