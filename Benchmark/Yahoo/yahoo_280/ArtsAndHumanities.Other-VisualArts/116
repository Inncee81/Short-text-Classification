is buying heat transfer paper to put pictures on t shirts any good what i mean is will heat transfer images last alot of washes if so how many approx i know you would have to iron the tshirt inside out inorder not to destroy the print what are the pitfalls what are the pros do you know i personally don't like it they rarely last more then a few washes and most brands are difficult to apply evenly since most household irons tend not to produce even heat on a flat surface my suggestion is to take a course on how to do silkscreening from home which some colleges offer you can probably find a guide on line somewhere your options are a bit more limited but at least it's more permanent and lasts longer Screen-printing Drill bit Casting Tire Upholstery Gas metal arc welding Opportunity rover Sento Ironing Laserdisc Brewery Glass Tattoo Loudspeaker Drawing Sword making Social rule Japanese tea ceremony Etching Cookware and bakeware Magnet Stereoscopy Friction Movie projector Solar power Printed circuit board Iron Thermoregulation Printmaking Konica Minolta Compact disc Wok Anchor Education in the United States Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Snowball Earth American and British English differences Strap-on dildo Lionel Corporation Carnivorous plant Fluorescent lamp Central processing unit Security (finance) Internal ballistics Annuity Sulfuric acid Redundant array of independent disks Wind power Animal Crossing Cast iron Textile manufacturing Stove Topps Customs and etiquette of Japan Acne GIF Boat building Label Japanese toilet Table tennis Energy development Furnace Spark plug Bicycle lighting Digital photography Mattress Photography Cascading Style Sheets Rugby union positions Toilet Menstrual cup Privatization Nuclear fallout Basketball Spacecraft propulsion Inertial confinement fusion Money Nintendo 64 Computer printer Carbon nanotube Pentagram Single Transferable Vote Screw Equine conformation Fermi paradox Enterprise content management Hiberno-English Life insurance United States Postal Service TRS-80 Traditional animation Collecting fossils Economic inequality Fusion power IPod Panoramic photography GED Rail transport
