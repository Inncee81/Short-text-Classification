how are prices determined for modern art i know that art is a matter of taste how are the prices set for paintings by contemporary artists that is little more than a colorful mess on a canvas to my untrained eye anyway i just don't get it prices can be in the tens of thousands for something that just doesn't seem to justify the sale price i don't know much about art admittedly so please enlighten me the value of the art was in the composition and the expression the painterly value the visual beauty of the colors and how they compliment one another the geometry etc basically set aside the idea that a painting needs to illustrate something and ask yourself is it pleasing to look at and maybe what is the artist trying to illustrate in abstract terms yes i think a lot of artists will just slap some paint on a medium call it art and sell it as the same because they can and classical training or some profound claim as to what is being portrayed is really what is being sold like that guy who covers a hotel room with cheese it's not profound it's not art it's just stupid but as long as someone is willing to pay for it then it's an art of some kind and maybe the artist is a con artist Piet Mondrian Western art history Modernism Wassily Kandinsky Academic art Drawing Japanese art El Lissitzky Impressionism Rococo Labor theory of value Helen Frankenthaler Supply and demand Transformation problem Color Buddhist art Art forgery Graphics Neoclassicism Georges-Pierre Seurat Degenerate art Modern art Frans Hals Baroque Microeconomics Andrea Mantegna Visual arts of the United States Abstract art Photography European classical music Stanton Macdonald-Wright Diego Vel__zquez Outsider Art Symmetry Live 8 Comics Cubism Pablo Picasso Copyleft Francis Bacon (painter) Martial art Kitsch Time Out of Mind Michel Henry Music genre Normal distribution Modern dance Renaissance Lisp programming language Economics Richard Payne Knight Law of value Electronic Arts Mannerism Philosophy of language Painting Prices of production Abstraction Drew Struzan Action painting Australian Aboriginal art Chinese art Abstract expressionism Rendering (computer graphics) Romanticism Postmodernism French literature of the 19th century Gerhard Richter Surrealism Expressionism Christina Aguilera Graphic design Tensor Miguel de Cervantes Georgia O'Keeffe Nicolas Poussin Art of the United Kingdom National Gallery, London David Hume Artemisia Gentileschi American comic book Grammy Award Miniature (illuminated manuscript) Model (abstract) Paint National Kidney Foundation Singapore Mathematics Tokusatsu Max Beckmann Ocean's Twelve Online music store Modernism (music) Eug__ne Delacroix Janet Jackson Guy Davenport
