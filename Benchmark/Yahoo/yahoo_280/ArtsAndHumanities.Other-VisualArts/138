hay im looking for an arts college that offers photography as a major and studio arts im looking for a college close to pa or ny any suggestions i am a philly native aiph the art institute of philadelphia has it it's an okay college but if you are looking to seek a higher degree some colleges don't accept their credits ccp community college of philadelphia they have a very competitive program and the price is steadily rising they offer all of the information and studies at the cheapest price around and their credits are accepted everywhere they have the best computer technology in the tri state area their programs are updated each semester go figure i had to find this out by attending the college if i would have known of the price and quality education provided by this institution i would have gone there first temple has an okay program but they play around with your money and you must stay on top of them to make sure that all of your grants and scholarships are credited to your account ccp's financial aid office sucks they make you wait in some of the longest lines and then it you don't know what you need the staff may play on your ignorance but you can bypass that by seeking assistance from other students philadelphia university has a pretty good program except they don't have photography directly as a major they have their photography courses intertwined within their many other arts and design majors most of the majors involve graphic design or digital design which is something which you will have to advance to in this day and age anyway drexel has a pretty good program as well a special note if you go to ccp and receive your associates degree upon entering you can enlist in their guaranteed enrollment programs which they have with many of the schools in the area such as temple and drexel what happens is if you complete the requirements at ccp you receive a grant and or scholarship automatically for entrance into temple or drexel you must choose one the monies range from or more depending upon your final gpa and hey if you decide that an associate's degree is enough for you to go into the industry you have that option and if you later on decide that you want to pursue a higher degree you can one last thing to add is you named two different states both have good arts programs both of these states have various stipulations with out of state students and charge an extra fee if you are not a resident and the cost of living in new york is higher than philadelphia keep that in mind when choosing if that is not an issue good luck Education in the People's Republic of China Student loan Education in Germany Education in Portugal College admissions University of Central Florida Drexel University Education in Australia American University Community college Kwantlen University College College Credit card Education in Hong Kong Brown University Medical school Associate's degree Seneca College Temple University Law school Oregon State University Trinity College, Dublin Grade (education) Cooper Union Middle Tennessee State University GED Georgetown University Cornell University Tuition University of Pennsylvania No Child Left Behind Act City and Guilds of London Institute Education in Romania Baruch College University of Maryland Baltimore County Advanced Placement Program Affirmative action Education in Malaysia Chinese University of Hong Kong Lawyer University of Alabama The College of New Jersey Master's degree University of Michigan Bilkent University Scholarship Higher education in Japan Education in Japan Physician Northeastern University, Boston School choice California Polytechnic State University Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Emerson College York University IB Diploma Programme University of Bristol PLATO Bank High school Savannah College of Art and Design Students' union Paralegal Ivy League Dublin City University University of North Carolina at Charlotte University of Connecticut IBM PC compatible The Citadel (Military College) Photography Institute for Christian Studies National Certificate of Educational Achievement Athabasca University Doctor of Philosophy Education in Singapore Cable television CPU cache Stevens Institute of Technology Master of Business Administration Lyceum of the Philippines Pennsylvania State University Saint Joseph's University Franklin W.
