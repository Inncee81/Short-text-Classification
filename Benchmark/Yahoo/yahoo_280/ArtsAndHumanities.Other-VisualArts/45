how do i create a good art show set up i'm new to the juried art show world and i've got one coming up in december i need a x booth which i have to make myself which also needs to be covered finding a camping cover up that size shouldn't be difficult but what's a good idea for the walls to hang my paintings upon it needs to be effective as well as look pleasant not sure if your art is themed or not so if you'd need a different background for various paintings but if you do try this as a lightweight easy to assemble take down carry to different shows use pvc tubing union joints to build frame walls that are as tall as you need find a solid color fabric you like drape it over each wall you can vary the color texture etc if you want this will give you privacy define your space if you need some extra space to hang small lightweight sketches use double sided tape to adhere the fabric draped over the back of your frame then a small tab on the back of each sketch to adhere it to the front for display get some room dividers that match each theme of your paintings if the divider is fabric covered use curtain hooks to hang your pictures if its wood use screw in hooks if its plastic vinyl use m hangers etc rember to bring a small tackle box you can keep under your chair with extra hangers scissors tape etc you could lean larger framed paintings against the legs of the table you set up in a corner of your x booth set up a couple easels in other corners not knowing exactly the size weight medium of your paintings its difficult to give you just one idea i hope at least one of these helps you think of a way to display your art Upholstery Chair Professional wrestling throws Plastic Professional wrestling holds Strap-on dildo Passenger car Textile manufacturing Mattress Casting Floppy disk Drill bit Skateboarding trick Wood carving Dog agility Tent Radio controlled airplane Marching band Gramophone record Equine conformation Suplex Door Electrical wiring Wilton House Mixed martial arts Table tennis Solar cell Professional wrestling match types Volleyball Art Billboard (advertising) Grace Cossington Smith Kitchen Professional wrestling attacks Snooker Textile manufacturing terminology Stereoscopy Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Lighting Sukkot De Lorean DMC-12 Oscilloscope Dice Movie projector Tire Traditional animation Color Compact disc Model aircraft M16 (rifle) EIA-708 Printmaking Seismic retrofit Sari Swingout Parachute Paint Stave church Digital photography Arcade cabinet Carburetor Boxing Paragliding Bicycle Wood Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway El Lissitzky Jumpstart 3rd Grade Glossary of American football Japanese tea ceremony Bed (furniture) Plame affair Car handling Kayak Aerial (dance move) Printed circuit board Stairway Escape from New York Clarinet Undergarment Ford Thunderbird Symmetry Rugby union positions Transistor Luminiferous aether Light-emitting diode
