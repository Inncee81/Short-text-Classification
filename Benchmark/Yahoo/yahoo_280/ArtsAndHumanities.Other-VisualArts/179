artists how do you keep yourself motivated to work hard at your art all my life i wanted to paint and be a famous artist or at least a self supporting artist who could make a living at it last winter worked my butt off so hard to get ready for an important arts festival i had anxiety attacks and heart palpitation it might sound twisted but i was proud of myself for that the actual event was not outwardly successful though because i didn't sell a damn thing except some bracelets but i learned a lot from other artists and i'm really happy with what i'm working on right now i just don't understand why i seem to be dithering so much and can't seem to concentrate for more than half an hour at a stretch even though i have another arts festival coming up fast and not a lot of free time to get ready because i have to work full time in a store during the tourist season to make ends meet i wonder if other artists go through times when you feel kind of blase about it and how you pull yourself out of that last winter was a let down because i usually sell a few paintings every year and lots of prints hi and i hear you first put your stuff aside get out your favorite things the things that are forever that calm you make you smile and feel safe once you've got 'you' back head out to a bookstore or a gallery or a library and start flipping through great works of art or tear out photos from magazines or just colors that make you feel great just take a break get back to 'your place' and let everything go there's a book by julia cameron that you might want to read called 'the artist's way' as well as her silly and wonderful journal workbook she endorses writing in longhand pages every morning to unlock the blocks it's incredible the blocks just transport from your head to the page just remember that you're in charge not the block that you are amazing you have so much to give you can do this you know you can i wish you so much good luck Jon Secada Blood on the Tracks The Ashlee Simpson Show Carl Barks Buddy Guy Aerial (dance move) Shaggy dog story The McGuire Sisters The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Current teachings of Prem Rawat Pitaten Queen (band) K' John Peel Milton H.
