anyone out there with an art career i'm thinking of many different careers i want to work in a museum maybe as an art curator or maybe in an art gallery or even an art critic i just want to know if there is anyone out there who has one of these careers or something similar and maybe tell me a little something about it just be aware that the kind of work you are speaking of is not artistic but falls under management if you wish to pursue this career path management courses in college would be advisable just because you will be working in the arts do not make the mistake of thinking that you will be an artist or of the arts artists are creative types you will be seen as a bureaucrat and although you may meet artists and handle their shows and such they will always see you as an outsider a bureaucrat and never the twain shall meet if however you are interested in being an artist then the career path you have asked about might still work for you but you will probably not have enough time during your day to exercise any creativity as to being an art critic well it brings to mind a variation on an old saying those who cannot do criticize in short most critics love to tell others what they did wrong but rarely if ever do they have the stripes or the talent to do anything creative themselves Art Scientology beliefs and practices Auguste Rodin Franz Boas Georgia O'Keeffe A Course In Miracles Bureaucracy Time Out of Mind Anthroposophy Curator Electronic Arts Outsider Art Rudolf Steiner Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood Copyleft Max Stirner C__line Dion Martin Sharp Leadership Surrealism Jiddu Krishnamurti Brian Eno University of Massachusetts Amherst One Tree Hill (TV series) Unconscious mind Stanton Macdonald-Wright Richard Hamilton (artist) Tony Bennett The Emancipation of Mimi Drew Struzan John Ruskin Delta Goodrem Yoko Ono Consensus decision-making Raphael Kitsch Children of Dune Reaction to Darwin's theory Modernism Madonna (entertainer) Social rule Carl Jung Past teachings of Prem Rawat Bloomsbury Group Objectivist philosophy Michael J.
