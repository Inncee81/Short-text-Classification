rangers celtic in champions league do you think both can will qualify and if so how far do you feel they can go this time please be honest in answer and support both sides quest for the good of our fine nation bigots need not answer i'm really worried about the auld firm's chances this year spartak are a really good team and are the sort of club that always seem to put the old firm out in the qualifying stage remember basel and cska moscow red star are no mugs but i think rangers have a better chance than celtic i'd love for them to both go far in the champions league but i think celtic will lose over the two legs and parachute into the uefa cup rangers will squeak through and finish rd in the group stage UEFA Champions League Rangers F.C.
