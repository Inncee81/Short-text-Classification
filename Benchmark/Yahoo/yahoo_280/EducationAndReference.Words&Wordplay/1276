any english teacher please i know i've been asking this for several times already i've got some answers already but yeah i still haven't got the exact answer how to differ them toward each other cos i know even though they are all have the same meaning but there is must be something different among them first q i am coming in tomorrow i'll be coming in tomorrow i'll come in tomorrow what is the different between those phrases second q what is the different between those phrases above and these following ones without in i am coming tomorrow i'll be coming tomorrow i'll come tomorrow timberwolf thank you so much for the grade given to me but i am not asking for a grade amanda m i know that what i am asking is how to differ them when to use it ok i'm a writing grammar esl teacher so here goes to answer your second question first we use 'come in' instead of just 'come' in certain situations most obvious examples are coming in to work and coming in to a city i e by plane now back to the first question as someone already said the difference is the tenses used i am coming in present progressive i'll be coming in future progressive i'll come in future simple but yes i know you want to know about difference in meaning in fact in your examples there is no real difference in meaning the word 'tomorrow' makes it very clear what time frame you are talking about so any tense which refers to a future time can be used and we often use present tenses when referring to the future there is a very slight difference in focus as follows 'i'm coming in' implies you already had the plan to come in as does 'i'm going to come in' which you didn't mention 'i'll come in' implies that you made the decision at the moment of speaking if you want even more detailed information i suggest consulting a grammar reference which should give you all the different tenses we can use to refer to the future and the differences between them which are often quite subtle you can also try englishpage com good luck Sociobiology Altruism Vocabulary Slovak language Big five personality traits Gene Goodness and value theory Personality psychology Gratitude Love Price equation Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Toki Pona Human Occam's Razor Japanese language Interlingua Theodicy Sapir-Whorf hypothesis Victor Hugo Alignment (role-playing games) Leadership Taoism God Numerology Fan (aficionado) Reciprocal altruism Otaku Dog Objectivist philosophy Utilitarianism Brahmavihara Quebec French Anti-hero Trinity Internet slang Horse Kin selection Individualist anarchism Jewish ethics Graphology Intelligence (trait) Mathematics Fascism J.
