is the word butt considered sexual harrasement ok i was talking to some one with my back turned and a friend coworker who is a man threw a pin at me he was turned backward as well and it hit my butt he didnt intentionally hit my butt and he always throws pins as a joke but because i said butt can another coworker someone who has nothing to do with it say that is sexuall harrasement the basic and very very limited definition of sexual harassment is a situation gesture word or action which causes another usually in the workplace to feel threatened by its use so for the person who mentioned that the word offends her him they have just laid the groundwork for a future sexual harassment issue with you and all other co workers who use that and similar words so in your situation yes it can be considered harassment if you continue one incident does not usually deem it to be harassment do not use the word again and if you find yourself using it apologize and do so sincerely do not make that person feel sorry for mentioning the fact to you or you could find yourself at the wrong end of a costly court case if no one in the workplace is offended by the word or brings it to the attention of others then and again in the simpliest of terms it is not considered sexual harassment here's where that gets tricky though if an employer insists that you have sex with him her in order to keep your job then that is sexual harrassment regardless of whether or not you tell anyone else about it the theory and it's a good one is that most people would be too embarrassed to speak up and tell anyone what is going on that doesn't make it acceptable also things to not have to be sexual harassment to be harassment and therefore illegal take the pin throwing incident that you seem to be tolerating this can be considered harassment and probably qualify as sexual harassment so why is the co worker throwing pins around and why do you find this to be acceptable behavior this falls into the same realm of tolerated behavior as butt pinching umm no because in my book this is dangerously close to sexual harassment especially if that person has any authority over you besides it's not safe grown up or professional environment for co workers to be in put an end to the pin throwing behavior now before that causes a serious problem Sexual harassment Domestic violence Sexual orientation Pedophilia Rape Transsexuality Human sexual behavior Infantilism Homophobia Child sexual abuse Harassment Gay rights Social rule Gender role Workplace democracy Theory of conduct Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Political correctness Sexual assault in the U.S. military Abortion debate Childlove movement Asperger syndrome Ethics Professional wrestling holds Internet troll Theodicy Contract Narcissism Professional wrestling throws Fair Game (Scientology) Sexual revolution Transgender Stuttering George Costanza Buttocks Pornography Nicomachean Ethics Homosexuality and transgender Autism Goodness and value theory Spanking Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Hate speech Socrates Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Racism Zoophilia Interpersonal relationship Bernard Williams Toilet humour Children of God Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Brave New World Reparative therapy Traumatic incident reduction Mediation Plame affair Gender-neutral language Homosexuality and Christianity Gay Dilbert 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Trade union Tag A Course In Miracles Affirmative action Child pornography Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Bisexuality Cult Civil rights Homosexuality in China Science Strap-on dildo Avenue Q Oral sex Coming of Age (TNG episode) Bondage (BDSM) John Howard Yoder Autism rights movement Sin City Baseball Customs and etiquette of Japan Mixed martial arts Coercion Lawrence v.
