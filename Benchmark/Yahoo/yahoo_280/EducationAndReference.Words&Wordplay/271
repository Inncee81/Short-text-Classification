in english where shall we use thanking you or instead of using thank you and what does it mean by cashing shall use that word instead of payiing like ' i can cash u now or i want to cashing you separately' cashing means exchanging a document that isn't cash but that has a specific cash value for cash you cash a check a document that has a cash value but isn't cash cashing the check means that you are giving the check to someone who will be giving you the cash amount written on the check i am cashing my check for at the bank and the cashier will give me for it paying means to give someone either cash or anything else of value to fulfill an obligation or debt or to purchase something james is paying for my old car james is purchasing the car that creates a debt or obligation that james must fulfill by paying the owner of the car when you cash something you get the cash or monetary value of the document when you pay you get nothing back except possibly a receipt showing that you paid because in that case you're fulfilling an obligation or debt thanking you is awkward and i wouldn't use it if all you want to say is thank you if you are speaking directly to someone even if in a letter you say thank you it would be correct to say i am thanking you now if for example someone asked when are you going to thank me the difference is that thanking is used to describe what's happening not to speak directly to someone if you're speaking directly to jane thank you jane if you're describing or explaining what's happening either to jane or someone else i'm thanking you or i'm thanking jane i can pay you now or i want to pay you separately is correct if what you are doing is giving something of value to someone to fulfill an obligation or purchase something if you really must use something different you could say something like i can remit payment to you now or i want to remit payment to you separately as the other answerer said you seem to be pretty confused and i have no idea whether i really understood your question or whether you will understand my answer correctly so seeing a translator would be a good idea Annuity Microeconomics Bond Contract Money Monetary policy Cheque Debt Wheel of Fortune Inflation Tax Insurance Security (finance) Credit card Poker jargon Deflation (economics) Theory of conduct Hyperinflation The Joker's Wild Euro Automatic teller machine Financial audit Gold standard Bank Babylonian law Biblical inerrancy Life insurance Child support $ale of the Century Surveillance Debugging Mortgage Anarchism and capitalism Stock Economy of Russia FairTax Article One of the United States Constitution Derivative (finance) Corporation U.S. public debt Hiberno-English Corporate governance Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?
