can someone serve out multiple life sentences in prison i thought that most people get only one life to life but people get sentenced to like consecutive life sentences wtf how the hell does that work why not just kill them they are going to die anyways in there that is the term life sentence to me the person doesn't really serve every life sentence that they are giving just that one i mean really u only have one life which means you can only serve one life sentence i really think that if it was something very big like multiple murders than the judge would say something like consecutive life sentences just to let the guilty person know that he will not get out on any circumstances for wat he did and the judges says it just so the victims family will be relieved that the person who put them through hell is going be away for the rest of his her life and probably theirs too i mean if you were a cat then consecutive life sentences would make a whole lot of since lol Jon Secada Humphrey Bogart Hell Theory of conduct Philosophical skepticism Bon Jovi Hubert Selby Jr. Rocko's Modern Life Moral Politics Blood on the Tracks Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Theodicy Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Calvin and Hobbes Phoebe Halliwell Social rule Rich Mullins Michael D.
