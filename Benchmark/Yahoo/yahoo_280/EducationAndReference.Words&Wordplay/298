can you come up with a story using these lines just for the fun of it what shall i do with all of this i never pick the right one love means never having to fairytales can come true should i open it oh no these are all so good i'll have to re read once upon a time pansy peachblossom the forest fairy was strolling through the glade of oaks she liked to lunch in when she came upon a most surprising scene it was a long table covered in a floral tablecloth with a most tempting repast of food there was a mixed green salad potato salad fruit salad two types of chili one with beans one without bbq hot dogs hamburgers and veggie burgers garlic bread and chocolate chip cookies what shall i do with all of this pansy said in awe as she looked at the spread before her despite being hungry for her aforementioned lunch she'd never seen all this human food before so she wasn't sure whether it was edible and even if so whether it would agree with her more on this later grin alas her hunger got the best of her so pansy flitted all along the table sampling a fairy sized portion of some of the dishes no sooner did she finish her chocolate chip cookie crumb than she heard a stir in the trees behind her quickly she flew up into her favorite oak tree just in time to escape being seen by a troop of boy scouts they were enjoying a weekend camp out in these woods and were very hungry after fishing in the creek catching bugs and taking a nature hike as pansy watched the boys at lunch suddenly she became aware of at least one item from lunch that did not in fact agree with her the chili beans unfortunately she began experiencing a lot of flatulence which was surprising and embarrassing all at the same time i never pick the right one pansy cried realizing that she should have eaten the bean less chili although she tried to keep her gas quiet the boys closest to her oak tree perch heard the sound and giggled about it as boys do then they went back to chowing down one boy however was more curious than the others and actually climbed the tree to find the source of the noise his name was spud and he was a cute freckled redhead with kind green eyes slightly crooked teeth and slightly too large ears pansy found herself smitten by his innocent good looks so she didn't fly away as he climbed nearer to her when they finally met high in the leafy limbs of the tree spud was as dazzled by pansy's sky blue eyes flaxen hair and iridescent wings as she was by his appearance within a few minutes to chatting they realized they were both in love and coincidentally they both spouted the same cliche at the same time love means never having to be something you're not despite coming from two separate worlds pansy and spud accepted each others' differences and decided that they would make their relationship work no matter what pansy transformed herself into a butterfly not too difficult since she's a fairy anyway and spud put her carefully into his bug jar hoping that no one would notice his butterfly was actually a fairy in disguise and so he brought her home after the camping trip and she lived in his house without any of the rest of his family knowing about it fairytales can come true it can happen to you if you're young at heart insert music here however that's not the end of our story several months after coming to live with spud and his family pansy got a letter from the fairyland express mail service it was marked priority and from the handwriting it looked like it might have come from her arch rival dahlia pruneblossom anything you could possibly think of that dahlia could be jealous about she found it and pansy was the one whom dahlia went after the most she really seemed to enjoy sabotaging other fairies' happiness dahlia did hence pansy became anxious when she saw the letter should i open it she mused turning it over in her hands suddenly she thought she heard a faint ticking sound coming from inside the envelope this struck her as strange because how could someone fit a bomb inside an envelope then again this was no human sent missive but rather one from the land of fairy where everything is on a much smaller scale so to be on the safe side pansy flung it out spud's conveniently open window as hard as her little arms could fling it was a propitious act because as soon as the envelope hit the ground it exploded and burst into flames to humans it would have sounded like nothing more than a pop but to pansy's ears it was more like a detonation thank goodness she got rid of dahlia's malicious missive before it caused any harm or rather before it caused any harm to spud or pansy because a few inches away from the charred spot of ground where the envelope exploded was a half melted metallic bracelet and on the bracelet were the
