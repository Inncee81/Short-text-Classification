all intents and purposes i know the saying is for all intents and purposes but i have heard atleast three people in the last month mistakenly say for all intensive purposes why do they say that it doesn't even make sense think about it how can a purpose be 'intensive' i just think it's funny and i can't help but correct them when i hear them say the wrong thing how would you explain the correct way to say it and why the way they say it is wrong have you ever heard anybody say something wrong and corrected them how did they react to you i really enjoyed the answers by jared and insanity and they have a lot of good insights but i'm not sure they gave you all of what you were looking for entirely if you want to explain the phrase you could point out that some of the most important things about what people say and do are their intents as well as purposes for saying and doing them to cover all bases regarding why things are being said or done we can preface our comments with the note that what we say pertains to all intents and purposes that possibly might be involved and if you keep saying intensive purposes i'll see that you will need intensive care on purpose Social rule Theory of conduct Philosophy of language Originalism Utilitarianism A Course In Miracles Predestination Biblical inerrancy Theodicy Shit Slashdot subculture Irony XML Nicomachean Ethics Extreme Programming Abortion debate Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Economics Negima Plame affair Strap-on dildo The nature of God in Western theology I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Philosophical skepticism Spanish pronouns Amiga Power Slashdot trolling phenomena Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Psychosis Piccolo Junior Saga Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Political correctness Shaggy dog story Scientific method Equal Protection Clause Vishnu sahasranama Contract Meme Sant Thakar Singh Autism Moral Politics Time Out of Mind Guns, Germs, and Steel Philosophy Philo Investigations since the Fiji coup of 2000 Musical analysis Appeal Current teachings of Prem Rawat Sampling (music) Karma Ethics Tonality Pitaten Escape from New York God Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Israel ben Eliezer Modal logic Teach the Controversy Pyramid (game show) String theory Oz (TV series) Surplus value Avenue Q Mao (game) Ludwig Wittgenstein Intelligent design Culture jamming Sharon Tate Force (Star Wars) Evolutionary creationism Book of Mormon Science Dyslexia Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Teleological argument English grammar Luna Lovegood Characters in Neon Genesis Evangelion George Edward Moore Roswell UFO incident Ontological argument Drag racing Friends Two Treatises of Government Violin Poker jargon Creation science Proper name Non-native pronunciations of English Coercion Supernatural Meaning of life Merit Maurice Merleau-Ponty Neuro-linguistic programming Debugging Evil
