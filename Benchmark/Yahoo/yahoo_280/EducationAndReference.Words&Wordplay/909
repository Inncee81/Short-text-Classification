what does this poem mean when to the sessions of sweet silent thought i summon up remembrance of things past i sigh the lack of many a thing i sought and with old woes new wail my dear time's waste then can i drown an eye unused to flow for precious friends hid in death's dateless night and weep afresh love's long since cancell'd woe and moan the expense of many a vanish'd sight then can i grieve at grievances foregone and heavily from woe to woe tell o'er the sad account of fore bemoaned moan which i new pay as if not paid before but if the while i think on thee dear friend all losses are restored and sorrows end i think it means the person is thinking again about things that happened in the past and about things he she wishes he she had done etc but when they think about their friend they forget all their problems and regrets and are happy again Prescription and description Dictionary Swedish language Library catalog Philosophy of language Taiwanese (linguistics) Spanish language Chinese language Norwegian language Hangul Crossword Greek language German language Literary language Tetragrammaton French language Grammar Korean language R__maji English language Finnish language Japanese grammar Style guide Aristotle Dutch language Japanese particles Hindustani language World Wide Web Singlish Oxford English Dictionary Chinese spoken language Spell checker Vowel Fowler's Modern English Usage Classical Chinese English plural Hepburn romanization Gender Danish language Pronoun Predestination American English Quebec French Construction grammar Arabic language Kanji Welsh language Hiberno-English Chinese character Spoken Finnish Diglossia Names of God in Judaism Apostrophe (mark) Word (linguistics) Umlaut American and British English differences Mahjong Masoretic Text Pinyin Irony Japanese honorifics Webster's Dictionary Lojban Editor Comma (punctuation) Slovenian language American and British English spelling differences Qur'an Portmanteau Spanish dialects and varieties Real number Vietnamese language Esperanto phonology Written Cantonese Hungarian language Theology English verbs XML Hanja Grammatical mood Bulgarian language Slovak language Grammatical number German grammar Canadian English Analogy Tag question Abbreviation Persian language Commonwealth English Split infinitive Finnish grammar Hindi Philosophical Investigations Tamil language HTTP cookie King James Version of the Bible Writing system Web browser Sonata (music)
