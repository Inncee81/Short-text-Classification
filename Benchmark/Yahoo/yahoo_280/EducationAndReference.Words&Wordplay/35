where did the phrase holy cow com from i've always wondered that but never could figure it out one key to appreciating this expression whatever its precise origin is to appreciate that the use of cow is not meant terribly seriously but as an odd or silly or at least harmless idea so for starters let's not get confused the expression holy cow is not the equivalent of the idiom sacred cow though i won't completely dismiss the notion that it might have some connection http idioms thefreedictionary com cow the word cow may be totally arbitrary but seeing that it starts with a c it may well be that it began as a minced oath a milder substitute for holy christ such expressions frequently use a harmless or even meaningless substitute including some of the same sounds esp beginning with the same sounds cf jeepers creepers jees jiminy cricket and judas priest for jesus christ also gosh darn heck 'the dickens' for 'the devil' etc there is actually quite a bit of discussion of this and similar expressions on the internet the following is my gleanings of the best of it first note that holy cow is one of a number of relatively recent and specifically american expressions beginning holy the dates several of these are first attested in print holy smoke holy cats holy mackerel both holy moses holy cow from i hear america talking by stuart berg flexner von nostrand reinhold co new york http www phrases org uk bulletin board messages html of this whole group the american heritage dictionary of idioms writes 'holy cow ' 'holy mackerel' or 'moses' or 'moly' or 'smoke ' an exclamation of surprise astonishment delight or dismay as in holy cow i forgot the wine or holy mackerel you won or holy moses here comes the teacher or holy smoke i didn't know you were here too the oldest of these slangy expletives uses mackerel dating from about the one with 'moses' dates from about and 'cow' from about none has any literal significance and moly is a neologism devised to rhyme with holy and possibly a euphemism for moses http www wordwizard com ch forum topic asp topic id compare the following on holy smoke it seems more likely that holy smoke was invented anew as a mock religious exclamation and mild oath on the model of the older holy moses from the s and holy terror and holy joe both from the s in turn these probably served as the model for others of similar type that came later such as holy cow from the early s http www worldwidewords org qa qa hol htm note that date for the first printed attestation of holy cow early s this does not necessarily mean that was it's first use but it apparently is much later than many of the others but it does suggest that it might not be so closely connected with the th century forms rather it might be part of a wave of mid th century expressions of this type esp in popular media comic books tv movies on these note the following from the dictionary of american slang holy cow equiv to holy cats both being euphemisms for holy christ the common oath and popular exclam put into the mouth of teenagers by all script writers universally heard on radio television and in movies it was first popularized by the corliss archer series of short stories television programs and movies which attempted to show the humorous homey side of teenage life paul beale however in revising eric partridge's dictionary of catch phrases american and british cites a different origin the orig 'captain marvel' and 'batman' oaths 'holy something harmless ' were in turn spoofed in later c by whatever seemed relevant to the situation nigel rees in very interesting but stupid catchphrases from the world of entertainment instances holy flypaper holy cow holy felony holy geography holy schizophrenia holy haberdashery etc and adds 'the prefix 'holy' to any exclamation was particularly the province of batman and his boy assistant robin characters created by bob kane and featured in best selling comic books for over thirty years before they were portrayed by adam west and burt ward in the tv film series ' http www phrases org uk bulletin board messages html since all of this was done as silliness it's possible the notion was suggested by the hindus sacred cow base on the idea that a cow itself is a rather silly thing to be regarded holy sacred at any rate the idea seems to be that the word is supposed to refer to something harmless which also applies if it was chosen as a substitute for christ one remotely possible parallel my own idea i will toss in the early th century expression 'holy mackerel' was apparently related to the expression 'mackerel snappers' a mock term of derision used against catholics immigrants this was based on their eating fish on friday why mackerels it may be influenced by the fact that mackerels are very cheap what these immigrants could afford and not highly regarded but mackerel may also have been influenced by the sound of michael name of the archangel http www takeourword com tow page html though it was originally derisive there may again be the idea of silliness viz the notion that a fish esp the mackerel is rather a silly thing to be regarded as holy now though they are not close in time perhaps it's worth considering the possibility that holy cow had some derogatory notion behind it an extension of the use of cow as an insulting term for a woman
