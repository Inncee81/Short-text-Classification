why do we pronounce try with a ch sound i think british speech maintains the 't' sound in 'try' a bit better than american speech so what you describe is really more of an american thing although we know in our heads that it should be 'tr' i think most americans do pronounce it ch and would be rarely corrected for it any british or australian actor who plays american roles would probably tell you that it's part of our accent tongue placement when making the sounds is very similar it's also slightly easier to make the 'chr' rather than 'tr' and we are a nation of immigrants after all native chinese speakers find the 'tr' sound very awkward for example i am sure there are others furthermore being linguistically lax here doesn't lead to any confusion we don't have any words in english that begin 'chr' and are pronounced 'ch' and not k so we all hear 'try' it wouldn't be confused with any other word in any english context if you take elocution classes for speech stage or singing they will still coach you on pronouncing and enunciating the 'tr' clearly even exaggerating it somewhat so that the word can be clearly and cleanly heard in the back of the audience The Nameless Novel Crossword Wheel of Fortune Voynich manuscript MacGuffin I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Jumpstart 3rd Grade Khazar Correspondence International Phonetic Alphabet Others look into the Dreyfus Affair Esotericism Socrates Monarchy in Canada Zapatista Army of National Liberation The Raven Morse Code Kosovo Bah__'__ Faith and Language Policy Acrostic Scrabble (game show) Academic Games Password Shogi Esperanto as an international language MIT Mystery Hunt Cryptic crossword Shadow the Hedgehog Free trade Runic alphabet The Hunting of the Snark Junius House of Leaves Esperanto and Interlingua compared Swami Vivekananda I Am the Walrus Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh Guy Smiley Zeta Psi Locked room mystery Paranoia Agent Dyslexia Esoteric Christianity Resurrection of Jesus John Dickson Carr Archimedes Sudoku Extradition Prayer Now You See It Rebus Chain Reaction (game show) Amiga Power Thomas Lodge Priory of Sion The writing of Principia Mathematica Book of Kells Intelligent design Muammar al-Qaddafi Lingo (game show) Head of state Secret Gospel of Mark Vicarius Filii Dei Eucharist Hebrew language Ruth Bader Ginsburg Jabberwocky Quebec French Anarchist law Countdown (game show) Acronym and initialism Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Richard Feynman Collation Call sign Epistle to the Ephesians Georgian language Intern Chain Letters You Don't Know Jack Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery Silent letter Franz Boas Victor Cousin One Tree Hill (TV series) Pyramid (game show) Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke H 2001 anthrax attacks Cyprus dispute Papal Infallibility Ichthys Status of religious freedom in France English spelling Scrabble Michigan State University Theodore of Mopsuestia Vehicle registration plate Peace Meaning of life Capitalization
