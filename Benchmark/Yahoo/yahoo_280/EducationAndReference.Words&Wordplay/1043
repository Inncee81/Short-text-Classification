wants to know can you write a little story that includes these m song titles i'm going to go through the alphabet nope this is not homework just some wholesome creative fun on ya morning has broken my dreams are getting better all the time madman across the water maybe i'm amazed mothership connection magic transistor radio if you want to answer please post your intent so i won't close on you ouch morning has broken on the fair town of cambridge sunlight cascades over the houses lawns and businesses of the city and morning commuters lazily make their way to work however one office is already open and doing businees by tradition dr frank mcgahee had begun accepting patients early so that he could go home early in over fifteen years of practice not one of his patients in the am slot had complained about the early appointment of course most of his patients were neurotic milquetoasts that couldn't stand up to their year old children much less complain to him about having to wake up early for his appointments and here before him at am this morning is the king of all neurotics captain psychosis himself tanner james in the tradition of all good psychiatrists dr mcgahee had purchased a large leather couch he had even hired a feng shui expert to come in show him where to put the couch for maximum effectiveness during treatment stretched out on this couch now tanner james was babbling my dreams are getting better all the time doc this treatment has done wonders for me he said contradicting this statement was the large marilyn monroe wig that covered his head beneath that wig were several sporadic bald patches that could only have occurred as a result of someone ripping out their own hair in handfuls dr mcgahee sighed in front of the couch was an old coffee table patterned after a louis the xiv antique on top of the table sat a full pitcher of water with little slivers of ice floating on top this was just in case the patient needed to wet his whistle in the middle of his diatribes however positioned just right he could use the pitcher to block the view of the face of his patient giving them distorted features that seemed to match their endless psychotic blathering dr mcgahee was tired what did you dream last night tanner mcgahee asked if only to focus the patient well i had this magic transister radio he began and this radio could pick up alien transmissions you know like from the ones who abducted me it seemed to have a mothership connection because i could talk to the fleet admiral himself for tanner it was always about the fleet admiral during the supposed abduction it was the fleet admiral who had ordered the he be released back to earth the fleet admiral who had saved him further tests yadda yadda dr mcgahee sighed again and shifted his view to the pitcher he sat staring at this madman across the water i don't know tanner i don't think these treatments are getting us anywhere you still believe these incidences occurred your dreams are still just as disjointed as ever and frankly i'm beginning to think of myself as a failure here maybe i'm losing touch with my profession maybe i'm losing my touch with patients like yourself maybe i'm amazed that you can function when you leave here at all but i think the time has come that i refer you to another doctor i'm truly sorry tanner i feel like i've failed that was as far as mcgahee got he was cut off by a sonic tearing sound as the roof above him was literally ripped from it's moorings sunlight and sky flowed into his office highlighting a now very stunned dr mcgahee what the that was when tanner james let out a cry in an instant he flew upward and out of the office by route of where the roof used to be his body getting smaller as it was pulled further into the sky dr mcgahee sat staring at the spec that was tanner until he winked completely out of view after such a quick and brutal intrusion the silence was now deafening and in the vein of all good god fearing psychologists dr mcgahee stood and made his way to the desk and picked up the phone and called his secretary and said lois please dispose of mr james file as he will no longer be a patient here also can you call a couple roofers for estimates and send in the o'clock as usual mcgahee returned to his seat and sighed maybe he was losing touch with his patients but dammit he still needed
