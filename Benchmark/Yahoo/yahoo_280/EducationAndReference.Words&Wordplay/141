what is a legitimate question i have heard people ask other people questions and htey said its a legitimate question what does legitimate mean can someone use it in a sentence for me please describe clearly thanks the word legitimate has several meanings depending on the context as quark has shown you but i'm not sure this answers your question about the term legitimate question usually the term legitimate question comes up in a conversation that is more of a debate the individuals are discussing some topic and one of them challenges something the other has said by asking a question the question usually requires an answer that makes the other person have to defend their point or perspective if the question asked is truly relevant to the topic of debate then the person who has been called upon to answer the question might acknowledge the appropriateness of the question by saying that's a legitimate question this phrase is often used to set someone up for a good answer that will follow by telling the asker their question is legitimate you give them the sense they have scored a point in the debate or discussion but then when you have a good answer to their question you pull the rug out from under them for example let's say we were discussing the war in iraq i might contend that we need to stay there until order is restored you might ask if we continue to keep troops there won't thousands of more soldiers be killed in truth that is a legitimate question because as long as we do stay in iraq more soldiers will be killed but the world has been fighting wars for freedom for centuries hundreds of thousands of people have given their lives so others could be free and if we leave iraq too soon it is likely that many many more people will die if the country falls into a protracted civil war in this example about the war in iraq if you had asked me to explain why sadaam hussein was found in a spider hole that would not be a legitimate question to our discussion because the question has nothing to do with the issue of whether we should stay in iraq or not does that help Democracy Philosophy of language Plame affair Iraq War Socialism Scientology beliefs and practices Resurrection of Jesus Fahrenheit 9/11 Civil rights Intelligent design movement English grammar Freedom of speech Non-aggression principle Post-invasion Iraq, 2003___2005 Goodness and value theory Amnesty International Predestination Cultural relativism State Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Who is a Jew?
