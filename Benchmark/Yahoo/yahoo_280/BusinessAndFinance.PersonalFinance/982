can an ach debit return yes it can achs of all types can return when you speak of ach debit are you the one initiating the transaction when an ach is processed from the originator for a debit this means the money is going from somewhere else to their bank account its backwards of what you would think if you are on the other end this means the money is leaving your account if the ach is a credit this means its leaving the originator and going to the recieving end in an ach debit the bank will give the originator the money on good faith until the actual transaction is collected about or days later if the other bank sends back an nsf or account closed the bank will take the money back from the origiator in an ach credit the bank will send the money first then try and deduct the money from the originators bank this is two step process the ach department in the bank is not the same department that handles the originator's your account sometimes its even outsourced so what happens is the ach department will send the money then send a request for the money to be debited from the originator's account i know the credit and debit thing doesnt make sense to alot of people if the originator doesnt have enough money to cover the transaction they send a note back to the ach department to reverse the ach thus returning it this is why you might see an ach deposit and or hours later it gets removed also remember anyone i spoke about above can reverse an ach up to hours this means even though a direct deposit goes through it can be pulled back Automated Clearing House Debit card Credit card Money EFTPOS Bank Double-entry book-keeping Electronic money Internet fraud Bank fraud Surveillance Octopus card United Kingdom corporation tax Payroll Monetary policy Financial audit Interac Short selling Money supply Gold standard Credit card fraud Automatic teller machine MetroCard Ulster Bank London Underground Mortgage Margin (finance) Transaction processing Advance fee fraud Cheque Annuity Smart card ACID Contract Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Bond Swingout E-ZPass Economy of India Letter of credit Accountancy Money laundering Financial services Magnet Capital accumulation Economy of Russia Offshoring Legal tender Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Clearstream Stored-value card Islamic banking Electronic toll collection Hyperinflation Personal finance Money creation Noah Bank of America File system Depreciation Globalization Witches (Discworld) Flat tax Anarchism and capitalism Reserve requirements Apostolic Constitutions Toll road Liberty Dollar Euro Canadian dollar Tax Finance Deflation (economics) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Mergers and acquisitions Surplus value Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Economy of the Philippines Insurance Credit union Currency Textile manufacturing Bank of China (Hong Kong) Plame affair Outsourcing Mail fraud Dai dai shogi Time-based currency Tai shogi Fractional-reserve banking Schabir Shaik Trial Causality Banknote Slot machine Health savings account E-gold
