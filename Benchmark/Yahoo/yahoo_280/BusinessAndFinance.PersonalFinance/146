atm question last night i was out partying and tried to take money out of an atm that was at this bar the atm was taking a long time so i canceled the transaction but my online banking shows the money was taken out what should i do has this ever happened to anyone does my bank have to give me the money back and is there any way that i can prove i did not get the money the only way to get your money back is to file a dispute with your bank call the bank and ask them what you need to do to file an atm dispute make sure it is in writing if they don't have a form to fill out then you should write a letter stating your dispute you only have so many days to file a dispute it may vary from bank to bank so don't delay they will need the date of your transaction your account and also the amount disputed the receipt from your transaction if you got one may help but it shouldn't be needed also be honest with yourself if you were drinking and can't remember clearly then don't assume the atm took your money atms almost never cancel your transaction and don't refund the money however you can still submit a dispute if you are unclear and then let the bank sort it out after they recieve your dispute and pass it on to the processing network the atm owner will have only so many days to send in records from the atm if the atm shows any sort of malfunctioning on or near your transaction then you will get your money you will also get your money if the atm owner doesn't send in any records the only way you will not get anything back is if the atms records indicate that it successfully dispensed the funds if they do refund your money make sure they also refund any surcharge that was added on Automatic teller machine EFTPOS Password Credit card Bank fraud Credit card fraud Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act United States Postal Service Bank Advance fee fraud Octopus card Annuity Taxation in the United States Asynchronous Transfer Mode Postage stamp Money supply File system Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Theory of conduct Life insurance Article One of the United States Constitution Database Surveillance Enron Corporation Monetary policy Mergers and acquisitions Domain Name System Mutual fund Plame affair Contract Wheel of Fortune Islamic banking Windows XP SCO-Linux controversies Euro Microsoft Jet Database Engine Internet fraud Mortgage Popular, Inc MetroCard Medical prescription Money SmartRider Automated Clearing House Congestion control MTR The X-Files Derivative (finance) PayPal Chip and PIN Citigroup Backup Identity theft 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, vote suppression GunZ The Duel Siphon Craps Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Stanley Cup Insurance BancNet Family Feud Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Anarchism and capitalism Liberty Dollar Btrieve Investment bank Poker jargon Financial markets Bond Money creation Jeopardy!
