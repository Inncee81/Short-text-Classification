is this a good pay average hi im looking right now for a future career i know that pay doesn't matter as long as you enjoy what your doing i also know money isn't everything but i just want to know what kind of money i might need to be making to have these things below computer and information science yearly base average would this be enough to live with a nice size house and a mercedes or bmw plus what my wife would make do you mean computer engineer or software engineer i would say that's above the average of what other people make it'll be enough to buy you a huge house and some cars yes a bmw or mercedes in addition to what your wife would make it'll be even more but it's unlikely you'll make that getting out of college many graduates will start out entry level with a base salary of about go into cpe computer engineering like me good for you to think about these things at your age p s you'll make more as an engineer than a computer science graduate BMW Gross domestic product Mercedes-Benz Software engineering W.
