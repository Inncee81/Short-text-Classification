opening joint checking account please help i'm thinking of opening a joint checking account with my husband who has a good job and a great credit score i haven't worked in years been a stay at home mom and my credit score is poor fair i haven't had any banking in my name since i stopped working never planned it like that we've just moved alot and didn't make time to opena new joint also about years ago i bounced checks from my personal account i'm wondering if anyone who works in banking could tell me if i am still eligible to join my husband on a joint account even though i have this history of bounced checks a less than perfect credit score which i'm working on no banking in the last years and am not currently working or should he just add me to his existing account thanks so much i dont want to be embarassed by going into a branch office and being denied the bank won't care about your work or credit history you only need to sign a form to be placed on the account and for a signature card so that you can be identified by your signature they don't check for checking history either they have no way to go into this much detail and have punitive charges for over draft or insufficient funds to try to prevent this a credit card company would be more interested in the items that you mentioned as a way to judge the amount of credit risk that you are and how much they could safely loan you on a revolving unsecured account Bank Cheque Internet fraud Money supply Citigroup Surveillance Mortgage Credit score Credit union Credit card fraud Octopus card Student loan 401(k) Debit card Identity theft New York Giants Year 2000 problem FairTax Advance fee fraud Finance Credit history Mutual fund Password United States Postal Service Health insurance Betting (poker) Schabir Shaik Trial Financial services Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Small business Digital signature Financial audit Insurance Bank of China (Hong Kong) Islamic banking Primerica Financial Services Annuity British national identity card Bond Poker jargon Derivative (finance) The Apprentice 2 Gold standard Automatic teller machine Bank of America Fiat money Corporation United Kingdom corporation tax Life insurance Unlawful combatant Social Credit Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Predatory lending Payday loan Tesco Short selling Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Money order Autograph Interest Satchel Paige Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Hillary Rodham Clinton Charles Ponzi Baseball Monetary policy Bretton Woods system Personal finance Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Marshall Plan Traveler's cheque Ocean's Twelve Plame affair Xerox SmartRider Money creation Corporate finance Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Paintball Futurama (TV series - season 2) National Football League The Amazing Race Oakland Athletics Capital accumulation Rickey Henderson Deflation (economics) $ale of the Century New England Patriots Phishing Mensal__o scandal Neopets Cricket Hearts (game) Venezuelan recall referendum, 2004 Government of India Act 1935 Gettysburg Address
