who's responsible for the debt in case of divorce my hubby and i live in texas i understand that this is a common property state and that we are jointly responsible for any debts we incur no matter who racks it up however if we move to a separate property state arkansas for instance in a couple of years would the responsibility for debts still be shared equally the issue of debt in a divorce case is rather tricky it really does not matter if you are in a community property state or not first even if the divorce decree states that each individual is responsible for half of all debts or the all debts incurred during the marriage will be the responsiblity of the a single person financial companies have the right to go after all individuals that were party to the loan for example if a credit card was issued to your husband and you have an a card on his account he will be responsible for the entire debt if both of you have a joint credit card account card was issued based upon both of your incomes if one party fails to pay the debt then the other party on the card will be pursued to pay the entire outstanding debt payments a home mortgage is the same once a divorce occurs the mortgage company has the right not to release a party to mortgage loan if their income was required for the person to qualify for the loan the mortgage company would have more risk exposure if it was otherwise auto loans are the same if both individuals income was required for the loan or the person that received the auto does not sufficent income to have qualified for the loan on their own when it comes to irs debt if they filed married joint returns during the years of marriage both parties are responsible for any outstanding tax debt for the related years even if one party did not work Mortgage Insurance Concurrent estate Taxation in the United States Debt Divorce Money Credit card Bond 401(k) Personal finance Marriage United Kingdom corporation tax Mortgage-backed security Life insurance Student loan Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 FairTax Security (finance) Government debt Islamic banking Deflation (economics) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Child support Predatory lending Tax Municipal bond Derivative (finance) Donald Trump Annuity Economy of Russia Social Security (United States) Flat tax Interest Tax protester Economy of the United States Debt consolidation Debt levels and flows Monetary policy U.S. public debt Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Bankruptcy in the United States Federal National Mortgage Association Real estate bubble Allodial title Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution Bank fraud Primerica Financial Services Corporate finance Finance Legal tender Financial markets Auto insurance Gold standard Polyamory Great Depression Mergers and acquisitions Corporation Canadian Senate ACORN Article One of the United States Constitution Government National Mortgage Association Unemployment benefit Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Capitalism Mutual fund Variable universal life insurance Income tax Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Same-sex marriage in Canada Microcredit Savings and loan association Title insurance Credit derivative Collateralized debt obligation Financial services Babylonian law Treasury security Microeconomics Political subdivisions of New York State Consensus decision-making National Insurance School of Salamanca Hillary Rodham Clinton Fungibility Anarchist economics Rights and responsibilities of marriages in the United States Real estate broker Bank of China (Hong Kong) Credit card fraud Citigroup Civil union Economy of India Anarchism and capitalism
