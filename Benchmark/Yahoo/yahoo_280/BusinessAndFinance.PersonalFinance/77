can banks charge without an agreement my bank charges a fee for overdrafts i told them i don't agree to a fee they said that if i overdraft i must pay the fee a buddy of mine was overdrawn by they transferred the funds from his savings to his checking to cover the overdraft and they charged him for the overdraft is this legal the choice is between bouncing the check and letting the check go thru but charging an overdraft fee there is a lot of debate about overdraft fees at the moment but there is no law saying they are illegal however they may be part of your contract with your bank either they are in the original checking agreement or the bank sent a notice some time after that stating they were adding overdraft fees to the agreement of course a bouncing check creates extra fees for everyone so it's a choice between two evils the fees should be regulated since some banks put the checks thru in such a way as to create as many overdraft fees as possilbe for example let's say you have a check and checks for each and your balance is the bank could put thru the small checks and only charge an overdraft fee on the big one but in practice they will put thru the big one and charge you overdraft fees on the small ones write your congressman and senators and complain Credit card Bob McEwen Advance fee fraud Bank Poker jargon Insurance SCO-Linux controversies Internet fraud Mortgage Leasing Debit card Schabir Shaik Trial Copyright Food and Drug Administration United States Postal Service Money creation Trust (Law) USA Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Israeli settlement Short selling The Wildhearts Congress of the United States Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Jack Abramoff Article One of the United States Constitution Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Betting (poker) Usury New Deal Citigroup Security (finance) Monetary policy United States House of Representatives GNU General Public License International Criminal Court Fiat money Microeconomics Education in Portugal Spyware Redundant array of independent disks International law and the Arab-Israeli conflict Cheque Public domain Gold standard Notary public London Congestion Charge Money supply Contract National Kidney Foundation Singapore Cable television Corporate finance George Galloway Octopus card European Union Celtic F.C.
