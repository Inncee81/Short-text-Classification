filing for bankruptcy are you glad you did it my husband and i have had really bad luck with jobs these past couple of years we have racked up some credit card debts and it's hard to make the minimum payments nevermind trying to pay down the balance we somehow make it by each month but pay a lot of our bills late even though we both work full time jobs and i do a home consultant business on the side it's hard to come up with extra money to pay down debts we are thinking of filing bankruptcy as a last resort because we were going to try and refinance our mortgage and take cash out to pay off some bills but with the housing market the way it is we can't get a good appraised value for our house so anyone out there filed bankruptcy and are you glad you did it did all the debts go away or did you have to repay and how long before your credit was back intact yes my husband and i are years out of our bankruptcy and where we do get some credit the apr on all of them are around which is a lot of extra money that we are paying now because of what we did then if i knew then what i know now i would of never filled we even got questioned when we wanted to rent a new apt and they pulled a credit report we have to explain why we filled every time we want to apply for anything it is really hard now and quite embarrassing now i cannot tell you how things would of went had we not filled but at the time it was a quick fix and it did work we got rid of all of our debt i still would never do it again or recommend it to anyone only you know your situation and i would advise talking to a lawyer before you file just to know your options i would maybe even look into a financial advisor to maybe find out some other options on how to get your debt paid off good luck it is a tough decision Mortgage Deflation (economics) Student loan Bond Debt Bank Money Interest Credit card Schabir Shaik Trial Personal finance Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Primerica Financial Services Credit score Poker jargon Mortgage-backed security Corporate finance Article One of the United States Constitution Betting (poker) Enron Corporation Predatory lending Debt consolidation Unemployment Donald Trump United Kingdom corporation tax Insurance Government debt Economy of Russia Plame affair Finance Annuity Refinancing Microeconomics Appeal Mutual fund Tom DeLay Gold standard FairTax Karl Rove Security (finance) Municipal bond Taxation in the United States Government National Mortgage Association Derivative (finance) Marshall Plan Economy of the United States Life insurance Bretton Woods system Internet fraud Pitaten Keynesian economics Bank fraud U.S. public debt Federal National Mortgage Association Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Delta Air Lines Babe Ruth Graduate school Treasury security Arbitrage Inflation Mensal__o scandal EastEnders Real estate bubble Arthur Laffer Money supply Economics Social rule Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Capital accumulation Fiat money Dot-com History of the United States (1918-1945) Commodity markets Futures contract Financial services Social Security debate (United States) Estoppel Economy of Pakistan High-yield debt Timeline of the Enron scandal Bankruptcy in the United States Dave Ramsey Yield curve Hong Kong Monetary Authority Leasing
