what to do with my roth ira i am years old i have a good job with a k i contribute of my earnings to it and my company matches it i also have a roth ira that my dad set up for me a few years ago i haven't paid any attention to it over the past few years but now i want to know everything i can about it there is currently about in the roth ira i also have a home equity loan for about i hate having this debt and am wondering if it would make sense to cash out my roth and just pay off the home equity loan i am not in any kind of financial crisis or anything but the equity loan has a interest rate and i dont like paying the interest should i cash out the roth and pay off the loan then look back into another roth down the line in a few years will i be taxed for taking out my roth i live in michigan you can take contributions out of your roth without penalty or taxes so you would have to find out how much your father put in and you could take that much out tax free however if you take out any more you would have to pay taxes plus a penalty that's the law however i would suggest letting it ride leave the money in the roth ira it will probably earn or so tax free which is pretty darn good as for the heloc you are paying a tax deductible which isn't that high you might be able to shop around for another heloc or home equity loan and get a better rate adam 401(k) Mortgage Bond United Kingdom corporation tax Cost of capital Annuity Roth IRA Deflation (economics) Debt Money Insurance Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 Life insurance Social Security (United States) Variable universal life insurance Security (finance) Tax Predatory lending Student loan Weighted average cost of capital Warren Buffett Individual Retirement Account Flat tax FairTax Credit card Islamic banking Stock Finance Taxation in the United States Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Bank Derivative (finance) Capitalism Economy of Russia Income trust Capital accumulation Hyperinflation Financial services Money supply Inflation Usury Unemployment benefit Divorce Compensation of employees Investment bank Free trade Microeconomics Tertiary education fees in Australia Tax haven Mergers and acquisitions Corporation Hillary Rodham Clinton Economy of Cuba EBITDA Federal National Mortgage Association History of post-Soviet Russia George W.
