what is the worst case scenario if i file for bankruptcy how long will it take to stop becoming a pariah how long does it take to get your credit score up i knoiw it stays for years but how does it affect your score the absolute worst case credit wise would be a credit score of the absolute lowest possible score and you still owing on student loans which cannot be wiped out by bankruptcy it will result in not being able to obtain an apartment or any credit and possibly getting rejected for jobs especially if they are gov't or finance jobs it usually takes about a year and a half for your score to start to increase again but you will start to receive preapproved credit offers again about mo after your bankruptcy is discharged i'd recommend building new credit as soon as possible which will help you to build credit faster go to your credit union and get a secured credit card and a secured loan remember you cannot build a high credit score if you don't have any current credit bankruptcy stays on your credit report for yrs depending on whether it is chapter or chapter bankruptcy after a few years you will eventually be able to qualify for credit just at higher rates or possibly needing a cosigner Student loan Graduate school Credit score Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Credit card Debt Social Security (United States) Deflation (economics) Mortgage Taxation in the United States Bankruptcy in the United States Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Appeal Bank Debt consolidation FairTax Grade (education) Economy of India Interest Education in the United States Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina United Airlines Leeds United F.C.
