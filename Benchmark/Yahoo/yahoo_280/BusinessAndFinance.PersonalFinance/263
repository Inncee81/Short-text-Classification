my dad purchased a nd home and i live in it with my son my office is closing due to the owner's bad business deals my company actually owes me nearly k that i haven't received because of this my home is in foreclosure and i want to prevent the sale if my father and or i declare bankruptcy can we keep both homes i can earn enough to pay it back within months but the bank obviously won't wait that long the way it is my credit isn't good enough to qualify on my own to buy it right now but i can fix that with time btw my dad is on the title of both homes he is not late on his payments so his property should be fine can we save this nd home depending on the state in some places they can't take away your primary home even if you file for bankruptcy i doubt any state will go as far as protecting the nd home if he has good relationship with his bank i would suggest he talk with them first before making drastic decisions best wishes Mortgage Bankruptcy Great Depression Insurance Trademark Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Bond Deflation (economics) Debt Credit card Monetary policy Enron Corporation Islamic banking Foreclosure Mutual fund SCO-Linux controversies Taxation in the United States Bank Amway Divorce Article One of the United States Constitution Donald Trump Bankruptcy in the United States Gold standard Life insurance History of the United States (1918-1945) Economy of Russia Marvel Comics Capital accumulation Tax Citigroup Capitalism Delta Air Lines Commodore International Mergers and acquisitions Student loan Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code Short selling Leasing Wachovia Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Internet fraud Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Microeconomics Wal-Mart Gross domestic product Child support Digital rights management Real estate broker Schabir Shaik Trial Investment bank Mario Lemieux U.S. public debt Allodial title Copyright Inflation United Kingdom corporation tax Trust (Law) USA Bank fraud Sears Holdings Corporation Security (finance) Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Draw poker Babylonian law Corporate governance Dividend Tom DeLay 401(k) Poker jargon Hyperinflation Video game crash of 1983 Corporation TLC Surveillance Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code Timeline of the Enron scandal Money Cheque First-sale doctrine Credit card fraud Fathers' rights Assignment (law) Personal finance Theory of conduct Social Security (United States) Intellectual property Variable universal life insurance Economics Plame affair Universal Studios Derivative (finance) Corporate personhood Finance Publishing Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal Ashton-Tate MCI Warren Buffett Xerox
