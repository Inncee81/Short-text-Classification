rangers where do you think they rank among the all time best teams i mean im a rangers fan so im biased but i honestly think that they were so deep and so talented that besides the dynasty teams they gotta be on top what do you think the new york oiler hawks neil smith mortgaged the future to build that team which had one shot at lifting the cup great roster but stacked with mercenaries that can't be compared to any dynasty in retrospect the price might have been too high but that is neither here nor there they won and as a native new yorker i was ecstatic the subsequent lockout and keenan's antics took a lot of the lustre off but the true beginning of the end came with the trading of zubov in he and nedved were moved for robitaille and samuelsson because messier didn't like the two zubov who took a numbing injection for half the playoffs was deemed soft because he chose to attend to his injured wrist the following season that was one of the worst trades in team history and also shone a light on the 'messiah's true colors what i take from that season are the contributions of home grown talents like leetch zubov kovalev and richter how he can be called overrated is beyond me along with the character and grit of adam graves of course i'll never forget matteau matteau matteau or any of the other fond memories of that spring summer it just seems that every unseemly act that followed the cup win magnified the underlying mercenary theme of that championship club my emotional issues aside i'd take the avalanche either cup year over that ' team not to mention detroit's own all star squad in ' the pens in the early 's were also pretty impressive in fact that ' heartbreaker against pittsburgh was one of the catalysts leading to smith's decision to collect a slew of hired guns Stanley Cup Los Angeles Kings Pittsburgh Penguins Pittsburgh Steelers Detroit Red Wings Boston Bruins Overtime (ice hockey) Chicago Blackhawks Philadelphia Flyers Oakland Athletics Sergei Zubov Montreal Canadiens Edmonton Oilers Wayne Gretzky Washington Capitals Qu__bec Nordiques New York Islanders Cincinnati Bengals Orlando Magic Calgary Flames Buffalo Bills National Hockey League rivalries Los Angeles Clippers 2003-04 NHL season New York Knicks New York Giants World Series National Hockey League Houston Astros Tennessee Titans Detroit Tigers National Basketball Association New Jersey Nets Mark Messier Brian Leetch Colorado Avalanche New England Patriots International League Jacksonville Jaguars National Hockey League All-Star Game Chicago White Sox Norway national football team NBA Finals Texas Rangers (baseball) St. Louis Blues (hockey) St. Louis Rams New York Americans Cleveland Browns Florida Marlins Toronto Maple Leafs 1987-88 NHL season Alex Ferguson Cleveland Indians New York Jets New York Yankees R.S.C.
