goalie substitution does anyone know of a situation where an nhl team had to use a regular skater in net after losing both the starter back up goalie in the same game surely it must have happened but i can not find any record since most teams only carry goalies on their active roster i would assume this situation had happened in the long history of the nhl to rac how can they call up another goalie in the middle of a game i know of an very old incident when teams only carried one goalie and when he went down the team's coach put on the pads and played the team was the new york rangers and the coach was lester patrick teams are allowed to press into service when required an actually goalie who wasn't dressed to start the game i've heard them talk about this during a few different games i believe the team is given enough time to get another goalie to the rink if one is needed mind you they aren't going to be calling patrick roy it would end up being a junior or senior leaguer or perhaps even an minor leaguer if one can be found quickly in the playoffs many teams actually have a third goalie in the building ready to dress should he be needed Ice hockey Montreal Canadiens Goaltender Detroit Red Wings 1992-93 NHL season National Hockey League Chicago Blackhawks Lacrosse Stanley Cup Jacques Plante New York Americans Playoff NHL series Roller hockey Toronto Maple Leafs Pittsburgh Penguins Boston Bruins Mario Lemieux New York Islanders Floorball National Hockey League All-Star Game New York Knicks 1985-86 NHL season 2003-04 NHL season Houston Astros Qu__bec Nordiques St. Louis Blues (hockey) Western Canada Hockey League Hartford Whalers Indiana Pacers Mark Messier Ottawa Senators Florida Panthers 2004-05 NHL lockout Overtime (ice hockey) Cincinnati Bengals Super Bowl XXVII Florida Marlins Baseball New York Giants Seattle Mariners Jokerit Dominik Ha__ek Edmonton Oilers Minor league baseball Tampa Bay Lightning World Hockey Association Roger Neilson Pittsburgh Steelers Miami Dolphins 2002-03 NHL season Calgary Flames Toronto Blue Jays Kansas City Chiefs Miracle on Ice Water polo Super Bowl XXV 1957 World Series Buffalo Bills Grant Fuhr New York Yankees Washington Capitals Super Bowl IX Penalty (ice hockey) Negro league baseball Trenton Titans World Series New Jersey Nets Patrick Roy Oakland Athletics New Jersey Devils 2005 World Series Ottawa 67's Chicago White Sox Pittsburgh Pirates 1939-40 NHL season Toronto Raptors 1987-88 NHL season Satchel Paige International League Jarome Iginla Cleveland Indians Boston Red Sox The Mighty Ducks (movies) Detroit Tigers
