is there any chance connecticut will get an nhl team i was when the whalers moved away and i was hartbroken since they are supposed to be doing a lot of new things in hartford i was wondering if any thing is being done to bring a hockey team to connecticut no the nhl is still soured on them since the last team they had moved to north carolina because of a lack of attendance an expansion team may go to you guys aways down the road but the market area up there is saturated islanders rangers and boston are all too close Hartford Whalers Carolina Hurricanes National Hockey League Hartford, Connecticut NHL Entry Draft 1983 NHL Entry Draft Qu__bec Nordiques World Hockey Association 2004-05 NHL lockout Los Angeles Kings 1991 NHL Entry Draft 1987-88 NHL season 1985-86 NHL season Boston Bruins New England National Hockey League All-Star Game Paul Coffey American Hockey League St. Louis Blues (hockey) 1992 NHL Entry Draft 1979-80 NHL season Gary Bettman Atlanta Flames Montreal Canadiens Springfield Indians Detroit Red Wings Edmonton Oilers 1988-89 NHL season 1982 NHL Entry Draft Pittsburgh Penguins New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad 1978-79 NHL season San Jose Sharks Toronto Maple Leafs National Hockey League rivalries New York Americans Lady Byng Memorial Trophy Dallas Stars New Jersey Devils University of Connecticut 2003-04 NHL season Presidents' Trophy Overtime (ice hockey) New York Rangers New York Islanders Hartford Civic Center Philadelphia Flyers Interstate 95 Dave Keon 2005 NHL Entry Draft Pittsburgh Pirates (NHL) 1947-48 NHL season Ontario Hockey League Chicago Blackhawks Oakland Seals Jim Dowd (hockey player) Dave Williams (hockey player) International Hockey League 2002-03 NHL season ECHL Madison Square Garden Major professional sports league Original Six Gordie Howe Maurice Richard Minnesota North Stars Guy Lafleur Raimo Helminen Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy Phil Esposito Don Cherry (hockey) New York and New England Railroad NHL series 1926-27 NHL season 1992-93 NHL season Brendan Shanahan Oakland Athletics Stanley Cup Kitchener Rangers Manny Legace Calgary Flames Calder Memorial Trophy 1999 NHL Entry Draft Ice hockey Playoff 2002 NHL Entry Draft Trevor Linden Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim U.S. Highway 1 Springfield Falcons Saginaw Spirit U.S. Highway 6 Brad Park Sidney Crosby 1973 NHL Amateur Draft Captain (ice hockey) Chris Pronger National Historic Landmark
