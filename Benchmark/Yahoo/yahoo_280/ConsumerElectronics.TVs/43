can you play a dvd on an hdtv using a pc and hdmi cable we recently bought an hdtv and i'm going to buy an hdmi cable do we need to buy an upconverter for watching movies or could we use one of our laptops instead which both have dvd players will a pc have lesser quality than watching the movie through an upconverter are there any special things we'd need to do to set the resolution with the pc thanks you will get the best picture by getting a dvi cable and connecting a dvi to hdmi adapter to hook it up to your tv you will also need to connect the sound to speakers or to a receiver seperately set your screen resolution to x which equals p and i find that watching with a pc on a hdmi connection gives better quality than an upconverting dvd player if you are using a program like windvd or something very smooth picture Television DVD High-definition television Home cinema Digital Visual Interface High-Definition Multimedia Interface Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Digital television SCART Laserdisc High-Bandwidth Digital Content Protection 1080p Widescreen British Sky Broadcasting TiVo Xbox ATSC Anamorphic widescreen Video Video Graphics Array PlayStation Portable PowerBook G4 MPEG-2 IPod Liquid crystal display television Dolby Laboratories Home Box Office Laptop Blu-ray Disc Karaoke Digital photography Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Motion picture rating system Dubbing (filmmaking) Digital cinematography Handheld game console Xbox 360 Computer and video games H.264/MPEG-4 AVC High fidelity PlayStation 3 NTSC Digital cinema Liquid crystal display Letterbox Musical Instrument Digital Interface Aspect ratio (image) ATI Technologies VHS Warez Anime Display resolution Super Nintendo Entertainment System Nintendo Revolution Mystery Science Theater 3000 Video codec Bluetooth Desperate Housewives Sega Dreamcast Law & Order Game Boy Video CD SonicStage Mouse (computing) Amstrad CPC Sound Blaster DVD player HD DVD Movie projector PlayStation 2 Broadcast flag IBM PC compatible Back to the Future Graphics card Console game Videotape CTV television network Camcorder S-VHS Machinima TFT LCD Digital cable IEEE 802.11 Super Video CD Desktop computer VAIO Game Boy Advance Poker jargon Our Gang Atari ST Atari 8-bit family S__CAM Digital rights management Stereoscopy Anchor Quatermass and the Pit Showtime (television) StarChoice Digital video
