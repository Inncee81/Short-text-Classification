television repair help please i have a television with a vcr dvd combo on it i had a tape stuck in the vcr but finially managed to get the tape out problem is that everytime i turn on my television it shuts off after about seconds i was browsing through questions and found someone who had a very similar question someone told this person that they would probably have to set the vcr mode but how do i do that not set the vcr mode reset the mode switch that involves taking apart the vcr section and rewinding the loading motor mechanism to it's stopped state then reinstalling the loading tray if it isn't damaged the mode switch should now function which allows the vcr to provide some of the low voltages that are used by the tv set to run when it's bad it shuts down the vcr and the vcr shuts off the tv it's not easy to retime the mode switch SCART Videocassette recorder VHS Digital video recorder Copy protection Floppy disk Laserdisc Embedded system Electric motor Betamax Oscilloscope Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Toyota Prius CPU design Booting S-VHS Television Radiation hardening Macrovision Uninterruptible power supply Digital circuit Camcorder Ethernet Windows XP Electronic amplifier Windows 2000 Commodore 64 Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Whose Line Is It Anyway? 8 mm video format Halting problem Relay Central processing unit Kernel (computer science) Airsoft Compact disc GunZ The Duel Atari 8-bit family Switch Galileo spacecraft Diablo II: Lord of Destruction PlayStation Portable Canon T90 IPod Manual transmission Thermostat ZX Spectrum Betacam Crossbar switch Transistor M16 (rifle) Hybrid Synergy Drive Diablo II Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Steam (content delivery) Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Virtual memory DV Elevator Hybrid vehicle Control-Alt-Delete Universal Serial Bus Teletext Firearm Variable Frequency Drive Guilty Gear Switched-mode power supply RS-232 Capacitor plague Hard disk Federal Standard 1037C Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Acorn Electron Wind turbine TGV Vacuum tube Remote control Cable television IBM PC compatible Terran (StarCraft) Heinkel He 100 USB flash drive Computer multitasking Nintendo Entertainment System Potentiometer Electrophysiology High-voltage direct current Video 2000 Welding Emacs STS-61 Motorcycle Mach kernel Transformer Rail terminology Pump It Up
