panasonic crt ripped out cable connector i have a panasonic crt and in trying to move it i stupidly ripped out the cable connector in the back the little thing that sticks out that the cable screws onto anybody know if this can be repaired and what it might cost to repair thanks probably not worth repairing but if you have an old vcr or a dvd recorder with a built in tuner and your tv has video line level inputs you could use the tuner in the dvd or vcr to view cable channels to directly answer your question yes it can be repaired for a few dollars more you could probably buy a new set Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting SCART Television S-VHS Videocassette recorder Oscilloscope DVD Panasonic Camcorder S-Video Home cinema Digital video recorder High fidelity TiVo Set-top box Cable television S__CAM RCA connector Videotape Composite video High-definition television Composite monitor VHS Secure Digital card Sound Blaster Atari 8-bit family Atari 2600 Cathode ray tube Xbox Digital Visual Interface Macrovision DV XLR connector Ethernet D-subminiature Teletext Advanced Technology Attachment Nintendo Entertainment System RS-232 TRS-80 Xbox 360 Coaxial cable Compact disc Federal Communications Commission PAL Universal Serial Bus Liquid crystal display television PC Engine Digital photography Floppy disk Copy protection PlayStation Portable Sega Dreamcast MythTV Betacam Nintendo GameCube SCSI Phantom power Live Aid Lighting Commodore 64 Sound card DVD recorder Archos Betamax Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis TurboGrafx 16 Laptop IMac Jack plug DVD player High-Definition Multimedia Interface ATI Technologies Microeconomics Nintendo Revolution MII (videocassette format) Modem PlayStation 2 Pirate decryption Digital television DMX (lighting) Balanced audio 1080p 8 mm video format Quizbowl Embedded system Violin Leica Film TIA-568A/B Gamma correction Karaoke Liquid crystal display PowerBook Cruising (maritime) TV tuner card Computer-aided design
