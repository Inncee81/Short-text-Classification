the alignment on my hitachi hdtv has gone array how can i realign it the picture is overlapping i have had it in the shop they say its fixed but its not they tell me once you move a big screen tv that is can't be alligned because of the transport i think this is bull so i will try myself there is buttons on the remote and i can get into programming different things but i can't seem to get it to take the alignment i have never in all my years of service found a tv i could not align very closely if not perfectly the idea of moving the set knocking it out of alignment is utter nonsense unless you tossed it out of your truck or dropped it take it back where you had it repaired and insist upon a full convergence alignment if they do not and they are hitachi authorized try giving hitachi a call hitachi the technician that performed the repair might have missed one or more burned out resistors in the convergence circuit Hitachi, Ltd.
