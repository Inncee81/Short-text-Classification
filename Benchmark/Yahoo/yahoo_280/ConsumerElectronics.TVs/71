my tv is messed up well last week our house got struck by lightning and it killed most of our electronics and made all of our tv's have rainbows all of the screen mine was not that bad just a pink line across the bottom of the screen is there any way to fix it i bought it at a pon shop i didnt have a warenty if the set is not dead just has the discoloration it probably needs to be degaussed demagnetized the proximity of the strike causes a very large magnetic disturbance which can adversely effect the color manufacturer's warranty does not cover lightning or power surges some extended warranty plans do cover lightning if you have extended coverage call your warranty provider and ask them most home owner's insurance will cover damages to any devices that are damaged make sure to check all electrical devices while you are filing your claim i do not know who your insurance carrier is and how much your deductible is but anything you can claim will help everything even down to cell phone chargers most folks around here have farm bureau insurance they and some others will require a statement to be signed by the repair person stating lightning damage contrary to popular belief most sets can effectively be repaired after lightning as long as the system computer has not been damaged or the board is not burned the only real question is is the set worth spending the money on Warranty Insurance Cathode ray tube Auto insurance Degaussing Health insurance Naval mine Life insurance Wal-Mart Telephone Publicly funded medicine Octopus card Public transport Poker jargon Universal Serial Bus Second Battle of the Atlantic Transmitter Spark gap Disaster Lightning Unemployment benefit Magnet Radiation hardening HIPAA Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Mortgage Electricity Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act High-voltage hazards 2003 North America blackout Toyota Prius Mobile phone radiation and health Social Security (United States) Radio Solar power Surveillance Vacuum tube Diode Windows XP Nintendo DS System/34 7 July 2005 London bombings GunBound Liquid crystal display NEC Corporation Estoppel Product liability United States Postal Service Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Medical malpractice Computer Hard disk Liability insurance Terran (StarCraft) Trademark Embedded system Computer virus Directed-energy weapon Bluetooth Year 2000 problem Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Copyright Tax System/36 Air traffic control Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Hurricane Rita War of the Worlds (2005 film) Manitoba Hydro Digital circuit USS Chicago (CA-136) Yohoho!
