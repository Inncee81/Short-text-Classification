getting a '' lcd that barely fits in my tv cabinet audio question i live in a small apartment where the walls in the living room are sort of rectangular and there is only one place i have space for my tv cabinet and i cannot put the plasma anyhwere else because i have some pretty expensive art hanging off the other walls the problem is the tv dimensions are mm and the tv cabinet can accommodate up to cm on each side of it will that affect the sound of the tv yeah i meant lcd the tv cabinet currently holds a inch tv there would only be cm space on the sides if i get the '' but plenty of room behind and above it just place the tv near the front opening and there won't be any noticeable difference having it toward the rear of the cabinet might cause a few unwanted reflections but that too would be minimal as long as it fits you'll be fine lcds run pretty cool so one centimeter clearance should be okay if you're worried about air circulation just cut a couple of holes in the back of the cabinet one high one low that will provide plenty of air for the tv Equine conformation Vacuum Kitchen Liquid crystal display Floppy disk Stereoscopy Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Transformer Solar power McMansion Gramophone record Television Wood carving Door Plasma display Solar cell Lighting Car handling Sento Drill bit Internal ballistics Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Laptop Table saw Surface-mount technology Dundas Square Thermal power station Glossary of partner dance terms Paintball marker Stairway Fire fighting M16 (rifle) Movie projector Jet engine Mattress Bong View camera Panama Canal Directed-energy weapon Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Antenna (radio) Wood Compact disc The Time Machine Spacecraft propulsion Discovery One Bicycle lighting Subwoofer Vowel Katana Boeing 737 Laser Hard disk Poker jargon Cloud Bass guitar P-38 Lightning IMac Nine Inch Nails Welding Oscilloscope Bicycle frame American handball Formula One cars Microeconomics Opportunity rover 10 Downing Street Handloading Diamond simulant Tire Acoustics Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Global climate model Changeroom Babylon 5 Dam Strap-on dildo Light-emitting diode Badminton Printed circuit board John Cage Timpani Racquetball Air-raid shelter Mitsubishi 3000GT Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Digital photography Engine cooling Mouse (computing) Sega Saturn Carburetor Kidney Organic light-emitting diode Air conditioning CPU design Vacuum tube Gameking Abbey
