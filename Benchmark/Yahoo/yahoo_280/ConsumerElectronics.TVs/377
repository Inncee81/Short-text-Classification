panasonic tv vcr combo when i play a dvd through the line in option the picture fades in and out but some dvds it plays fine i have tried different dvd player but same situation i have tried the line in as well as the rf input tv works ok and vcr works ok but some dvds of them have the same problem the picture gets dark for about seconds and fades back up to full brightness throughout the movie it is kind of maddening the tv is months old the dvd players are brand new you cannot play a dvd player through any recording device due to the copy guard encoded into the dvd itself it will adversely effect the color brightness and contrast the recording device in your case is the vcr stage in your tv vcr combo the vcr does all the picture processing so the signal is treated like it would be if it were just a vcr i could go into lots more technical stuff to explain why but i seriously doubt any more explanation would help right now Videocassette recorder Macrovision Laserdisc DVD VHS S-VHS S__CAM Television High-definition television SCART Compact disc Camcorder PAL Digital video recorder DVD recorder NTSC Video codec Gramophone record IPod Blu-ray Disc Videotape Film DVD player Video CD Copy protection Pump It Up MiniDisc Panasonic Digital photography Stereoscopy Digital camera Betamax Composite monitor Movie projector Color Digital rights management Anamorphic widescreen Oscilloscope S-Video Glossary of American football Light-emitting diode Magnetic resonance imaging PlayStation Portable Super Bowl XXVI Cable television TiVo 8 mm video format Telecine YUV MPEG-2 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Live Aid Gamma correction Composite video Frequency modulation PlayStation 2 Modem EIA-708 Windows XP Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Holography ITunes Photography Sony Corp. of America v.
