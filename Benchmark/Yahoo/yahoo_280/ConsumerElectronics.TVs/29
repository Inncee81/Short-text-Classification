how do i adjust my television bulbs i recently got a bigscreen tv that my boss had sitting around in his garage upon plugin i found that the picture quality was fairly good but the color projected by the bulbs was way off and not only that three inch globes of red blue and green were visible i pulled off the screen from the front and everything inside was dirty and dusty cleaned mirrors bulbs etc problem is still there and i don't know where to begin at all help this is obviosly a projection crt tv if the colors dont line up then its a convergence problem most pro jo crts have a convergence option in the menu options its called convergence settings this will allow you to manually set the convergence it is a teddious task it will give you a screen for each color with a bunch of crosses in it you have to line up the color with the crossed for each color once you complete a full screen for a color i reccomend saving the setting before going to the next color you dont want to have to go back and do it all over again again most tvs have this setting you didnt say how old it was or the manufacturer so i dont know for sure but some older sets dont have this function and a technician has to come and do it but u should be safe just look through the entire menu settings looking for the convergence some technicians in this catagory might be able to give you more detailed answered Television Plasma display Cathode ray tube Gamut Oscilloscope Stage lighting Lighting Mouse (computing) IPod Atari 8-bit family Strap-on dildo Widescreen Pixel Fluorescent lamp SCART PlayStation Portable Windows 2000 Laserdisc Headlight Liquid crystal display Traffic light NTSC Stereoscopy Drag racing IMac Bubble Bobble CIE 1931 color space System 7 (Macintosh) Eye Digital photography Incandescent light bulb Technicolor Bicycle lighting PNG CPU cache DLP System/34 View camera Liquid crystal display television Ecco the Dolphin The Amazing Race Opportunity rover Game Boy Embedded system Computer display Compact fluorescent lamp Dog agility DVD Mozilla Firefox Color temperature Series (mathematics) Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Rainbow Islands M16 (rifle) Canon T90 Modem Dialysis Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Computer animation Blue screen of death Textile manufacturing School bus Tour de France Windows XP Color Volleyball Color Graphics Adapter Sega Saturn Screenshot Peanut Nintendo 64 Link (Legend of Zelda) Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 2 AmigaOS Railway signal AS/400 Command Language Nintendo DS The Brady Bunch Topps Dodge Charger Beatmania IIDX Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem Marching band Microsoft Paint Super Nintendo Entertainment System Jennifer Lopez DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution Windows Mobile Starfleet ranks and insignia Diode Interlace Heckler & Koch G3 Carburetor Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Light gun Floppy disk RGB color model Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX
