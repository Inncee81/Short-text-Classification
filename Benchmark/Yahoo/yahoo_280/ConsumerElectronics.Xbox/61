elite vs halo edition console hi im selling my xbox pro i want hdmi so what do you think its better the halo edition console im a halo fan or the elite console i think i would sacrifice bucks for elite also because teh halo edition doesnt have hdmi cable so in the end their price is very similar so what would yo do i would get the halo over the elite because the halo version will be worth a lot of money in the future remember how the halo green xbx sold for a pretty good profit same thing should happen for the halo since it's only being made in limited supplies Xbox Xbox 360 Halo (video game series) Halo 2 Machinima Nintendo GameCube Bungie Studios Computer and video games SCART First-person shooter PlayStation 3 DVD Microsoft PlayStation 2 The Covenant Microeconomics Killzone Dead or Alive (video game) Nine Inch Nails Console game Television ATI Technologies Video game music Sega Dreamcast Marathon (computer game) Nintendo Computer and video games that have been considered the greatest ever The Ark (Halo) Grand Theft Auto III Console wars Penny Arcade (comic) History of computer and video games FIFA Series Intellivision Rampancy Supply and demand Capital accumulation Computer role-playing game Timeline of computing 1990-forward Haibane Renmei Computer and video game packaging Capitalism Game Critics Awards Nintendo Entertainment System Unreal Red vs Blue Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Nintendo DS Video game console Monopoly (game) Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Lockdown Game programmer Super Nintendo Entertainment System Babylon 5 American individualist anarchism Pok__mon (video games) Atari Sega Saturn And All That Could Have Been British Sky Broadcasting Nintendo 64 Halo (megastructure) Atari 2600 PowerPC Radeon IPod Microsoft Game Studios Karaoke PlayStation Portable Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Deflation (economics) The Sims 2 Short selling Loss leader Alan Moore $ale of the Century Starship Troopers The Sims The Codex HALO/HAHO Terry Pratchett Dance Dance Revolution Sonic the Hedgehog Launch game TurboGrafx 16 Final Fantasy XI Grunt Windows 2000 Monetary policy Laserdisc High-Definition Multimedia Interface Poker jargon Commodity Exchange rate Mercury Cougar Economy of Africa Doom 3
