why has my xbox got the error code i am another sufferer of the red ring of death the last thing i did was upload another audio cd into the hard drive then i turned the system off i turned on my system minutes later and bang red lights i leave my xbox off for a while turn it back on and sometimes it works if im lucky i did the error code procedure when you press and hold the eject button with the search button on the console i got the error i have been doing a bit of research and people have been saying that kind of error code is a dvd drive error maybe the dvd drive doesn't like audio cd's or something but i know it probably isn't the gpu because when im lucky and the xbox turns on i boot call of duty and plays fine doesnt crash at all i just dont understand how my xbox can break from months of usage and i bearly touch the thing anyway the manufacture date is if nothing works out i am hoping to get a replacement from the place i bought it from got any ideas about that error you know it's funny people tell you oh this is how to find out what the error code is but then they don't tell you what to do with that information maybe that is why microsoft didn't set it up so you could just find out online or something because the average user can't do anything knowing that code on the other hand microsoft can fix some problems simply by seeing what the error code is hence why it is easy to find out if you know how my point is why did someone waste the time to say oh this is how you find the error code as if it matters in the end you call them up have them send you the coffin and they will then send you a replacement system Xbox Xbox 360 Computer virus PlayStation 3 PlayStation 2 DVD Modem Nintendo Revolution Mouse (computing) Blue screen of death Modchip Windows Vista System/36 Debugging Nintendo Entertainment System Game programming Nintendo GameCube Compact disc Microsoft Pump It Up AmigaOS Computer and video games System/34 Floppy disk NVIDIA Mozilla Firefox Sega Dreamcast Windows 2000 Nintendo Morse Code Error correction and detection Pinball Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Embedded system Linux Halo: Combat Evolved Booting Objective-C Domain Name System Copy protection ZX Spectrum Mortal Kombat Musical Instrument Digital Interface Timeline of computing 1990-forward Opera (web browser) Commodore 64 E-mail Knoppix Console wars Bubble Bobble Expert system MS-DOS GameFAQs Computer numbering formats Poker jargon MDAC Sega IPod Mach kernel Atari 8-bit family ATI Technologies Apollo Guidance Computer Intellivision Oscilloscope Software bug History of operating systems The Sims 2 X86 SCO-Linux controversies Ajax (programming) 1957 World Series Grand Theft Auto III Visual Basic Lisp programming language Fischer Random Chess Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Phantasy Star Online 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Alien (film) SCART NX bit Drag racing Toyota Prius Disk image Ctrl Alt Del (webcomic) Laserdisc Apple II family
