does your xbox sound quality mess up when watching a movie i find that certain parts of a scene from a movie dvd messes up in sound quality in my xbox it has no problem in any other dvd player has this ever happened to you and what can you do about it if anything the only issue i ever noticed with the sound was when i was not using an optical cable for the audio it would not play in surround sound you need that cable in order for the sound system to receive the digital signal and play it back properly if you don't have a sound system then all i can say is check your cables and connections and maybe think about buying some new ones and see if that works DVD Laserdisc Cable television Modem Television Xbox High-definition television NTSC Musical Instrument Digital Interface High fidelity SCART Nintendo GameCube Audiophile Sound recording Dolby Digital Xbox 360 Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting DualDisc Digital television Universal Serial Bus Anamorphic widescreen Movie projector Home cinema Super Audio CD Widescreen Computer and video games GSM services Dolby Laboratories Loudspeaker Sound Blaster Phonograph S/PDIF MP3 8 mm video format Ethernet MiniDisc Compact disc Digital Theatre System VHS PlayStation 2 Multitrack recording Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Digital video recorder Digital Telephone PlayStation 3 Warez Surround sound Motion picture rating system Audio data compression Gramophone record DVD player MPEG-2 Nintendo Revolution Enterprise content management Back to the Future FM broadcasting Coaxial cable Film Sound card Digital audio broadcasting Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind RS-232 Nintendo Entertainment System PlayStation Portable Optical fiber Broadband Internet access ATI Technologies Bluetooth ATSC Decibel Videocassette recorder Digital cable Impedance matching S-Video Radio Film preservation Oscilloscope Super Video CD ITU-T Federal Standard 1037C Karaoke Compact audio cassette Receiver (radio) Movie camera Atari 8-bit family Timpani Digital photography Vorbis Satellite television Super Nintendo Entertainment System Pioneer Corporation Public Switched Telephone Network Pornography Audio system measurements Headphones Camcorder Remaster TiVo Sega Dreamcast
