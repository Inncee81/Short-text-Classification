geforce gts bit i'm still looking for a dx video card for my new pc but got a real dilemma gts oc decent midrange card suffering from low memory mb and bit bus gts great high end card but not in my price range i saw this site http www tomshardware com forum bit real rumours it said an upgraded version of the gts should be coming in june with increased memory mb and a wider memory bus of bit however as of today i've only seen a mb version of gts but not bit in north america is there really a bit gts coming soon i would really like to get the bit version of gts i hope it arrives on canadian shores soon i think it'd be a mid range king no credible evidence of a bit version coming anytime soon also remember that the memory bus is not the only factor that slows the gts down it has a small number of shaders which also holds it down if you were speaking in american dollars i would just spend the handful extra to get the gts if that was canadian dollars then i would forego dx for the moment and go with something like the x pro or the gt they will outperform the gts or wait a little while when the s or the s come out depending on who you listen to the gts will drop down into your price range GeForce 4 Radeon 3dfx NVIDIA ATI Technologies GeForce FX GeForce 6 Series GeForce 7 Series GeForce 3 CPU cache PlayStation 2 Porsche 928 Audiophile Voodoo 5 Xbox PlayStation 3 Apple Macintosh Timeline of computing 1990-forward Public transport Motorola 68000 Pentium 4 TurboGrafx 16 Poker jargon Atari 8-bit family Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories PC Engine IBM PC compatible Microprocessor Modem CPU design Universal Serial Bus Analog-to-digital converter TRS-80 Color Computer Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME IBM PC Mac OS X PowerBook IMac Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Xbox 360 Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Social rule Windows Vista Chevrolet Corvette Sound Blaster Prisoner's dilemma Canadian dollar TRS-80 RISC ITU-T 1973 oil crisis Dodge Viper Messerschmitt Bf 109 Holden Monaro Cell (microprocessor) United States dollar Drill bit Front side bus Nissan 300ZX Xeon In The Groove (game) Monopoly (game) Digital audio broadcasting Pump It Up Anytime You Need a Friend Nintendo Revolution Computer numbering formats MP3 Central processing unit Inflation Overclocking Extended display identification data Power Macintosh G3 Computer bus Broadband Internet access Windows Server 2003 PlayStation Portable Hiawatha Line Ethernet Nintendo 64 Far Cry Microeconomics X86 assembly language Teletext Dodge Charger Hash table H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Random access memory Bus models used in New York City Transit DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Blackjack Cyrix High-definition television DV Graphics processing unit Loudspeaker
