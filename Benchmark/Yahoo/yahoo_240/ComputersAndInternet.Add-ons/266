laptop won't read dvds when i insert a dvd into my laptop the drive spins up the led flashes and then finally nothing happens if i check my computer it takes forever for anything to show up and if after minutes the drives show up sometimes they don't the optical drive is reading as being empty now here's the weird part it can read cds without an issue and burn cds dvds without a problem these cds and dvds can be read by any other machine with a combo drive but only the cds can be read by the laptop if i stick one of the burned dvds in it again it spins up the led flashes and finally does nothing i'm getting to the point where i want to ghost my system re install the os and see if that makes a difference before that however i want to know if somebody has an idea what's wrong with it i'm currently running a legal copy of windows xp professional on it the drive is fine it seems to be a software issue i've gone through the process of making a drive image and re installing the os to make sure right now it is reading dvds but i'm also in the process of adding applications and doing updates hopefully one of these will eventually break my system making it possible to see what happens it possible can be a defective drive reinstall the drivers for it first if it has worked before then i recommend re formatting to get your computer back to the factory settings Windows XP USB flash drive DVD Floppy disk Laserdisc Compact disc Windows 2000 IBM PC compatible IPod Windows Vista Copy protection Apple Macintosh Blu-ray Disc Digital photography SUSE Linux Booting File system Linux Computer PlayStation 2 PowerBook G4 CD-ROM IBook AmigaOS Rootkit Knoppix Microsoft Windows Disk cloning Enterprise content management Gramophone record Warez Movie projector Embedded system Laptop Computer virus Universal Serial Bus Sega Dreamcast Flash memory Mouse (computing) Redundant array of independent disks Blue screen of death PowerBook Digital rights management PlayStation Portable Atari ST Debugging Xbox 360 Screenshot Computer forensics LiveCD Surveillance Digital audio player Multitrack recording Xbox Modchip Bluetooth Automatic number plate recognition Spyware File Allocation Table Personal computer Sound recording CD recorder Software bug Btrieve Nintendo Revolution Adobe Photoshop Television DualDisc Domain Name System MDAC NTFS Backup Oscilloscope X Window System Windows registry OpenBSD DOS 64-bit Casting Expert system Mach kernel Apple Computer Virtual memory CPU design BIOS Master Control Program Computer bus MiniDisc C programming language Macromedia Flash Optical character recognition DR-DOS
