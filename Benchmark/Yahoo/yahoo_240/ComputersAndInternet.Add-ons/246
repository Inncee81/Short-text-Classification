new geforce fx graphics card on dell b i am wanting to get a new graphics card for my dell b preferably the geforce fx mb pci slot there is a lot i need to know does my computer have enough power supply to run it will my intel integrated graphics card get in the way can it be disbaled will the integrated adapter get in the way of a new graphics card if these are all big problems should i forget about a geforce what good quality graphics card or descent can i get that runs on a lower power supply please leave you suggestions i appreciate the help a whole lot the fx card requires at least a watt power supply and luckily for you that is the power supply that is built into the computer so you are ok as far as power supply the integrated graphics card will not get in the way it is integrated into the motherboard as the name suggests and will not block the pci slot when you install the card into the pci slot you will have to plug the monitor into the the card not where it was plugged in before in order to use the card you will have to disable the integrated card to do this you will have to click on start and then control panel if you have the category view click on performance and maintenance and then system otherwise just click on system go to the hardware tab and click on device manager search for the integrated graphics card right click and click disable this will cause the display to become messed up but as soon as you hook it up into the graphics card it will be fine the graphics card you wish to buy is a bit outdated however the computer you have does not have an agp or pci express slot so the geforce fx is probably the best card you can buy for the system and you will be able to run most newer games with the card good luck Personal computer GeForce 6 Series 3dfx ATI Technologies PC motherboard PCI Express Computer bus Graphics card NVIDIA Peripheral Component Interconnect Windows Vista Radeon GeForce 4 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis GeForce FX Windows 2000 GeForce 7 Series Universal Serial Bus IBM PC AmigaOS Windows XP Laptop Graphics processing unit Computer hardware Atari 8-bit family PlayStation 3 Radeon X Series Apple Macintosh Commodore 64 IMac Power Macintosh G3 Mouse (computing) Expansion card Amiga Amstrad CPC IBM PC compatible Industry Standard Architecture Apple II family Xbox Computer and video games Mac OS X PlayStation 2 Apple IIGS SGI Octane PowerPC Object Desktop Motherboard Texas Instruments TI-99/4A Sound card Nintendo GameCube OpenGL TurboGrafx 16 Timeline of computing 1990-forward GeForce 2 Scalable Link Interface USB flash drive Redundant array of independent disks Screenshot PC card ATX Game Boy Advance NForce2 Server Ethernet Microsoft Windows NForce4 Architecture of Windows 2000 Overclocking Wi-Fi VIA Technologies Digital photography Capacitor plague Nintendo Entertainment System IPod Cisco PIX Linux kernel Linux Telephone exchange History of operating systems IBM Personal System/2 Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Microprocessor Far Cry Spyware Central processing unit ZX Spectrum Commodore International Palm OS
