does upgrading video card make any difference i am building a computer for basically internet use no gaming it is reasonably high end in components but not sure at what point getting a better video card is a waste since it is not for gaming would a cheap card work just as well as a high end graphics d gaming card you know the old saying it is only as fast as the slowest component don't want to waste money but don't want any bottle neck also i have pci express slots and would use that for the video card you want to get a dedicated video card that does not use any of the system memory beyond that since you plan to do no gaming anything more would be a waste i would personally recommend this one http www newegg com product product aspx item n e if you go anything less you are starting to get into the area of ones that have cheap parts anything more and you are wasting your money considering your needs this will be a good card for vista if you plan to get that since if you use aero this will handle it without any slowdowns Windows Vista Personal computer Computer bus GeForce 4 Amiga Radeon PlayStation 2 Power Macintosh G3 PC motherboard Overclocking Computer and video games GeForce 6 Series Apple II family Windows XP Graphics card PlayStation 3 Computer IBM PC compatible 3dfx Nintendo Revolution HyperCard Computer hardware IBM PC Peripheral Component Interconnect Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME PC Engine Nintendo Entertainment System History of Microsoft Windows GeForce FX Redundant array of independent disks PCI Express Atari 8-bit family Computer and video game genres Nintendo GameCube Sound Blaster Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories ZX Spectrum Apple IIGS Final Fantasy (video game) Laptop Windows 2000 Sound card Mac OS X v10.4 Star Trek Customizable Card Game Galactic Civilizations Atari ST SGI Octane Mac OS X Industry Standard Architecture OpenGL Uniform Resource Locator Video game music Universal Serial Bus Copy protection IEEE 802.11 Intellivision Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Apple Macintosh Commodore 64 History of computer and video games CPU design Embedded system Acorn Electron Electronic commerce Game Boy Advance Video game developer Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Microsoft Windows Slot machine Graphics processing unit Xbox Neopets Texas Instruments TI-99/4A Risc PC Ragnarok Online Sega Saturn IMac Timeline of computing Contract bridge Computer-aided design Blackjack Nintendo Xserve Home computer Hubbert peak theory MSN Messenger Winning Streak Timeline of computing 1990-forward Mahjong Creative Technology Secure Digital card PowerPC PlayStation Portable Desktop computer Amstrad CPC Advanced Squad Leader Sheepshead
