my pen drive just fell into the water and now i went crazy can it be fixed my sis said let it dry by itself meaning dont use it for few weeks then the pen drive is fixed is it true i'm not sure what type you have but if it is your normal flash drive then it should be fine i use the cruzer micro ones and actually put it through the washing machine and dryer before and it came out fine works like new drying it isn't a bad idea and they contain no moving electronic parts so it should be okay go ahead and try it if it works it works if it doesn't it doesn't there is not much you will be able to do about it at this point anyway if it already doesn't one strategy you could try though if it's not too late is to freeze it this will condense the water and you may be able to knock off the ice by tapping it semi hard on a table once it is frozen can't hurt to try Carbon dioxide Floppy disk Dry cleaning Poker jargon Freeze drying USB flash drive Water (molecule) Desert Thermal power station Climate of the United Kingdom Tenshinhan Instant coffee Refrigerator Pok__mon types Blackjack Ice cream Atari 8-bit family Queen (band) GunZ The Duel Naruto jutsu Kitchen Kurt Angle Commodore 64 Boss (video games) Debugging EIA-708 Casting Montgomery Burns Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Babe Ruth Water Pump It Up Theory of conduct The Price Is Right Professional wrestling match types System/34 Guilty Gear Happy Tree Friends BBC Micro AMD Wire wrap Acorn Electron Coffee Fog Glossary of climbing terms System/36 Embedded system Tofu Diablo II Futurama (TV series - season 5) Computer virus Computer Washing machine Blood (computer game) Degree Fahrenheit Ocean thermal energy conversion Knight Rider Hey Jude Ra (board game) Gambling Dishwasher Hard disk Diving suit Bob and George Glacier Claudio Ranieri Ice Steam engine Freezing Transformer Ice resurfacer Jumpstart 3rd Grade Pinball Rail terminology Prisoner's dilemma CPU design Friends NTFS Ecco the Dolphin Air conditioning Fan (implement) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind True Crime: Streets of LA Computer chess Non-native pronunciations of English Food preservation The Shining (film) Equine conformation Ballpoint pen Gilding Fire extinguisher Sea ice Sonic the Hedgehog Thunderstorm Arimaa Social rule Precipitation (meteorology) Windows XP Drawing
