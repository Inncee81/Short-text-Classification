can anyone tell me about the ten days that shook the world by john reed ten days that shook the world is the account by john reed of what he saw during the russian revolution reed was an american communist and journalist who is the only american known to be buried in the kremlin throughout this book we read a series of observations and dialogues reported by reed virtually without comment although his bias is apparent this book is a classic case of missing the forest for the trees the view is too up close to permit the reader to see the big picture one does not look here for the history of the revolution we look here for its spirit in writing this book reed gives the reader a view of himself and other american communists his view can best be summarized in his comment that while watching a funeral he realized that the russian people no longer needed priests to pray them into heaven because they were building a world brighter than any which heaven promised this hope is in stark contrast to the now known communist record John Reed (journalist) Russian Revolution of 1917 Ten Days that Shook the World (book) Book of Mormon Plame affair Sharon Tate Jacques-Louis David Christian eschatology Tacitus Funeral of Pope John Paul II Ann Coulter Judaism The Catcher in the Rye John F.
