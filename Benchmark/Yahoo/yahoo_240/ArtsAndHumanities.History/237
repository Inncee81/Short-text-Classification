carolingian empire can anyone provide me with some articles or information in some form which does a good job of clearly detailing information about the carolingian empire especially around the reign of charlemagne and right around the treaty of verdun and the conflicts stemming from it to someone who doesn't know much about history and won't understand complex jargon or if that's impossible something hard to understand is better than nothing i would also like to know a little about their neighbors to the east as far east as modern day warsaw around the same era s s ad or so what was everyday life like what were the political structures what were the differences in how the common people lived in all of the different areas such as burgundy or normandy or aquitaine though all not just those what was going on politically how did the church impact all of that i would also like some easy to read maps i have a lot of trouble reading those old maps so anything new showing the cities of the era would be appriciated if possible which show the cities it would also be helpful if someone could tell me or give me a resource which says how big those cities were i don't need to know specifically but just a general idea small medium large huge and if there was any special significance of the city over other cities i know it's a lot to ask but if you guys know of collections which basically archive large amounts of information from the era i could just look though that i don't need links to individual articles i did check wikipedia but there wasn't a ton of information there thanks i agree with the first two respondents that you may need to use the resources of a real world library for your study but if that is inconvenient for you you could first try one of the online book services the one to which i subscribe questia com claims to offer the world's largest selection of online books and magazines and all of the texts are keyword searchable in what seems to be a very reliable database a subscription can be expensive unless you would be using the service regularly but i believe that questia offers a short free trial which might suit you for just a one off study whether you go by that route or via a real world library it may helpful for you to have a list of books and magazine articles as possible targets for your carolingian research here are some that ought to give you at least a chunk of what you are seeking questia available book the carolingian empire by heinrich fichtenau author peter munz translator uk publisher blackwell us publisher barnes noble book the medieval empire vol by herbert fisher macmillan book the era of charlemagne frankish state and society by stewart c easton helene wieruszowski robert e krieger publishing book charlemagne first of the moderns by charles edward russell the riverside press magazine charlemagne in italy article by ross balzaretti history today vol february books not available via questia charlemagne by derek wilson charlemagne father of a continent by alessandro barbero and allan cameron daily life in the world of charlemagne by pierre riche early carolingian warfare prelude to empire by bernard s bachrach atlas of medieval europe by donald matthew Franks Philosophy Carolingian Empire Middle Ages France in the Middle Ages Holy Roman Empire History of Germany Open access Science Sociocultural evolution Carolingian Greek language Legal research Hundred Years' War Louis the Pious Enterprise content management Second language acquisition Encyclopedia The Economist Perl History of Bavaria Mercantilism Philosophy of science BASIC programming language Plame affair Military history of France El Cid History of science Usenet Surveillance Extreme Programming History of Toulouse Bosniaks Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Biology Economics First Crusade A Course In Miracles Wikipedia Philosophy of language History of France Duke Strategic management Objectivist philosophy The Origin of Species Library Computer Ontario general election, 1977 Wealth Tacitus Carolingian art George Lakoff Dictionary Podcasting Second Crusade Comic book Doctor Who spin-offs Visual Basic Lisp programming language Visigoth War Carolingian minuscule Medieval Croatian state Roman Emperor Sunday Times Rich List 2004 Alcoholics Anonymous Anjou Librarian Reconquista Sociology Jehovah's Witnesses Wilfred the Hairy Max Weber Game theory Theory of conduct E-mail spam Objective-C Sing Tao Daily Military history of Germany Map Manitoba general election, 1920 On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Franz Boas History of Austria C.
