is salmatia a real place and was there a cavalry unit from there that was used in the roman army oops thanks i did mean sarmatia thanks there are two possibilities as to what you are referring too one are the sarmatians this makes the most sense because sarmatians were a tribe of iranians who migrated up into russia and then west into europe who mingled with the empire and were expert cavalrymen the romans made frequent use of them as auxiliary troops sarmatian auxilia were the prefered cavalry unit of the later roman army the concept of a heavily armored mounted knight who abides by a code of chivalry has its origins in the colony of sarmatian cataphracts which were stationed by marcus aurelius in britain the sarmatians hailed from what is now modern russia and poland http upload wikimedia org wikipedia commons d df jpg the other possibility is that you are refering to dalmatia dalmatia was a province in what is now the balkans http upload wikimedia org wikipedia commons a rempire dalmatia png dalmatia was also famous for being a rich recruiting area for legionaires when septimus severus seized the throne he did so with the backing of legions that were recruited in this area late in the empire's history virtually all legionaires in the western roman army were either dalmatian or gallic though known for their fanatically loyal legionaries there is no mention made of there being anything unique about dalmatian cavalry therefor i believe you are thinking about the sarmatians edit whoops i put severus alexander when i ment to put septimus severus my mistake Rome: Total War Cavalry Sarmatians Septimius Severus Praetorian Guard Roman Britain Knight Roman legion Roman Republic Western Roman Empire Dacia Military history of the Roman Empire Battle of Adrianople Cataphract Medieval Croatian state Roman Emperor Dalmatia History of the Balkans Alans Timeline of Portuguese history (Lusitania and Gallaecia) Roman Emperor (Crisis of the Third Century) Byzantine Empire Marcus Aurelius Ancient warfare Singidunum Military history of France Battle of Chalons Batavian rebellion Diocletian Battle of Alesia Julius Caesar Byzantine army Bosniaks Polish cavalry Historical basis for King Arthur Maxentius Scythia Surena Hadrian's Wall Iazyges Parthia History of Greek and Roman Egypt Roman province Caracalla Medieval warfare Valens History of Bosnia and Herzegovina Military history Roman governors of Britain Huns Siege Bosnia and Herzegovina Human migration Aurelian Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth Lugdunum King Arthur (film) Serbia History of Slovakia Roman Emperor (Dominate) Legio V Macedonica Mongol Empire History of Poland (1939-1945) Persian Empire Macrinus Turkic peoples Marcus Licinius Crassus Crisis of the Third Century Cossack Timeline of Slovene history Illyria Gallienus Prehistoric Europe Clodius Albinus Pannonia Venice Military history of China Jewish history History of Ukraine Tetrarchy Hispania Sassanid dynasty Ardashir I of Persia History of Albania History of West Eurasia Battle of Grunwald Quadi Battle of Munda Legio III Augusta Roman Emperor (Principate) Origin of Romanians
