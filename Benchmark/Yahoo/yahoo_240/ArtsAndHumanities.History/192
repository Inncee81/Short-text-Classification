how was archimides killed reportedly this is a story told by plutarch archimedes the mathematician was so abstracted and absent minded that once he began an equation he couldn't see or hear anything else his servants would haul him to a bathtub and he would scribble notations in the soap bubbles this is the same mathematician who when he learned that his own body mass inserted in the bathtub displaced an equal mass of water ran at once through the streets of the city to announce his discovery stark naked bathwater dripping from his hair howling eureka i have figured it out sure enough when his home city of syracuse was captured by roman forces and the general marcellus gave order that archimedes whose calculations formed the basis for so many engines of war was to be brought to him archimedes was found by a soldier in a house and archimedes was scribbling mathematical equations in the dust on his floor the soldier demanded that archimedes accompany him but the geometry wizard did not hear eventually the soldier became so frustrated that he lost his temper and slew archimedes with his sword before hurrying on to other loot when the general learned of it he was furious i would not have wanted to be that soldier Archimedes Geometry Mathematics Mathematician Calculus Romulus and Remus Joseph Louis Lagrange Hipparchus (astronomer) Buoyancy Pi Carl Friedrich Gauss Marcus Claudius Marcellus History of physics Force Black hole William Rowan Hamilton Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Gravity Ordinary differential equation Pappus of Alexandria Galileo Galilei Torque Natural number Coriolis effect Ephesian Tale Archimedes Palimpsest Hannibal Ancient Greek literature Taikyoku shogi Cicero Complex number Tai shogi Mathematics of general relativity History of calculus Marcus Licinius Crassus Macbeth Maxwell's equations Adjoint functors Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Boolean algebra Function (mathematics) Shaggy dog story Second Punic War Quaternion Richard Rahl Classical mechanics Blood on the Tracks History of science in early cultures Sphere History of computing Covariance and contravariance Physical science Regular polytope Parabola Finite element method Battle of Thermopylae Mathematical notation Miss Saigon Dirac equation Sicilian Expedition Vector (spatial) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe General relativity Second Bloody Valentine War Laws of Form Dai dai shogi Sento Srebrenica massacre Marius Aerys Targaryen Infinitesimal Derivative Naive set theory Trajectory Group theory Mithraism Heracles Lagrangian point Post-invasion Iraq, 2003___2005 Pah-Peh-Rheo Energy Fancy Crane Link (Legend of Zelda) Stress (physics) Comet Muslim ibn Aqeel Diophantine equation EastEnders Henri Poincar__ Algebraic geometry Floppy disk The Sand Reckoner Polynomial Combinatory logic Shannara Druids Acorn Archimedes Elric of Melnibon__
