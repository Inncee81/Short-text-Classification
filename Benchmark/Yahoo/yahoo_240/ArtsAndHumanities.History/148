what was the speech that said if the north won the civil war tere would be no more slavery this has been bothering me it is not homework i think you're referring to the emancipation proclamation lincoln gave a speech in which he declared that there was no more slavery in the united states of america it was given before the end of the war and even prior to the outcome of the war had been determined it has been said that lincoln making this speech which was then widely disseminated throughout the south both in print and primarily by word of mouth encouraged the slaves of the time to throw in their lot with the north and even attempt escape to join up with the gar lincoln gave great credit as was their due to former slaves who risked life and limb not to mention being captured and sent back to hell to join the union army and fight against their former owners and the owner's supporters i am unaware of any provision that this freedom would only occur if the union won the war he did it before war's end primarily for political and militarily strategic purposes American Civil War History of slavery in the United States Confederate States of America Slavery Abraham Lincoln Union blockade Dred Scott v.
