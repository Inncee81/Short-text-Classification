what specific persecution did the pilgrim fathers experience in britain leading them to leaving for america i'm british and don't know this part of history except for hollywood epic films etc judging from the other responses this won't be a very well recieved answer but it is my understanding that it had more to do with persecution of protestinism than the desire to force beliefs on others british religious leaders went to quite a bit of trouble to break away from the catholic body but retained many elements that hard core protestants found distasteful catholic sentiment was vigorously opposed and the only other choice was church of england which was basically catholic in flavor that did not answer to the pope for those who went further and were at odds with the doctrine and policy of the church of england things did not go well especially during the conflict opposing catholicism anything that was not seen to be explicitly c of e church of england was apostate from the summer and winter festivals of rural welsh folks to the protestant leanings of people in saxony and brittany which was tied to the more or less protestant heresies on the coast of france all of this is very closely connected to the witchcraft hysteria which was pervasive in britain and western france at the time the early c of e led by woolsey's followers was desperate to assert itself as the 'true' belief thus protestants and catholics and witches were lumped together leading to fullout massacres in the welsh forests french villages and abroad in this atmosphere puritans quakers and other offshoots of luther's teachings were seen as threats to the establishment of a unified church in england and more importantly as not recognizing the divine prerogative of the king of england this led to persecution in both private and state forms a protestant puritan may be ostacized by his local society and if a craftsman or merchant this could be a pretty serious dent in his ability to provide for his family his marriage if conducted by a non c of e clergyman may not be recognized by the state leading to problems with inheritance and property rights and a lower status for his children if he did not tithe to the local parsonage or bishopric he may have goods confiscated at an inflated rate but more importantly by not supporting the church that supported the king and his rights he was likely to be branded a traitor and depending on his level of activity with the puritan or otherwise protestant community he could be pillored flogged imprisoned or executed Separation of church and state Puritan Christianity History of the British constitution Baptist British monarchy Colonial America Divine grace Roman Catholic Church Christian denomination History of Christianity Oliver Cromwell United States religious history Great Apostasy Protestantism Bishop James II of England English Civil War Religious Society of Friends Henry VIII of England Anglicanism Catholic Church in Great Britain James I of England Pacifism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Huldrych Zwingli Mary I of England Salem witch trials Liberalism Christianity and anti-Semitism Elizabeth I of England Quaker history Religious pluralism Homosexuality and Christianity Status of religious freedom in Iran John Wycliffe Parliament of the United Kingdom Calvinism Anne of Great Britain Lutheranism Mormonism and Christianity French Revolution John Wesley Christian anarchism Same-sex marriage in Canada House of Bourbon Lollardy Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford Historical persecution by Christians Witch trial Catechism Habsburg Spain Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Wars of the Three Kingdoms Opposition to cults and new religious movements Biblical canon Roger Williams (theologian) War of the Spanish Succession High church Christian-Jewish reconciliation Fundamentalism George Fox Philip II of Spain Catholicism Conservatism Unitarian Universalism Idolatry History of Europe Edward VI of England Evangelicalism Church of Christ Roman Catholicism's links with political authorities Louis XIV of France Unitarianism Witch-hunt Status of religious freedom in France Same-sex marriage Peasants' War Mary, the mother of Jesus Revivalism History of Scotland Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief A Course In Miracles Religion Clergy History of Ireland Thomas Paine Anti-Mormonism Separation of church and state in the United States Persecution of Christians Ten Commandments Celtic Christianity
