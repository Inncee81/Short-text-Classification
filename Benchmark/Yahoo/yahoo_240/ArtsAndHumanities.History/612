how did the japanese treated singaporeans during world war about as well as they treated every one else in the philipines china burma they treated all asians as second class citizens to them and were considered inferior to the japanese they were very arrogant and acted as if they were shoguns and samurai and most were not they just wanted to be and took their racist hate out on these poor peoples all over the pacific isles in the war the japanse soldiers esp officers thought that surrender was a sign of humiliation and disgrace that is was better to kill yourself than to be allowed to be captured by the enemy that was their edict in the war only japanese treated well were germans italians their two axis allies what about the lessons of pearl harbor and sneak attacks what about non geneva convention rules followed how about the bridge over the river kwai how about the invasion of poland and france or germany starting two world wars oh then the invasion of manchuria during that particular time period japanese and german nazis were very cruel and rutheless period this question has nothing to do with today's generations of japanese and germans so before you want to give lessons learn some too hiroshima nagasaki never would have happened if guess what japan had not bombed pearl harbor and then dresden never would have happened for hitler would not have declared war on us he did due to his partnership with japan it was the last thing they wanted was the usa in the war now today everyone wants to look at the usa as the bully well had you all left us alone in the 's as we asked you may have gotten your wish we were dragged into that war just like everyone else we just happened to emerge the victors sure the usa has made its mistakes especially with native americans being part native myself however the contribution the native american code talkers gave to the usa was so huge that the japanese never broke their code sitting bull and jeronimo were not exactly non violent men so what is your point he asked a simple ww history question and you want to turn it into a human rights issue i think you have the wrong category i love going to germany and have dozens of german friends and am even a sensei of shotokan and okinawan kenpo so i certainly have no misgivings towards today's generation of germans and japanese but history cannot forget any of the atrocities be it from the axis or the allies sure the allies had their atrocities too but in comparison to the axis it is barely noticeable until you reach modern days i am part native american but i am usa bread and born no matter my ethnic background Participants in World War II European Theatre of World War II Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Axis Powers Second Sino-Japanese War Polish September Campaign Pacific War History of Japan Japanese war crimes Military history of the United States Imperial Japanese Navy Timeline of World War II Eastern Front (World War II) Russo-Japanese War Burma Campaign Korean War Attack on Pearl Harbor Battle of the Bulge Aerial bombing of cities War Bombing of Dresden in World War II History of Europe Martial art Joachim von Ribbentrop Allies of World War II Military history of Egypt during World War II Strategic bombing Franklin D.
