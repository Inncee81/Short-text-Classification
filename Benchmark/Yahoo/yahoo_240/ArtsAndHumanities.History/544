what effects did cataclysmic events like the black death hundred years war and great schism have on europe both in the arts and in cultural development each of these events had a different effect if you take the black death when one third of europe's population died it was a political economic and social change today we have the benefit of hindsight we know as fourteenth century people suspected that the mortality caused by the bubonic plague of the black death was the worst demographic disaster in the history of the world we also know that the mortality came to an end in the first outbreak soon after contemporaries could not have known this would happen so far as they were concerned everyone might well die some treated each day as if it were their last moral and sexual codes were broken while the marriage market was revitalised by those who had lost partners in the plague the sustained onslaught of plague on english population and society over a period of more than years inevitably affected society and the economy evidence of the effects can be measured and responses traced not only in social and economic political and religious terms but also in changes in art and architecture the effects of the black death in all these matters were disputed by contemporaries and are still hotly disputed today which makes the topic so endlessly fascinating 'the effects of the black death are still hotly disputed today ' it has been argued that the black death brought about the end of feudalism this was the system of service in return for a grant of land burdening the peasant with many obligations to his lord for example payments were due on entering a land holding upon marriage and death and on many other occasions the black death did not start the process of the commutation substitution of a money payment for labour and other services however there is no doubt that the plague speeded up the process by reducing dramatically the numbers of peasants and artisans by how much commutation accelerated is still a matter of fierce debate government and landlords tried to keep the lid on rising wages and changing social aspirations lords and peasants alike were indicted for taking higher wages in a sumptuary law was brought through parliament this measure decreed not only the quality and colour of cloth that lay people at different levels of society below the nobility should use in their attire but also sought to limit the common diet to basics such legislation could only occur when the government had observed upwardly mobile dress among the lower orders such legislation was virtually impossible to enforce but indicates that among those who survived the plague there was additional wealth from higher wages and from accumulated holdings of lands formerly held by plague victims http www bbc co uk history british middle ages black impact shtml now you need to do same work on the year war and the great schism Famine Capitalism Unemployment Democracy Feudalism Inflation Microeconomics Wealth Tax History of British society Late Middle Ages Emancipation reform of 1861 in Russia Deflation (economics) Minimum wage Gold standard Mercantilism Free trade Appeal Capital accumulation Keynesian economics Divorce History of economic thought Serfdom American individualist anarchism Economics History of Europe Anarchism and capitalism President of Germany Libertarian socialism Conscription Parliament of the United Kingdom Manorialism Economic inequality Affirmative action Labour economics Population history of American indigenous peoples Trade union Labor theory of value Social class Marriage Italian Renaissance Intellectual property Annuity Surplus value Voter turnout Israeli Arab Property (ownership right) Socialist economics Life insurance Bubonic plague Political economy Economy of Russia Social Security debate (United States) Working class History of Russia Bretton Woods system Education in the People's Republic of China Globalization Cancer Abortion debate France in the Middle Ages Russian Revolution of 1905 Marxism Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles and Fundamental Duties of India Origins of the American Civil War New Deal Szlachta History of the United States Peasants' War Euroscepticism Economy of Africa State American Revolution Max Weber Roman Catholic Church Great Depression Medieval demography Constitution of Ireland Parliament Act Middle class Insurance Fathers' rights Conservatism Global warming Renaissance Article One of the United States Constitution
