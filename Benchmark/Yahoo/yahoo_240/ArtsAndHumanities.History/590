the execution of major andr a blot on washington s reputation george washington's character was is admired on both sides of the atlantic yet washington insisted on hanging major john andr as a spy despite appeals to at least give him a gentleman's death by shooting and despite the fact that the british did not execute american officers for spying so was washington showing a vicious vindictive streak or did he have good reasons for insisting that andr must hang dutch is quite correct about nathan hale of course i apologize but hale was executed summarily no court martial within hours of arrest and in the course of a hunt for saboteurs due to the new york fires of days previously andre was executed after lengthy due process and washington certainly had ample time to reflect on the pros and cons of hanging versus firing squad versus clemency in times of war tough decisions have to be made yes this was a very controversial one but in hindsight perhaps this is also a classic example of how american historians just delight in destroying the reputations of americans while neglecting similar criticisms of other foreign leaders who do identical things truly was the execution of andre' any different at all than the execution of nathan hale has anyone ever bothered to even discuss the disgusting brutality of the british in north and south carolina these are events that are forgotten major john andre' was a spy and was partially responsible for the traitorous acts of benedict arnold it was a time of war yes he deserved to be executed it's one of the risks that a person in his shoes had to undertake the fact that he is honored in britain today is completely irrelevant in they were the enemy and that the enemy would honor one of their own doesn't mean anything to us today it's what enemies do John Andr__ Plame affair Treason Capital punishment Claudius Smith Benedict Arnold Anne Boleyn Anglo-Irish War Characters in the Southern Victory series Breaker Morant Appeal Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Marie Antoinette Joseph Addison American Revolutionary War Yi Sun-sin Execution by firing squad 2004 Republican National Convention Peleliu Indian rebellion of 1857 Slander and libel Capital punishment in the United Kingdom John Kerry military service controversy Vietnam Veterans Against the War Isaac Brock Robert Novak Hanging Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Days of our Lives George Washington The Death Gate Cycle John Wilkes Booth Red Scare Patrice Lumumba Lodge Committee Provisional Irish Republican Army Humphrey Bogart Capital punishment in the United States President of the United States Ann Coulter English Civil War Tax protester Nathan Hale MI5 Polish September Campaign Hogan's Heroes NKVD Vichy France Speaker of the British House of Commons Saratoga Campaign Espionage Pursuit of Nazi collaborators Acting President of the United States Royal Assent Seppuku Fair Game (Scientology) Fox News New York Giants Anti-Defamation League Conservatism Cicero First Battle of the Atlantic Oliver Cromwell Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Nanking Massacre God Emperor of Dune Separation of powers under the United States Constitution Gordon Drummond Palpatine Fallacy Sydney Riot of 1879 Daniel Morgan Venezuelan recall referendum, 2004 Cleveland Browns James II of England Politics of Hong Kong Louis Riel Same-sex marriage in Canada Abraham Lincoln United States Army Karl Rove Anarchism in Spain Mumia Abu-Jamal Same-sex marriage in the United States Opus Dei Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Codename: Kids Next Door Contract The resolution of the Dreyfus Affair Emma Hale Smith USS Liberty incident Biblical inerrancy
