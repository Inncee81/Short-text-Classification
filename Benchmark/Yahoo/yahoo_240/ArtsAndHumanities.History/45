us won wwii and saved the world here in the uk we are aware of some derogotary feeling from the us having to win ww for us the british this is my hypothesis if the uk had rolled over and been defeated in hitler would have held all of europe and our teritories including india austrailia a lot of africa etc with the japs winning in burma and asia with no australian or british resistance germany and japan would have help the whole world outside the us hitler would not have been fighting on fronts against russia russia would have japs and germans on each side and would have folded no matter how strong the us is it could not have resisted the rest of the world german and japan on each side so if we hadnt resisted carpet bombing of civilians if we had collaborated at first the us has us to thank their not talking japaneese but we did need your financial support and we probably wouldnt have won without you just had to point out we won the war too ps must add what a brilliant thing is that we won if you want to hear something truely inspirational typein winston churchil speech on youtube im and this was a long time ago but im choking back the tears when i think of what we all went through to win the fight for democracy and good nb amanda ann churchil was not for a treaty neville chamberlin and his government were all for apeasment churchill was the only man with the bottle to stand up and look hiltler straight in the eye and say nein yep it's unlikely the us alone could have beaten nazi germany and imperial japan in fact it boarders on not bloody likely history unfortunately gets watered down and what gets taught it sometimes specific to a country and filtered by current events you had to look long and hard in the 's and 's to find any reference in the west that the soviets deserve a major share of credit in beating hitler and as far as winston and a tear to the eye this from an american historian probably our best william manchester the french had collapsed the dutch had been overwhelmed the belgians had surrendered the british army trapped fought free and fell back toward the channel ports converging on a fishing town whose name was then spelled dunkerque behind them lay the sea it was england s greatest crisis since the norman conquest vaster than those precipitated by philip ii s spanish armada louis xiv s triumphant armies or napoleon s invasion barges massed at boulogne this time britain stood alone if the germans crossed the channel and established uncontested beachheads all would be lost for it is a peculiarity of england s island that its southern weald is indefensible against disciplined troops now the tommies at dunkirk britain s only hope seemed doomed on the flanders beaches they stood around in angular existential attitudes like dim purgatorial souls awaiting disposition there appeared to be no way to bring more than a handful of them home the royal navy s vessels were inadequate king george vi has been told that they would be lucky to save the house of commons was warned to prepare for hard and heavy tidings then from the streams and estuaries of kent and dover a strange fleet appeared trawlers and tugs scows and fishing sloops lifeboats and pleasure craft smacks and coasters the island ferry grade fields tom sopwith s america s cup challenger endeavour even the london fire brigade s fire float massey shaw all of them manned by civilian volunteers english fathers sailing to rescue england s exhausted bleeding sons even today what followed seems miraculous not only were britain s soldiers delivered so were french support troops a total of men but wars are not won by fleeing from the enemy and british morale was still unequal to the imminent challenge these were the same people who less than a year earlier had rejoiced in the fake peace bought by the betrayal of czechoslovakia at munich most of their leaders and most of the press remained craven it had been over a thousand years since alfred the great had made himself and his countrymen one and sent them into battle transformed now in this new exigency confronted by the mightiest conqueror europe had ever known england looked for another alfred a figure cast in a mold which by the time of the dunkirk deliverance seemed to have been forever lost england s new leader were he to prevail would have to stand for everything england s decent civilized establishment had rejected they viewed adolf hitler as the product of complex social and historical forces their successor would have to be a passionate manichaean who saw the world as a medieval struggle to the death between the powers of good and the powers of evil who held that individuals are responsible for their actions and that the german dictator was therefore wicked a believer in martial glory was required one who saw splendor in the ancient parades of victorious legions through persepolis and could rally the nation to brave the coming german fury an embodiment of fading victorian standards was wanted a tribune for honor loyalty duty and the supreme virtue of action one who would never compromise with iniquity who could create a sublime mood and thus give men heroic visions of what they were and might become like adolf hitler he would have to be a leader of intuitive genius a born demagogue in the original sense of the word a believer in the supremacy of his race and his national destiny an artist who knew how to gather the blazing light of history into his prism and then distort it to his ends an embodiment of inflexible resolution who could impose his will and his imagination on his people a great tragedian who understood the appeal of martyrdom and could tell his followers the worst hurling it to them like great hunks of bleeding meat persuading them that the year of dunkirk would be one in which it was equally good to live or to die who could if necessary be just as cruel just as cunning and just as ruthless as hitler but who could win victories without enslaving populations or preaching supernaturalism or foisting off myths of his infallibility or destroying or even warping the libertarian institutions he had sworn to preserve such a man if he existed would be england s last chance in london there was such a man Scots Guards Darth Vader Peleliu Hannibal Military history of the Soviet
