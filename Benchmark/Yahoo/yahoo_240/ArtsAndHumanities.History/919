what if there was no october revolution would the provisional govt still exist would there be no ussr red army stalin etc america would've have more of the upper hand of superpower status germany could've taken over the eastern front the baltic and e euro countries would not be independent the current russian people would've lived better lives the romanov dynasty would've existed still bush would smuggle more russian goods or the allies would've lost world war to both germany or japan is clearly not true everything else would depend on why the october revolution did not occur two things off the top of my head could have kept the october revolution from happening the provisional government getting out of the war or germany not sending lenin back to russia to ferment revolution in the first case i think the provisional govenment would have had a decent chance to build a relatively stable democracy in the second case the provisional govenment would have collapsed before the end of the war and there would have still been civil war Vladimir Lenin Russian Revolution of 1917 World War I Communism Russia Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact History of the Soviet Union Military history of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev Leon Trotsky History of Russia Red Army Cold War Axis Powers October Revolution Comintern Polish-Soviet War History of communism Joseph Stalin Former countries in Europe after 1815 Anti-communism Russian Civil War Yalta Conference History of the Soviet Union (1985-1991) History of Lithuania Trotskyism Communist party Bolshevik Cold War (1947-1953) and its origins Conscription History of the Soviet Union (1927-1953) History of Europe Germany Russian history, 1892-1920 Grigory Zinoviev Eastern Front (World War I) World War II Republics of the Soviet Union Estonia Eastern Front (World War II) History of Poland Total war Decolonization Allies of World War II Winter War American Revolution White Guard (Finland) Economy of Europe Left-wing politics Operation Barbarossa Five-Year Plan Russo-Japanese War Napoleonic Wars Stalinism Leonid Brezhnev Post-Soviet states Aftermath of World War I Manchuria Participants in World War II Commanding Heights: The Battle for the World Economy History of the Jews in Russia and the Soviet Union Political status of Taiwan Enlargement of the European Union History of Georgia Nicholas II of Russia Superpower European Theatre of World War II Saint Petersburg Flat tax World War III History of socialism Imperial Russia History of Germans in Russia and the Soviet Union History of Estonia Sun Yat-sen Lithuanian 1941 independence Tashkent Karl Marx Leninism History of Belarus Federation Baltic countries B__la Kun Battle of Berlin Western betrayal Sino-Soviet split Europe History of Poland (1795-1918) Luftwaffe Continuation War France City-state Anti-aircraft warfare
