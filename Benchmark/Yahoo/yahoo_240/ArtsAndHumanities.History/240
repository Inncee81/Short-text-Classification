was russia and her citizens better off under the soviet regime than now just seems to me that while political freedom was not tolerated people at least still had some stability in their lives was capitialism a huge culture shock well i think you should ask russians this because we can only give opinions based upon our frames of reference assuming that i would say that the average russian not high enough or vocal enough to threaten anyone might have been better off in some respects and i agree their lives seemed more stable as proof of this i cite documentaries i have seen where some russians wish to return to the old ways when their futures if austere seemed more secure and russia the ussr anyway was a dominant world power that brought them pride however there were few consumer goods and those there were were usually reserved for party members one might stand in line for hours to buy bread or soap and wait five years for a car if one could afford one and based on the writings of the dissidents the more aware and intelligent one was the more one suffered it always seemed to me that they had traded one serfdom for another and possibly a worse one also i have read that the crime rate in russia has really escalated with fewer restraints and political attention to the problem conversely the younger generation seem to appreciate the increased access to the outer world and the availability of more consumer goods and evince no desire for the old days so who knows there do seem to be an awful lot of russian women seeking to be someones bride anywhere but russia Bretton Woods system Inflation History of the Soviet Union (1985-1991) Soviet Union Russia Economy of Russia History of Russia History of post-Soviet Russia Free trade Foreign policy of Japan History of the Jews in Russia and the Soviet Union Russian Revolution of 1917 People's Republic of China Democracy Jew Supply and demand German Confederation Capitalism Keynesian economics Tariff Microeconomics Communism Politics of Russia Autism rights movement Finnish Civil War Simone Weil Anti-communism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Economy of Europe Russian Orthodox Church Collectivisation in the USSR Belarus Communist state History of the Soviet Union (1927-1953) Winter War History of the German Democratic Republic History of Poland (1945-1989) Liberalism International Monetary Fund Vladimir Lenin History of nuclear weapons Serfdom Cold War (1947-1953) and its origins Freedom of speech History of the Soviet Union History of the United States (1945-1964) World War I Motorcycle Privatization Emancipation reform of 1861 in Russia Left-wing politics Annuity East Germany Napoleonic Wars Chernobyl accident Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23 Nuclear warfare Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Economy of Asia Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth Brave New World Capital accumulation Overpopulation Publicly funded medicine Eastern Question Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe History of socialism Economy of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev Communist Party of the Soviet Union Plame affair Progressive tax Democratic Party (United States) Central Asia Neoliberalism Gold standard Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Economy of the United States World War II Enlargement of the European Union History of the United States (1918-1945) Russian history, 1892-1920 Independence Party (Iceland) History of Japan World government Kyoto Protocol Monetary policy Cold War (1962-1991) Superpower Islam as a political movement Dmitri Shostakovich History of Poland (1795-1918) Second Chechen War Total war Separation of church and state
