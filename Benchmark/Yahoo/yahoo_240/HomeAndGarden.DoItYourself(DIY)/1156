how do i cut my flowers so i want to plant some sweet peas flower and i read the back of the package which says care water regularly and deeply cut flowers at least every other day and remove all seed pods what does the last sentence mean cut the flowers cut them off what seed pods help please i've never really planted anything my life and i'm quite clueless as how to start thank you it's too late to be planting sweet peas i would keep your packet until next year and plant them in the spring you do not need to cut the flowers off or the pods when you plant your seeds make sure you plant them where they can grow up against a fence or trellis and let them grow wild they will grow high and look really lovely keep the pods on the plant until they have finished flowering the pods look just like a pea pod which grows on the plant then you have loads of seeds for some more plants when they have finished flowering and starting to die off take the pods off the plant let them dry out and then split them so you have all the new seeds for the next year keep in an airtight container until you are ready to plant out Legal tender United States dollar United States Postal Service Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Euro Article One of the United States Constitution Fiat money Federal Reserve Monetary policy Money supply Philippine peso U.S. ten-dollar bill Copyright Hyperinflation Salmon P.
