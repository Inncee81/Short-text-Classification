whats the difference or when would i use varnish eurethane or shellac all three of these products serve a similar purpose the properties of the finish are a bit different so you select the finish based upon what you want it to do for you varnish is a very old type of finish it can be difficult to work with and can get gummy after several years if not maintained it is a good choice for use on a furniture piece that needs a rich antique look finish but for general purpose i would avoid it shellac is another very old finish the main reason it is not often used is the orange red cast of the finish it is actually the easiest finish to work with very forgiving the finish is fairly hard and will take a reasonable amount of abuse it will stick to darn near anything and will seal in most bleeding stains and odors it was the earliest form of stain block and is still the base component of the best ones in my opinion shellac can be used on nearly anything interior floors trim windows furniture cabinets etc i suspect you mean polyurethane as your other option true urethane is hard to find outside of some specialty applications two varieties of polyurethane both are a general purpose sealer for wood either over stain or bare wood the old style poly is oil based and is still a viable option requires mineral spirits for thinning and cleanup and gives the finished product a bit of a yellow cast the product will sometimes turn more yellow over time water borne polyurethane is the new version another very good general purpose finish water to thin soap and water to clean up it dries clear and most will remain clear over a long period of time either polyurethane can be used on nearly any wood product inside but check the label if doing floors as some are a bit too soft and will state they are not suitable for floors can be used outside as well if the product is labeled for exterior use so my choice for most products in order of preference waterborne polyurethane shellac where appropriate sometimes it is actually first choice oil polyurethane varnish very rarely Paint Polyurethane Plastic Wood Mattress Lacquer Drill bit Violin Woodworking Gramophone record Pottery Hamster Upholstery Casting Dodge Charger Shellac Poker jargon Menstrual cup Knife Sento Carburetor CPU cache Screw Wood finishing Epoxy Condom Visual Basic Japanese toilet Thermal power station Radio controlled airplane Diamond simulant Bong Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Kitchen Steel Diamond Transformer Bulk vending Wood carving Anchor Japanese tea ceremony Opportunity rover Expert system Aluminium Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Amber Fancy rat Welding Jute Bicycle lighting Single Transferable Vote Glass Peanut Skateboard MP3 Pump It Up Cookware and bakeware Light-emitting diode Carpet Mouse (computing) Chromium Hydrochloric acid Gas metal arc welding Campfire Central processing unit Bass guitar Chevrolet Corvair Liquid crystal Lighting Leather Table saw The Amazing Race Psoriasis Handloading Dialysis Cell (biology) Perfume Fire fighting Oscilloscope Laser engraving Solar power XML Bladderwort Bubble Bobble Mushroom hunting Diving suit Tlingit Equine conformation
