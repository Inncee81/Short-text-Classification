how are cable tv cables grounded i'm in an old house and would like to use the cable outlet as electrical ground my landlord won't allow me to drill a hole in the wall to connect to a grounding rod but the cable box outside is connected to one already is the entire cable grounded and would it be possible to connect an electrical ground somehow i e soldering a wire to the connector shell not at all a good idea coax cable does not have a ground conductor the cable does have a shield which just happens to be grounded to dampen interference the shield is not sufficient to serve as an electrical ground if you do this you run the risk of ruining your tv and any other equipment connected to the coax if you experience a short circuit while connected to the shield the shield will burn out rather quickly if it burns between the connection and the ground rod and it will as this is the most direct path to ground any equipment connected to the coax will receive voltage to the chassis not good if there are others connected to the same cable drop they could be affected as well Canadian football Great Pyramid of Giza Badminton Great Britain at the 2004 Summer Olympics Permittivity Enceladus (moon) Zambezi Athletics at the 2004 Summer Olympics - Women's 800 metres Humpback Whale Hurdling Egyptian pyramids Metre Gatun Dam Cross-country skiing Celes Ch__re Archery at the 1988 Summer Olympics Geography of the United Kingdom Cox Plate Geology of Venus Swimming pool Diamond cut Great Belt Bridge Windsurfing St Patrick's Cathedral, Melbourne Gaillard Cut Athletics at the 1896 Summer Olympics Volleyball Colosseum Sequoia Meter (poetry) Grand Union Canal Glider Surtsey Copenhagen Metro Noah's Ark Concerto Avalanche Radio Caroline Basking Shark St. James railway station, Sydney Sniper Francis Petre Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Sprint (race) Great Britain at the 2000 Summer Olympics Roller hockey World Wide Web Oslotrikken Ordnance Survey Longwave Fixed-wing aircraft Metropolitan and Metropolitan District Railways Final Fantasy VI Original Sound Version Carolina Kl__ft Light-emitting diode Sperm Whale Laws of cricket British national grid reference system Athletics at the 2004 Summer Olympics - Women's 400 metres Krypton Western United States Panama Canal Locks Germany at the 1896 Summer Olympics Athletics at the 2004 Summer Olympics - Men's 400 metres Stealth technology Flood Diamond Young's modulus Balikpapan Athletics at the 2004 Summer Olympics - Men's 110 metres Hurdles Lake Burley Griffin Athletics at the 2004 Summer Olympics - Men's 200 metres Athletics at the 2004 Summer Olympics - Women's 200 metres Transmission line Giraffe Canoeing at the 2004 Summer Olympics Athletics at the 2004 Summer Olympics - Women's 1,500 metres Athletics at the 2004 Summer Olympics - Men's 4 x 100 metres relay Metric system History of the Panama Canal Bosporus Swimming at the 2004 Summer Olympics - Men's 200 metre Backstroke Spinosaurus 100 metres Stone ship Athletics at the 2004 Summer Olympics - Women's 10,000 metres Pinophyta Eifel Aqueduct Athletics at the 2004 Summer Olympics - Women's 100 metres Trampoline Australian megafauna Stockholm Metro Ton Athletics at the 2004 Summer Olympics - Men's 400 metres Hurdles Tyne Bridge Opah Siberia Potential energy Capercaillie Athletics at the 2004 Summer Olympics - Men's 1,500 metres
