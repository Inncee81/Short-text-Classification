what kind of glue can bond plastic to glass since both are non porous surfaces most glues dont work i need a strong waterproof glue that will bond lightweight plastic like oil funnel plastic to a glass jar it also needs to be inexpensive no more than you need a tube of two part epoxy it comes in different drying times depending on your needs but it sounds like the minute epoxy will do it's very strong water proof and will be dry in well a little over minutes also it will bond the glass to the plastic regardless of the fact that neither is porous but i'd still rough up the plastic a bit with some grit sand paper you can get it at walmart lowes or any hardware store for less than Plastic Epoxy Sandpaper Adhesive Reinforced concrete Wood Hamster Glass Seismic retrofit Sewage treatment Circuit design Knife Irrigation Casting Pebble bed reactor Fiberglass Boat building Ceramics Cyanoacrylate Leather Masonry Titanium Printmaking Capacitor Seismometer Floppy disk Fire extinguisher Cookware and bakeware Coffee Pottery Carnivorous plant Solar cell Stereoscopy Carbon dioxide Model aircraft Primer (paint) Deck (ship) Gramophone record Solar power Dishwasher Tofu Laser printer Jute Genericized trademark Drill bit Light-emitting diode Friction Solvent Hemp Cathode ray tube Fume hood Bong Screen-printing Mars Exploration Rover Concrete Alkane Geodesic dome Porosity Tire Mortar (masonry) Magnetism Beer Atari ST Brewery Ammonia Milk Fuselage Manicure Smoking pipe Central processing unit Sharpening stone Lignin Neutrino MP3 Ultraviolet Roof Houseplant Pachypodium bicolor Graphite-reinforced plastic Polyethylene terephthalate Compact disc Optical fiber Welding Laserdisc Ethylene Soldering Geyser Water purification E85 Manifold Glass electrode Harmonica Internal ballistics Cast iron Solid rocket Petroleum
