how hard is it to change an outlet from two prong to three prong assuming i am careful to turn off the power is this the kind of thing i can do without an electrician actually changing the outlet is rather easy make sure the power is off by switching off the appropriate circuit breaker or removing the appropriate fuse remove the old outlet transfer the wires to the new outlet and place it back in the box the bigger problem is making sure you have a proper ground so the new outlet will function properly without a ground the outlet will still supply power and most things will work fine there is a safety hazard however if an appliance requires a grounded outlet there is a reason for the ground and simply changing the outlet does not account for this whether or not you have a ground will depend upon the age of your wiring very old wiring used two wires a hot wire and a neutral with no ground a bit later a ground connection was included but there was no ground on the outlet the metal box housing the outlet was grounded and the frame of the outlet was grounded to the box but there was no connection for the equipment sometimes there was a separate wire for this sometimes it was taken care of with a metal sheath on the cable if you have a physical ground connection to the box you should be able to do this yourself if there is a bare or green wire connected to the box this can be connected to the green screw on the outlet to make a ground if you have metal sheathed cable you can attach a bare wire to the box sometimes there is a screw to attach to inside the box sometimes you will need a grounding clip and attach the bare wire to the ground screw on the outlet for either of these methods you will want to make sure the ground wire is actually connected to a ground with the power on carefully remove the cover from the outlet use an electrical tester the kind with two probes and a light is sufficient to check for voltage between the hot conductor and the metal box hold one probe against the bare part of the black wire and the other against the metal box if you get light there is a ground there if not the ground is not connected if you have a ground you are good to go if you do not have a ground a three prong outlet should not be installed in this location it is a code violation and a safety issue you should call an electrician to upgrade the circuit or install a new grounded circuit Textile manufacturing Sewing machine Professional wrestling holds Skateboarding trick Sewing HyperText Transfer Protocol Spinning wheel LOOM Textile manufacturing terminology Professional wrestling throws Weaving Suplex Crochet Swingout World Wide Web DragonFly BSD Earring Cotton mill Julia Roberts Wire Wget Lace-making Glossary of partner dance terms Wireless Application Protocol Forth programming language Manual transmission Jon Secada Tai shogi My Little Pony PowerPC RuneScape quests Roxette PHP Figure skating Diving RuneScape cheats English Country Dance Bookbinding Theory of conduct IBM PC compatible Apache HTTP Server Knight Rider Placeholder name Springfield Elementary School Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala(Annoyed Grunt)cious Spyware Taikyoku shogi Uniform Resource Locator Remix Aerial (dance move) Dai dai shogi Oral sex Kurt Cobain PostScript Nine Inch Nails Zhao Yun Roy Orbison Maka dai dai shogi Domain Name System Van Halen Rich Mullins Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Pretty Good Privacy Fictitious force Revolver Thread (computer science) Contredanse Proxy server Yoga Sutras of Patanjali JavaServer Pages Firearm action Motorola 68000 Squid cache Billboard (advertising) Fontella Bass Quantum field theory Glossary of firefighting equipment Gmail My Life as a Teenage Robot Hammond organ Gary Rossington Transmission (mechanics) Chu shogi Visual Basic Backward message Scapula Babylon 5 Windows API City Hunter Yarn Federal Standard 1037C MSN Messenger Clockwise and counterclockwise Typewriter Mattress Menstrual cup Hot air balloon Futurama (TV series - season 2) Sacred Harp
