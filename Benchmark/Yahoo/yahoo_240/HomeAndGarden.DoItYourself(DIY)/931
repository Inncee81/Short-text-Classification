screwing in closet shelving into studs create squeaking noise i am installing closet shelving into my closet and in the process i need to screw the shelving into the wood studs behind the wall i'm using manufacturer screws to do this and it becomes very difficult to get the last or so in using these screws the screw head was getting worn out so i thought it might be cheap metal so i instead using about drywall screws although the drywall screws went in without a problem it made a squeaking noise in the last while doing this is this something to worry about or is there possible something behind the stud i do not think it is metal piping because i am installing it on a bedroom on a top floor with no bathroom nearby anyway it seems like this last is making me worry some anyone have any thoughts so far no issues have appear but i am a little paranoid at this time thanks not sure if it matters i am using a cordless drill this is normal if you look at the screw it is tapered the further you drive it in the more it bites into the wood you can try two things here drill a hole first a little smaller than the screw diameter or but a touch of dish washing liquid on the thread of the screws first to act as a lubricant if you spill any easy clean up that's why i don't use oil Electrical wiring Hydrogen economy Bong Welding Plastic Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Solar power Thermal power station Carburetor Domestic water system Sulfur Screw Rebreather Autonomous building Natural gas Hydraulic machinery Kitchen Lighting Gas metal arc welding Diving regulator Manitoba Hydro Gasoline Tire Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Bus models used in New York City Transit Siphon Elevator Radio controlled airplane Furnace Apollo 13 Incandescent light bulb Haloalkane Diving cylinder Spark plug Seismometer Universal Serial Bus Hydropower CPU design Gas compressor Novelty (locomotive) Wind power Breathing gas Flatulence New London School explosion Embedded system Sinclair ZX81 Fossil fuel power plant Rocket fuel Circuit breaker Steel Fuel cell Hybrid vehicle Roof and tunnel hacking Rail terminology Bicycle lighting Home repair Alcohol fuel Sulfuric acid Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Arc welding TGV Tobacco De Lorean DMC-12 Ocean thermal energy conversion Sewage treatment Oil refinery Nuclear power Radio controlled car Atari 8-bit family Jet engine Pipeline (Unix) Battery (electricity) Hydrochloric acid Renewable energy Plumbing fixture Solar cell Internal ballistics TransUnion Commodity markets M60 machine gun Light-emitting diode Insurance Organ (music) Archimedes' screw Drill bit Air conditioning Glossary of firefighting terms BC Rail William Murdoch Borehole Internal combustion engine Casting Microeconomics Mac OS X Mach kernel Dairy Straw-bale construction Containment building
