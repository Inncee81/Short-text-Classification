how hard is it to change the floor flange under the toilet my upstairs toilet was leaking i pulled up the toilet cut away the rotten wood and still have to replace the floor flange it looks like the drain itself is pvc but i'm not sure my house is in the north east and it was built in ' i think the toilet and the wax ring are original which brings up another question how often are you supposed to change the wax ring if at all i have two other toilets i think one other is also leaking the flange i have is rotten to the point that i don't know what it's made of if the drain is pvc you just cut the flange off and glue one on with pvc pipe glue the problem you may run into is once cut the pipe may not be long enough if that is the case you will have to cut the pipe short enough to add a coupler and a short piece of pipe and the flange if you have a degree elbow just under the toilet cut the pipe back past the elbow add a coupler and a short piece of pipe then an elbow and then a piece of pipe for the flange same thing with abs black plastic wax gaskets are usually good for decades if installed properly but anytime you think it's leaking it should be replaced Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Autonomous building Sewer Basement Irrigation Swimming pool Drainage Solar power Welding Sewage treatment Derbyshire lead mining history New Orleans, Louisiana Urban sprawl Microeconomics Roman road Construction Mortgage 2005 Maharashtra floods Zuiderzee Works History of the Panama Canal Civil engineering Geodesic dome SimCity 4 Narrow gauge Mars, Pennsylvania Elis Prefecture Grand Forks, North Dakota Eifel Aqueduct Wal-Mart Airport Water supply Erie Canal Cable television Milwaukee, Wisconsin Extreme Programming Road Public good Panama Canal Manitoba Hydro Thermal power station CPU design Tag History of Chicago Air-raid shelter Yarralumla, Australian Capital Territory Motor oil M16 (rifle) Dairy Air traffic controller Humphrey Bogart Red River Flood, 1997 West Side Highway Keynesian economics Dundas Square Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans New York City Subway nomenclature Easement Energy development Mount Pinatubo Electrical wiring Education in the People's Republic of China Locomotive Personal rapid transit Hebburn Atlanta metropolitan area King City, Ontario Water purification Hurricane preparedness for New Orleans Gyeongju Columbus, Ohio Gas metal arc welding Sacramento, California 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Stream Watershed Crime prevention through environmental design A151 road Geography of India Salt Lake City, Utah Hydroponics Boston and Lowell Railroad Mach kernel National Weather Service Political subdivisions of New York State Solar cell Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Education in the United States Fire hydrant Sinkhole Parking lot Dam Hollywood, Los Angeles, California Bethalto, Illinois Fraser Valley Regional District, British Columbia Celebration, Florida Virtual memory
