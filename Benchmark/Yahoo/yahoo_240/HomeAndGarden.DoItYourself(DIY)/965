squeak in flooring i purchased a fairly new manufactured home am noticing that the floor squeeks around the kitchen area what are my options thanks probably where it squeeks is at the edge of a piece of the plywood in the sub floor it may be that one of the nails that holds it in place has worked its way a little loose and the squeek is the wood moving a little as you step put weight on that part of the floor if your flooring carpet tile etc can be pulled up you might can stop the squeek by securing that section of the plywood sub floor you might want to use wood screws instead of nails when the sub floor is tight so that it no longer has any room to give move when weight is put on it then your squeek will probably stop if you cannot pull up the flooring without destroying it you might want to just keep this in mind for a future project when the flooring is replaced updated this is assuming that there is no sign of other damage that needs more immediate attention rot termites water damage etc Mattress Real estate broker Mortgage Air New Zealand Bad Wolf Screen Actors Guild Structural engineering Seismic retrofit Wood Atari 8-bit family Oscilloscope Amiga Best Buy Real estate appraisal BC Ferries Wal-Mart IPod The Invisibles Mutual fund Craps Oil-for-Food Programme FairTax Video game crash of 1983 Space Shuttle program IBM PC compatible Dodge Neon San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Ashton-Tate Lost City (Stargate SG-1) Douglas DC-8 Lighting Dennis Kucinich XERF Virtual memory De Lorean DMC-12 Heinkel He 112 History of Adelaide Elevator Bending Battle of the beams Poker jargon Downing Street memo Citigroup Option Intellivision Bulk vending Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Animal Crossing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) RX-78 mobile suit series Crane (machine) Wayne Corporation Great Depression Sony American Motors Eurofighter Typhoon Nintendo Entertainment System Tractor Characters of Lost Microeconomics Hubert H.
