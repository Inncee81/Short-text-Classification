does anyone know how to effectively level the ground before laying an above ground swimming pool i have read several different idea in which none worked your hekp would be appreciated contrary to what many people may say do not spread sand on the ground to level it the sand will act like tiny ball bearings and let the pool slide down hill always dig out the higher ground to match the lowest grade level within the area of the pool once the ground is level then you may need to spread and tamp debris free masonry sand to a depth of inches to provide a cushion under the pool bottom digging the ground yourself can be a real chore if the ground is hard packed clay or rocky and you have to remove several inches if that's the case then either rent a transit and a bobcat or hire an excavator to dig and grade it level if you choose to dig and level it by hand then start by getting a straight board when laid edgewise ideally as long as the radius of your pool assuming it is a round pool to simplify this discussion you will also need a good accurate bubble level at least feet long you can also use a laser level with stakes and string but it may be more tedious if you are not skilled at using it determine the location for the pool trying to find as level an area as possible mark off the area for the pool and dig out the sod for at least a foot beyond the edge of the pool starting at the lowest point inside the pool area dig out the dirt from the higher area using the level to make sure you don't dig out too much once you have dug out about half the width of the pool you should attach the level to the edge of the straight board with tape have a helper hold one end of the board on the ground at the lowest point where you started digging from you can then move the other end of the board around the area where you are digging and see if you have dug out enough dirt to level the area with what was the lowest spot once you get that half of the pool area leveled then have your assistant hold the end of the board at the center of the pool area you should then move around the pool area with the other end of the straight board on the ground and dig out the high areas to level the ground along the length of the board ultimately you should be able to slide the board on the ground with one end at the pool center all the way around the pool area with the bubble level staying level when you can do that then the ground is level and ready for your pool once the pool is level the pool you may be able to spread and tamp sand to about inch depth to pad and protect the bottom of the pool from roots small rocks and such Upholstery Textile manufacturing Mattress Professional wrestling match types Sea-Monkey Japanese tea ceremony Floppy disk Changeroom Drawing Loudspeaker Kimono Great Teacher Onizuka Sento My Little Pony Colours, standards and guidons Atari 8-bit family Oscilloscope Textile manufacturing terminology Guitar Pennsylvania Railroad Undergarment Carpet RISC Hamster Garfield Wheel of Fortune Care Bears Dog agility Horse tack Mars Exploration Rover Squidward Tentacles Manifold Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Harp Electric motor Pysanka Francis Bacon (painter) Rigging Violin Scale model B-47 Stratojet Zoids Tire CPU cache Dragon Booster Kylie Minogue Ron and Fez Autostereogram Brassiere Casting Dinghy Traditional animation Bish__jo game Bicycle frame Circuit design Movie projector Fluorescent lamp Teen Girl Squad Dollar store Murdock-Portal Elementary School Wood carving James Kochalka Fischer Random Chess Tattoo Typewriter Poker jargon Door Equine conformation The Contender (television series) Cork City F.C.
