can i place a gas hob over my dishwasher does any know if i can safely place a gas hob in the worktop over my dishwasher i am having a new kitchen and really want to place it here actually no you cannot firstly you should not place a gas applicance on top of an electric one for safety fire reasons secondly when a hob is fitted it actually sits down in the worktop and goes down quite a few inches so there would be no room for the dishwasher to fit in also they should not be on the same plug sockets for safety reasons afraid you will have to redesign your kitchen and did you really want all the grease and food from the cooking falling down onto the dishwasher Electrical wiring (UK) Advanced Mobile Phone System Wire Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Guitar Chariot Bass guitar Ampere Magnetic field Operational amplifier Circuit design Torpedo Electrical wiring Electrophysiology Gas metal arc welding Resistor Hand grenade Electromagnetism Jack plug Electronic amplifier Double bass Magnet Voltage drop Naval mine Roman triumph Adenosine monophosphate Welding power supply Nail (engineering) AIM-9 Sidewinder Telephone tapping X10 (industry standard) Adam Jones Rigging Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing XHTML Barbed wire Valve sound Fuse (electrical) Back to the Future XML Overhead lines Die (manufacturing) Mobile phone Violin Spark plug Character encodings in HTML Telephone numbering plan Wire (band) Seismometer Lac operon Wire wrap Residual-current device Kenwood Electronics Drill bit Surface-mount technology Land Rover Discovery Nikon FA American wire gauge Electricity meter Cascading Style Sheets Loudspeaker Wire-guided missile Panama Canal Locks Transmission Control Protocol Radio controlled airplane Electric guitar Roman currency Electricity Solar power Antenna (radio) In the Flesh Live Bassoon Carburetor Series and parallel circuits Sky Digital Trombone Andr__-Marie Amp__re Archery Gee Conductor (material) Instrument amplifier Xbox Jet engine Lawn mower Good News Week Eyepiece Digital recording Mountain bike Harp Tire Cellular network Advanced Technology Attachment Bookbinding Dental brace USS Zane (DD-337) Reading spark plugs for racing Piano wire Suspension bridge Knitting needle
