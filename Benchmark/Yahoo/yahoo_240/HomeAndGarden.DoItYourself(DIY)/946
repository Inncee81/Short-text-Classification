any good ideas for making a 'bench' out of a chaise lounge chair so i have a chaise lounge that isn't good for whats its supposed to be used for and i was going to throw it away but then thought if i laid it flat the head part and put on a long cushion it could make a great bench or because its long perhaps couch would be a better word so what i'm asking for is some suggestions for the back of the couch thanks how about a headboard for the back of the bench depending on how long the chaise is a queen or king headboard might work all you would need to do is get some screws the headboard should already have holes where it would normally be attatched to the bed frame just screw the headboard into the legs or frame of the chaise add lots of throw pillows and there ya go instant couch good luck Lyonel Feininger Sinn F__in Benny Fein Belfast West (UK Parliament constituency) Mid Ulster (UK Parliament constituency) West Tyrone (UK Parliament constituency) Republican Sinn F__in Provisional Sinn F__in South Down (UK Parliament constituency) Belfast North (UK Parliament constituency) Irish Republicanism Democratic Unionist Party Labor slugger war Mark Durkan Upper Bann (UK Parliament constituency) IRA Army Council Armagh George Burns Waxey Gordon Official Sinn F__in European Parliament election, 2004 (UK) Gerry Adams Galway Jacob Orgen Home Rule Act 1914 William Gillies Green Party (Ireland) Alone in the Dark (series) Hawaiian sovereignty movement History of Northern Ireland Steve Lawrence Antrim Borough Council Nancy Witcher Astor Derry City Council Drill Beyond Shadows Provisional Irish Republican Army Winsor McCay East Londonderry (UK Parliament constituency) North Antrim (UK Parliament constituency) South Antrim (UK Parliament constituency) Londonderry (UK Parliament constituency) Greater London Council Belfast South (UK Parliament constituency) Irish National Liberation Army United Kingdom general election, 2005 Bauhaus Terence MacSwiney Armagh (UK Parliament constituency) Acad__mie Colarossi Rip Taylor Radio Telef__s __ireann North Down (UK Parliament constituency) Sean MacDermott Belfast Treaty of Nice Irish Republic Scottish independence Anti-Semitism Nathan Kaplan William O'Brien Northern Ireland Pok__mon Colosseum Monty Python's Flying Circus Republic of Ireland Parliament Building of Northern Ireland The Lumberjack Song The Comics Journal Socialist Workers Party (Ireland) Red Hand Defenders Kenneth Bigley Northern Bank robbery Southern Accents Thomas Mac Curtain Politics of Ecuador Michael McKevitt Billy Bulger Ephraim Eitam Apology Resolution Alasdair Milne South Antrim by-election, 2000 Antrim (town) Robert McCartney (murder victim) Victoria of the United Kingdom Endless Nights United States at the 2004 Summer Olympics Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America __r nDra__ocht F__in Seamus Costello Ian Paisley 20th century Socialist Workers Party (UK) Media in Ireland Harold Bloom Response to the 2005 London bombings Sidney Hillman Tripartite System Irish nationality law February 15, 2003 global anti-war protest Supporting Characters (Xenogears)
