how do i if at all rig up a window air conditioner to work in an attic recently thought i was a genius and installed a btu amp volt window air conditioner in my new nd story additon with the rear of the unit hanging into the attic all is well and good with the unit when the air temp is moderately high but these past few days with the temp in the attic peaking around degrees have been causing the unit to trip the amp circuit breaker i have an attic ventilation fan that i could use via duct work to blow outside air directly on the back of the ac unit or to suck air directly from the back of the unit i could also increase the ampreage of the circuit breaker but am not sure if gauge wire can handle anything above amps another option would be to run a thicker gauge wire to accomodate a larger circuit breaker but i feel that is not adressing the real problem of the cool air ventilation to the ac unit anyone have any suggestions it sounds to me like your on the right track and all you need to do is exhaust the hot air coming off of the back of the a c unit out of there it is trying to cool the area but also pumping hot air back into the same area off of the back of the a c unit if you could hook your attic vent fan up to the back of the a c unit via duct work of some kind like you said and have it exhaust this hot air outside you will have solved your own problem HVAC Fire fighting Basement Thermostat Thermal power station Softball STS-114 Firefighter Volleyball Spark plug Glossary of firefighting terms Wood fuel Glossary of American football Furnace Apollo 13 Campfire Door Glossary of firefighting equipment Billboard Hot 100 Torpedo Laws of cricket Sento Mars Exploration Rover RuneScape quests Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Diesel engine Stairway Insulation The Ark in Space Seismic retrofit Hot air balloon Casting Radioisotope thermoelectric generator Salad Fingers Solar power Autonomous building BS 1363 Indianapolis 500 Vacuum Space shuttle main engine Tag Violin EastEnders Chatsworth House Vacuum tube Hard disk B-47 Stratojet The Shining (film) Mario Dualism (philosophy of mind) Natural Selection (computer game) Glossary of wildland fire terms The Empty Child Shaggy dog story Fire extinguisher Chevrolet Corvair Table saw Rose (Doctor Who) Dundas Square Kitchen High-voltage hazards Miss Saigon Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala(Annoyed Grunt)cious Pebble bed reactor Friends Rais massacre MAME Milton H.
