how do i remove gas logs the previous owners of my home had gas logs installed in the wood burning fireplace i don't want gas logs it's not that i want to convert it back to wood buring right now either i just don't want anything in there the gas company has already removed the gas tank so there is no gas at all coming into my home but there are logs sitting in the fireplace can i just unscrew a line and pick them up and out of the fireplace sounds too easy but then will there be a pipe line dangling in the fireplace i am not insterested in burning anything in the fireplace right now i just want it empty thanks yes just unscrew the pipe then take out the log set but then u can still remove that other gas line coming into ur fireplace as long as the installer did it correctly and sleeved ur gas line see if that line goes thru a little bit larger line and if it does just pull out the smaller line from one side or the other then just caulk the whole and there ya go Carburetor Refrigerator Thermal power station Motor oil Furnace Ozone depletion Thermostat Boeing 747 Ozone hole HVAC Hydrogen economy Tesla coil B-47 Stratojet M16 (rifle) Explosive material Seismic retrofit Airsoft Transformer Hard disk Vacuum Internal combustion engine Alcohol fuel Air pollution Jet engine Dodge Neon Phase change heat pump Mattress Solar power Biodiesel Diesel engine Loudspeaker Gas compressor Brewery Petroleum Floppy disk Welding Motorcycle Glossary of firefighting terms Tank Alkane Electric motor Refrigerator car Web crawler IBM PC compatible Heinkel He 100 Internal ballistics Ocean thermal energy conversion Directed-energy weapon Nuclear power Stirling engine Intravenous therapy General Dynamics F-111 MS-06 Zaku II Atari 8-bit family Microeconomics Turbocharger Single-stage to orbit Fusion power Trademark Automobile Telephone exchange Steam engine OV-10 Bronco Embedded system Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Diode Swamp cooler SCO-Linux controversies Refrigerant Software engineering Carbon dioxide M4 Sherman Pretty Good Privacy Battery electric vehicle Vacuum tube B-25 Mitchell Gasoline SR-71 Blackbird Sewage treatment San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Breathing gas Town gas Airbus A380 Condom Stryker Industrial engineering
