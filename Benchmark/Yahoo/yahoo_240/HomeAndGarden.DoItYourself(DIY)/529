how to heat outside pool with wood burning stove hi can anyone give me serious answers to how i can use a garden wood burning stove to heat my ft above ground swimming pool solar not a good option nor is leaving sun to heat as we dont get much in scotland and heaters cost too much in electricity thanks nessie see not so mad after all am i didnt think along lines of water tank more of putting a pipe through the fire to heat up and the filter pump puts back into the pool circulating the hot water but need help to explain on how to diy it you need an answer that comes from experience i was in the same boat and don't listen to any of the hare brained schemes previously written here go buy yourself feet of inch convert to metric copper tubing i got mine at a metal scrap yard and paid by the pound much cheaper than at the store by as much as you think you can cram through the door of your stove without crimping the tubing my stove is about inces deep and inches wide and i used feet of tubing coil and bend the tubing so it forms a coil inside you stove cut a hole in the stove for the inlet and one for the outlet and let the tubing stick out of the stove a little in both places be sure there's still room in the box for burning wood too for the rest of the plumbing you can use pvc or cpvc piping use only cpvc on the outflow since it is made for hot water run a 't' off your filter system output so you're not heating the water before it goes through your filter and your filter still has a place to push the excess filtered water to the pool t line runs to the stove input with a gate valve controlling the flow you need to adjust the flow depending on how hot your fire is if you use the full pressure that the filter creates your pipe will never heat up and you'll shower your firebox with condensation i can heat about gallons per minute flow from farenheit to farenheit connect pipe from your firebox output to the edge of the pool and just let the water flow in it can get hot enough to burn people or melt your liner so use common sense i never operate mine when kids are in the pool or i open up the gate valve a lot so the water can't get too hot i live in south carolina so our winters are pretty mild i find that this stove extends the swimming season months for wimps and creates year round enjoyment for me above ground pools lose heat easily so you might want to invest in a bubble cover too hope this helps and find a friend to help search the web for tips on bending tubing without crimping it also always let your fire go out before turning off the water flow most of all have fun and learn from your mistakes Poker jargon Universal Serial Bus Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Telephone exchange Ethernet Jack plug IPod Drill bit Optical fiber Knife Coaxial cable Floppy disk Oscilloscope Telephone numbering plan RS-232 Dialysis D-subminiature Modem DVD Phreaking Telephone Electrical wiring (UK) Plame affair 25-pair color code Baseball Atari ST Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Residual-current device Condom Ribbon cable Cable television Nonblocking minimal spanning switch Wire Big Brother (USA TV series) Windows 2000 Wire wrap Internet Registered jack Light-emitting diode SCART Space elevator CPU cache Intravenous therapy The Inside 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Die (manufacturing) Explosive material Lawn mower Textile manufacturing Embedded system Glossary of climbing terms Wheel of Fortune Integrated Services Digital Network Musical Instrument Digital Interface Gas metal arc welding Password Surveillance Screw Snooker Amstrad CPC Action potential Cruising (maritime) Internal ballistics Johnny 5 USB flash drive Rail terminology BS 1363 The Strangerhood Telephone tapping Interstate Highway Electrical wiring Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster The Star Wars Holiday Special The Doctor Dances RCA connector Spyware RuneScape quests World Wide Web Digital Visual Interface Computer bus Switch Transformer ITU-T Digital circuit Spark plug New York City Subway nomenclature Advanced Technology Attachment Glossary of graph theory Heinkel He 112 9-1-1 Phishing
