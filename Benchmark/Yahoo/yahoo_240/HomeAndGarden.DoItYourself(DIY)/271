what do you know about re finishing hardwood floors my apartment has hardwood floors and they are not attractive they are scratched dull and stained i want to fix them myself can anyone give me some insight it is a small apartment certainly no more than sq ft what materials will i need what will i actually have to do and how much time will it take also what costs can i expect any details anyone can give me would be great thank you so much my landlord is paying for it i am not stupid why can't people just answer the question and not assume things that aren't even asked you should rent a floor sander the square type at a building supply place such as lowe's or home depot they run about dollars a day probably depends on where you live buy sanding sheets starting with a coarse one then a finer one they are about each and you will probably need or so of each get extra ones they will refund your money for the ones you don't need you will probably spend around dollars on the sanding you will also need a hand held block sander or sheets of sandpaper to hand sand around the edges before you start sanding be sure that there aren't any nail heads or splinters sticking out that will tear your sanding pads start sanding in a out of way spot until you get the hang of it it isn't hard so don't worry sand with the grain of the wood not across the boards be sure to empty the bag of saw dust as often as the machine says too after you sand the floor with the machine first using the coarse paper then the fine take your block sander or sheets of sandpaper and hand sand any edges that your machine couldn't get too or any stubborn spots when you are through sweep vacuum and go over the floor with tack cloth to be sure that you don't have any saw dust left on it now you should decide if you want to stain it or just go with the natural look it will be lighter if you don't stain it but the polyurthane will make it darker than it is before you apply it this is the look that i prefer you can buy small sized cans of stain apply each to a small area as well as applying just polyurthane to a spot and let them dry while you still have the sander choose which finish you want and when it it dry sand over that area again to remove the ones you didn't like again remove any sawdust and go buy your stain and apply it with a brush just like you would paint be careful not to over lap the edges so you won't have darker stripes after hours you should be able to apply the clear polyurthane but be sure that the floor isn't still tacky if it is rainy out sometimes it takes longer to dry apply a coat of polyurthane let it dry hours and lightly hand sand the floor again removing any dust when you are done apply a second coat and let it dry probably hours and you are done it isn't really hard and the results are amazing have fun and good luck Glossary of firefighting equipment Wrench Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Hydraulic machinery Tap (valve) Diving regulator Spark plug Plumbing fixture Tire Irrigation Bong Flush toilet Drill bit Trombone Soldering Home repair Domestic water system Scuba set Oxyacetylene Fire hydrant Air brake (rail) Mattress Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Seismic retrofit Siphon Electrophysiology Rail terminology Diving suit Plastic Welding Computer Vacuum tube Glossary of firefighting terms Sento Dairy Rebreather Two-stroke cycle E85 Violin Sleeve valve Dialysis Textile manufacturing Gasoline Transistor Radio controlled car Universal Serial Bus Steam engine Anchor Glossary of wildland fire terms Kitchen Toilet paper Energy development Hard water Solar power Geographic information system Manifold vacuum William Murdoch Carbon dioxide Electronic amplifier Lock picking Mouse (computing) Metalworking Milling cutter CPU cache Furnace Table tennis Commodore 64 Diamond Internal combustion engine Circuit design MP3 Tap wrench Reamer Portable stove Cheating in Counter-Strike Password Electrical wiring Renewable energy Glossary of graph theory Chevrolet Corvair engine Naval mine Laserdisc Water supply Combine (Half-Life 2) Panama Canal Mercury 4 Apollo Command/Service Module Urinal
