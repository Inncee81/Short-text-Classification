what are the ways in which electrical fires start my neighbor tells me not to perform wiring projects but i was told that wiring is not dangerous if you read up on your stuff it is my understanding that wiring projects only start when you do one of the following cut corners by installing a higher amp breaker than permitted for a given guage of wire to allow too much current to flow through a narrow cable without the breaker tripping when a wire is nicked and then makes contact with another conductor causing a short circuit but even then i believed that shorts of this variety were rendered harmless because such problems are precisely what causes a breaker to trip and turn off the power what other ways do electrical fires start thanks btb is right it's not short circuits those just blow the fuse or breaker but loose connections the wire has to be stripped correctly so it does not have any nicks in it the screws have to be tightened enough and the wires need to be routed so vibration does not loosen them over time it's the loose wires faulty outlets that have been overloaded or have loose wires inside the box that heat up and cause a fire that is why aluminum wire is no longer used in house wiring it cold flows and gets loose heats up and often cracks where it was striped those nice easy backwire outlets switches are a prime example just strip of insulation off and press into the rear of the outlet switch against a spring a few overloads or just metal fatigue will result in a loose connection loose connetctions and heat will buildup even at less than say amps if it's enough to make toast it will toast you before the breaker blows Fire fighting Paint Milton H.
