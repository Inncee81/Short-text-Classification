is there such a thing as an easy to install laminate that looks good or should i forget about it and just pay to have hardwood floors installed laminate wood floors are fairly easy to install the most important part is preparation it's imperative that you prepare the floor well if you have some sort of deteriorated flooring now you will likely have to remove it make sure that your floor is level and smooth take the trim off before doing any installation once you have the floor clean vacuum it well before you lay anything smooth and level there is a backing material that you buy separately from the flooring if you buy the better backing your floor shouldn't squeak as much make sure to keep things clean through every stage of installation when you install the flooring leave a gap of about a quarter inch around the entire room the floor 'floats' and this can help you put difficult boards down try to have the gap even around the edges before you put the trim on for tricky boards i find it useful to make a template with paper first and measure everything a few times before cutting this takes a little bit of time and patience but your floor will look nicer and you will have fewer waste boards also use a piece of x to pound the boards together this prevents damage to the edges of the boards i have assisted in the installation of regular hardwood flooring it's hard on the knees noisy you need to rent a special nailing tool the floors need sanded and sealed etc laminates are vastly easier for a regular person to install i'm a respiratory therapist what do i know about carpentry and a pretty large area can be done in a day if you choose to go laminate there are places like discount stores i e ollie's that might have material available for cheap my bedroom floor for five years was laminate from there and it worked fine it even mated to the laminate we added through the rest of the second floor of the house from home depot my floor squeaked less than the other areas because better underlay was used in my room Epoxy Plastic Casting Seismic retrofit Deck (ship) Boat building Dinghy Reinforced concrete Printed circuit board Fiberglass Concrete Glass Woodworking Graphite-reinforced plastic Upholstery Xanadu House Fuselage Homebuilt aircraft Stucco Carbon fiber Polyurethane Basement Wood carving Friction Mattress Paint Poker jargon Molding (decorative) Tire Drill bit Geodesic dome Straw-bale construction Timber framing Masonry Radio controlled airplane Brazing Architecture of the California missions Tlingit Anchor Horseshoe Glacier Drawing Composite material Brush Bulk vending Sand casting Drywall RMS Titanic Knife Pavement (material) Passenger car Wind turbine Chevrolet Corvair Glossary of nautical terms 24 Hours of Le Mans Dishwasher Fire extinguisher Betting (poker) Thermal power station Radio controlled car Massage Brewery Ford Mustang Cosmic Era technology San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans First aid kit Leather Windsurfing Wayne Corporation Mosaic Opportunity rover Textile manufacturing terminology Ammolite History of Test cricket (to 1883) Drag racing Las Vegas metropolitan area Plaster Apple Die (manufacturing) Wood finishing Great Pyramid of Giza Pebble bed reactor Radar cross section Varnish Kit Kat SS Normandie USS Ticonderoga (CV-14) Magnetism Tier One Soap Tofu Apollo Command/Service Module Volkswagen Golf Hamster Amateur telescope making Manicure Arcade cabinet Drainage
