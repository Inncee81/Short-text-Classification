sanding floorboards i'm going to sand my floorboards and want to know if i should hire a floor sander and are they difficult to use or would i be aswell getting on my hands and knees and using a hand held electric sander mel s i'm ' and not scared of hard work i'm a diy nut just wondered how hard these machines are to use boy i can't belive all of the bad advice you got here i have done this project you will too it will look great anyone can use the machines needed to do this job rent a machine called a drum sander and rent a professional heavy duty finish sander the drum sander cost me bucks for hours and i think the finish sander was about for the same amount of time the rental store will provide you with all of the sand paper you will need and alot more of which the paper you don't use is given back and your not charged for it the drum sander's handle is removable it fit in my car perfectly get help lifting it the drum sander was not at all hard to use and was easy to contol just go slow and go with the grain of the wood you will need to use the finish sander around the walls or other tight areas i found it harder to use the finish sander the finish sander produced more dust and didn't remove much material without much effort the huge drum sander had a dust collection bag that worked very well empty it often i was indeed nervous until i used actually used the sander i thought i might make a mistake with this huge heavy powerful machine but when in action it is very graceful on the wood the drum pulls itself when you lower the lever it's not hard to control the lever lowers the sanding roller to the floor i performed this by simply starting to walk slowly lowering the sander at the same time as opposed to lowering the sander and then walking this way it doesn't dig in the machine pulls itself gently when moving along prior to stopping or turning simply begin to raise the lever if you need any further tips about refinishing a floor ask i did my home and my parents the floors came out perfect a couple hundred dollars over the thousands it would cost was saved plus it was fun i am fully confident you can handle the machine i don't care if your or years old tall thin fat short meak or mild give it a shot Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Glossary of firefighting equipment Thermal power station Seismic retrofit Brewery Flush toilet Thermostat Drill bit Siphon Professional wrestling holds Rail terminology Knife Irrigation Lock picking Wrench Carburetor Fire fighting Space shuttle main engine Fire hydrant Screw Diesel engine Oxyacetylene Transistor Solar power Apollo 13 Textile manufacturing Tire Spark plug Rebreather Tap wrench Poker jargon Panama Canal Locks Hydraulic machinery Newcomen steam engine Basement Diving regulator Steam engine Professional wrestling throws Motorcycle Corrosion Bong Geyser Motor oil Two-stroke cycle Three Mile Island Snorkel Tap (valve) Dialysis Injection moulding Diving cylinder Autonomous building Plumbing fixture Novelty (locomotive) Gramophone record Furnace Canal lock Metalworking Naval mine Scuba set Car handling Water heater Water hammer Containment building Internal ballistics Hydrogen economy Armored Core Welding Pebble bed reactor Fossil fuel power plant PID controller Vacuum tube Concrete Half-Life 2 Glossary of American football Sewage treatment Aerial refueling Wave power Portable stove Cruising (maritime) Dishwasher Dam Transformers: Cybertron Pump USS Tunny (SS-282) Panama Canal Process control Urinal Liquid breathing Lathe Circuit breaker GunZ The Duel Fuel pump Coffee Tofu The Covenant Pliers Baby bottle
