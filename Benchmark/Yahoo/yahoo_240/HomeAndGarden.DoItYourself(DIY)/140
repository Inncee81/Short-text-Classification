electrician advice needed asap i got a new outdoor floodlight socket to replace the old socket and the old component had wires from the ceiling white and black going into each socket the new socket came with just one black and one white to tie into the existing wires of the house i clipped all four of the old wires and just connected the white w white and black w black giving me three of each tied up i turned the power back on and nothing any suggestions thanks first i would get the voltage ohm meter as suggested above second if you have too many wires then stop what you are doing and try to find out the answer before turning on power you could have and may have shorted out the light it probably would have been better to have two whites together with a connector and out of the way and two blacks together with a connector and out of the way and just use one black and one white wire just don't mix the black and white wires also make sure that your light works and that you turn on the light after you turn on the power Carpenter Miyamoto Musashi Timber framing Light-frame construction Escape from New York Volkswagen Type 2 Window Wayne Corporation Passenger car Robert Lawson (architect) Almanzo Wilder Gothic architecture Apple Macintosh Yohoho!
