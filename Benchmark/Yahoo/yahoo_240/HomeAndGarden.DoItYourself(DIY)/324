want to polish hardwood floor by myself i think that i can do it but how just bought a house made awesome deal but there is only one problem that hardwood floors are in very bad condition i mean it needs polish very badly i don t know how many years ago they polished it last time after paying for down for the house and appliances the budget is very tight so i thought that my husband and me should do it by our self i know we can do it so guys please help give me some links to get info how to do it and need tips from your experience too and for supplies home depot or what what is the best store for supplies thanks a lotttttttt in advance star promise for help but more then that my blessings for you all usually with an old house you need more than polish for the hardwood if you see bare wood sand the old finish go back to all bare wood stain if you want or need to hide problems then varithane for the finish if no bare spots and no discolorations dog or cat mess then you can just light sand and varithane the floors again the details home depot rental centers are a great place to start the regular home depot stores may not have all the best tools for this job so go to the rental center they have a good rental policy all the supplies you pick up in the beginning are returnable if you did not need them so stock up to save useless return trips you should ask yourself if you want to replace baseboard at this point be careful these jobs can multiply baseboard paint window coverings and on and on floors are best done with the baseboard removed if you are not planning on replacement carefully remove the old and save door casing can stay but he base should go you will need a good vacuume to clean the floors of dust you will need dust masks and ear protection the total cost of this job will run plus depending on how many square feet and the extent you are going in order to strip the floor to bare wood rent the drum sander with grit to start sanding old finish off floors is difficult to do the old finish is hard to sand a gums sand paper quickly if you start with the very course grit you will remove the finish quickly be careful if the floor sander sits in one spot for even a few seconds you will dig a hole in your floor the idea with the first sanding is to go over the whole floor once always with the grain and get most of the old finish off then change sandpaper to grit it is much more forgiving and you should be able to remove of the old finish in the areas you can reach again keep the sander moving with the grain of the wood you might want to sand the floor one more time with this sander using the next higher grit paper i think but i usually change sanders at this point you should now turn your attention to the edges i return the drum sander at this point and rent a edger hd charges rent on the tools for as long as you need them if only one person is working only rent one tool at a time the edger is a circular sander and it will get right up to the wall it will sand across the grain of the wood so it leaves more visable scratch marks this is unavoidable but if you follow the directions for the drum sander you will get a good job from it course to get the finish keep it moving change paper is it becomes gummed or worn away as you work your way around the room you will need to change grit and move to a finer and finer grit after each completed trip around the room sand with this toold all the way to grit no other tool will get to the edge of the wall like this one this by the way is the worst part of the whole job it is very hard on your back take lots of breaks it will wear you out if you husband does this job be nice to him massage his back after he's done he will need it i do the edges second because after the drum sander i can see all the parts i missed once done with the edges return this tool one last thing corners even the edging tool has it's limits being a circular sander it will miss the inside corners you will need to do this by hand i use a sharp chisel just remember baseboard will cover most of the corner but you still need it to be flat and even with the surrounding floor or the base will show a gap there if your floors were not too bad of shape and they only need a touch up you could skip the previous two sanders and go right to this one rent a vibrating extra large pad sander wide because of the wide sanding surface it is very difficult to hurt your floor with this one start with grit and sand everything you can reach you wont need to be as careful at going with the grain here the key is to even out the floor fix any mistakes you made with the drum sander continue with this one till you reach the grit paper and your floor looks great on a refinish just lightly sand with and do not try to remove the existing finish follow the directions with any wood stain you might use as well as the directions for the varithane mind the waiting time between stain finish as well as between coats of finish i have mixed feelings about the varithane as you have two choices water or oil based water based finish is easy to apply dries very fast two hours for re coat and is crystal clear in fact i think it dries too quickly it many times does not flatten out well and will leave bubbles and bumps in the finish oil based on the other is slow to dry overnight has an amber color but usually leaves a much nicer finish clean up with oil is also a pain and is concidered a hazordous waste to decide concider the weather fumes time allowed for the project coats of oil means staying off the floor for days then you still don't want to move furniture in for a few more days you will also want to lightly sand the finish between coats to completely strip and refinish allow a weeks work it is a big job but is doable for the average home owner it is also not cheap the rentals and the sandpaper add up quickly however the results are well worth it Ozone depletion Radar Second language acquisition
