can i save money having only a house frame built and doing the interior work myself i am going to have a house custom built in the next year i was wondering if i could save alot of money by only having the builders do the frame and having contractors come in for electric and plumbing and basically doing all the interior work drywall painting tileing flooring etc myself if so about how much would i be saving jason you asked a good question and it deserves a good answer unlike the other responders i will tell you no no you will not save money doing this work yourself and this is why the subcontractors that perform services like drywall tiling casework trim doors and flooring have accounts with suppliers that allow them to purchase materials and equipment at discount prices that will be unavailable to you in other words they can perform the work for nearly the same cost you can purchase the material for in addition to purchasing material you will need to purchase or rent the tools to install the material trust me you will not save money by doing this work yourself over the years i have received about a dozen calls from people that got in over their head and need help getting their project completed i have always turned them down because there was no money to be made and i didn't want to get in the mddle of someones mess there would have been no way to warranty the work when they did part of it and i did a part of it the best advise i can give you is don't go there but there is an upside to doing it yourself and that is when your done not saving money you will have a garage full of tools that will be useful for future projects i would also caution agaist acting like the builder and hiring the contractors yourself in an effort to save money remember that these subcontractor will be more loyal to the builders that they have a working relationship with than they will be to an indivual try to be a builder you will get real frustrated with them when they don't show up because their taking care of another builder i hope you take this advise good luck Window Solar power Glass Locksmithing Bicycle brake systems Automobile John Hancock Tower Windows 2000 Lock picking Autonomous building Insulation Canal lock USB flash drive Cookware and bakeware Elevator Mouse (computing) Hurricane proof building Panama Canal Volkswagen Type 2 Public-key cryptography Panama Canal Locks Houseplant Motorcycle RISC Apple II family R32 (New York City Subway car) IBM PC compatible 30 St Mary Axe Wallpaper group Full disclosure Windows Me Caboose Function key British Railways Mark 1 Badminton De Lorean DMC-12 St Albans Cathedral Short Stirling Imperial (automobile) Hybrid vehicle Toyota Prius Personal rapid transit Radeon Industrial engineering Docklands Light Railway Computer Door Transmission Control Protocol Windows XP Mercedes-Benz SL-Class R46 (New York City Subway car) Ford Thunderbird Hash table Tea Disc brake Oldsmobile Toronado Internal ballistics Windows Vista Locomotive Tennis TGV Euro Spark plug Locked room mystery UK Singles Chart Hydrogen economy Key (lock) History of Microsoft Windows Object Desktop Safe-cracking Professional wrestling attacks Construction Wilton House Erie Canal Linux Microsoft Office Parable of the broken window The Smashing Pumpkins Password cracking Chatsworth House Gramophone record Macintosh Finder Diacritic Wind turbine Trombe wall Drag racing Dash Professional wrestling throws Mario Commodore 64 DVD Windows Server 2003 Genericized trademark Four wheel drive Nissan Skyline RFID Machine gun
