what are the steps to stripping and re painting a wooden bench seat we want to repaint it white or black is one of those easier than the other how do we make it look professional should we paint spraypaint glossy matte does it need to be coated with something after the paint dries it will be indoors do we need to sand it first i think right now it is just has a varnish on it if it's just varnish i wouldnt bother to strip it just sand it a bit grit or so should do apply a coat of primer and then paint either color will require about as much work as the other just keep in mind you can get primer in white or darker colors too so match the primer with the finish coat spray painting puts on a very thin coat so it will probably take more coats than if you brushed it on but the advantage is that you get a smoother finish after all is said and done sand very lightly between coats to scuff the surface so the next layer of paint will adhere steel wool works well for this if you want to eliminate the wood grain altogether then use a 'filler' before priming have fun Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Fire extinguisher Olympic Flame Scramjet Swamp cooler Portable stove IllumiNations: Reflections of Earth Gas tungsten arc welding Filling station Reaction control system Tier One Air pollution Gas metal arc welding Hell's Kitchen Plasma arc welding Turbojet Kitchener, Ontario Inkjet printer Jet engine Atlas Comics (1950s) Plasma cutting Solid rocket Urban beach Kitchen Spacecraft propulsion Abiogenic petroleum origin Flue gas desulfurization Akatsuki (Naruto) Human Torch Turbofan Fire breathing Chef Space shuttle main engine Marvel Universe Fountain Epcot 2003 North America blackout Marvels Rydia Fuel injection Torch Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem Human Torch (Golden Age) Syringe Expanding nozzle Port Authority Trans-Hudson Air safety Operation Torch World War Three (Doctor Who) Aviation fuel Turbine Afterburner (engine) Diesel engine Aerial refueling Carrie Jacobs-Bond Rocket fuel Stove Recycling Splash pad Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Knight Lore Olympic Games Battle of the Bulge 10 Rillington Place Zippo Steam turbine Diving regulator PepsiCo, Inc.
