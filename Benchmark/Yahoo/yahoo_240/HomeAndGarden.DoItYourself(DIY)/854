should i finish the basement i was going to finish the basement and noticed the floor is really uneven the house was built in the 's and it has two drains in the floor at opposite corners with the floor sloped towards them highest spot is the center of the basement one isn't used the other is used for the washing machine drain should i try and level the floor and plug the drain s i can add a new one i want to put down carpet but want it to look nice will the uneven floor make it look bad to someone who didn't know it was uneven assuming they never saw it before it was finished also should i paint the existing concrete walls and floor with water sealer like kilz thanks it would seem that answerer and i may follow each other around through diy i'm very ok with that obviously a slab with drainage should be sloped to the drain otherwise where is the logic it would seem that when the house was built the likelyhood of water intrusion was considered sad for that other than a washer drain which should be an up pipe anyway i guess my point is have you any water intrusion probelms have you addressed them in stating you can add a new drain have you considered a sump pump have you considered an elevated floor leaving access to any drainage issues with all due respect as much as i use kilz yet dislike priming it will not seal a basement your home no matter where built with a basement should have been tar sealed outside before any backfilling was done if that isn't the case water seepage and intrusion will always be a problem no matter how many coats of any substance you apply to the interior walls below ground level beyond that what's the condition generally speaking of the floor forget uneven are there stress settling cracks i'm re doing on a constant basis sq ft of tile on a concrete floor in a year old power plant the battle is like the kid with his finger in the holland dike for the uneven and with no offense to contractors plus years ago they likely used different pour support methods than used today perhaps never did screed or float before adding walls you also don't mention whether or not the flooring is uneven due to degradadtion or the initial process perhaps if you have moisture or seepage problems and the floor is wet or damp nothing you apply in the form of leveling mortars will remain intact over the long term if i was contracted to do the job i d probably suggest thinking of losing inches in height from floor to celing and install a faux sub floor other than that can i should i certainly with proper planning and prep why not if only for the aesthetics steven wolf Animal Crossing Rose (Doctor Who) Amazon.com Care Bears Mnemonic Publishing Economy of Brazil Knife Gross domestic product Electrician Crash Test Dummies Extreme Programming Breastfeeding Do it yourself Kim Possible ISBN Minor characters in Morrowind Goosebumps Characters in Neon Genesis Evangelion Finesse Windows Vista Doctor (Doctor Who) Upholstery Burl Ives Fighting Fantasy Game Books 1986 World Series Retailer Mark Calaway Ron Weasley Insane Clown Poppy Serial Sears Holdings Corporation Binoculars The Karate Kid, Part III Home improvement The Wonderful Wizard of Oz Luck Customer relationship management Management information system Iron Maiden Walt Disney World Resort Neighbours Industrial Revolution UK Singles Chart Electronic commerce Programmable logic controller Industrial engineering Tony Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) Printing press World Championship Wrestling Atreyu Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, manga or movie only characters The Wheezer Bros.
