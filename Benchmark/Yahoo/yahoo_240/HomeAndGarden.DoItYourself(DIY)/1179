how do i add to my block wall i hav a block wall in my backyard i added a another level with a cap to make it higher for ym dogs my questions is how do i fill in the cracks withour having to take fingers and go one by one filling in the cracks with cement maybe i layed them wrong this was my first time is there a way to do this when building a brick wall put cement on the block below first and on the inside side s that way you have cement on all sides where your blocks touch other blocks to make the space between the blocks nicer or to help fill them in you can get a tool for 'pointing' pointing is when you fill the space between bricks this process will be messy with lots of cement all over the place you will need a cement trowel a drywall mud holder a metal plate that is square to hold cement and a pointing tool will have a diamond shaped and a curved end to do pointing you basically hold your drywall mud holder against the wall close to the area you are working on and push cement into the crack with the pointing tool you can easily do a nice job like that remember to hose the cracks out and let them dry beforehand Surveillance Trapping Paragliding Hamster Printed circuit board Jackass: The Movie Spider Fishing Manual transmission Punch card Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dairy Skateboarding trick Ed, Edd n Eddy Typewriter Gag (BDSM) One Piece minor characters Spliff Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man A Simple Plan Diseases of the honeybee ZX Spectrum Fox hunting Breastfeeding Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Top-bar hive Salad Fingers Doom enemies Computer virus Glossary of climbing terms Shen Gong Wu Spidey Super Stories The Caves of Androzani StarCraft: Uprising Futurama (TV series - season 5) Great Teacher Onizuka Gemini 9A Aerial (dance move) Breakfast Computer forensics Bulk vending Tire Textile manufacturing Skateboard One Ring Sticky Fingers Marilyn Monroe George Costanza Sailing Roswell UFO incident The Inside Russian joke MP3 Remix Cardboard Phoebe Buffay's songs Tsetse fly Falconry The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Leaf Charles Goodyear Mattress Dog training Rigging RuneScape quests Unreal Raiders of the Lost Ark Computer numbering formats Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Professional wrestling match types Glutinous rice Fast bowling Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Plastic German grammar Economics Punched tape Four wheel drive Radio controlled airplane Tractor Phonograph cylinder Ice cream Sant Mat History of computing hardware Detroit Tigers Sugar Ray Robinson Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed Carnivorous plant Food preservation Parachute Nuggets: Original Artyfacts from the First Psychedelic Era, 1965-1968 Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Central processing unit Gramophone record Cosmo Kramer Battle of Jutland Coronation Street Hey Jude Motorcycle Best Buy
