paulie malignaggi vs chavez jr i read that paulie is calling out chavez jr and is talking alot saying he will embarasse chavez jr and his family in my opinion paulie is in for a rude awakening paulie is quick but no punching power and he could get knocked out chavez jr isn't as fast but he got the power to knockout paulie if this fight happens i see brutal beating for paulie that will send him to retirement great fight if this happens chavez should get the knock out if he can slow him down still think he beats paulie would love to see paulie get knocked out ever since he beat a crappy paper champion in n'dou hes been talkin way too much he called out hatton after hatton's win and now hes calling out chavez the only real fighter malignaggi fought was cotto and he got banged this is a big step for chavez though but i think he can close that big mouth of malignaggi Julio C__sar Ch__vez Erik Morales Marco Antonio Barrera Boxing Paulie Ayala Azumah Nelson Kostya Tszyu H__ctor Camacho Muhammad Ali Joe Louis Juan Martin Coggi George Foreman Eder Jofre Julio C__sar Ch__vez, Jr. Wilfredo G__mez Johnny Tapia Jeff Fenech Miguel Cotto Edwin Rosario Yori Boy Campas Roy Jones Jr. Archie Moore Genaro Hernandez Bob Foster Sugar Ray Robinson Bobby Chacon Evander Holyfield Professional wrestling match types Tenshinhan May 2005 in sports Technical decision Willie Pep Jack Dempsey Rocky Marciano Mike Tyson Carmen Basilio Henry Armstrong Jorge Paez Sonny Liston Rafael Limon Lupe Pintor Sugar Ray Leonard Jiro Watanabe Floyd Patterson Pernell Whitaker Danny Lopez Jersey Joe Walcott Floyd Mayweather Jr. Shawn Michaels Michael Moorer Jos__ Miguel Cotto Acelino Freitas John Ruiz Aaron Pryor Alex S__nchez (boxer) Antonio Margarito Alexis Arg__ello Jesse James Leija Juan Laporte Rub__n Olivares Chris Byrd Alan Minter Stanley Ketchel Oscar de la Hoya Emile Griffith Roberto Duran The Sopranos Joe Frazier Bernard Hopkins Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Vegeta Betulio Gonz__lez Ricardo Mayorga John Mugabi Marcel Cerdan Billy Backus The Contender (television series) V__ctor Gal__ndez Arturo Gatti Naseem Hamed New York Giants Wolfgang Pauli Yvon Durelle One Piece minor characters Barry McGuigan Manuel Pacquiao Laila Ali Carnival of Champions Norway national football team Carlos Ortiz Larry Holmes vs. Gerry Cooney Yasutsune Uehara Wilfredo V__zquez Sugar Ray Leonard vs. Thomas Hearns Christy Martin Michael Watson Antonio Tarver
