if women understand men why do they continue to complain most women think they understand men right so if thats the case all the complaining should stop or is it that women just complain about men they can't manipulate or figure out oops i think i'm on to something the secret is women don't really understand all men what women do is what all yes i said it all humans do that is they make sweeping generalizations based upon a few possibly extraordinary examples of men if women really did understand men then you are right in that you suggest they should try to change the situation instead of complaining that would be more helpful than simple criticism on your second point the fact of the matter is that some women think that they can manipulate any man and of course they are wrong there is no doubt that this is frustrating for some but many may also have the mentality of 'there's a sucker borne every minute ' in this they are correct some of this type of thinking may also be due to feminist influences women could also just be 'anchoring their' opinions that is they let a few past experiences color their current view of men and thus jump to a sweeping generalization of all men women complaining could be due to self serving bias in that they only see the 'bad' in others and not the 'bad' in themselves Abortion debate Ontological argument Ethics Political correctness Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Transactional analysis Gender-neutral language Object-oriented programming Causality Transsexuality Philosophy of language Opus Dei David Hume Feminism Scientology beliefs and practices Epistemology Free will Sexual orientation Time travel Mind control Religion Animal rights Scientific skepticism Cultural relativism Supernatural Homophobia Nation of Islam Neuro-linguistic programming Killian documents Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Intelligent design Utilitarianism Philosophy of mathematics Falsifiability Class (computer science) History of intersex surgery Ex-gay Domestic violence Magical thinking Franz Boas Dissociative identity disorder Masculism Biblical inerrancy Cyberspace The nature of God in Western theology John Lott Internet troll Reparative therapy Person New Testament Goodness and value theory Problem of universals Fictional character Static Shock Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) God and gender Mary Wollstonecraft Logic Philosophical Investigations Psychology Generation X Psychosis Nuclear option (filibuster) Friedrich Nietzsche Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Amnesty International Creation according to Genesis Androgen insensitivity syndrome Metaphor The Shining (film) George Fox Theodicy Child sexual abuse Social rule Philosophy of history Media bias Psychoanalysis Behavioral finance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Homosexuality and transgender Badminton Prisoner's dilemma Civil rights George Lakoff Faster-than-light Appeal Nineteen Eighty-Four Emotional intelligence Self-concept Special relativity Gender role Human Meme Mathematics Bullshit!
