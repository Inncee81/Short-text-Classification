men give me an honest answer here so why is it that whenever i talk to a guy have a good conversation or two and find out that we actually have a lot in common they assume that i just want to be a friend call me crazy but i like to try to find commonalities before i try to date somebody but apparently the majority of people expect you to find somebody attractive date them and then just hope you're compatible or something i mean part of it may be my appearance i'm definitely not thin i know this isn't all of it though because i know girls much larger worse looking than me who are dating married etc incidentally i'm bi and i haven't had the same problem with girls they don't assume i'm not dating material just because i have a conversation with them maybe i'm just too hesitant in communicating what i really want this drives me nuts i'm single most of the time because of this darlin when a man just wants to be your friend he just isn't feeling you perhaps you're coming off as too intellectual analytical maybe if you just relax a lil and date not interview the man Social rule Shaggy dog story Theory of conduct Kimi Finster Undergrads The Ashlee Simpson Show Phoebe Buffay's songs Good Morning, Vietnam True Crime: Streets of LA The Beach Boys Humphrey Bogart The Smoking Room Poker jargon Slow Train Coming Kill Bill The Catcher in the Rye Theodicy IP (complexity) Jean Grey Sex and the City Plame affair IBM PC compatible Sinfest The Critic Something Positive Coming of Age (TNG episode) Spice Girls Current teachings of Prem Rawat Infantilism Mach kernel The nature of God in Western theology Nintendo Revolution TLC Hearing impairment Floppy disk Missy Elliott About a Boy Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Birthday Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Intelligent design Nashville Skyline Phoebe Halliwell Samurai Deeper Kyo Angel One (TNG episode) Scientology beliefs and practices Ron and Fez Cliff Richard Supergirl Kodocha Ludwig Wittgenstein Paranoia Agent Hilary Duff One Tree Hill (TV series) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Transactional analysis Extreme Programming Jon Secada Okashina Okashi Paula Abdul Kender God Emperor of Dune Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma George Costanza Destiny's Child Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Charmed Ex-gay The Untouchables Hip hop collaborations EastEnders Singlish Megan Griffin Prostate cancer The Amber Spyglass Another Side of Bob Dylan Human sexual behavior Pitaten Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Altruism McFly Kyle Broflovski Pok__mon Chronicles Frankie Vaughan Sharon Tate Time Out of Mind The Death Gate Cycle Brian Griffin Transsexuality Shot of Love Turing test Sleeping Murder Oasis (band) Aesthetic Realism Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown) PlayStation 3 Andy Kaufman 10 Things I Hate About You
