why are men better at dancing like michael jackson than women i've never seen a woman do a good job dancing like mj compared to men some guys are incredible i've never seen a woman do a good moonwalk there are a lot of things male dancers can do and which female dancers cannot and almost all of them have to do with the differences in male and female bodies a woman's pelvis is shaped differently from a man's and is wider at the top while a man's is a lot closer to a square or rectangle shape that single difference accounts for the reason why women walk in a different manner than men their legs do not swing from the hip the same way when you talk about dancing there is also the issue of the size of a woman's thighs even very thin female dancers have extra fat on their thighs it's a biological fact add to that the fact that professional dancers develop more muscle and are differently muscled depending on their sex and you begin to see that a lot of the things men can do in dance are a physical impossibility for women for example a really good moonwalk requires the feet and legs to be fairly close together and pretty much parallel to each other that's possible for a man but nearly impossible for a woman both because of the shape of her pelvis and the shape of her thighs things like the tight spins that mj does where he crosses his feet and spins neatly are also not as clean looking when done by a woman because her legs will not be and cannot be as straight a lot of what he does looks the way it does because while he is not tremendously tall i think he's probably average which is ' for an american male he is very thin which leads to a very streamlined look even very thin female dancers still have to contend with breasts and rear ends and hips and thighs there are a lot of really great female dancers but they tend to excel at different types of dancing and it mainly has to do simply with how they are built Equine conformation Aerial (dance move) Puberty Glossary of partner dance terms Undergarment Swingout Sexual differentiation Strap-on dildo Lindy Hop Professional wrestling holds Glossary of ballet terms Breech birth Figure skating Sexual attraction Androgen insensitivity syndrome Double bass West Coast Swing Diving Fast bowling Tango (dance) Contredanse Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Prostate cancer Charleston (dance move) Mojave people Breast Professional wrestling attacks Hip hop culture Lead and follow (dance) Billie Jean Breaststroke Stewie Griffin Kylie Minogue Secondary sex characteristic Weight training Circle (dance move) Scottish country dance Textile manufacturing Horse Boxing Physical attractiveness Urinary incontinence Tyrannosaurus rex Bicycle Striptease Balboa (dance) English Country Dance Gender role Norway national football team Biped Stairway Pelvis Human anatomy Drag racing Swimming Volleyball Jennifer Lopez Orgasm Side pass (dance move) Japanese tea ceremony Anal sex American football Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Michael Jackson Social rule Gender-neutral language Paula Abdul Diamond cut Combine (Half-Life 2) Brassiere Hair Dinosaur Sport rowing Duchenne muscular dystrophy Body image Anatomical terms of location Beat It 2000 Australian Grand Prix 1957 World Series Tennis Nudity Skirt and dress Stocking Rod Stewart Gay slang Muay Thai Human sexual behavior View camera Sexual dimorphism Spider Mr. Olympia Intersex surgery
