im uncertain of my sexual orientation okay so i have a boyfriend and everything right but then sometimes i just imagine myself better off being with a girl i enjoy fantasizin bout girls and i also had a dream this one time of making love with a female and going out and dating them am i straight or bi or is it just a lil phaze i need help i have had similar issues with this experience usually the reason a heterosexual female will have phases of attraction to females is because of a bad experience they had with a male father figure growing up or a bad experience with a previous boyfriend in my experience i sometimes yearn for the comfort and closeness of another female because i feel safer around them this may not be the case in your situation my suggestion is that you may be bi curious for a number of reasons you may need to just experiement or discuss it with your boyfriend if you can sometimes they are supportive if you have a friend that is interested you can try cuddling or kissing to determine both of your boundries and how comfortable you feel doing it after the experience refect on it and if it was overall positive the rest is up to you don't be afriad or supress your feelings it's better to try and figure out your orientation now before you get involved in a serious relationship imagine how difficult it would be if you were married or even had kids when you realized your preference overall i think it's best to consider it a phase it depends on your past and how long you have had these feelings best wishes Sexual orientation Human sexual behavior Child sexuality Strap-on dildo Homosexuality and Christianity Pedophilia Infantilism Bisexuality Gender role One Tree Hill (TV series) Homophobia Coming out Heterosexuality Transsexuality Biology and sexual orientation Anal sex Friendship Orgasm Transgender Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Zoophilia Scenes from a Memory Age of consent Mixed martial arts Ex-gay Laura Schlessinger Something Positive Milton H.
