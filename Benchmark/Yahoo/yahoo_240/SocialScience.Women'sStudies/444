pretending the cultural belief system doesn't exist despite the evidence igorance by design or misogyny the cultural gender belief system has influenced the ways in which difference and sameness has been studied in men and women early researchers conceptualizations of masculinity femininity conformed to a bipolar view the more contemporary plethora of research on masculinity femininity and expressivity instrumentality has created a body of knowledge that accepts these as coherent and measurable constructs there are many definitions and instruments developed to measure them the bem sex role inventory bem are used to assess the degree to which men and women have internalized the gender stereotypic personality traits of agency instrumentality i e male stereotypic traits and communion expressivity i e female stereotypic traits engaging in gender typed behaviors is assessed using the sex role behavior scale srbs orlofsky and its short form companion orlofsky o heron con't from above the degree to which people have adopted traditional versus contemporary or liberal views about men women and the relationships between men and women is assessed using measures such as the attitudes toward women scale spence helmreich and the male role norms scale thomp son pleck thompson pleck fer rera other frequently used measures of gender role socialization include the gender role conflict scale grcs o neil helms gable david wrightsman the masculine gender role stress scale eisler skidmore and the feminine gender role stress scale gillespie eisler see beere for more examples of how gender role socialization can be measured i posted a question about traditional masculinity at http answers yahoo com question index ylt auifhflb huhy hldpkbbsy ix qid aapdnzo lo and behold i am attacked with this 'feminist science' that men are bad using assumptions is why men say that 'hatred towards men' is what feminism is about quit wasting our time with man hating assumptions how can there be any effective communication between the genders if so many people refuse to look at the body of scientific evidence they pretend it doesn t even exist what causes this ignorance by design i can't beleeeeeve this references both are scholarly articles originally published in refereed scientific journals http counselingoutfitters com rees htm http www menshealth org code pmm a pdf uh ya the american psychological association ain't a good enough source for ya men who display high hostility and strong conformity to masculine gender roles what the literature calls gender role conflict grc may cause distress to others particularly their wives hostility appears to be positively correlated with strong conformity to masculine gender roles you don't like the research results you wanna make it up yourself or what guess the entire american psychological association are 'man hating' how can this be i think i understand you guys don't want to look too closely you are afraid of what you will see it all makes sense now lol it's probably been done you can search the internet as i did the fact that you state that hostility toward women low self esteem anxiety depression homophobia fear of intimacy are masculine traits makes you a man hating sexist or the people doing the study you can hate men and blame them for your failures all you want though here is is lifted from the apa site verbatim men who display high hostility and strong conformity to masculine gender roles what the literature calls gender role conflict grc may cause distress to others particularly their wives a recent study indicates past research on men suggests such conformity limits their emotional lives and has linked high grc with lower self esteem increased anxiety and depression hostility toward women fear of intimacy homophobia and reluctance to seek help men displaying hostility in the videotaped discussions scored high in grc in their own and their wives' ratings and wives with the most marital dissatisfaction and depression rated their husbands con't from above highest on grc measures of restrictive emotionality power success competition and restrictive affectionate behavior between men men low in grc were less hostile during marital interactions and their wives were less depressed and more satisfied with the marriage indicating that men who have the courage to resist traditional masculinity are likely benefiting themselves and their spouse yes that's fine too they collect and disseminate information amongst other things the fact that is is published on their site means they stand behind it manbeast and kendrick its perceptions of masculinity not the actual being male its the same dangerous cycle of gender expectations that feminism has been dismantling for women no one in these studies says that being male hostile and evil it is equating things that are traditionally associated with masculinity like hostility to divorce rates it does not say anywhere that men are naturally hostile in fact one of the researchers cited bem is forefront in identifying gender role expectations and deconstructing them your reactions to this question are just proof of how much you have accepted these fairly arbitrary gender expectations and assume them to be natural you have proven the point instead of refuting it congrats edit kendrick what part of associated with masculinity are you not getting read sandra bem's work on gender role expectations before you start mouthing off about what the research means i do not deny that women can be hostile but women are not expected to be hostile if they fit into the traditional concept of femininity i wouldn't be offended if you said that the concept of femininity had been associated with mental inferiority because it is the traditional concept of femininity assumes inferiority to males thats half of my argument you sound quite intelligent but i get the feeling that something here isn't quite making sense to you concepts of masculinity male concepts of femininity female therefore don't take this all so personal and try reading the studies before assuming that the entire apa is misandrist and the communication training came with a year college degree i mentioned the intercultural communication training because thats where i encountered sandra bem and her research Mathematics Hypnosis Psychometrics Modernism Feminist
