men about your sexuality here's the senario your woman says tonight it's all you whatever you wish i'm down no judgements or reservations no ulterior motives i'm here to please you you can totally be in charge here's the question do you fear and hold back afraid that some of what you might like to do and or have her do will be seen as unmanly or girly or do you accept the invitation and explore your fantasies what's more important your pleasure or your image edit lol no sitting on the fence you have to pick one yes or no astaroth whatever your new name is whaaaa explore or not yes or no image or pleasure okay hellfire thanks for clarifying so your image is more important than your pleasure gotcha no kendrick i never said that i'm leaving it open as each man has his own fantasies to some that would apply to others not this isnt about me this is about you men and where your head's at no pun intended for instance and watch now i'll get a violation just to illustrate my point a woman sucking on a man's chest i've heard men tell me though they would enjoy this they don't want to appear girly there are many other senarios i could use but i think you get the point eh brad yes i have quite a well balanced life thank u great answers from the ladies brad i like your style just go for it and yes every now and then my thoughts are non sexually related lol i know this is for men but i have experimented with this so i think i can answer the question when you give a man total sexual freedom three scenarios can come up he thinks he's being tested i know this with threesomes you ask a man if he wants a threesome for his birthday he'll automatically think you're testing him so he'll hold back and give you the right answer i think men have been conditioned not to believe a woman when she makes such statements he feel comfortable with you because you have established a trusting non judgmental bond so he'll go for what he wants usually this only happens when you both reveal the not so good for the image fantasies together so you both have to open up to each other mutually to lower the vulnerability level this also works if you're best friends and he doesn't care what you think of him let me be blunt i personally think every man got a little bitch in him just like every woman got a lot of fantasies she doesn't usually reveal afraid of being judged not too many are open enough to even admit this to themselves even less to a woman who they want to impress or be with this guy will let the fantasy night go to waste in conclusion i really think it depends on the guy the nature of the relationship and the openness and comfort of both parties involved Human sexual behavior Goodness and value theory Bondage (BDSM) Infantilism Sexual orientation Friends Ex-gay Extreme Programming Sadism and masochism Appeal Anal sex Strap-on dildo Theodicy Oral sex Rape Polyamory Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Utilitarianism Social rule Ethics Child sexuality Nicomachean Ethics EastEnders Alignment (role-playing games) A Course In Miracles Philosophy of language Avenue Q Katelyn Faber Time Out of Mind Social psychology Zoophilia Meaning of life Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an David Hume Gender role Happiness Rei Ayanami The Smoking Room Sigmund Freud Narcissism Group sex Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Internet troll Sola fide Masturbation Current teachings of Prem Rawat Transsexuality The Ashlee Simpson Show Peter Singer Epistemology Jiddu Krishnamurti The Shining (film) Abortion debate Lincoln-Douglas Debate Social justice Terri Schiavo American Psycho U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Contract Night (book) Final Fantasy Tactics Advance 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Paraphilia Merit Equine conformation Philosophical skepticism Swinging Qiyamah Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Logic Homosexuality and Judaism Tom Coburn 2004 Republican National Convention Neuro-linguistic programming Columbine High School massacre Reparative therapy Originalism Socrates Feminism The nature of God in Western theology Married... with Children Jean Grey Australian constitutional law One Tree Hill (TV series) Civil rights Discordianism Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 God Emperor of Dune Psychoanalysis Phaedo Melanie Wilkes Motivation
