is there an inequity between mr and mrs right this is one of those more anecdotal things that seems to derive answers that try to invalidate my right to even ask the question if you compare the needs wants list of a man for romantic relationships and compare the needs wants list of a woman in romantic relationships you'll see some very distinct differences both quantitative and qualitative i would say that most men are looking for quality companionship and some sex with a partner they're attracted to wouldn't you say that men are really looking more for a lack of bad things than an abundance of good things in a woman compare that to what most women would put down on their honest list of needs wants and let me know what's fair about this hey maybe it isn't fair romantic thoughtful attractive make more money than me sensitive but not too sensitive chivalrous remind me i'm special all the time clean organized a decent cook into traveling and trying new things intelligent surprises me and on and on really the list could go on longer but i hope you get the point also men's need for quality companionship entails some of the same things that the woman's list does but it's not as elaborate and strict carrie is right there's probably a little more to quality companionship than i previously thought wendy g i think the truth is somewhere between our perspectives but i appreciate your articulate way of showing another perspective i think high expectations for being treated well should be a given but high expectations for harlequin romance situations are usually costly for all involved ka i appreciate you bringing me to a more centrist perspective but i suspect there are more women out there that have job description level criteria for the simple easy going men they'll end up with than you might think hmmm interesting question i'll add a different viewpoint than the rest let's consider the old fashioned traditional roles it used to be that a boy was raised told to go to college obtain a good degree find a great job then settle down with a woman to raise his kids hence the boy was raised to become his own independent person a girl used to be told to be pleasant and find a nice man to take care of her not much was spoken about going out there in the world being independent and taking care of herself even though there is more emphasis on educating young girls to be independent go to college establish herself there are still quite a bit of the old fashioned guidelines out there so let's focus on the list of wants since the man already has his own identity career job his requirements are likely to be less she just needs to be nice enough to be around if it doesn't work out he can go on with his life and find another it is much more critical to the woman that she doesn't make a mistake and choose a bad spouse if things don't work out she may not have the good college degree or great career to fall back on since she will likely end up with the kids it will put even more stress on her i actually know of some married couples where the woman has opted to stay home and raise children the wives did have degrees and good jobs before the choice but being out of work in many professional occupations means one loses a bit of their craft it would take more effort to find a new career should they become separated for some reason Same-sex marriage Social rule Infantilism Theory of conduct Polyamory Sexual orientation EastEnders Economic inequality Gender role Marriage Avenue Q Pedophilia Goodness and value theory Theodicy Divorce About a Boy Friends Social psychology Human sexual behavior Ethics Economics The Apprentice 2 Polygamy Domestic violence Phoebe Halliwell Software engineering Human Scientology beliefs and practices Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Expert system Intelligence quotient Incarnations of Immortality Asperger syndrome Bernard Williams Zoophilia Inflation Abortion debate Education in the United States Epistemology Philosophy of language Extreme Programming Objectivist philosophy Age disparity in sexual relationships Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Species Political correctness Sinfest Free trade Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Capitalism Labor theory of value Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Little Britain Sex and the City Family name Poker jargon Education in the People's Republic of China One Tree Hill (TV series) Logic Eastern Orthodox Church Microeconomics Publicly funded medicine Fathers' rights Laura Schlessinger Mojave people Hey Jude Feminism Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Religious Society of Friends Socrates Prisoner's dilemma Pitaten Meaning of life Surveillance Autism The Amber Spyglass Unemployment The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Sharon Tate Ocean's Twelve Procrastination Debugging Division of labour Scenes from a Memory Lie Religious conversion Leadership Past teachings of Prem Rawat Phaedo Alexander Technique
