why are ladies so shady to each other the movie mean girls over did it a little but the sad thing is the movie is very true to life i work w mostly females and some of them can't stand each other i have a female friend that used to be cool with my other ladies friends now she despises both of them i dated a girl that told me her bff was a hoe why do you ladies seem like your at the cerbral warfare with other women and it's be this way since high school now i'm and it hasn't changed w age you know we the ladies are taught to regard each other as threats we are raised to think that every female except ourselves is morally or socially suspect what is really funny is how so many walk around thinking that they are 'different' for having better relationships with men then with women but most are like that most find it easier to deal with males especially in sexual relationships then to deal with other females some women realize this some don't i know females who have never been able to have a real friend ship with another female because they were convinced that she would take their man or take their job or take her place in a social circle what we the ladies need to realize is that we have more to learn from other women then to lose from them there is room for more then one girl in a social interaction in a circle of friends in a workplace and in our lives but if a lady continues to think that the only way that she can interact is to the sole female then she will never have female friendships Friends One Tree Hill (TV series) Gender role Social rule Dead Like Me Friendship Jean Grey Humphrey Bogart The Smoking Room Shaggy dog story Scenes from a Memory Undergrads Kodocha Nicomachean Ethics Pitaten Knots Landing Blonde on Blonde Charmed Infantilism EastEnders Sydney Bristow Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The O.C.
