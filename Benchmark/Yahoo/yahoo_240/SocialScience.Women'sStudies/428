why must guys just sometimes hang out with guys my husband has a friend named mark my husband mark and myself have hung out on numerous occaions all three of us get along very well and are pretty good friends i'm a tom boy so guy friends are more my cup of tea and i usually get along with guys better as well i wheel fish hike watch football and drink beer not to many women want to do those things with me anyway well mark is always talking about how he just wants him and my husband to go four wheelin sometime like a guys day or something i guess it kinda hurts my feelings that would be the girl in me right there so my question is why must guys do guy only things sometimes it really frustrates me and i think it's stupid baba yaga just because i haven't many female friends speaks ill of me how about the fact that i have very few friends at all male or female it has everything to do with being a tom boy i'm interested in things males are mostly interested in and not interested in things that females are usually interested in so i tend to hang out with people that do things i'm interested in simple math really i didn't need your psycho babble today thanks anyway jim baw it's mark that wants the guys day not my husband he's mature enough and couldn't care less about a guys day out it's not stupid but a mental block we can't change hardened attitudes formed over decades even if we wish to then there are social norms which some times take more than a generation to just get modified leave aside the total change the answer for you is that guy and guy things shall continue but increased participation by people like you shall help in modifying attitudes your kids would face lesser resistance when they reach your age Kyle Broflovski Humphrey Bogart Friends Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story Singlish Boston Public Kodocha About a Boy Laura Schlessinger EastEnders American Psycho Milton H.
