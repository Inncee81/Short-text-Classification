are men becoming more and more submissive in the modern world in my opinion its not about submission or non submission there are women who believe that we should rule the world and there are those who feel that we are entitled to the same rights as men and gender equality in most societies boys are taught that men have the dominant role in relationships families society in general since modern day women have more rights this conflicts with that mode of thinking because women now choose and decide for themselves which strips away from the dominance of men and places them in an equal position sex is also a factor of why some men feel submissive most women choose who they will sleep with therefore some men feel they have to go to certain measures to have intercourse with them translating it then to women having some sort of power in contrast a woman doesn't really need to do much convincing to have a man sleep with her unless she is hideous looking or for some other rare reason personally i don't want for women to show preponderance over men its obvious that men with no character can become dull after a while no offense to anyone personally but most definitely do not agree with male dominance either because women are not inferior in any way shape or form unless they choose to be balance is all it takes though its easier said than done there are many other reasons for these issues between men and women but i focused on those however in midst of all this i do find that male submission or dominance does work where sex concerns because its mutual and consentual fun Sexual orientation Infantilism Homosexuality and Christianity Human sexual behavior Transgender Homophobia Feminism Domination & submission (BDSM) Gender role Domestic violence BDSM Gender Homosexuality Economic inequality Women in Islam Transsexuality French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Gender-neutral language Human sexuality Androgen insensitivity syndrome Same-sex marriage Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Group sex Cross-dressing Divorce Age of consent Same-sex marriage in Canada Woman Child sexual abuse Theory of conduct Sex Friedrich Schleiermacher God and gender The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Lawrence v.
