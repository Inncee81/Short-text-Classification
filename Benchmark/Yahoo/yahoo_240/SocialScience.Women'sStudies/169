questions for the girls i was just reading the answers to one of the questions below me and i read numerous people answering your rack to the question complete with other various sexual references it got me thinking about a million different things for one do guys actually say things like this in real life or do they only say it when they're hiding behind a computer screen especially when they don't even have pictures of themselves posted up i mean i've said my share of stupid things when talking to a girl but i can't even imagine what a girl would say do if a guy said something like that in real life what would your real life reaction be also would you ever actually meet someone in person that you started talking to on yahoo answers just seems weird to me then again i didnt think people actually used dating websites either but apparently a lot of people do curious to see your thoughts of course they do i have brothers and lordy to listen to them go on about their adventures and their references to women would make your hair stand up people do connect on the web and it is very possible to hook up just about anywhere i can't really believe you are that naive' having read about your escapades in ocean city i think there's more partying in you than you let on Avenue Q Plame affair The Human Stain A Course In Miracles KaBlam!
