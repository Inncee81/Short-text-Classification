don't you think that insulting women would make them more prone to become feminists it depends on the men and women men become feminists too what affect insulting women will have on them it also depends on how insulting people are being towards them as well i grew up pretty sheltered living in rural areas i could not believe how men treated women away from there college was a rude shock the disrespect of some men towards women was not just upsetting it was dangerous what many got away with when i was in college in the 's but that didn't make women feminists it made for some very messed up women the women and men i knew who became feminists just wanted to be treated with respect and not as a piece of meat on campus after college i've lived primarily in medium sized to large us cities and at work while walking to lunch i've been repeatedly sexually harassed walking down the street in business clothing by men hooting at me on construction sites men in cars screaming at me while they were supposedly driving men saying outrageous things to me while walking down the street past me or on the opposite side of the street in parking lots etc frankly most women and men found this behavior insulting not gratifying and the women often felt it was threatening if they weren't feminists beforehand even shy women and men got tired of being treated so poorly i've had co workers and managers repeatedly tell sexual jokes about women while the women were present at work at the business work site again many women didn't consider themselves feminists beforehand but quickly got sick of being treated like a prostitute at work unfortunately the younger men and women didn't like the behavior but were not willing to stand up to the harassers when these men acted inappropriately at other workplaces i saw more older men and women 's who were only too willing to tell other men what they thought of their sexual harassment and sexism but it's very threatening for many women to stand up to a harasser i agree if you've never been discriminated against or been harassed on a regular basis in public or at work you'll have less reasons to think you need to be a feminist but if you respect yourself and expect others to act professionally at work and treat others civilly in public you're less likely to take it and say boys will be boys or girls will be girls i've also seen a woman sexually harass men and was equally upset but the men didn't want to make waves Sexual harassment Feminism Prostitution Masculism Sex-positive feminism Gender role Shaggy dog story Domestic violence Woman Social rule Human sexual behavior Internet troll Yoko Ono Camille Paglia Simone Weil Joke St. Elmo's Fire (film) Germaine Greer Sex Effeminacy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sexism Economic inequality Human sexuality Biology and sexual orientation 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Transsexuality Gender-neutral language Civil rights Humphrey Bogart Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an History of intersex surgery Animal rights Orgasm Full Metal Panic?
