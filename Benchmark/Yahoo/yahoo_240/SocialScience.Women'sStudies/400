a question for feminists why do feminist get so bent out of shape with other women just because we don't agree with you i like dominante men and i want a traditional marriage and most times i get told by other women how awful i am and how i'm hurting women everywhere i think that's really stupid because isn't the whole idea built around having choices so why is my choice so bad mike t you're too late i will throw my two cents in it has been my experience that feminist are pretty cool and they usually know what they want and work to get there you sound like one honestly take it as a complement radical feminism has nothing to do with choice it has everything to do with power a real man one who is dominant need not be abusive to the contrary he should protect love and cherish his wife also just because he wears the pants does not necessarily mean he should not ask for advice no one sees it all from all points your choice would be deemed bad because in terms of a political struggle for power that has nothing to do with relationship you add nothing to the cause radical feminism is like any group struggling for total control unpleasant to be around for all parties who disagree Feminism Sex-positive feminism Marriage Domestic violence Anarchism History of women in the United States Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism American Conservatism Peter Griffin Gender-neutral language Fathers' rights Friends Evil Lesbian Episodes of Lost (Season 1) American individualist anarchism Polygamy Same-sex marriage Socialist Workers Party (UK) Andrea Dworkin Ethics Biology and sexual orientation Internet troll Jennifer Lopez Judaism The Handmaid's Tale The Apprentice 2 Joke Women in Islam The nature of God in Western theology Libertarian socialism Masculism Alcoholics Anonymous Avenue Q Sadism and masochism LaVeyan Satanism Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Philosophy of language Where Mathematics Comes From Plame affair Homosexuality and Christianity BDSM Incarnations of Immortality Civil rights Singlish Humphrey Bogart Fiddler on the Roof Masturbation Abortion debate Saved by the Bell Knots Landing Philip J.
