why is it that you never hear about female pedophiles or sex offenders its just strange to me and when you think of pedophile you think of a bald fat hair old perverted man are there are female sex offenders i'm not crazy i was just wondering all this because i'm watching law and order svu right now it's rare but they're out there alright it's only been in recent years that these crimes that these women have committed are getting taken more seriously being reported to police more often and these criminals are being made to be just as accountable for their disgusting actions as the men who do it are and they are getting headlines just as the men are fictional tv shows just haven't caught up to the reality that these sick women are out there too i can imagine that will change as more of these cases are made known to the public some examples of highly publicized cases in the us and canada mary kay letourneu of washington state was a schoolteacher and a sex offender she not only seduced but also got herself pregnant twice by one of her grade school students she went to jail years for their crime and after she got out they got back together he's now an adult and they got married in some say it was a matter of them being born out of time humph i still say she corrupted him and abused her authority as a teacher in fact there have been news reports across the us canada the uk australia and other countries of female teachers who have been convicted of sexually abusing their underaged students just as there are male teachers who have gotten nailed for the same thing there's also been arguments that there is a double standard where women sex offenders don't get as harsh a punishment as male offenders one of the most disturbing cases of a female sex offender a women serial killer in canada named karla homolka she and her then husband paul bernardo were called the barbie and ken murderers their first victim was karla's own sister over the years the pair would systematically befriend teenage girls and then rape and or murder them she went to jail years in the rape and murder of three teenage girls i think probably because this happened in canada it didn't make much news in the us i remember back in the early s there was a year old woman in my neighborhood a large midwestern city whose kids i used to babysit for she got sent off to what they called a hospital for the criminally insane because she got romantically and sexually involved with a year old at that time most people in the neighborhood blew it off as a rite of passage for the boy and truth be told he did have a crush and was pretty openly obsessed with her buying her gifts bringing her flowers etc but his parents didn't see it that way and so they prosecuted under the statutory rape law but the case was kept real quiet not even a mention in the papers i only knew about it because my mother told me why i wouldn't be babysitting for her anymore i heard that the boy ran away from home trying to look for her didn't hear any more after that about what happened to either one of them Serial killer EastEnders Pedophilia Rape Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal Murder Domestic violence Days of our Lives Humphrey Bogart Polygamy Prostitution 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Child pornography Marriage North American Man/Boy Love Association Leo Frank Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Statutory rape Law & Order: Special Victims Unit Child sexual abuse Prisoner (TV series) Law & Order Great Teacher Onizuka Satanic ritual abuse Knots Landing Boston Public Paul Bernardo Sharon Tate Pornography Theory of conduct Plame affair Miscarriage of justice Childlove movement Mary Kay Letourneau Marc Dutroux Zoophilia Appeal Little Britain Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Sexual abuse Hip hop rivalries The Fairly OddParents The Marshall Mathers LP One Tree Hill (TV series) Lex Luthor Pornography in Japan The Lovely Bones Infantilism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Crime Jam (TV series) Friends The Catcher in the Rye Katelyn Faber Spanking Incest Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Sathya Sai Baba Lawrence v.
