i just came home to find my new husband wearing my undies bra and a half slip he said thet he had always wondered what it would feel like well i fell over laughing but thought it was very strange i have heard of guys trying on panties but a lacey half slip i guess it might be normal for guys to be curious even jealous of the silky things we wear i plan on teasing him for awhile and made him pose for a few pics but i am wondering if this is a bit abnormal what are your thoughts he wanted to know how it felt why tease him i hope he doesn't pose for you because i think you would make him regret it either that or he'll thank you for advertising for a new partner for him Scenes from a Memory Social rule Avenue Q Time Out of Mind Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Professional wrestling match types The Ashlee Simpson Show Good Morning, Vietnam Ranma __ characters Buddy Guy Blood on the Tracks Datalore (TNG episode) Friends Haven (TNG episode) Boom Town (Doctor Who) Full Metal Panic?
