where do women get off saying men cannot handle pregnency that is ridicolous and doesn't make any sense what information supports this claim i guess you women think a man would die from giving birth because of he can survive it he can handle it i know this claim always annoys me as well men may not be able to give birth but plenty of men have endured other probably even more traumatic experiences who do you think the vast majority of soldiers and warriors throughout human history have been men but of course getting an arm hacked off your face whacked with a spiked mace bullets to the gut your flesh ripped up by shrapnel or your skin burned with mustard gas is nothing compared to the pain and trauma of pregnancy and birth right whenever i hear this argument that giving birth requires some kind of special courage that only woman can have i feel like slapping the people who say it for their stupidity go talk to the men who fought in the trenches of wwi or survived the bataan death march and tell them how they couldn't possibly take the strain of pregnancy Trench warfare Abortion debate Use of poison gas in World War I Post-traumatic stress disorder Abortion Pregnancy Childbirth Miscarriage Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Birth control Breastfeeding Clothing Theory of conduct Sin City Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Poker jargon Breech birth Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Irish Guards Human sexual behavior World War I Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Homer Simpson Romulus and Remus Darth Vader Unreal Human Rape Goodness and value theory Major League Baseball television contracts Left-handed Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Psoriasis Tank classification Spina bifida Philosophical skepticism Chemical warfare Obstetrics Nazi human experimentation Ammunition Aztec Hearing impairment Smallpox Anne Boleyn Theodicy Transsexuality Fathers' rights Bataan Marriage Doomsday argument Terminal ballistics The Dunciad Dissociative identity disorder God Emperor of Dune Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Wolfrider Fecal incontinence Cytomegalovirus Immortality Reincarnation Comanche K' Hera Storytelling Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Doctor (Doctor Who) Condom Little Britain Social rule Tank Aortic dissection W.I.T.C.H.
