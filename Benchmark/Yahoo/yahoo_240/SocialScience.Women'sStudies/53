why do women like to throw around the whole giving birth thing so much a lot of women especially on this forum are always using arguments like well a woman can give birth to you or you wouldn't be here if women couldn't give birth blah blah blah like so what without sperm you can't give birth to anyone are men supposed to bow to women because they can give birth last i checked i only have one mother and none of you women would be here if your dads didn't knock up your mom or if your dad didn't give his sperm to a sperm bank fighting in a war is worst than giving birth even the most stupid and least capable woman can give birth it can even be done in a coma that kind of makes it less than an item for bragging rights much akin to bragging about a cowlick it is comparable to a fish bragging to a dog about it's superior swimming ability this type of woman also denigrates the fact that men are just beginning their willful and intentional duty as a parent in supporting their children for the next two or more decades even women who were raised by a single mother is heavily dependent on either a man or men via government as surrogate father ignore them they are emotionally stunted Abortion debate Adoption Father Humphrey Bogart Fathers' rights Little Britain EastEnders Friends In vitro fertilisation Theory of conduct The Fairly OddParents Divorce Charmed Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Androgen insensitivity syndrome Ren and Stimpy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Iggy Pop Fathers' rights movement in the UK Kim Possible Jam (TV series) Transsexuality Daredevil The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Futurama (TV series - season 5) Shaggy dog story Childbirth Peter Griffin Child custody Whale Kodocha Married... with Children Characters from Arrested Development Recurring South Park characters Joke Surrogacy Pregnancy Sin City Garfield Kurt Cobain Poker jargon History of British nationality law Margaret Sanger Ranma __ characters Human History of intersex surgery Artificial insemination Infertility Good Times Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film) About a Boy Kyle Broflovski Philosophical skepticism Van Houten family Cowboy Bebop One Tree Hill (TV series) Birth control The Marshall Mathers LP Kibbutz StarCraft: Uprising Conscription Bill Maher Intelligence quotient Dead Like Me Eminem I Am Furious Yellow Marie Antoinette Grandview, U.S.A.
