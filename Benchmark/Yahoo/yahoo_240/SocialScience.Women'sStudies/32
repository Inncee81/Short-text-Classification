registering potential fatherhood to protect men's rights to child in case of underhanded adoption the state of virginia's social services department recently passed a law asking men to voluntarily notify the state when they have had sex with a woman so that if in the event of pregnancy and adoption the state will have record of potential fathers and be able to notify the man so that he may consent to adoption of his child an interesting side note of this is that the child support offices will have access to the records although they will not establish paternity another interesting thing is that fornication sex between unmarried adults is a misdemeanor in virginia so i guess by asking men to register the state is also asking them to cop to a crime rarely enforced but nonetheless a crime if fathers don't file the paperwork they give up their right for the state to inform them about a possible adoption or if they've lost their parental rights if the form contains the address of the woman she will be notified what are your thoughts on this http www roanoke com news roanoke wb state officials said the public does not have access to the registry the information also is not available through the freedom of information act harris said the problem with this law is the focus is in the wrong place plus they won't have enough manpower to file in some database a list of everyone who had unmarried sex just last saturday much less making this an ongoing database i think the state would be better served to require all women wanting to give a child up for adoption obtain a waiver from the father of the child before the woman may give up that child for adoption i've seen too many adoptions annulled because the woman had a one night stand with a guy got pregnant then gives the child up for adoption the man later finds out he has a child wants to raise his child and the state has no choice but to give the child to the father regardless of the time the child has spent with the adoptive family i don't know what they will do when they genuinely don't know who the father is but they should have thought about this before they had sex with a guy shouldn't they fathers' rights are important also does the law address what happens when a woman is raped Marriage Divorce Abortion debate Fathers' rights Same-sex marriage Abortion in the United States Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Plame affair Roe v.
