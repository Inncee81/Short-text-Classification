would allowing gay marriage bring stability to the gay community and would making divorce more difficult to obtain bring more stability to straight community i think that gay marriage would bring more stability to not only the gay community but society in general divorce being harder to obtain however would not bring stability staying married to someone despite major problems brings chaos not stability forcing people to try to reconcile their differences may seem like a good idea on the surface because some people take marriage and divorce far too lightly but even so forcing people to stay together against their will is bad for the all the people involved esp the children people don't change unless they want to change laws can't force people to love each other i'm not sure that i agree with the post above that said that making marriage more difficult to obtain would be a good solution because who then would be the good authority to decide who should marry and for what reasons it's too complicated to have too many restrictions how would they be enforced and how fair would they be to all just my opinion Marriage Same-sex marriage in Canada Divorce Same-sex marriage Human sexual behavior Polyamory Federal Marriage Amendment American individualist anarchism Religion and sexuality Fathers' rights Lawrence v.
