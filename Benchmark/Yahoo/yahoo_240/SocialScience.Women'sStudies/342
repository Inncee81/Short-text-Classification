do men get scared you notice its always the woman grabbin for the man when shes scared its almost instinct do men ever get scared and if they do how do they hide it so well yes men definitely get scared but i feel like they are afraid of different things and they deal with their fear in different ways i feel like some of it has naturally evolved and some of it is social conditioning when it comes to the fight or flight discussion i feel like more men will fight whereas women are more prone to choose the flight option note i did not say all in either case i feel like this has affected our biological development men typically are taller and have more muscle mass than women if a predator or another human were to threaten a man woman and their child in most cases the man would be better suited for fighting off the predator or at least distracting it while the woman escapes with the child thus there is a better survival rate even if the man dies the woman and child live and the faster not stronger women survive and the stronger men survive as such their traits are passed to their offspring if i am in a situation where i feel threatened or afraid rather than becoming scared i get an adrenaline rush and i become more aware i keep my cool and am ready to defend myself if i need to i'm a decent sized guy and i am confident i can take care of myself this type of attitude is calming to someone who is scared and would typically take the flight action when in danger women are typically drawn to it because it gives them a sense of security i can't speak for all guys of course but the only time i get that deer in the headlights look is when a girl brings up a subject i don't want to talk about haha God Emperor of Dune Androgen insensitivity syndrome Dog Ranma __ characters Abortion debate The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Extinction Autism Brown Bear Gender role Anorexia nervosa Gray Wolf Evolution Kim Possible Theory of conduct Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Transsexuality Infantilism Milton H.
