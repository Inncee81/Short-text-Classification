do feminists instruct thier daughters not to accept doors being opened for them from little boys at school otherwise where do girls learn this crap where i'm from we teach everybody boys and girls to open doors for others and to say thank you when someone opens the door for you case in point i was at the dentist the other day and a mother and her mentally challenged daughter who was about or were walking out ahead of me i overheard the mother say when people are walking up behind you always hold the door for them i walked through and said thank you like i always do and i always hold the door for others and open it for the people behind me when i'm entering it's how i was raised so i don't get it i come here and there's always this big controversy over men holding doors for women i always believed it was something everyone did and everyone said thanks unless they are just rude jerks where do you people live that only males are taught to hold doors or is all this complaining just much ado about nothing edit just to clarify i open the door the door for everyone as in let them walk in first and i walk in after when entering a building when exiting a building i hold the door so that it doesn't close on them not sure why this distinction is made but it's common practice where i'm from for men and women Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Shining (film) The Marriage of Figaro Androgen insensitivity syndrome The Death Gate Cycle Japanese tea ceremony Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Gender role Friends Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine Eastern Orthodox Church Transsexuality Milton H.
