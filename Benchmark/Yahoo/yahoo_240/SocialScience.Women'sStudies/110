whats should i do until about or years ago i always wore pantyhose with my skirt suits for work each day at the office needless to say with me dressing that way for work each day my hubby developed a pretty intense curiousity for my pantyhose right around the time that my wardrobe transitioning to skirt suits and going bare legged with skirts i was wearing pantyhose for work only on occasion one one of those occasions that i was wearing them i just asked him if he was so curious about the hose why doesnt he just try them i then hiked up my skirt eased out of my sheers handed them to him and told him to slip them on well long story short he went absolutely ga ga over the way they felt which i thought was kind of neat hes asked a few more times recently for me to let him wear them again but i dont want things to get out of hand at the same time i don't want to deny it to him because of how much he liked it that one time what should i do he's not alone in his interest many men have an interest in pantyhose to various degrees as far as it getting out of hand its just like any other area of sexual exploration keep the lines of communication open between the two of you i love pushing the envelope and broadening horizons so for me i wouldn't deny him something he so enjoys Pantyhose Skirt and dress Undergarment Stocking Social aspects of clothing Ranma __ characters Trousers Suit (clothes) Leggings Tights The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Bob Jones University Swimsuit Cowboy Time Out of Mind Humphrey Bogart Shaggy dog story Mojave people Gender role Milton H.
