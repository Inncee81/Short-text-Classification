if men are tanks what do you think of this analogy men have been caricatured as knights in shining armor for quite some time now not all men meet that standard we for centuries have used the field plate of stoisicim and the denial of emotions as a defence against what ever is being thrown out at us i think men need to have that field plate of stoicism even today however what is becomming more and more important is to percieve things that are thrown at us from a long ways off so dont have to use that armor of stoisism every time evolving from the knight in shining armor to figurative tank tanks dont just realy on big slabs of steel and compoisites to protect them whats becoming important is situational awareness the ability to see far off whats comming at you millions of dollars are spent on these crude behemouths sightes and sensors so they percieve whats around them i think we need both the field plate of stoicism and now more then ever to be situationaly aware well what do you think i like it and find it to be true with most of the men i know you could also say that men do let some people in and show them emotions this would be the people inside the tank and that there are not so great tanks those that fire in the wrong direction or are simply in need of repair Tank Armour Panzer I M4 Sherman Vehicle armour Panzer II T-72 Stryker Tiger I Combine (Half-Life 2) M16 (rifle) T-34 Stoicism Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 M1 Abrams Ammunition Armored Core Imperial Guard (Warhammer 40,000 army) M113 Knight Rider Panther tank Squad Leader Warrior (World of Warcraft) Cavalry Terran (StarCraft) Undergrads Cosmic Era technology Merkava RuneScape quests Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Grand Theft Auto (game) Tank gun Battlefield 2 Superior Defender Gundam Force Battle of Jutland Vegeta Sex and the City Firearm The Parting of the Ways Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Voltes V Transformers: Cybertron Armoured personnel carrier Armoured warfare Iron Man Baseball Armored car Bratislava Castle Zerg Composite armour Reactive armour High explosive anti-tank Starsiege USS Voyager (NCC-74656) Space Shuttle program Mecha A Course In Miracles Waking the Dragons BattleTech technology Softball The Covenant Bulletproof vest MS-06 Zaku II Operation Barbarossa Shaggy dog story Starsiege: Tribes Asperger syndrome Seismic retrofit Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Robot Master EastEnders German armored fighting vehicle production during World War II Terminal ballistics The Invisibles Trench warfare Kain (Legacy of Kain) Star Destroyer Teen Girl Squad Polish cavalry U.S. Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time characters RuneScape weapons Sloped armour Brotherhood of Nod Type 98 Emotions (album) Combat Mission (computer game series) Six-Day War Gulf War YuYu Hakusho Battle of the Bulge Darth Vader Empire Earth II Comparison of 21st century fighter aircraft Heinkel He 112 Operation Market Garden Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2
