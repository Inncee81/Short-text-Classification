a long personal question for women need your opinion suppose you were a big fan of a musical band there were two main stars in this band the lead singer the keyboard player both of them are brothers the singer is a tall and handsome guy and he sings with so much passion that gets cheers from all the fans and you are like totally attracted to him eventually by virtue of luck you both meet and go out on a date you get to know that not only is he the lead singer but also the music composer lyricist wow the chemistry between you two is increased tenfold you both are deeply in love with each other and pursue a serious relationship now this guy's brother the keyboard player is kinda ugly and a bit fat but a very good guy at heart it turns out that he actually has deep feelings for you but once he knew that you and his brother were dating he is heartbroken but makes a mature decision not to see you or get involved in your matters but one day by chance you meet this brother say hi strike up a friendly conversation he is immensely delighted to meet and spend time with you he expresses how happy he is to know that you and his brother are together you both have an enjoyable conversation until all of a sudden you get shocking news the main person responsible for the working success of the band was not your bf but the brother the brother was the guy who composed all the songs wrote the lyrics even arranged the vocalist for the songs your bf didn t do anything you thought he was the singer of the band but you were wrong founded you bf had very poor quality of voice so he was merely lip syncing with the vocalist behind the scenes but you couldn t make out the difference because the sounds were synthesized the music was so good that you were absorbed in the enjoyment the reason your bf was even in the band in the first place is because he was his brother you initially doubted the brother but after he proved everything to you you came to the realization your bf is a cheat he just lied to you about himself being so great just because he wanted to love you and needless to say the brother is heart stricken with disappointment as well in this situation what would you do next dump your boyfriend immediately because he lied to you then get away from both of them calm down and still stick with your bf realizing it s too late you have already given your heart away to him dump your boyfriend immediately but after a period of time start dating his brother as he is very talented and good natured both brothers are liars not just the singer one can lie passively as well as actively and the ugly brother is also living a lie i would have nothing to do with either brother because the whole situation is very likely to end badly best wishes Blood on the Tracks EastEnders The Ashlee Simpson Show One Tree Hill (TV series) Humphrey Bogart Roxette The Band ABBA Queen (band) W.I.T.C.H.
