iamgine a woman hooks up with a steady man with an normal to decent income the man had a vasectomy but doesnt inform her about it in an attempt to get pregnant she forgets the pill since she is not getting pregnant she bangs some thug who is barely getting by financially when she comes back pregnant to the well off guy for marriage or child support he can proove the child is not his since his sperm count is zero a surprise to the soon to be mother should the guy have to pay child support anyway since he tricked her and because it is in the best interest of the child to go after the money of the well off guy since there is nothing to take from the biological father i think many here would be surprised to learn that many men have been in similar circumstances where they were ordered to pay child support for children to which they are unrelated it is an all too common problem estimates put the percentage of this at between and many states still hold to the legislation that says all children born into the marriage are considered children of the husband depending on the state he has a very narrow window in which to contest paternity this means if she can hide it long enough she's free and clear and will never be prosecuted for fraud even when she knows the husband is not the father not only should the husband in your question not have to pay she should be heavily fined and jailed for fraud and attempted extortion as well as receive nothing in the divorce if the husband chooses to go that route the bio dad should receive total shared custody with the mother Divorce EastEnders Child support Child custody Knots Landing Marriage Advance fee fraud Birth control 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Abortion debate Paternity Father Fathers' rights Fathers' rights movement in the UK Past characters (Neighbours) Neighbours Masculism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Status of religious freedom in Malaysia Enron Corporation One Tree Hill (TV series) Isabella of Jerusalem Family Single parent Credit card Pregnancy Friends Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Fred Phelps Internet fraud Babylonian law Fertility awareness David Blunkett Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom IBM PC compatible Woman Hillary Rodham Clinton Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Contract Married... with Children Family name Prostate cancer Algerian Family Code The Marriage of Figaro Mail-order bride Legal rights of women Evan Mecham Indira Gandhi Politics of Canada Freeters Alois Hitler Human Marc Dutroux Domestic violence Melanie Wilkes Tax British nationality law Federal Marriage Amendment Paternalism Witch trial Confidence trick Spyware FairTax Will & Grace Brian Griffin Bank fraud Sun Myung Moon Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Incarnations of Immortality Diana, Princess of Wales Women in Islam Social Security (United States) Peter Griffin Capitalism Martha Stewart Same-sex marriage Lawrence v.
