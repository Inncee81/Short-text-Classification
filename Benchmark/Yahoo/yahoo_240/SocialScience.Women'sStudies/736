is is possible to love and respect women but not be a feminst many have stated that rejecting feminism and respecting women as equal partners are mutually exclusive can't do both at the same time do you agree with this if you agree are you saying that anyone that is not a feminist considers women second class citizens thinks that they are not people too don't deserve equal opportunities etc let me state for the record i have great love and respect for females of all ages and get it right back however i will not ever accept being characterized by anything that starts with fem and i am far from alone rico steve don't play dat if you want to accuse me stand up be a man and send me an email girly you know i respect you but i think you are off base on this one let me use myself as an example there are hundreds of females all ages who would testify under oath that i am i am not a feminist they have at no time ever witnessed me treat any female with anything less than due respect and consideration as a person based on her sex see not a feminist but still a person who loves and respects women there are millions of us out here one of the advantages is that i can chose to treat ladies categorically different better than i ever would a man without guilt benevolent sexism kind of like the best of both girly i was not intending to bash feminism rather unbashing non feminism girly economic equality certainly pay hire and fire equally politically sure it's a racket y'all can have it socially yes and no same rights but in practice not being a feminist frees me to treat women better than i do men you would call it sexism i'm not mean to men but i treat all the ladies in my life simply better socially than i treat they guys in kinder even more respectful way i know feminists don't shouldn't approve of that but that's one of several reasons i am not one if i were a feminist it would be wrong imo to treat women better than men so no i'm no feminist but that does not make me a bad guy kendrick i get you but i tried not to be too wordy i probably did not use the best choice of words thanks girly we're cool as always carrie in answer to your how can you love and respect based on physical characteristics i mean the principled kind of love no romantic also i am thinking of females that i know personally but in the broadest view i guess i would have to say respect is more accurate someone might consider me guilty of benevolent sexism but in all my years i have not gotten a single complaint the women i know seem to like it properly motivated wendy g i don't qualify equal is not the right term in my opinion i don't discriminate and try to treat all fairly but i also don't treat men and women equally at all times and in all circumstances it doesn't always work for me however i do know you are consistent with that which i highly respect equal means equal as well it should if you claim the feminist moniker no word essays justifying inequality when it suits your fancy but i am free to treat women and men categorically unequally when it seems appropriate i have hundreds friends and not a single one has ever said that my behavior toward any of them is anything but kind and respectful because of sex or race or anything else like that the good news is that i already have a toaster pythagoras are you a masculist no so then that that means that you do not want men to have equal rights why not what do you have against men see how unreasonable that position is just because you don't subscribe to masculism does not necessarily mean you don't want men to have equal rights feminism is no different i ain't one never was one and ain't never gon' be one and you can draw whatever conclusions you wish but that does not make them so my goodness will you guys please get over your damn stereotypes and stigmas long enough to learn for crying out loud yes that makes you a feminist forget what everyone else thinks feminists and anti feminists alike do you agree with the definition the belief in social political and economic equality of the sex es yeah plural if you disagree with this definition that makes you either a misandrist or a misogynist all definitions taken literally now do you fall within the stereotypes you have to figure that out for yourself but please don't let the stereotype keep you from equality if anything those who recognize the stereotype and disagree with it and actually do something about it instead of sitting around bitching about it yet still believe in the ideal can be the most beneficial to the cause
