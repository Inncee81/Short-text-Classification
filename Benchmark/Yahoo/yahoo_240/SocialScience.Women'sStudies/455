do gender roles truly exist are they social or biological in origin how do you account for those who don't fit into the roles also if you could add your personal definition of gender role that would be very helpful as well please don't look it up cut paste in your own words how you think of it right now thanks so lori there's a subset role for a female that is the 'breadwinner' career woman who can't stand being around kids opens the door for men and there's a subset role for men who are 'househusbands' and incredibly nurturing to infants all things vulnerable show no aggression if the subset is completely the opposite of the role it's supposed to fit under isn't that kinda pointless contradictory there are studies showing that people treat babies differently depending on the sex of the baby without even realizing it even baby boys are called strong big while girls are called sweet cute i like your explanation kendrick i beleive it is a combination of both biological social the biological differences though i do not think are as strong as the social differences meaning biologically we're more flexible in our roles adaptability is one of the greatest of human evolutionary traits so i do not see how biologically strict gender roles would benefit but societies have often flourished at a certain point when people specialize gender roles would be similar to specializing would it not how in the world do you people figure i reject science i'm actually more into science than social science but i guess a few of you must have your prejudices presumptions degree in the humanities are you possibly confusing me with someone else i'm an engineer have applicable b s degrees both social and biological in a way gender roles happen in every society while men do gather and women do hunt in hunter gatherer societies or at least in some it's usually easier for a pregnant woman or a woman who's nursing a potentially noisy baby to gather women do most of the childrearing too because they've got the mammary glands also in early warfare where strength really does matter it makes more sense to send the men out to fight beyond the basics though it's all a matter of culture women aren't so much weaker than men that we can't do manual labor in fact women are used as the pack beasts in many countries men are also fully capable of playing with the babies and cooking a lot of our s gender assumptions are actually pretty new anyway and have more to do with wealth than gender in a poor family everyone has to work and in a farming family when it's harvest time it don't matter what you've got between your legs you're working it was only ever in the wealthier city dwelling families that women were kept in the home doing needlepoint or whatever the stay at home mom and working dad nuclear family arrangement only caught on in the us in the fifties because we were rich enough that people could do that Sexual orientation Transgender Transsexuality Sex Physical attractiveness Theory of conduct Biology and sexual orientation Infantilism Woman Sociocultural evolution Gender-neutral language Orgasm Intelligent design Liberalism Anthropology Rape Family Species Capitalism Medicine Intelligence quotient Culture Affirmative action Objectivist philosophy Grammatical gender Wealth Androgen insensitivity syndrome Masculism Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Homophobia Sociobiology Same-sex marriage Game theory Evolutionism Gender identity disorder Feminism Ethics Goodness and value theory Social psychology Joke Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Sex assignment Effeminacy Jacobo Arenas Creationism Girl Epistemology Karl Popper Dog Human English grammar Creation-evolution controversy Anarcho-primitivism War Microeconomics Man Homosexuality and transgender Meaning of life Gender identity Human sexual behavior Breast Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Soul Civil rights Supernatural Patriotism Marriage Altruism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Gay slang Religion Gray Wolf Intersexuality Atheism Child Social rule Franz Boas Cultural relativism Eugenics Neolithic Revolution Homosexuality Divorce Breastfeeding Democracy Community John Money
