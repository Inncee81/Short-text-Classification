what do feminist think of the tony soprano character from the hbo show the sopranos i think he is a model for men not because of the crime thing but how he handles his relationships especially with women he reminds me of myself a true alpha male all girly men should watch the sopranos and take notes on how tony behaves interesting question his relationship with several of the women in his life says more than his relationship with carmela with his mother he was contrite and aiming to please until he figured her out with his daughter he gives in to her every whim and looks at her as pristine and precious it's his relationship with the shrink that interests me the most because she has absolute control over him and he knows it this is the one place in his life where he has no control and he has to give it up to a woman of all things so to the world tony is a powerful strong man in reality tony is insecure and damaged and he has no control over his emotions it is a woman to whom he reveals his insecurities and it is that woman who ultimately controls him Gender role Tony Soprano Carmela Soprano EastEnders Jennifer Melfi The Marriage of Figaro Simone Weil Days of our Lives Soprano Objectivist philosophy Yoko Ono Domestic violence Polygamy Brave New World Meadow Soprano Roman Catholic Church Superhero Girly Mary Jane Watson T'Pol Sigmund Freud Rei Ayanami The Truman Show Sadism and masochism Rape Nicomachean Ethics Abortion debate A Course In Miracles One Tree Hill (TV series) Daredevil Fantastic Four Slander and libel Hollyoaks Will & Grace Theory of conduct Feminism Girly girl Stock character Fight Club Bene Gesserit Anarcho-primitivism Arthur Schopenhauer Social psychology Love Hina main characters Rogue (comics) Memento (film) God and gender American Psycho Themes in Blade Runner Eastern Orthodox Church Maison Ikkoku Adriana La Cerva Janeane Garofalo Knots Landing Homosexuality and transgender Undergrads Asian fetish Patrick Bateman Gaze Charmed The Smoking Room Sex and the City Phaedo Coercion Leadership Asperger syndrome Butch and femme The Conformist Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an About a Boy Economic inequality S__ren Kierkegaard Law of value G-Man (Half-Life) Masculism Ultimates Civil rights Mary, the mother of Jesus Watchmen Parsifal Drawn Together Homophobia Alignment (role-playing games) W.I.T.C.H.
