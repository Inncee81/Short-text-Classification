what do you do in the real world to help inequality and abuse i know i asked this question before but the kind of material that i read here today makes me ask this question again are you helping a cause to stop racism are you helping to stop torture are you helping to stop death penalty are you doing something to stop wars are you really doing something to help stop abuse be it men children or women are you helping stopping cruelty to animals are you doing positive actions against homophobia this question comes after reading someone that has the idea of making a change in the internet to destroy feminism lol but what about the real world it is easy to write here but are we doing a positive change in real life thanks yes i should say what i am doing in real life i am part of a program against animal cruelty i am a member of amnesty international regarding abuse to men women and chidlren i subsidize education and well being to an adopted girl in africa and if i post here is because i want to reach others to make positive actions or at least eventually to think about it crk i am not rich either besides the child in africa the rest is about active participation no money too little place here to explain you have a very good point i think most ethical people would be surprised just how many adults couldn't pass elementary school ethics http www goodcharacter com ycc doingright html many of us learned this in church temple many in school many from a loving parent or other adult many of us had to learn this stuff on our own the hard way most of us learned a combination of it essentially it boils down to doing the right thing as often as possible this doesn't always mean joining a club or whatever it must be nice that you can brag that you're a member of a reputable organization that does good works but is that because you were able to afford the dues and give them your money or is it because you're actually participating in things that help people and animals in my case i've tried to join several organizations and they wouldn't have me because i had no money for membership fees seems these places although probably well intended are for the well off poor people need not apply however that won't stop me from making as many correct choices each day that i can to say a kind word or nothing to walk instead of drive if i am physically able to intervene before violence erupts if i can to speak rather than allow myself to be silenced by the wrong people learn from what they read on the internet the more right stuff they read the more likely it is to help them do the right thing for some of us that's all we can offer right now our minds our education our experience and so forth if you can do more or differently that's great http www utm edu research iep e ethics htm Theory of conduct Animal rights Economic inequality Theodicy Domestic violence Education Scientology beliefs and practices Autism rights movement Abortion debate Childlove movement Transsexuality Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Simone Weil Fight Club Anthroposophy Capital punishment Human Avenue Q Blacks and Mormonism Transactional analysis Microeconomics The Subtle Knife Education in the People's Republic of China Nicomachean Ethics Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Socrates Motivation Rudolf Steiner Utilitarianism Philosophy of language Abortion in the United States Ethics World Wide Web Homophobia EastEnders Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist The nature of God in Western theology Alcoholics Anonymous Kodocha Religion Infantilism Scouting LaVeyan Satanism Summa Theologiae Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Economics MoveOn Amnesty International Eugenics Incarnations of Immortality Deconstruction Zoophilia Unitarian Universalism People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Paradox Bernard Williams Patriotism Jiddu Krishnamurti A Course In Miracles Extreme Programming Friedrich Schleiermacher Altruism Mediation Animal Liberation Front Abortion Time Out of Mind Kasparov versus The World Rick Santorum Franz Boas Merit Serial killer Opus Dei Education reform Meme Ten Commandments Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Democracy American Psycho Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Torture The Human Stain Sin City Divorce Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Mumia Abu-Jamal Mojave people Child sexual abuse Social psychology Richard Feynman German grammar Opposition to cults and new religious movements
