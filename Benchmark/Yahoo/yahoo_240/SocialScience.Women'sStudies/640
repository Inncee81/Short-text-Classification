what is a stalker i asked the question here http answers yahoo com question index ylt ampq j ik lhr rplqftpsy ix qid aaqs kr if i myself am a stalker but i guess should first ask what is a stalker is it just someone who thinks about doing certain things or someone who does them the simple definition of stalker would seem to involve following people but it seems that in today's society it has extended to so much more in that light it would seem that i was a stalker in this situation but i am no more unless mere thoughts constitute being a stalker but wait i pass by her work area on the way to my work area and glance at her everyday though i could go another way damn so maybe i'm still a stalker but i ask you what is a stalker waswisgirl i hope you don't think all of those stalking traits apply to me and if you think i only stopped because of the write up there are two things i do not like threats and bribes accordingly i never stop something because of a mere threat i'm creative enough to harrass a woman without breaking the law or getting caught at least i'm stupid enough to think i am but i chose not to because i want her to be comfortable at work main reason i was sending the emails was to try to ease down the tension but it of course backfired and hindsight is you want a definition of 'stalker' ok here goes 'stalking is a crime which canadian criminal law calls criminal harassment it is clearly defined at section of canada's criminal code the code states that no person shall without lawful authority and knowing that another person is harassed or recklessly as to whether the other person is harassed repeatedly follow the other person or anyone known to them from place to place repeatedly communicate with either directly or indirectly the other person or anyone known to them beset or watch a place where the other person is visiting lives or works or engage in threatening conduct directed at the other person or any member of their family the punishment for stalking can be as high as a five year jail term this new section of the criminal code passed in makes it much easier for the police to charge a stalker the code did contain other sections that were helpful in blatant cases of stalking but they were ineffective against the more passive but just as frightening forms of stalking for example the code prohibits trespassing on another's property at night uttering threats indecent or harassing phone calls intimidation and mischief to another person's property under the criminal code you can also get a restraining order or a peace bond against a person measures which might in certain circumstances be preferable in some cases of aggressive or predatory stalking the new law now protects you even if the conduct of the stalker is not done with the intent to scare you it is enough if it does scare you actions that might be acceptable in a normal loving relationship could become criminal harassment when one of the persons wants the relationship to end and the other does not for example in these circumstances giving someone roses could in some cases be considered to be stalking as could repeated visits telephone calls or waiting for the victim after work everybody has a right to end a relationship a former spouse or partner should stop communicating with you if you have told them that their attention is not welcome if they persist section is there to help federal department of justice canada research conducted in found that of stalking cases examined of the accused were male and of the victims were female one of the key parts of section of the criminal code is the requirement that when the conduct being complained of is following or communicating it has to be repeated there is no set rule on this it can mean persistent or frequent behaviour but the following or communicating has to happen more then once for it to constitute criminal harassment but if the conduct is watching prowling or besetting a place where you are visiting live or work or if there has been threatening conduct one incident would suffice in getting a conviction under section in all cases the conduct must be such that apprehension or fear for their safety is reasonable this means having a fear for which there is a reason not a fear based on exaggeration of the situation or on imagined problems the law also excuses those that have lawful authority from being convicted under this section one example of this has been given as the private investigator that has been hired to check into an insurance claim that you have filed some cases which have gone to court under section include the accused made telephone calls and left threatening messages on the victim's answering machine the accused visited the victim's work place for no legitimate reason and followed the victim on buses or the accused made rude or obscene gestures towards the victim if you are being harassed we suggest you talk to the police a lawyer or a victim services agency any of the above should be able to counsel you on your best course of action you may be advised for example to stay away from your home for a short period of time you should certainly keep a diary of the harassing behaviour in case your memory should later fail in court if calls are coming in get a tracing device connected through your telephone company if you have a restraining order or peace bond carry it with you at all times if you are being stalked call the police if you know that the suspect carries or owns weapons this is important information for the police and yep your behavior elaborated on in the other post most definitely meets the definition Torture Infantilism Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Katelyn Faber Same-sex marriage
