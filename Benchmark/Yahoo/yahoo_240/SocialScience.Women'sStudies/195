are my friends sexists i had lunch with a two friends a couple it was raining as we left the restaurant my friend's wife asked him to get the car and bring it up so she wouldn't have to get wet he did no big deal she said that he does it all the time no surprise to me since that is not an unusual kind of thing for the men to do for women in my circle of friends we simply treat women better in situations like that but i got to thinking what if she were a feminist would she expect the man to always be the one to pull the car up in bad weather that certainly wouldn't be equal in fact she would probably consider that to be sexist would she have gotten the car for him this time since he got it for her last time or would they have both gotten wet to ensure equality carrie they both were wearing nice clothes in a light rain the car was just a few seconds walk away and they were going home this is what he always does and this is what she expects because that's what men are supposed to do for women and you're smart enough to recognize it but since it's him being courteous it's not sexist what if for example he always expected her to pull up the car for him because that is what women should do for men i doubt you would consider it common courtesy allegra the contortionist logic that you use to pretend you don't notice the feminist hated gender roles when the woman is on the receiving end is embarrassing i know you are way smart enough to recognize this scenario see tk and waswisgirl 's answers if you're going to be a feminist be a feminist we may not agree but we will respect you more i agree with waswisgirl very seldom but she can be counted on to always stick to her feminist principles athalia no it is simple and there is a steady pattern feminism uses terms like sexism oppression and patriarchy when the woman is the one expected to serve when it's the man somehow it's always common courtesy waswisgirl i respect your consistency you are one of the very few feminists who seem to practice equality even when it might be convenient to suspend it out of convenience the mrs and mojo you do know we are talking about gender roles here he got the car because that's his role as the man what if she was expected to do all the cooking and cleaning because she's the woman i thought feminists rejected fixed gender roles and why do some feminists call it common courtesy and politeness when it's the man serving the woman but when the woman is expected to serve the man because it's her role it's sexism oppression the patriarchy etc carrie pls re read the question i did state in plain english she said that he does it all the time you re are too smart to be believed when you pretend that you have no idea that what bringing the car up all the time implies taking turns to cook fine that is equality if only he pulls out chairs opens doors etc that is inequality see the difference i m just observing what many people have repeatedly identified as a convenient inconsistency when women have a traditional expectation such as cooking is your job there is public outcry in the feminist forum oh the oppressive patriarchy but when men are expected to be gentlemen crickets feminists looking the other way i have observed this countless times if you re going to hold to feminist values fine just don't make convenient exceptions walk in the rain too if you re still struggling with this ask waswisgirl to explain it allegra they are my friends as i said i didn't bump into them i know them she is not a feminist by any means she is happy that her husband has no problem in making sure she doesn't get wet because she is his wife the woman her husband is the head of their family because he is the man of course you probably you consider that objectionable but they are happy you seem to think that just because people maintain gender roles that women become subject to abuse and disrespect what odd thinking i know many hundreds of people who grew up in a traditional household and there was no abuse or disrespect by anyone why do you think that people who are not feminists are either abused or abusers most of the people in this country us are not feminists and lead reasonably happy lives without abuse or disrespect i think it's courtesy but i don't think she's a feminist well at least i hope not otherwise she's a hypocrite Gender role Theory of conduct Domestic violence Mojave people The nature of God in Western theology Feminist movement Avenue Q Fathers' rights Epistemology Masculism Infantilism Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Civil rights Humphrey Bogart Goodness and value theory Sexual orientation Simone Weil Little Britain Transsexuality Homophobia Patriarchy Objectivist philosophy Esperanto as an international language Theodicy Microeconomics Milton H.
