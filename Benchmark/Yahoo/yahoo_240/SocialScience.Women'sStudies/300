nancy friday and the glamourisation of rape part pls read parts before reading this i have looked at the last parts and my questions had not been answered my feeling is that women respondents have been hesitant to condemn the real rape story that was recorded in nancy friday's book forbidden flowers because they may find it sensuous the questions that were not answered if a real rape story is included in the book where the victim cecilia enjoyed being gang raped and that the female readers derive pleasure from the story doesn't that mean that the women readers are condoning the rape and agreeing with the crime if the rapists of cecilia read the story in friday's book would they feel ashamed of the crime or will they feel vindicated would potential rapists who read the story be deterred from committing rape or would they feel inspired if women readers derive pleasure from the real rape story doesn't that contradict the message that rape is destructive thx thanks for your answer delicious this is not about rape fantasy that is separate i am talking about the real rape case of cecilia that features in the book forbidden flowers it would help to read the section and then come to my questions otherwise my question could be misunderstood to mean that i am promoting rape whereas in fact it is the opposite i e i have been surprised by the lack of condemnation of women respondents to nancy friday s inlcusion of the rape story rape is destructive and a crime hence my earlier questions are quite pertinent and seeking to establish one thing and that is that the rapae stroy should not have been included because it could be percieved to promote rape and that women readers who get excited by the story and pleasure themesleves over it are in fact condoning a crime hence contradicting the message that rape is a horrbible crime thanks for your reply pam i was not referring to fantasy the story cited in friday's book is a real gang rape that had taken place and was recorded in her book which in turn is designed to stimulate women readers i had mentioned before that rape fantasies are separate hence is not dealt with here pls read fridays's book forbidden flowers and read the story entitled 'cecilia' under the heading 'masturbation' because the story is real that is what led to my set of questions i raised above as well as the discussion in the previous parts regards thanks phantommoon that was a great response and sorry to hear about your rape and abuse you went through you are exactly right about cecilia even though you hadn't read her stroy she did fantasise about her gang rape experience hence shared it in the book for women readers to derive pleasure from she said she had tried to resist coming but she was being licked by one of the rapists and she came and then she told them she wanted to have sex because the feeling she had was irresistible afterwards she was dropped back from where she was picked and had pleasured herself over her ordeal for the next few days rather than tell the police she told her boyfriend who was turned on and played the submissive game thanks for answering the questions i had you are the only person to have done this rapists would feel vindicated by this story and that is why friday was irresponsible to include the story women who derive pleasure from the story would be condoning the rape following on from the above paragraph addressed to phantommoon the question i would like to ask women who have read cecilia's story and derived pleasure from it aren't you supporting the rape that had taken place afterall you are being turned on by a real crime that had taken place even though the victim derived pleasure from it i had a female lawyer friend sepcialising in criminal law and she was dealing with a rape case she admitted to me that she was tunred on by the rape and went to the toilets at work and masturbated over the rape case doesn't this mean she was supporting the rape i didn't get the chance to ask her this but i told her not to share this with anyone because the rapist would feel vindicated surely the stories i have cited go against the general perception that rape is a serious crime and perpetrators should feel ashamed of committing such crimes hi juliet r i have found the story and will post it in part separately look out for 'nancy friday and the glamourisation of rape part ' thx i'm not going to read parts sorry in fact ive only skimmed over this question it appears that you want to assert that women enjoy rape differentiate the rape fantasy that some of us have from the harsh reality of genuine rape no one in their right mind wants to experience true rape edit fair enough i will try to find time tomorrow too busy today to read all that i do find the
