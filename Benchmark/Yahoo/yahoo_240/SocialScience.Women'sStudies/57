did your parents wallop you when you were young have you forgiven them i only ask because my sister never forgave ours my dad use to beat the crud out of my brothers and i quite often he did not have control of his anger or rage my dad apologized to my youngest brother who talked to him about it a few years ago my other brother doesn't like to deal with issues or scenes so he's never discussed it with my dad i talked about some minor stuff with my dad and he couldn't handle it many many years ago he might be able to handle it now but i don't care about it anymore it's the past i don't forgive him but i accept he did the best he could even if it was awful but it's one of the reasons i decided never to be a parent what if the best job i could do as a parent was still dreadful i didn't want to take that risk with a child a child deserves to be loved and cherished not used as a punching bag EastEnders Kyle Broflovski Shaggy dog story Ranma __ characters Fathers' rights Kodocha Divorce The Fairly OddParents Knots Landing Laura Schlessinger Hillary Rodham Clinton One Piece minor characters Anger management Fred Phelps About a Boy Grandview, U.S.A.
