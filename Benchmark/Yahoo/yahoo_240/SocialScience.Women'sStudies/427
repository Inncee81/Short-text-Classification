so what's it like at a women's shelter i'm thinking about going to one but i wanna know first hand what is it like there and what are the benefits of going there will they teach you how to drive so you can get your license and be on your own tell me other stuff you know about women shelters and thanks do they take women who are emotionally abused and controlled i hate to be the bearer of bad news but no most shelters won't take women who are only emotionally abused in fact i have yet to see one where this is the case shelters are in place to protect the safety of the abused victim not give her a place to crash till she gets on her feet i do not mean to imply that your experience is not in fact abusive but unless you are physically threatened you would be better off just ending the relationship with the support of your friends and family members the women who are physically in danger are the ones who need those extra beds in shelters on a side note it should also be mentioned that most shelters because of lack of funding are turning away solitary women in favor of women with children the shelter holds women with children in priority because of the increased number of potential victims rare is the shelter now a days that will open its doors to a childless woman though if you call a few hotlines you might be able to find one again if your abusive situation is terms for plausable physical danger if your situation is not physically abusive and you just need support right now hang on to your friends and family members call those same hotlines and ask about emotional abuse support groups read self help books get into therapy and get to know you i'm currently going through the transition from emotionally abusive relationship to singlehood too so if you need someone else to talk to about this who understands feel free to e mail me sorry if what i said about the type of abuse came off as harsh i just know how badly every single bed at a shelter is needed and that it should go to the people who really need it the most if you are in physical danger then that means you take care and good luck Domestic violence Spanking Infantilism Transsexuality Child sexual abuse Rape Reparative therapy Polygamy Traumatic brain injury False memory Alcoholics Anonymous Divorce About a Boy Fathers' rights Stroke Borderline personality disorder Child abuse Narcissism Cult Human sexual behavior Homophobia Social rule Happiness Serial killer American Red Cross Boston Public Zoophilia Polyamory Anger management Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal A Course In Miracles Gratitude Torture Dog Anxiety Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Drama Child sexuality Nicomachean Ethics Asperger syndrome Opposition to cults and new religious movements Carl Jung Hate group Childlove movement Chernobyl accident Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Glen Jacobs Emotions (album) Motivation Emotion Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Involuntary commitment The Empty Child Sin City Prostate cancer Clinical depression Sigmund Freud Autism Past teachings of Prem Rawat Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Psychoanalysis Dead Like Me Homelessness Childbirth Children of God CPU cache Strap-on dildo Grief Post-traumatic stress disorder Numerology Road safety Men's rights Sant Thakar Singh Bipolar disorder Domination & submission (BDSM) Drug abuse Dissociative identity disorder Amnesty International Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare Friends of the Western Buddhist Order First aid Scientology beliefs and practices Anorexia nervosa Theodicy Theory of conduct Sheryl Crow Clomipramine Deprogramming
