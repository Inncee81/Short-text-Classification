hyip do stupid ppl not realize that investing is a fixed sum game hi i'm a precocious know it all in finance from a top private university i am writing my thesis on comparing zero sum games vs fixed sum games my logic is that zero sum games are strikingly similar to fixed sum games for example retarded people believe that they can one up the market and make above average investment returns at the expense of no one these people believe in a synergy of if enough people invest in a concrete asset that the gains can offset the losses by an infinite amount that is that people who make a huge gain on investing on a stock which makes average gains can do so at no one's expense these magicians believe that everyone can make a huge r o i ret on inv on a stock that goes up only whereas my conjecture is that exceptional returns come at the expense of fool's losses please state your opinion and tell me your credentials for those who are truely motivated to end investor false confidence ty many authors on the market talk about it as though it was a zero sum game that those that make money do so at the expense of those that lose the losers didn't buy the author's book i guess on the other hand there are days when the market tanks like feb i am hard put to know where the money went if it were a zero sum game someone would have it somewhere because so many lost theirs i think that logic casts serious doubt on the zero sum game idea many of the authors i have read almost sound like a athletic coach trying to get the investor to be motivated and get on his market face be smart make money show you are better than the other team well attitude is important but stay cool i believe as many authors do that the price of stock has little to do with economics and has mostly to do with psychology that the market is like a mercado where people come together to trade their goods to barter to bid and offer remember the tulip panic of the late 's did the tulips have any particular intrinsic value only in the minds of the speculators of the time on the other hand hyips are almost all cons and p t barnum knew all about that sort of stuff nothing to do with investing everything to do with the two headed lady i think that your opinion of hyips is correct they are generally ponzi games on the market in general i do not accept the zero sum hypothesis or random walk either both are the exclusive property of academics come into my trading room by elder is a great read on the subject generally Mutual fund Microeconomics Confidence trick Capital accumulation Ponzi scheme PE ratio Economics Gambling Keynesian economics Bond Deflation (economics) Derivative (finance) Technical analysis Annuity Hyperinflation Economy of Russia Law of value Bretton Woods system Social Security debate (United States) Supply-side economics Gold standard Wall Street Crash of 1929 Joseph P.
