stocks question i really want to invest in stock but i guess i just don't understand the idea of it yet what is the point in buying stock how do i know how much my stock is worth i really don't actually have that money until i sell the stock right i mean i can't just take some money out as if it was an atm right how do i know how much i will sell it for any basic information you can give me would help a lot i'm trying to learn but it's kinda hard to find information in words that i can understand people make money from dividends and selling stocks based on inflation and emotions you would want to buy stock when you have taken these things into account and are willing to risk your stock investment in return for a greater return on your money most companies pay no regular dividends and those that do pay very little like interest on a bank account the reason you would rather own stock than a bank account is you are expecting a greater return based on a greater risk of losing some or all of your investment in the stock market than with a bank account generally those companies that pay regular dividends are earning the market's confidence that they continue to pile up so much cash they have to give it away so if you invest in them for years and then sell you can make profit both on the dividends and the gain in value when you sell this is a sound way of making money in the stock market by inflation i mean regular inflation of wages and prices of stuff you buy that also raises the value of everything up the ladder including businesses in the stock market i also mean inflation that comes from a population that continues to grow and finds it easy and more tax advantaged to buy stock such as through k's and ira's also look at the dates of the mutual funds on your k offering and see if you can find any that were around during wwii this theory suggests you can expect some overall growth in the stock market over time some will go up some will go down be sure to diversify by buying more than one mutual fund and make sure they are in different categories so you will have some that go up to go along with those that will go down so overall your investment will grow over time notice i said mutual fund obviously you are a novice and therefore should buy mutual funds now stocks once you feel comfortable with a broker or advisory newsletter and avoid commodities and options because those are so risky with less ownership than stock and are therefore more gambling than investment much more money is probably made or lost on emotions one example is the stock market changing based on some economic data that makes sense then people continue buying and selling because they are emotionally attached to the trend have you ever played a car race video game where you are racing along faster than you should and when you come upon a curve you start to slide you get worried about crashing so you counter steer but you over corrected so you steer back the over way and discover you over corrected again the stock market has thousands of people doing the same thing every day they are going too fast the market corrects they worry about a crash and they over correct people are buying and selling based on the emotional sales pitch of a broker k enrollment relative friend email or ad look at how many answers suggested specific companies to buy or brokers to use one of them stated her affiliation to her recommendation the others did not state their affiliation they might be brokers or they might just be happy customers i advise you to steer clear of specific recommendations do an internet search or a review of a k listing and pick out mutual funds that have good track records good track records do not bring guarantees of future success but if the yankees have been to the playoffs more than the devil rays in recent years which team do you think has the better chance this year also only look at years so you don't get a fluke and you don't get a past perennial that has not done so good recently also if a mutual fund did well over years the fund manager may have retired been promoted or lured to another company for higher pay so stick to a year measurement stock is easily measured by the stock market and reported in the daily papers and the internet it is not like a car art rare coins antiques and real estate you always know what stocks are worth expect to lose a little when you sell stock just like everything else the person buying or selling wants an incentive and there are usually transaction costs too so if you see xyz stock is trading at and you have you might want to buy shares but the person who owns it would offer it for sale at and the broker wants for handling the transaction so you would only wind up with shares now worth apiece for a total of if you think you want to sell them somebody might offer you apiece for them and the broker will want another so if you sell them the broker will return to you so you would have paid and got back close to what the stock was worth you also would have lost only because you did not let it sit long enough for others to keep bidding up the price it was only affected by your activity that raised and lowered the price you do not have that cash readily available like withdrawing it from an atm since you would lose a little every time you buy or sell like i explained above it should not be fluctuating with withdrawals your investing strategy should be an expectation of keeping that stock in there for at least a year you could use your k where your employer pays all those transaction costs and the money is deducted before tax is calculated so you can afford to invest more than if it had been taxed if the rate coming out of your check is too much then you can adjust it or even stop it all together until you can add to it again in the meantime you should not withdraw from it but can sometimes borrow against it if you really need to and can afford to pay it back on a regular basis keep in mind that process usually charges you transaction costs you did not ask the hardest question of all when to buy and when to sell that is very hard to answer but you need to know something about that too basically you should buy based on meaningful statistics you should not buy based on proforma projections or forecasts those are not statistics but guesses and marketing ploys meaningful is hard to define one statistic is not enough to be meaningful recent profits are the best measure unless there is a pending investigation by the sec irs fda or other governmental entity comparing profit earnings pe ratios to other companies in their industry is a great tool but is not the best when the whole industry say technology is overpriced the other top measure relates to cash such as debt to equity ratio the drawback to this is some companies like tobacco have great cash ratios but may not be the sound investment for the future so get more than one measure from the internet maybe stick to a rule like each of the above net income p e recent news debt equity must compare favorably to competitor and to the market as a whole to compare to the market as a whole you might research the brand names of the stuff you buy the stores you visit and the restaurants you enjoy and use a few of them as benchmarks you might even find that company that gets so much of your business is a good stock buy just ripe for the stock market to go wild about the last thing is you should sell the stock or mutual fund when you no longer would want to buy it if you had the money to invest for instance you would sell if the measure you used for buying the mutual fund is now below average or the great p e ratio is too high or a meaning they lost money and there is no profit
