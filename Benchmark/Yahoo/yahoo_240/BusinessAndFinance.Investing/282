what happens to my stock if a company declares bankruptcy i own a few hundred shares of ahm american home mortgage and i only bought it a few days ago thinking that it was as low as it could get and now they are talking about bankruptcy i am wondering what will happen to my shares will i ever be re imbursed if the company comes out of bankruptcy if they come out of bankruptcy will i be able to make a profit over the next years if the company takes off again an has no debts left will i be able to trade my shares like normal if they come out of bankruptcy is it likely that i can still make a profit if they go bankrupt pay of the creditors and the business takes off again bankrupt stocks are a write off you can only hope they will try use bankruptcy protection methods to prevent a total collapse but the way the mortgage industry is looking right now i would say the chances of being bailed out by a buyout firm are slim just hope they won't fold what most companies do when they come out of bankruptcy is restructure their entire share system its really hard to say whether or not you are still going to get a piece of the new pie although more often than not you don't these new shares can be traded normally on the market read up on the history of companies like delta airlines and air canada they will give two different scenarios of how companies emerge out of bankruptcy Bankruptcy Enron Corporation Airline Bond Deflation (economics) Delta Air Lines Debt Donald Trump Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code Bank Arbitrage United Airlines Dot-com Stock Mergers and acquisitions Corporation Security (finance) Northwest Airlines The South Sea Company Mutual fund Sears Holdings Corporation Ryanair Economy of Russia Privatization Insurance Natural monopoly Stock market Gold as an investment Revco Warren Buffett Aerol__neas Argentinas Citigroup Eaton's Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Short selling Timeline of the Enron scandal America West Airlines Corporate finance Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Tesco Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code Bankruptcy in the United States Day trading Interest Ford Motor Company Mississippi Company Derivative (finance) Conrail History of the United States (1918-1945) British Airways Economy of the United States PE ratio MG Rover Group Money Avianca Temasek Holdings Pan American World Airways Raleigh-Durham International Airport US Airways NASDAQ Intellectual property Capital accumulation Corporate governance Financial markets Takeover Social Credit Marconi Corporation plc Boston and Lowell Railroad Economy of Romania Dairy Air New Zealand Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Pets.com Royal Dutch Shell Strategic management Olympic Airlines Leveraged buyout PSINet Trade Unemployment Islamic banking United Kingdom corporation tax Economy of Argentina Lloyd's of London Poker jargon Sega Publishing Air Canada Frequent flyer program FairTax Gold standard Greyhound Lines Article One of the United States Constitution
