is it better to buy a home before an investment property or vise versa i was thinking of buying an investment property to rent out which would look better for applying for the second does it matter there would be a loan on both you need to talk to your lender each one will view your situation differently a lot will depend on the equity you can show in either property whether it's by making a large down payment or the market in that area is rising quickly if you have the investment property and can show steady income from it it may help you qualify for your own home loan remember tho' the income from the property will be taxable so buying it for a month taxes ins principle and renting it for is not a pure profit but some lenders may balk if they believe you will be over extended and can't show long term tenents the market is presently getting a little more expensive to get into you may want to get your place first see what tax benefits you will have and then determine what sort of investment risk you can handle you need reserves to cover periods when the investment property is sitting empty unless you are thinking of buying bare land for selling in the distant future that's another scenario again talk to the mortgage lender that pre qualifies you before you go shopping Insurance Mortgage Life insurance United Kingdom corporation tax Bond Mutual fund Debt Predatory lending Microeconomics Leasing Bank Real estate bubble Government debt Intellectual property Financial markets Annuity Capitalism 401(k) Economy of India Derivative (finance) Economic rent FairTax Municipal bond Flat tax Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Interest Inflation Monetary policy Real estate Gross domestic product Variable universal life insurance Short selling Security (finance) Personal finance Subsidy Islamic banking Real estate broker Corporate finance Capital accumulation Warren Buffett Anarchism and capitalism Productive and unproductive labour Profit Federal National Mortgage Association Corporation Dividend Trust (Law) USA Free trade Citigroup Mergers and acquisitions Privatization Money Hedge fund Property tax Mobile home Labor theory of value Rational pricing Asset Supply and demand Economy of the United States Temasek Holdings Progressive tax Allodial title Real estate developer Donald Trump Economy of Russia Economy of Pakistan Income tax Supply-side economics Income trust Property (ownership right) Repurchase agreement Primerica Financial Services Stock market Estoppel Title insurance Financial services Bretton Woods system Nuclear power Yield curve Urban sprawl Income statement Futures contract Copyright Mortgage-backed security Interest rate Venture capital Social Security debate (United States)
