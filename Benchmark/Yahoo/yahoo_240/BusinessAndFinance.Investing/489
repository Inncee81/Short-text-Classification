if i work at my company past age can i still contribute to my k until i finally retire at the age of you must take mandatory distributions out of your k and iras so you begin a series of withdrawals based on your life expectancy for an ira at age you would take the total value of your ira and divide by to determine what your mandatory annual distribution will be in the first year the denoiminator changes ever year if you are married to a person that is ten years younger and she or he is the only beneficiary of your account the required distribution amounts can be based on the joint life expectancy of you and your younger spouse this amount will be less than a single life expectancy but you can continue to contribute to your k as the contributions are still pre tax and returns are tax deferred until distirbution so you may be lowering your overall tax bill by continuing to contribute depending on your tax situation the only issue is that if you continue to contribute there may be a very large balance when you pass so rather than spending the money in your lifetime you are passing it to your spouse or the next generation it would depend on whether you want to work past and if you have something you would rather spend the dollars on now Social Security (United States) Annuity 401(k) Life insurance Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 Roth IRA Mutual fund Pension Insurance FairTax Taxation in the United States Social Security debate (United States) Tax United Kingdom corporation tax Salary cap Trust (Law) USA Inheritance tax Politics of Canada Economic inequality Economy of India Government debt Retirement plan Canadian Senate Flat tax Inflation Microeconomics Registered Retirement Savings Plan Variable universal life insurance Corporation Charitable trust Money supply National Insurance Trusts and estates Compensation of employees Medicare (United States) Civil unions in the United Kingdom 457 plan Personal finance Capitalism Depreciation Economy of Russia Probate Immigration to the United States Balanced Budget Amendment Ponzi scheme Express trust Credit card Wind power Food Stamp Program Bretton Woods system Student loan Health savings account Dividend Progressive tax Elections in the United States Ageing Divorce Parliament of Canada Income trust Article One of the United States Constitution Property tax Surplus value Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Murder Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Wealth Money United States dollar Charles Dickens Yield curve Rights and responsibilities of marriages in the United States Concurrent estate Legal tender Health insurance Arthur Laffer Domestic partnerships in California Canadian House of Commons Tax cut Warren Buffett Euro Reaganomics Normal distribution Deflation (economics) Trust (Law) non-USA Bond British monarchy Value added tax Economy of El Salvador Anarchism and capitalism Government of Maryland Sea level rise Keynesian economics Referendum Russ Feingold Charles Haughey Bank
