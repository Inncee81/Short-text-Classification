why does the stock market keep crashing the stock market won't stop going up and then down it's like a stupid roller coaster what's happening there has been no crash the financial sector has suffered recently due to the inappropriate lending practices over the last couple years people getting mortgages for houses they can't afford interest only loans and such as the interest rates have risen these people have begun defaulting on loans and this has causes the companies holding the loans to suffer losses some of these have been pushed back to the originators and packagers and now all the financials are afraid to hold or originate mortgages due to the increased scrutiny and apparent risk anyway this behavior has led to a credit squeeze in which there is too little money available for loans the market ups and downs have been only moderate when one considers the dow has hit the level age movement is quite reasonable we have merely hit a period of high volatility due to this credit squeeze and some conflicting economic data if you can't sleep because of worry over what is going to happen next you are better off moving your assets to bonds treasuries money markets cd's etc you can come back into the market in a month or two once the volatility has subsided you can watch the vix to see when things calm down Debt Deflation (economics) Mortgage Asian financial crisis Finance Bank Short selling Supply-side economics Derivative (finance) Mortgage-backed security Economy of Russia Insurance Money supply Monetary policy Economy of Pakistan Federal National Mortgage Association Bretton Woods system Stock Gold standard Inflation Predatory lending PE ratio Interest rate Real estate bubble Interest Student loan History of the United States (1918-1945) Money Security (finance) Toronto-Dominion Bank Credit card Technical analysis Government National Mortgage Association Mergers and acquisitions Financial markets Life insurance Usury Modern portfolio theory Capitalism Central bank Wall Street Crash of 1929 Microcredit U.S. public debt Financial services Annuity Keynesian economics Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Islamic banking Yield curve United Kingdom corporation tax Collateralized debt obligation Corporate finance Futures contract Economy of the United States Fractional-reserve banking Economy of India 401(k) Privatization Great Depression Investment bank Free trade Microeconomics Fiat money Economy of Iceland Bank of America Volatility Subsidy Health insurance Personal finance Credit derivative Wells Fargo Cost of capital Debt levels and flows Bank fraud Eugene Fama Corporation Treasury security NASDAQ Capital asset pricing model Urinary incontinence British property bubble Institutional fund management FairTax Social Security debate (United States) Economy of Haiti Savings and loan association
