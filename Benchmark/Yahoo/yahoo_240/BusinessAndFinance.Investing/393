prnhx keep or dump i have about of my portfolio in prnhx however its not been doing that great in the last years and i have a bad feeling about it today i read some morningstar analyst updates saying it may be too bloated etc i am trying to get different opinions about people one way or the other on keeping it or taking it off this is in my k btw i am not very familiar with prnhx specifically but from what it sounds like you have already lost some not every company recovers but many do if you believe that it will come back up this is your best opportunity to buy don't believe everything that you hear my best advice is to look into the companies last annual report if the company has cash flow problems it most likely will not recover if however the company has a positive cash flow in past years it is most likely a mix of the market and investors such as yourself who want to cut their losses one easy way to find out their cash flow situation is the current ratio current assets current liabilities info for both in annual report Mutual fund Corporate finance Warren Buffett Mergers and acquisitions Bond Capital asset pricing model Rational pricing Microeconomics Modern portfolio theory Valuation (finance) Institutional fund management Arbitrage pricing theory Financial statements Collateralized debt obligation Surveillance Citigroup Derivative (finance) Asset PE ratio Enron Corporation Annuity Short selling IAS 36: Impairment of Assets Conglomerate (company) Margin (finance) Stock Debt United Kingdom corporation tax Lloyd's of London Futures contract Income trust Finance Temasek Holdings Yield curve U.S. generally accepted accounting principles Insurance Berkshire Hathaway Eugene Fama CBS Ford Motor Company Income statement Microsoft Personal finance Corporate governance Closed-end fund Life insurance Intellectual property Tax Security (finance) Privatization Financial audit Gold as an investment Mad Money Wal-Mart Bulk vending Chartered Financial Analyst Equity investment Bank fraud Arbitrage Social Security debate (United States) FairTax Corporation Economy of Russia Video game crash of 1983 Capital accumulation Dividend Conrail Poker jargon Pretty Good Privacy The South Sea Company Monopoly (game) Cash flow statement Dot-com Ponzi scheme Fractional-reserve banking Donald Trump Capitalism Craps Health care in the United States Financial markets Deflation (economics) The Standard Liability Arthur Laffer Leverage (finance) Cost of capital Economy of the United States Mortgage Sarbanes-Oxley Act Paramount Pictures Hubbert peak theory Strategic management American Broadcasting Company Money creation Mortgage-backed security Stomach cancer Real estate developer Technical analysis Accounting methods
