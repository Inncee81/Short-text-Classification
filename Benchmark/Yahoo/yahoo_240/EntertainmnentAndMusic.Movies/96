what did you think of aishwarya rai's love scene in shabd was it necessary or do you think it was done in an artistic and sensual way that it was required for the film i think it was completely wrong for the film genre we all know how pretty she is and perhaps part of her allure was her refusal to sell out in this way it's a big step over the line from no on screen kisses to simulating sex even if there is no nudity excepts a male nipple artistic and sensual sound like an apology the film has become known for those scenes rather than the main storyline of the extra marital affair and the reasons behind it a great original plot device as far as i know i hope that the rest of the cast have better luck from now on than the main male lead sanjay dutt Aishwarya Rai Soap opera Bish__jo game Hentai Nudity Censorship in Australia Madonna (entertainer) EastEnders Computer and video game genres Human sexual behavior Bollywood AVN Awards Batman Forever Motion picture rating system Anime Serial Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind David Bowie Pornography Iago Munnabhai M.B.B.S.
