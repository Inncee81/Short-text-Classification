did anyone see the bourne ultimatum if so what were your thoughts about the movie i absolutly loved it i thought it was awsome the only thing was was that i think they couldve built the girls character a little better but what do yall think they are suposed to make another movie i forget what it will be called though but this was the best movie of the year for me the final installment in the action thriller franchise is just that probably the hardest hitting of the three films it goes further to play the anti bond theme bourne doesn't like what he is doing and wants to know about his blurry past everything about this film hits it on the nail from the cinematography to choreography stunt work to the script to acting the film starts out in a flurry as bourne is running from the moscow police the story seems to pick up right where the first film left off or does it the time is a little muddled here but we get the fact that bourne is remembering things a sudden flashback while trying to clean himself up nearly gets him caught but he makes it and doesn't kill anyone they aren't his target from there we get more of the intrigue of his past with a new player noah vosen who seems to know everything about bourne and will protect it at all costs pamela landy is back as well as nicky parsons who seems to have a past with bourne as well the cinematography is in your face following tight on practically everything the car chase is even more intense if that seems possible than the ones from the first two and the veteran cast chasing bourne is superb with a nice part by albert finney it also has slight political overtones in relationship to rendition and other government policies but that is minor and integrated very well within the plot all in all this is the best of the trilogy conclusions this year if not the best action trilogy ever The Bourne Supremacy (film) James Bond Goldfinger Jason Bourne The Man with the Golden Gun Avenue Q Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Reservoir Dogs On Her Majesty's Secret Service Moonraker The Bourne Identity (film) Dr. No Sin City GoldenEye Kill Bill The Bourne Ultimatum EastEnders Die Another Day Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi Jackass: The Movie The Blues Brothers Action movie Memento (film) Friday the 13th (film series) Austin Powers John Woo Bourne, Lincolnshire Stunt True Grit Ewoks: The Battle for Endor Casino Royale (2006 film) Casablanca (film) The Matrix Reloaded Motion picture rating system Bullitt Silent Hill Film soundtrack MDA (television) Back to the Future trilogy For Your Eyes Only The Apprentice 2 The Shawshank Redemption You Only Live Twice Babylon 5 Quentin Tarantino The World Is Not Enough Back to the Future The Bourne Identity James Bond music Serial Never Say Never Again Mary Poppins Ocean's Twelve Batman Forever From Russia with Love Friends Boba Fett The Bourne Legacy Grand Theft Auto III Kevin Smith Thunderball The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (film) Sunset Boulevard (1950 film) Machinima Matt Damon Star Wars Hellraiser The Simpsons Something Positive Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Star Trek: Enterprise The Legend of Zelda series Retcon Taxi Driver Dead Like Me 24 (television) Phoebe Halliwell 11:14 Genre fiction Poker jargon The Matrix Batman Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne Tag The Invisibles The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air Ginny Weasley Die Hard Scenes from a Memory Grant Morrison The Italian Job Full Metal Panic?
