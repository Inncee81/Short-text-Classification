movies something missing these days anyone here feel like a lot of todays movies seem to have a lot missing while i have enjoyed a few of the trilogys out there a lot of film seems to miss my demographic late 's now i am open to new things but the slasher and the teen angst movies i have grown out of just wondering if you other somethings feel the same way i think one major thing happened that really hurt movies and that is the overreliance on special effects the special effects have gotten unbelievable however the story lines suffered there seems to be no original thought it is either a remake triology or some political message it is the same way with video games you can have the best graphics in the world but if the gameplay is bad it makes the game bad Horror film Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Trilogy Computer and video game genres Expanded Universe (Star Wars) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Resident Evil Crime film Double Dragon One Tree Hill (TV series) Enhanced remake Sequel Pump It Up Final Fantasy Tokusatsu The Thing Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire PlayStation 3 Guilty Gear Homestar Runner Social rule Jon Secada Mortal Kombat Machinima Notable lines in the Star Wars series Whitney Houston Time Out of Mind Super Mario 128 Ninja Gaiden Counter-Strike The Shining (film) Ultima Video game controversy The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker Paul W.
