do you know the title of this film this was one of the teen horror films from the 's or late 's i saw it on tv in the late 's possibly even early 's it was set at a high school i don't remember exactly but folks were getting killed off and only one girl was aware of what was going on it was a man with a green glove doing the killing and she thought it was the janitor the actor that was playing the janitor i actually still remember tall brunette creepy lopsided face i know that sounds odd but if you saw him you'd understand the movie ended with the girl waking from a dream and the actor that played the janitor was now the principal and vice versa and of course some other actors changes at the end of the movie the camera panned through the woods and a hand with a green glove clawed it's way up from the ground you're talking about a horror slasher film parody which predated the scary movie franchise by years the film was called student bodies and it features not only the tall creepy janitor character you spoke of but also a mysterious psycho killer affectionately named 'the breather' in the credits decked out in a rain coat and the green gloves you mentioned the killer would conduct obscene phone calls while talking through a rubber chicken all the of the killer's victims were dispatched by some of the most unusual weapons conceived including an eggplant a paper clip etc the killer would also talk to himself while stalking victims being especially vocal and increasingly frustrated about some kid who he suspects had been leaving gum all around for the killer to step in or put his hand in which he does of course every time the killer would make a kill a scoreboard point tally would flash on the screen in fact one of the kills included the death of a fly which resulted in half a point and justified the student bodies movie poster blurb which claimed deaths one of the funniest parts of the film is when one of the supposed producers of the film would break in about halfway through the movie and talk about the fact that r rated slasher movies have been most successful due to the gratuitious violence and sex in the films he went on to say that although this film did not have the excessive violence and sex that those other films had the producers of student bodies were still obligated to put out an r rated film to make the film r rated he looked directly at the camera the audience and said i would like to take this opportunity to say f y unfortunately the folks over at paramount have yet to see fit to release this film on dvd i've virtually worn out my vhs tape Horror film Scream (film) Slasher film Kill Bill Little Shop of Horrors Columbine High School massacre Film Our Gang Prank flash American Psycho Shaggy dog story Beavis and Butt-head The Inside A Nightmare on Elm Street (series) Friday the 13th (film series) Internet phenomenon Invader Zim Sin City MPAA film rating system Science fiction on television Serial killer Mystery Science Theater 3000 Pornography The Shining (film) The Blair Witch Project Theory of conduct Taxi Driver Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Motion picture rating system Jason Voorhees Meta-reference Halloween (film) Goldfinger Psycho Machinima Quentin Tarantino Napoleon Dynamite Salad Fingers Murder G-Man (Half-Life) Professional wrestling holds The Ashlee Simpson Show The Invisibles Humphrey Bogart Twin Peaks Saw (film) The X-Files (season 1) Batman The Truman Show Night of the Creeps Bowling for Columbine The Brady Bunch Resident Evil (film) Mickey Mouse Doctor Who Reservoir Dogs Filmmaking The Matrix Tokusatsu Nine Inch Nails Resident Evil Fictional crossover Friday the 13th: A New Beginning Laserdisc A Clockwork Orange (film) Leo Frank Tom and Jerry (MGM) The Exorcist III Hellraiser Inspector Gadget Dawson's Creek Queen (band) Social rule Hilary Duff Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Traditional animation Punisher Resident Evil (video game) Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Paul W.
