for people who have seen the movie the painted veil y is it called the painted veil im mean nothing in the movie tht had anything to do with a veil before it was a film it was a novel the title is meant to be a metaphor for the way the heroine viewed the world she lived behind a painted veil and thus saw the world askew when it was lifted she realized that she had depth and empathy but it also enabled her to love truly and to find real intimacy which she tragically lost so lift not the painted veil is meant to be a sort of warning but i think its one that the poet hoped wouldn't really be heeded i'm no poet so thats the best that i can expain it here's the sonnet lift not the painted veil which those who live call life though unreal shapes be pictured there and it but mimic all we would believe with colours idly spread behind lurk fear and hope twin destinies who ever weave their shadows o'er the chasm sightless and drear i knew one who had lifted it he sought for his lost heart was tender things to love but found them not alas nor was there aught the world contains the which he could approve through the unheeding many he did move a splendour among shadows a bright blot upon this gloomy scene a spirit that strove for truth and like the preacher found it not Jon Secada Simone Weil Wassily Kandinsky In Search of Lost Time Adam Mickiewicz Children of Dune Love Mulholland Drive (film) A Course In Miracles Obi-Wan Kenobi Brett Whiteley Urantia Darth Vader English literature The Deadly Assassin Sri Aurobindo Epistemology Medea (play) Philipp Melanchthon Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Storytelling Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith Friedrich Schleiermacher John Howard Yoder Bhagavad Gita Eastern Orthodox Church Karen Horney Irony Motion picture rating system Raiders of the Lost Ark Parallax Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Reality Pok__mon Abilities Charmed Grace Cossington Smith Concepts in the Wheel of Time series Fernando Pessoa Innocence: Ghost in the Shell Enneagram The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Autostereogram Cyberspace Victor Hugo Alfred Hitchcock Dante Gabriel Rossetti Dutch literature Care Bears Memento (film) The Marshall Mathers LP Religious Society of Friends The Truman Show Camouflage Dialogue The Cantos One Tree Hill (TV series) EastEnders The nature of God in Western theology Bob Woodward Out-of-body experience Casablanca (film) Buffy the Vampire Slayer Maison Ikkoku James Henry Leigh Hunt Aesthetic Realism Kill Bill I, the Jury Narcissism Eug__ne Delacroix Portuguese literature Cube (film) Philo The Chronicles of Amber Color Jean Grey Numerology Incarnations of Immortality Summa Theologiae Johann Wolfgang von Goethe Mystique (comics) Love of Life Scenes from a Memory Cupid and Psyche Paranoia Agent Jacques-B__nigne Bossuet Days of our Lives Yehuda Halevi Storm (comics) Anubis The Matrix George Eliot Philosophy of language The NeverEnding Story (film) Kender Cigarette Smoking Man Thomas Carlyle Meaning of life Poetry
