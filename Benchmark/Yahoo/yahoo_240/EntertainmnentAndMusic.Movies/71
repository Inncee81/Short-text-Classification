can a year old watch the new transformers movie my husband really wants to take our son to see the new tranformers movie and i'm not sure if he's old enough i know he's allowed what i am trying to figure out is from the people who have seen it is it appropriate for a year old he has seen the first two harry potter movies but i wouldnt let him see the third because it gets much scarier than the first two any help is appriciated thanks if you do not want him to watch prisoner of azkaban than this is probably out as well since all kids are created differently i cannot say for certain if it would be okay for him to view this film some four year old can handle a little violence and language while others will leave the theater quoting the bad words i would say as a general rule that i would wait for dvd he will be a little older it will not be in a dark room so he will be less likely to be frightened because i could see a few spots where he might get a little scared also you could take the time to point out and teach him the lessons that the film makers are trying to point out explain to him that language like that is for adults and that he doesn't have to worry every time he sees an airplane because he is scared that it will transform into a monster and get him good luck and have fun with your kid it is important that in today's society we actually spend some time with our kids your husband should be commended for wanting to spend time with his son and i think going to the movies is a great outing it stimulates conversation and it usually leads to a lifelong of movie going that they both will cherish forever Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Motion picture rating system Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Ron Weasley Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game) The Shining (film) EastEnders Blood purity (Harry Potter) Vegeta Humphrey Bogart Invader Zim Mystery Science Theater 3000 Yu-Gi-Oh!
