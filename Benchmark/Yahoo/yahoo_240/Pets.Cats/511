need help from those who have had a cat with ocd my cat has developed an obsessive compulsive disorder and over grooms causing bald spots and bloody scabs she sucks on her skin and pulls out fur she has been on anxiety tablets and these have helped a lot on top it has cleared up perfectly however underneath on her belly and sides she has started up licking and sucking and has caused havoc my question have any of you with cats that have experienced a similar problem has the cat eventually healed and the behavioural problem gone away do you think she needs stronger anxiety tablets until she is all cleared up and her fur grows back i believe her over grooming ocd began when she had a flea infection and even though the fleas are gone have been treated the behavior still remains she is half burmese and i read on the net that oriental breeds can be a bit nutty thanks so much any advice is welcome i am seeing a vet just wanted some advice from cat owners with a similar experience if you haven't already done so it's a good idea to get the vet to test for things such as diet sensitivity and allergies psychogenic or nervous dermatitis is a reaction to stress or recent illness the normal adult cat spends over a third of it's waking day grooming aside from the obvious benefits like ridding themselves of parasites and keeping the coat clean cats also find grooming therapeutic in helping to relieve tension some sensitive cats use grooming as a comforting diversionary activity when faced with some kind of challenge or perceived threat other than when she had a problem with fleas could there be any other source of stress in her life changes of any kind in the home while her wounds are healing they will itch and your cat is responding by grooming the areas and so the vicious cycle continues you may have to consider fitting her with an elizabethan collar to stop her doing this your vet is already prescribing sedatives but the original psychological cause of the problem needs to be identified and treated if she's a particularly sensitive cat you may need to build up her competence levels so that she doesn't revert back to this behaviour should she become stressed again oriental breeds are known for being highly intelligent but they are also more disposed to problems like psychogenic dermatitis and pica consumption of non food items like fabric cables and wool they require a lot of mental stimulation to stop them from becoming bored is your cat an indoor only pet if so it might be a good idea to allow her outside for short periods on a harness this will divert her attention away from grooming and will build up her confidence if you are unable to do this make sure to set aside regular time every day to play and interact with her as this should help divert her attention from grooming the web article below offers further advice on this subject http www bsava com virtualcontent derm ch pdf hope you find a solution good luck Chronic fatigue syndrome Dog Insomnia Domestic rabbit Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Guinea pig Eczema Clinical depression Coeliac disease Autism Anxiety Urinary incontinence Breastfeeding Psoriasis Clomipramine Charles Darwin's illness Baldness Milton H.
