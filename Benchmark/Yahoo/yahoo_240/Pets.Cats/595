i am i right to do this well ill start from the beginning on my birthday i wanted a cat and my dad bought me one from the local shelter that was going to get put down in five minutes so we got it her name is boots and a couple months later she ran away and after months of her runaway i come back there and bring her food and i went to go bring her food when kittens went running up the tree there are all am i wrong to give the kittens and boots food and water and i cant bring them to the pound cuz they put them down after three days they dont trust me that much but the yellow and white kitten comes up to me so am i right to do this definitely feed them they will need it when thinking about future homes you can put an ad in the classified section of your local newspaper and ask friends and family and anybody you can think of if they're interested in kittens advertise at your school if possible and put up flyers about them if you can't get all of them adopted then ask your parents if you can keep a few if they say yes keep as many as possible now if your parents say no find a no kill shelter and take the kittens there do not abandon them as they will most likely die RuneScape quests Kitten Garfield One Tree Hill (TV series) Kodocha Phoebe Buffay's songs Friends Feral cat Cat Socialization Shaggy dog story Badly Drawn Kitties John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Atomic Kitten Jon Secada Domestic rabbit Feral Sarah Kerrigan Neighbours Azumanga Daioh Knots Landing Doug Treecat Bob and George Divorce Rocko's Modern Life Rabbit Community emergency response team Animal shelter Back to the Future Wright brothers Lynx Fancy Crane Inuit Mystique (comics) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Characters of Lost Cats (musical) The Marshall Mathers LP Newspaper Advertising Iron Bowl Diwali Barry Horne Burke and Wills expedition Ferret Internet phenomenon W.I.T.C.H.
