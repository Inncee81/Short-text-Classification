my indoor cat suddenly had a bubble on her face she han't been social hiding in the basement since today she has a nasty furless slimy mess on her face i am a single mom of young kids and can't afford a vet bill for something simple does anyone know what it might be or if it is puting my kids in harms way i am not a moron i am at my neighbours house using her computer and internet trying to find helpful advice before this becomes fatal it doesn't sound like something simple or that can be treated at home so i'm afraid i'll have to recommend you take the cat to a vet my guess and it's only a guess is that the lesion on her face is from a spider bite the fact that it is a slimy mess indicates that the venom is actually dissolving her flesh it will not heal on its own as you can imagine this is very painful in fact it may fall into the realm of animal cruelty if you don't get it treated it is no danger to your kids but if it is a spider bite your kids might encounter the same spiders Spider Cat Blood (computer game) Pet skunk Fancy rat Minor Harry Potter Beasts Calvin and Hobbes Hobo spider Tarantula Ferret First aid Venom (comics) Venom (poison) The Human Stain The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Australian venomous funnel-web spider Troll Zoophilia Naruto jutsu KaBlam!
