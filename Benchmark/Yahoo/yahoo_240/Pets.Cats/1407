my newly acquired kitten is hiding under the rack where u put ur shoes shes hiding there and it appears shes sleeping i was wondering if she was sleeping there would she pee or poop in the same area i tried putting her in the litter box a couple of times and she just walks right out helop she appears to be sleeping because when i call her she doesn't respond or 'meow and should i move the cat litter and food to the kitten line of sight or leave it at the oringinal spot where the kitten knows where it is she's just scared just set some food and water nearby and the litterbox within her line of sight then all you can do is leave her alone and let her come to terms with her new home at her own pace don't worry it shouldn't take too long Cat Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Kitten Atomic Kitten Spot (Star Trek) Garfield Shaggy dog story Pet skunk Avenue Q Toilet humour RuneScape quests Hamster Through the Looking-Glass Horse gait Super Mario Bros. 3 Glossary of partner dance terms Feral cat Guinea pig Ferret The Shining (film) Humphrey Bogart Sarah Kerrigan Friends Softball The Time Machine Contredanse Greebo Singlish Tick Ralston Purina Company Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Pok__mon Abilities Asiatic Golden Cat Triathlon Eggerland series The Marshall Mathers LP Sin City Pitaten Invader Zim Hide and Q (TNG episode) Hansel und Gretel Aerial (dance move) Escape from New York Ocean's Twelve Major League Baseball television contracts Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Phoebe Buffay's songs Dog training Trapped in the Closet Placebo (band) Homer Simpson Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Gary the Snail Kurt Cobain Double entendre Characters of Naruto Manx (cat) First Battle of the Atlantic Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Black panther SpongeBob SquarePants (character) Azumanga Daioh Bon Jovi Episodes of Lost (Season 2) David H.
