my cat sometimes throws up a clutch of hard food why he is a large tabby cat and fat sometimes he will just throwup a large clutch of hard food like maybe ce every months or so also he has been throwing up his food a lot lately and we havnt switched his foods or anything why is my cat doing this that sounds exactly like what happened to my cat she is overweight too i thought maybe it had to do with hairballs but found out that was not the case if i looked at the puke it had actual pieces of her food in it it wasn't a hairy lump like a hairball a lady i knew told me that cats cat develop allergies to their food and that i should switch up her food i didn't believe her at first i had been feeding my cat purina cat chow her entire life and she'd never had any problems until now i kept feeding her the purina food and kept cleaning up more and more puke one day my cat got very sick and lethargic and threw up every hour for four hours straight finally we took her in to the vet and he told us to change her food i bought some iams food and mixed it in with her old purina food and she picked out all the old purina pieces and left the new iams ones it took a while to get her to eat the new food but once she had made the complete switch to the new food the puking stoped i suggest that you switch the food make sure you mix the new food in with the old food this makes the change easier on the cat brush your cat at least twice a week this keeps the hair from slowing down the digestion process a dog's tick and flea remover brush works well for my cat if the puking keeps up after doing and you should probably go to the vet and check your cat for worms Cat Garfield Fancy rat Ralston Purina Company Vomiting Dog Guinea pig Hamster Ferret Shaggy dog story Flea RuneScape quests Breastfeeding Nestl__ 2000 Australian Grand Prix Piccolo Junior Saga Kitten The Amber Spyglass Kakapo Pedigree pet food Phoebe Buffay's songs Brown Bear Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Stomach cancer Cat food Dog food Time Out of Mind Milton H.
