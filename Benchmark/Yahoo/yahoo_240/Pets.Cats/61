stray cat advise needed last night my friend was swimmin in the pool at our apt complex and told me to come out there cause there was a cat playin with him sooo i went the cat was adorable and she's super friendly her fur is really soft and she's constantly cleaning herself also she's not skin and bones which makes me think maybe she isnt really a stray but maybe a runaway so i took her home with me after about seconds she was very comfortable inside and hasnt tried to run out the front door or anything she lays on the couch and last night even slept in my bed the entire night what should i do with her if i plan to keep her how much does a visit to the vet usually cost and any other advise you shouldn't plan anything until you have searched for her owner she has been well cared for someone is probably missing her terribly put yourself in their place she probably lives very nearby and may belong to another tenant in your building to find the owner you should post flyers and look for lost cat flyers you can post free found ads in your local paper and on line at craigslist petfinders and other sites call your local shelters and or humane societies leave a found report with them take the cat to a local vet or aspca shelter or humane society to have it scanned for a microchip check the ears or inside the back leg for a tattoo call or leave flyers with all of the local vets often owners will post notices at the vets office or call to alert them i also recommend that you print out large clear flyers to post at all nearby intersections make sure it's easy spot and to read from a car i know it's alot of work but if the cat already has a good home it should be there with it's family as for you there are lots of beautiful cats waiting in shelters for a new home if you have the ability to provide a great home please consider a cat who needs you good luck to you both Dog Microchip implant (animal) Fancy rat Aerial (dance move) One Tree Hill (TV series) Donald Neilson Pet skunk Cat Community emergency response team The Inside Domestic rabbit Pitaten Conker's Bad Fur Day Sin City Pittsburgh Steelers Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Guinea pig Hamster Gaia Online New York Giants The Amber Spyglass Ocean's Twelve ASPCA Theory of conduct Animal euthanasia Dog training Mattress Upholstery Care Bears Avenue Q Taikyoku shogi Ferret Heinkel He 112 Strap-on dildo Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Dinosaur Natural Selection (computer game) Feral cat Miss Saigon Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Customs and etiquette of Japan Social rule The Shining (film) The Time Machine Columbine High School massacre Advertising Bart Sells His Soul Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Iditarod Shaggy dog story Richard Chase Ted Bundy First aid The Apprentice 2 Comanche Housebreaking Animal shelter Melanie Wilkes A Canticle for Leibowitz Blood (computer game) Poker jargon Minor Harry Potter Beasts Rais massacre The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland The Family from One End Street Water polo Bleeding Shen Gong Wu KROQ Top 106.7 Countdown of 1982 Carolina Panthers Killian documents Lazarus Long The Voyage of the Beagle Sento The Dalek Invasion of Earth Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an ALGOL 68 Redundant array of independent disks Animal Crossing Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Tattoo Garfield 2000 Australian Grand Prix Apt Pupil Undergarment Menstrual cup Full Metal Panic?
