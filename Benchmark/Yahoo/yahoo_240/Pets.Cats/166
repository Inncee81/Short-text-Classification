i am going away for one week i left my two cats home with food and water last year for nights this year will be nights my one older cat is blind in one eye and the younger cat is a black cat that scoots out whenever a door is opened i think it is ok to leave them with food and water for nights and several dirt boxes than to have a family friend come in twice and risk that the blind one could get out and the young one will scoot out my year old dog is being kenneled with my vet since he has conjestive heart failure and takes several pills a day my family thinks i am wrong leaving them home alone and they live too far away to care for my cats i think they are better being secured in my home and not getting out bottom line is if they get out i don't think the care taker i can get will come back and look for them if they get out and that will be worse than being alone for nights to ubi my cats get the best of care they are one reason i never go away this happens to be a family vacation and my caregiver of the past years died of a heart attack the last time i went away two years ago for a full week and that is why i did not go away for a full week last year the only two folks who i would trust with my cats are on vacation the same week i am does the question imply or nights in a row or is it simply one night at a time to times a year if it is many nights in a row you need to respect the fact that they require attention and care from you if you find you are unable or unwilling to give them proper care find someone who will provide it for them if it is just single nights a few times a year that will be no problem and they will do just fine Shaggy dog story Garfield Cat Pitaten Infantilism Public-key cryptography Abortion debate Social rule Ferret Palliative care Theory of conduct Sin City Saga (band) Animal rights Urinary incontinence Tobacco smoking Polyamory Operation Market Garden Tai shogi Billboard Hot 100 Hamster Piccolo Junior Saga Fancy rat Transsexuality Rent (musical) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Pet skunk Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Boom Town (Doctor Who) Flea Aerial (dance move) Elvis Presley Shen Gong Wu The Amber Spyglass Tocopherol Characters in the Smurfs Adoption Theodicy Rod Stewart Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Phoebe Buffay's songs Diabetes mellitus Neighbours Customs and etiquette of Japan Plame affair timeline Jon Secada Guinea pig Tooth enamel Melanie Wilkes Fathers' rights Password Minor Harry Potter Beasts Draw poker Futurama (TV series - season 5) Dean Koontz Heartworm Cindy Sheehan RuneScape quests Milton H.
