how at risk is my cat my sister owns both a diabetic and a felv cat and a few other cats the diabetic and felv are kept in seperate rooms however the diabetic has some interaction with one of her other cats the diabetic must travel with her to my house when she comes to visit is this putting my cat at risk i am not concerned about the diabetes that is just the reason the cat needs to come out with her when she visits it is the felv that concerns me diabetes is not contageous so that won't affect your cat but my bigger concern is that felv cat because it can spread it's germs to the diabetic cat she is bringing and then it can carry those germs to your cat is your cat vaccinated against felv if not then i suggest you get it vaccinated and also that you ask your sister to keep her cat she is bringing in a cage the entire time it is at your home and keep the cage away from your cat i'm talking about a run around cage like the two decker ferret kitten cages or a large dog cage that can contain a liter box and food and water if she won't bring one then i would purchase one myself and request her cat be kept in it or then she can't bring the cat you surely do not need a sick kitty yourself if the felv spreads good luck i hope her diabetic cat is vaccinated against the disease but even if it is it can still carry the germ to your cat even if it doesn't get the diesease itself check with your vet very soon on that Ferret Hamster Pet skunk Domestic rabbit Rabies Malaria Guns, Germs, and Steel Influenza pandemic Guinea pig Cat RuneScape quests Garfield Socialization Hypoglycemia Adverse effect (medicine) Tuberculosis H5N1 Colorectal cancer Leopard Coeliac disease Kitten Prostate cancer Smallpox Dog Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Cats (musical) Pneumonia Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Fancy rat Precautionary principle Poliomyelitis Milk Hyperglycemia Insulin Betting (poker) Stroke Alzheimer's disease Animal Crossing Obstetrics Louis Pasteur Crohn's disease Professional wrestling match types Bioterrorism Medicine Kakapo Singaporean measures against avian influenza Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Genetically modified food Vaccination Feral cat colony Equine conformation Ionizing radiation Microchip implant (animal) Vegetarianism 2001 UK foot and mouth crisis Felix the Cat Poker jargon Care Bears RuneScape locations Feral cat Ron Weasley Siamese (cat) Livestock Tooth enamel The Amazing Race Dialysis Badly Drawn Kitties Ernest Hemingway Island Fox Little Britain Public health Externality Luck Domestication Chagas disease Cat on a Hot Tin Roof Biological warfare Pet store Autism epidemic Glucokinase Chronic fatigue syndrome Atkins Nutritional Approach Cancer Sexually-transmitted infection Folic acid HIV vaccine Andr__s Galarraga Veterinarian Canary Thimerosal Dieting Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Sheaf (mathematics) Immortality The Catcher in the Rye Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Clozapine
