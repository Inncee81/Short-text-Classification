i just got kittens that are about weeks old their tails shake back and forth and it seems unnatural why they seem happy enough although we've only had them for two days or so but the tale vibrates and it's worrying me does anyone know why this happens hahaha this made me laugh this is completely natural it is simply a sign of excitement much like people when they jump up and down i used to have this story book that was all about cats tails and what they mean you should feel very special to excite your cats in such a way Cat Shaggy dog story B3ta Manx (cat) Cats (musical) Shake It Off Spot the Dog Rent (musical) Kitten Ferret Catgirl Dream Pointer Sisters Felix the Cat AFI 100 Years series Tokyo Mew Mew Peanuts Garfield It's All Gone Pete Tong Newcastle United F.C.
