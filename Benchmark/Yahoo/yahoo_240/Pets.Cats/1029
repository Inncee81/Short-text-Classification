i adopted two kittens together and i'm affraid that they will only find company in eachother and not me i adopted two littermates from the humane society when i got the little girl and boy home they were skittish they shrug away from our hands and hide i'm worried that having eachother to rely on will keep them from being great lap cats snugglers my companions is there any tips experience on this i've had plenty of kitties and lots of experience but never adopted two together why are people so mean pushy weird on here i dont need your criticism finger pointing or jesus wittnessing i just want some info geez thanks for good advice to the others separate them a few times a day and spend time with each individually you don't have to do this for a long time when ever you separate them it can be three minutes of petting for each once then ten minutes of play with each and five or ten minutes of petting or snuggle time later you can also play with them both at the same time but use a different toy for each since they are a bit nervous it is essential that you work on this sooner rather than later if they just glom onto each other they will have no reason to bond with you Dog Cat RuneScape quests Pet skunk Ferret Treecat Pet Tokyo Mew Mew One Tree Hill (TV series) Hello Kitty Harmonica Bat Breastfeeding Atlas Shrugged Hamster Scouting Socialization Pet Sounds Social rule Theory of conduct Alaga__sia Abortion debate Garfield Rabies Animal rights Puma One Piece minor characters Annuity Shaggy dog story Little Britain Taboo food and drink Doug Companion dog Kodocha Wright brothers Madonna (entertainer) Atomic Kitten W.I.T.C.H.
