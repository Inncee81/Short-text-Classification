about a cat my faamily found a cat outside in our backyard who was very skinny so we took her to the vet and and had her checked and stuff or whatever they do and she was fine so we kept her as a pet about to weeks she seemed to be getting a large belly and her nipples were swelling so we knew she was pregnent a while later it seemed like the day she was gonna have the kittens cuz she was hiding and stuff she was having labor pains i guess and then she just died i have no idea how this happened two days later we buried her and im wondering why the cat died and if it was possible to save the babies when the mom died many times animals have complications in labor just like people it is not always easy to tell because they can act like everythings normal when it's not if she had complications that were serious enough to kill her then usually there is not enough oxygen being delivered to the babies and they are either born dead or severely brain damaged she would have had to be at the vet's office as she died for the babies to have any chance and even then it's usually too late i am so sorry for your loss Pet skunk Ferret Breech birth Cat Rabies Jon Secada Fancy rat Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Traumatic brain injury Phoebe Buffay's songs Obstetrics Childbirth Premature birth Coma Feral cat The Marshall Mathers LP Radiation therapy Socialization Toxoplasmosis Stroke Breastfeeding Guinea pig Drowning Garfield Pregnancy Microchip implant (animal) RuneScape quests Blood (computer game) AFI 100 Years series Intact dilation and extraction Kim Possible Diabetic retinopathy First aid KaBlam!
