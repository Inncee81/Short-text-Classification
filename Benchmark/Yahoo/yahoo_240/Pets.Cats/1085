year old cat has a paw that makes cracking noise just in the last months my cat has some cracking noise coming from one of her paws or something i can hear her coming and know it's her because of the noise i have another cat too i had her at the vet and he didn't seem to have any idea he thought maybe it was her claws making a noise on the floor but that's not it since it's on carpet also it sounds like when someone cracks there knuckles what could this be does it sound like a problem it seems to be getting louder if it is arthritis what can be done about it she does limp a little but she also chases the year old cat down the hall very fast without a problem so she doesn't seem to be doing too bad i've heard that glucosamine suppliments can help with the pain i saw they had them at walmart even i wonder if that really works but then the tricky part is getting it into her she's a fighter when it comes to taking any medicine or pills or even liquid medicine she's pretty strong when she wants to be in preventing any treatment she needs maybe if i could find some liquid glucosamine for cats that actually appeals to there taste that might be good not sure if that exists though since you have already gone to the vet your are smart owner and they dont think its a problem than maybe its not im not sure why they wouldnt think anything of it the cat is getting older and when humans get older there joints crackle it could be artheritis i say take her to the vet again and ask for an x ray if they dont see anything and your cat is in no pain than leave it but if any changes occur write them down and put a tensor bandage on it then bring it into the vet Cat Guinea pig Osteoarthritis Ferret Garfield Dog Psoriasis Equine conformation Brown Bear Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Randomness Pain Sonic Adventure Shaggy dog story Maneki Neko Fancy rat Methylsulfonylmethane Neighbours Pet skunk Urinary incontinence Quotation mark Poker jargon Buddy Guy Lupus erythematosus Plastic Memorial Stadium, Clemson Veterinarian Theory of conduct Sampling (music) Motorcycle Pretty Good Privacy Gout 2000 Australian Grand Prix Girly Mathematics of general relativity Babe Ruth Sound English English Street-Legal Professional wrestling holds Chiropractic Keynesian economics Manx (cat) Traumatic brain injury Sonic X Combine (Half-Life 2) A Day in the Life Sonic boom Cat o' nine tails Hearing impairment Volleyball Tenshinhan Characters of Naruto Traditional Chinese medicine Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog Ketamine Prostate cancer Stomach cancer Rheumatoid arthritis Arthritis Gasoline Folic acid King Crimson Domestic rabbit Quarashi Fecal incontinence Gravitational radiation Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pseudoscience Shen Gong Wu Pitaten Kakapo Atari 8-bit family Sonic the Hedgehog Orthopedic surgery The Legend of Zelda series enemies Housebreaking Cheetah B-47 Stratojet Traumatic incident reduction Rabies Nine Inch Nails Dog training Hypnosis The Fairly OddParents Ranma __ characters The Inside Theodicy Abortion debate I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Syphilis Breastfeeding Diabetes mellitus Sense Alternative medicine Alaga__sia Engine cooling Mickey Mouse Onomatopoeia
