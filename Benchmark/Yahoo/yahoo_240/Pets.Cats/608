how long before the fleas are gone a few ok i have three inside cats they have never been outside which makes me wonder how the heck they got fleas but anyway i used the cat flea drops on the back of thier necks i put flea collars on them i got flea killing carpet stuff that i used and i sprayed flea killing spray on all of my furniture and everything that i couldn't wash i did all of this earlier today so how long does it take before all of the fleas are dead i have not seen any fleas on anything accept the cats since i did all of this can the fleas still live on my cats even with the drops and flea collars since they are on the neck and no where else how does the drops kill all of the fleas on the cats whole body the drops were from hertz trade it said it was to kill fleas eggs and ticks holy crap brianna scare somebody sorry so many details the drops said they were to kill and prevent i don't have any pets that go outside is it possible that we the pet owners brought them in i have had one of the cats for years and i have always kept a flea collar on her she is still alive and never had fleas until here recently but i have not had a flea collar on her for the past month or so so sorry i'm not going to rule out the flea collar also i read the back of the box forthe drops it said it is only a hazard while it is wet it said once it is dry it is okay for the cats to groom and bathe eachother you guys are scaring the crap outta me what the frontline does is puts a chemical that seeps into their skin and the fleas hop off they hate it we buy bengal to spray everything else and then vacuum its a good idea to change your vacuum bag afterwards outside the frontline takes a day or two to really get in and start working a vet also told us it was better to use every weeks instead of once a month Flea Cat Dog training Hamster Bedbug Dog Doctor Who (Enemy Within) Pet skunk Red Hot Chili Peppers Richard Chase Phoebe Buffay's songs The Inside Craps Swingout Donald Rumsfeld Keeshond Diseases of the honeybee Mattress Toilet humour Dog collar Microchip implant (animal) One Piece minor characters Canary Jute Fancy rat Kakapo Professional wrestling match types RuneScape quests Heartworm Alaga__sia Tobacco Minor Harry Potter Beasts Ferret The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Collar Milton H.
