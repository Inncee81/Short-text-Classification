my kitten has no whiskers i have very active weeks old kittens i got them when they were weeks old and they were very sick diahreea vomiting etc for the first few weeks i had them it took about weeks and several medicines later for them to stat feeling better last thursday i came home from being away for a few days for work and noticed that my one kitten the smaller of the two had almost no whiskers the other kitten the bigger one has all of her whiskers i notice as the whiskers start growing out that the ends are bending and then breaking off the two kittens play very rough and i wasn't sure if i should be worried about the missing whiskers sick again or if it could be a result of their roughhousing thanks for taking the time to read this your kitten could have a rex gene it could be diet rough play or even health related there are a lot of posibilities that a vet could eliminate for you with a simple checkup a rex gene can give the kitten kinky wavy fur and kinked whiskers that are often very brittle Cat Manx (cat) Ferret Kitten Prostate cancer Atomic Kitten Garfield Breastfeeding Pet skunk Fancy rat Socialization Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Domestic rabbit Cat coat genetics Tyrannosaurus rex T.
