kitten's eyes are puffy and red and her inner eyelid is half closed does anyone have any idea what is wrong i'm giving her polysporin eye drops right now to see if that helps is there anything else i could give her she did have an eye infection when i brought her home and the eye drops cleared it up that was a few weeks ago i was hoping it would help again but i'll definitely take her to the vet tomorrow if it still looks bad thanks for the advice everyone i took her to the vet today and it wasn't an eye infection at all she has a fever so i was given some medicaion to take care of it i would recommend taking her to the vet so that they can take a close look with a scope to make sure she doesn't have an injury to her eyeball or cornea she may have something stuck in her eye the redness and puffiness is probably caused by her pawing at her eyes because they are causing her pain or distress she may have an infection that needs treated with a prescription eye drop or gel made especially for cats you could apply a clean cold compress to her eyes for as long as she will allow without stressing her out too much the cold would help to alleviate the swelling so call your vet asap to get her checked out if this isn't treated properly she could lose her sight Eye Common cold Guinea pig Conjunctivitis Psoriasis First aid Cat Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pet skunk Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Traumatic brain injury Fancy rat Herpes simplex virus Childbirth Garfield Contact lens Chronic fatigue syndrome Urinary incontinence Medical prescription Chalazion Acne Diving Intraocular lens Cancer Poker jargon Asthma AIDS Gonorrhoea Ferret OpenBSD Domestic rabbit Abortion Chlorpromazine Dialysis Snake Malaria Breastfeeding Dog Sickle-cell disease Pneumonia Group A streptococcal infection Sin City Bates Method Diseases of the honeybee Theory of conduct Hay fever Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Rosacea Cornea HIV test Extreme Programming Fecal incontinence Diabetic retinopathy Gun safety Rabies Vulcan (Star Trek) Stomach cancer Babe Ruth Infectious mononucleosis Tuberculosis Aloe Social rule Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Wound Cornea transplant Prostate cancer High-heeled shoe Coma Equine conformation Carpal tunnel syndrome Leptospirosis Mouth ulcer Obstetrics Pitaten Professional wrestling holds Al-Razi Tears Randomness Hip fracture 2000 Australian Grand Prix Computer virus Dog training Gout Glaucoma The Marshall Mathers LP Syphilis Diabetes mellitus Escherichia coli O157:H7 Repetitive strain injury Time Out of Mind Acute respiratory distress syndrome Cellulitis Multiple sclerosis The Contender (television series) LASIK Penis Otitis externa
