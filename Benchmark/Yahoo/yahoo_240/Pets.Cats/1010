inside cats and outside cats in usa i read lots of questions about 'inside' and 'outside' cats and i have to assume all these are asked by americans because i've never heard of an 'inside' cat as in one that isn't allowed out in the uk unless it was seriously ill everybody's cat here goes in and out of the house as it likes except for a few outside farm cats can somebody explain why so many americans feel they need to keep their cat in the house all its life please fortunately in the uk rabies is non existent and there are no natural predators of cats so it has always been considered relatively safe to allow cats outside provided they are vaccinated and spayed neutered it's estimated that of cats have regular access to go outside if they want to this practice is widely advocated by vets and animal welfare shelters alike in fact many animal welfare organisations won't allow you to adopt a cat unless it has access to a garden many cats have a litter tray even though they are allowed outside because it saves on confrontations with neighbours and cats are often kept indoors over night as that is when they are most at risk from cars in north america the situation is reversed quirkyblonde has given you a good explanation of the many hazards that cats in areas of north america face in those locations it isn't in a cat's best interest to let them outdoors some animal shelters also have a policy of of not allowing people to adopt cats unless they guarantee to keep them indoors many owners put a lot of effort into providing their cat with a physically and mentally stimulating indoor environment to compensate for not being allowed outside however certain aspects of a cat's natural behaviour such as scratching often leads to them being declawed by less enlightened owners it's already illegal to do this in many countries i just i wish that it were illegal everywhere in america it is claimed that indoor cats live twice as long as outdoor cats although no one has yet produced enough statistical evidence to support this claim beyond doubt neutered cats live longer and house pets are more likely to be neutered than feral cats but this longevity difference is due to neutering not to indoor living there are literally millions of cat owners in the uk who can testify to having cats who lived well into their mid teens or early twenties even feral cats have been recorded as old as so it would appear that the uk outdoor environment is definitely a much safer one for cats than it is in america one factor influencing the indoor outdoor statistics is the number of moggies and pedigree cats in the uk it is thought that only of pet cats are pedigree cats a figure which appears to correspond to the number of indoor cats far more american pet cats are pedigreed which contributes to the indoor only philosophy sarah hartwell has written several articles on the indoor outdoor cat debate and the cultural differences between the uk and america for keeping cats they make interesting reading http www messybeast com indooroutdoor htm http www messybeast com catsusuk htm Feral cat Pet skunk Dog Ferret Organic farming Socialization Guinea pig Capitalism Manx (cat) Livestock Extreme Programming Insurance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Animal rights Housebreaking Tobacco smoking Fox hunting Fancy rat Fathers' rights Autism Domestication Democracy Conservatism Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Psychology Economics Zoophilia Nudism Theory of conduct Sigmund Freud Kitten Unemployment Peter Singer Abortion debate Whaling Intelligence quotient Animal shelter Life insurance Sociocultural evolution Altruism Intelligent design movement Garfield Infantilism Agriculture Rabies Ethics Microchip implant (animal) Colonial mentality Psychiatric hospital Divorce Sexual orientation Pitaten Meme Economic inequality Bulgarian language Swimming pool Religion DDT Baseball Light-emitting diode Domestic violence Intelligent design Determinism Health insurance Nuclear power Animal euthanasia Liberalism Homeopathy Creation-evolution controversy Constitution of Ireland Science Happiness Objectivist philosophy Crime prevention through environmental design Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Wealth Scientology beliefs and practices Luck Microeconomics Cognitive science Human nature Gun politics in the United States Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Social justice
