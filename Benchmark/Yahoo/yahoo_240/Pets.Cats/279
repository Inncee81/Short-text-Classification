i live in a house with cats and dogs they are all indoor pets and do their business inside i am constantly cleaning up after them i want to know can i ever have a couch we have a bench we put cushions on but if you leave the room one of the animals gets to them in one way or another do they make anytype of material that would be easy to clean if it was soiled and that is also chew claw resistant thank you all for responding i am going to look into ecah of your answers greatly appreciate it the problem with outside is that the one dog keeps hopping the fence and running away he keeps finding new ways to run away i know the problem with the cats is that there are way to many but i can't seem to convince the housemates of this fact wow with cats that a tuffy petco has an item that you can put on the corners of couches and chairs to help with the clawing it is clear material with a sticky back i've had cats for over years and i've found that the best material for a couch or other furniture is like a crushed velvet or something like that it's hard for the cats to claw for chewing you could use apple bitter spray it on the areas that get chewed i also just read something about vinegar you can spray white vinegar on areas where cats scratch or get on they don't like the smell i imagine that would work for chewing as well also you can use white vinegar after you've cleaned up any accidents that your pets have had the smell of the vinegar is supposed to keep the pets from re visiting the area i hope this helps Fancy rat Hamster Pet skunk Cat Dog training Plastic Ferret Domestic rabbit Skunk Strap-on dildo Garfield RuneScape quests Dog Upholstery Tooth 2000 Australian Grand Prix Tooth enamel World War Three (Doctor Who) The Fairly OddParents Ren and Stimpy Taoism Tobacco smoking Chinchilla Billiards Shaggy dog story Catscratch Bulk vending Guinea pig Housebreaking Couch The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Red Dwarf characters Sin City Kakapo Weed control Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Pet Sematary Happy Tree Friends Social rule Cuisine of Denmark Acetic acid Big Brother UK series 6 Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Woodworking Dr. Seuss Brown Bear KaBlam!
