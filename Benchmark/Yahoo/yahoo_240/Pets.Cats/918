what's the right choice i work at the humane society as a volunteer and recently they've begun a crackdown on ill cats it's one of my jobs to report any possible symptoms of disease well there was a cage of kittens and two were sneezing what's the right choice i had two choices not report the sneezing and risk all three of their lives or possibly save all three or to report the sneezing and get the two kittens killed but definetly save the third what's the right choice why also i have two cats of my own at home and i don't want them to get sick so fostering was completely out of the question follow the rules harsh as they seem the rules are there for a reason upper respiratory infections spread like wildfire and an entire shelter can become infected if that happens every cat there will have to be euthanized the building will have to be thoroughly cleaned and no more cats can be taken in for a quarantine period usually two weeks i know your heart goes out to the little sick kittens a feline uri can be treated though it's not cheap and the treatment goes on for a while personally i would find the responsibility for reporting disease symptoms too heavy for me and i would resign and volunteer elsewhere deciding what symptom is significant and which are not is a job for a person trained in vet medicine not a volunteer and i wouldn't want to think an animal's future was depending on my opinion Common cold Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Rabies Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Group A streptococcal infection Pneumonia Feral cat Cat H5N1 Tuberculosis Domestic rabbit Heartworm Prostate cancer Stomach cancer Transmission (medicine) Sexually-transmitted infection Ferret Pet skunk Hepatitis C Disease Fancy rat Guinea pig Malaria Quarantine Medicine Influenza Ebola Spanish flu Socialization Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Sleeping sickness Avian influenza Ulcerative colitis Lung cancer Kitten Upper respiratory tract infection Anthrax Tobacco smoking Toxoplasmosis Multiple sclerosis Cancer Coeliac disease Bubonic plague Alcoholism Rocky Mountain spotted fever Chronic fatigue syndrome Asthma Animal shelter Abortion Traumatic brain injury Psoriasis Health insurance Legionellosis Chagas disease Decompression sickness Infectious mononucleosis HIV vaccine First aid Virus Colorectal cancer Escherichia coli O157:H7 Urinary incontinence Bipolar disorder Cytomegalovirus Feral Hypertension Hyperthyroidism Palliative care Stroke Smallpox Progress of the SARS outbreak Clinical depression Poliomyelitis Leukemia Diarrhea Vaccine Theory of conduct Diabetes mellitus Breast cancer West Nile virus Aspartame Obsessive-compulsive disorder Animal euthanasia Biological warfare Addiction Natural health Lupus erythematosus Foodborne illness American Red Cross Influenza pandemic Omega-3 fatty acid Euthanasia
