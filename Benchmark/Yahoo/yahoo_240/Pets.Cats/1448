my cat got lose last night he's an indoor cat he is neutered he's years old with no front claws i think when my father was talking to someone he managed to slip out without my dad seeing him we've checked the house so many times last night and we tried to look outside for him i put some put out on the steps and someone said if you put a peice of clothing you've worn they can smell you and come is he going to come back will he find his way home the food is untouched i've stayed up the whole night checking and checking he's my baby he can't survive outside i can relate to how you're feeling because when i lived with my parents my father left the door slightly open and my indoor declawed by previous owner cat got outside at night i was frantic finally after calling her name and looking all over for over an hour i suddenly saw my cat walking from the next door neighbor's house to our house my cat was so laid back about it like what is all the fuss about then my father made the same mistake again and my cat got out but she stayed close to the house anyway it's a good idea to keep going outside to call his name and to walk around the neighborhood to look for him keep looking for him and call his name loud enough so he can recognize your voice ask the neighbors if they've seen him call all the vets and shelters in your area put up lost posters at your vets and shelters you can place a lost ad in your local paper i know how you must be feeling because even though my cat went missing for about an hour it felt like an eternity it's possible that your cat is exploring or that someone thought he was a stray cat and either took him to a vet shelter or has him in their home for the time being cats have a way of finding their way home they are very smart i pray that your cat turns up on your doorstep very soon Cat The Shining (film) Pet skunk Rais massacre Housebreaking One Tree Hill (TV series) New York Giants Dog training The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Garfield The Amber Spyglass Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Good Times Social rule Rent (musical) The Dalek Invasion of Earth Japanese tea ceremony Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Friends Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Avenue Q The Inside Domestic rabbit Kakapo Aerial (dance move) The Empty Child What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?
