should my male kitten still be bleeding after neutering i have a male kitten about months old that i just had neutered at the humane society about hours ago when they returned him to me i noticed small blotches of blood in his carrier which i assumed was normal after getting him home i noticed that he was dripping blood from his scrotum it seems to have slowed a bit now but i'm concerned my sister had her male cat done last year and said it's fairly normal for a bit of blood to drip out for the first several hours after the operation and that it should eventually stop should i be concerned call a local vet and ask your question they'll answer better than anyone here can and questions are free i'm sure it's probably nothing to worry about but better safe than sorry i can't believe they sent him home immediately after a neutering operation most vets keep the animal hours after a neutering Ferret Castration Kitten Cat Pet skunk Feral cat Socialization Dog Penis Androgen insensitivity syndrome Guinea pig Domestic rabbit Puma Manx (cat) Shock Intravenous therapy Gender Polish language First aid Childbirth Grammatical gender Stroke Paracetamol Rabies Menstrual cycle Animal shelter Gender-neutral language Cheetah Housebreaking Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Puberty Stomach cancer Peanuts Ancient Greek Dialysis Intersex surgery Caffeine Bulgarian language Shark Breastfeeding Lesch-Nyhan syndrome BloodRayne Spanish pronouns Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Emergency Medical Services The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Testosterone Gender identity Bleeding Prostate cancer Malaria Tocopherol Blood Fancy rat Cancer Gender role Spider Melanie Wilkes Negima USS Waters (DD-115) Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Modem Blood Simple USS Yorktown (CV-10) Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Blood pressure Tyrannosaurus rex Veterinarian Blood transfusion Traffic light Blood (computer game) Sleep Glycogen storage disease type I Tick Garfield Tourniquet Spanish nouns Hypoglycemia Piccolo Junior Saga Feral Lion Peter Singer Mosquito German grammar USS Thomaston Male reproductive system (human) USS Turner Joy (DD-951) Animal euthanasia Giraffe CPU cache Chromosome B3ta Diabetic retinopathy Rail terminology Gravity Testicle African American Vernacular English Proto-Germanic language
