any ideas on possible kinds of worms on a stray kitten hi my wife and i found abandoned kittens near our house after church today one seems alright but the other has some form of worm around its' butt i don't know if they are tape worms or maybe maggots but there are a lot of them they are tiny about the size of an eyelash i have given the kitten a bath and my wife has been trying to remove the worms the kitten's butt appears to be swollen as it is protruding kind of like a hemroid as near as we can tell the worms have made a hole in the protrusion we have tried some peroxide to get them out but i'm curious to know if anyone might have a better idea of exactly what these worms are and how if we can do something we haven't thought of yet i will be taking the cat to the vet first thing monday but until then we want to do what we can to help thanks for right now just wait until the vet appointment tomorrow be sure to bring a small fresh stool sample with you this way they can check to see what parasites your kittens have it sounds like tapeworms but they can have other things too like roundworms or coccidia nothing else is going to work on them so you might as well stop using the peroxide be sure to wash your hands immediately after handling the kittens as some parasites like rounds can be transmitted to people Pet skunk Garfield Animal Conspiracy (TNG episode) Phoebe Buffay's songs Kitten Computer virus Ferret Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Intestinal parasite Heartworm Fecal incontinence Sampling (music) Roundworm Dracunculiasis Violin Floppy disk Foodborne illness Cestoda The Amber Spyglass Toilet humour Trichinosis Body piercing Shaggy dog story Schistosomiasis Diarrhea Baylisascaris Cysticercosis Drill bit Sento Socialization Fancy rat Hydrogen peroxide M16 (rifle) Enterprise content management Dairy Stopping e-mail abuse Tick The Inside Toxoplasmosis Goatse.cx Randomness Organic peroxide Philip J.
