why is my cat pooping everywhere and how can i stop it i've had my cat for a year but recently she started pooping all over the house couch my bed kitchen chairs my bedroom floor sometimes right in front of me at first she was still peeing and pooping a bit in her litre box but now not at all i am getting very frustrated of coming home to poop everywhere i don't know what to do and i don't know why she's doing this nothing in her life has changed so far as i know her litre is the same her litre box and location are the same her diet is the same the amount of time i am home spend with her is the same she is the only cat in the house the only thing that has changed is that a couple months ago i started letting her go outside and she's been fighting with the neighbouring cats i live in a basement suite and the room she stays in is small so i feel guilty not letting her go outside i've had her on a leash and usually go outside with her when i can but lately i've let her go on her own more since she's used to it she is spayed and she recently had all of her shots first i would take her to the vet to rule out any medical problem she could be experiencing have you had her spayed if it is a behavioral problem it really could be brought on by the fact that she has been going outside she may now feel the need to mark her territory and unfortunately once they mark a spot it is so hard to get all of the odor out they will tend to go back to the same places no matter how much you clean check out the website the first guy gave you i bet it will have the name of a good cleaner i can't think of it right off the top of my head good luck Cat Pet skunk Poker jargon Kitchen Guinea pig Dog training The Brady Bunch Domestic rabbit Hamster 2000 Australian Grand Prix Ferret Sailing Milton H.
