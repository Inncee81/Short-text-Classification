really need help with this situation and my stupid son and what you would do ok this is the stuation my son moved in with his girlfriend she had cats i say had because i took them they like to smoke pot my son thought it would be funny to get them high so he would blow the smoke in their face this went on for about six months before i found out i don't smoke the stuff i hate that he does but he is an adult but i got really pissed at him for blowing in the cats face told him that if he didn't let me take the cats i was going to call the police on him for animal cruelty abuse he gave me the cats they are both in a good home now i told him never to get another animal again til he grows up stops acting like an idiot here is the thing i do love my son but it still bothers me that he could do such a horrilbe thing to those poor cats part of me still wants to call the police but since he did give me the cats when i told him to then maybe i should let it go this time what should i do if it was anybody else i would have turned them in help to goldwing i am glad i am not your mother too but it is wrong for him to do that to the cats i do love my son very much and would do anything for him it is more about the principal of animal abuse would you still the same way if he was blowing the smoke in a child's face i was just asking for advice not your criticism or name calling but then you are so defensine because you are a pot smoking blow it in the cats face type person thank you everyone else for your help i do feel a little better but it still bothers me that my son could do something so stupid they do have their own place they could live with me but not when they smoke pot bottom line is the law is the law thanks again for all your help my son is years old and if i had to pick between saving him or the cat of course it would be my son but that is not the case he needs to know that every wrong action receives punishment since most of you said let it go and because he did give me the cats and they are doing good now i will let it go this time i just want him to be a good and loving person as far as his pot smoking he doesn't live with me so what can i do nothing or am i wrong about that i am sure you do love your son but you are right this is animal abuse and could turn into more serious problems but since you did tell him to give you the cats and he did i would let this one go but if he does do something else to an animal that is abusive behavior i would report him animals are defenseless to humans and we need to stand up for them to the first person who answered just ignore him he seems like a jerk i don't think you are a witch good luck with your son and good for you for getting those cats out of his care Theory of conduct Social rule Pitaten Good Times Kodocha Domestic violence Poker jargon Friends EastEnders Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Garfield Ren and Stimpy Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Ranma __ characters Humphrey Bogart Shit Laura Schlessinger Jam (TV series) The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Sin City Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Nicomachean Ethics Dilbert The Critic The Amber Spyglass Great Teacher Onizuka Russian joke Animal Liberation Front About a Boy Anne Rice W.I.T.C.H.
