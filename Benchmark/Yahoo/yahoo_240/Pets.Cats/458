cat goes back to pooping on the floor i trained him to go in the litter a while ago but he just started doing it again he isn't too bright i don't know why and everything the internet tells you is wrong so don't copy and paste stuff off the internet just so you know i don't read that stuff and anything that is like paragraphs long please help cats stop using their boxes because something is wrong it could be something as simple as he's picky about how clean or in some cases unclean his box is or the kind of litter you use cats are highly sensitive to smell and touch so if the box is stinky obviously he's not going to want to use it or if the litter is a weird texture or too sandy or too dusty or one of a million other things he could just be going to what he knows and likes beyond those reasons it can be medical usually you'd be dealing with urinating on the floor which in my opinion is much worse or in strange places so if you're noticing anything different increased water intake less intake of dry food diarrhea straining to go multiple trips to the bathroom or anything else out of the ordinary get him to the vet i know how you're feeling in this case because i've had to compromise with one of my cats who just doesn't like the box at all she'll only use it when she absolutely has to and let her use my bath tub it sounds gross but is easy clean up so i figure it's better than cleaning urine out of my carpets obviously that may not work for you so i can suggest toilet training your kitty which can take time but would be pretty cool i think this is the best link i've found with info on toilet training http www karawynn net mishacat toilet html most importantly i know how frustrated you must be with your kitty but give him some time and patience and you should be able to find common ground with him Hamster Cat Fecal incontinence Toilet Urinary incontinence Guinea pig Shaggy dog story Fancy rat Toilet paper Toilet humour Pet skunk Sin City Milton H.
