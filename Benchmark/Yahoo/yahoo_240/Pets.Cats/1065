are there treatments for cats being depressed i am moving next monday to school and can't take my cats with me i have two but i am more worried about the younger one aspen both are rescues and my older one is more tough and she's a diva so she won't miss me but aspen follows me everywhere loves being petted played with sleeps all over me all the time and runs between my legs trying to trip me because it's a game for her lol they are staying here with my dad so no change in environment except that i won't be there they love my dad but aspen doesn't have the same bond with him that she does with me with her nature and people personality i really think she's going to get depressed i'll come back to visit often but it's the not same what can my dad to help her that's not even remotely close to what i asked jr i really love when people are arrogant enough to think that cats don't think or feel emotions beyond their immediate needs it is impossible to say exactly what emotions cats feel but when a close companion goes missing they are certainly aware of the absence and may search for that person or cat it is unlikely that they mourn in the human sense of the word but there will be some behavioural changes as they adjust to the gap in their lives as the cats will be staying on familiar territory with your dad whom they already know and love this will help them feel reassured any items of yours that are still in the home will have your scent which they may also find comforting cats are creatures of habit so ask your dad if he can try not to change the daily household routine too much as this will cause them additional stress in your absence your dad will become the primary caregiver and this will strengthen the existing bond between him and your cats hopefully both cats will be fine especially as you plan to visit often the web article when cats grieve contains information that you may find helpful http www messybeast com cat grief htm Cat Grief Dog Transsexuality One Tree Hill (TV series) EastEnders Miss Saigon Friends The Amber Spyglass Ranma __ characters W.I.T.C.H.
