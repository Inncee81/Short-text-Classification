my cat has just had kittens minutes ago help she gave birth minutes to good looking kittens this ismy first experience to my cat having kittens she has cleaned then up nicly and the of them are snuggling together in a box that i have set up for them how long will it be before they start feeding and how can i check if the mom has milk to be honest i don't think she does so how to check and if she doesn't what can i do she doesn't seem to have teats just tiny nipples congratulations i so wish i had little kittens to care for right now most likely mama cat does have milk the last cat i was fostering had very tiny nipples when she gave birth but was also producing milk her nipples got bigger later on the kittens should suckle every two hours or so you can check and see if any milk is coming out when the kittens are suckling the area around the nipples should be puffy however if you're not sure you can ask a vet i've never milked a cat before to check i've raised many new litters of kittens and i'll tell you all the advice i know do not handle the kittens at first if you want to pet them or hold them do so but only for a few minutes and then let them be with their mother each week of their live increase your time with them at week hold them for minutes at two weeks hold them for minutes at three weeks hold them for minutes etc soon they'll be playing with you and you can spend all the time you want with them it is very important that you do handle the kittens some so they will become socialized to people the fact that you are handling them now will mean they are most likely going to be sweet lap cats however again do not handle them too much at first they need to be with their mom for the most part and learn how to be a cat and what the rules are for their species the kittens should be ready to begin weaning to solids around weeks but they will still continue to suckle during that time do not pressure them as each cat has its own time when it is ready to eat solid food do not force feed them solid food most likely your kittens will play with the food and roll around in it before they ever eat it however they're becoming exposed to it use a mushy wet kitten food at first instead of crunchy food they will see mama eating it and understand that they are to eat it too with my last batch i had kittens kitten ate right away another kitten ate a week later the last kitten the runt didn't eat solids until two weeks after his brothers began eating it however if the kitten isn't eating solids around weeks you may have an issue there also get a small shallow pan and put a very small amount of water in there again mama will drink the water and the kittens will observe also again they'll end up rolling in the water which is hysterical to watch i hope you don't need sleep if the kittens and mama stay in your room with you you'll be awake for the next few months it's worth it though kitten proof your house as they get into everything do not give cats cow's milk it gives them diarrhea my advice is to never give away animals in the newspaper i don't know if you're keeping these kittens or already have homes lined up for them contact a local cat rescue when they are ready to go i recommend weeks not weeks if you need help finding a local cat rescue in your area you may send me an email and i will be more than happy to help you cat rescues will give the kittens to fosters where instead of your kitten being in a cage at the shelter waiting for adoption the kitten will live in a house with someone who is qualified to give them all the care that they will ever need the kitten will get to run around a house and cuddle up on the couch while it is waiting for adoption plus the kittens will have their shots and be spayed neutered before they ever go to their new homes it's a great first start in life for kittens don't give them away for free in a paper there are some sick people out there who will do anything to a free cat it's sad but true get mama a very good brand of kitten food to eat instead of her adult cat food she'll pass on those nutrients in her milk to the kittens go to wal mart and get some toys for later kittens are just too cute again i've delivered so many kittens in my life and raised them email me if you need help Domestic rabbit Hamster Dog Ferret Dairy Feral cat RuneScape quests Garfield
