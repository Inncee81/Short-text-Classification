does anyone have cats that are allergic to red dye do your cats vomit up their foods shortly after eating my cats do like friskies feline favorites dry food but each time i have returned to this food my cats i have throw it up i have had to pick through all of the food to pick out the red dye pieces i usually buy natural cat foods in order to prevent this task but occasionally i will feed it to them without sifting and sorting out the red pieces i am always sorry that i do this as my cats promply become sick gagging until they throw it up i have spoken to other cat owners who stand in the cat food isle and are trying t buy cat food that is of good quality which does not have a recall on it and yes i am not the only one who is looking for cat food without red dye i think the food once sorted and sifted of red dye pieces looks just as good if not better than with the red dye pieces i cannot buy the friskies seafood flavor dry food because it has more red dye pieces in it it is usually the one that is on sale i am wondering decreased sales you are definitely not the only one looking for cat food without red dye in it so do i i have cats but only one that can't tolerate red dye in her food she starts making a 'choking coughing' sound when she eats it i had also removed the red pieces from her food and she was fine so i know it is the cause cats just like people have different nutritional needs i get sick if i eat 'red' candy but am fine with the other colors talk to you vet or other experts in your area to find the right food for your 'babies' that is in your price range maybe if we let the companies know that enough of us care they will take the 'dye' and other unnecessary ingredients from our kittie's supper best health to them all Fancy rat Cat Food Chocolate Guinea pig Taboo food and drink Healthy eating Bulk vending Egg (food) Potato Peanut Sushi Garfield Nestl__ Hemp Organic food Tofu Coeliac disease Hamster Genetically modified food RuneScape quests Wine Ramen Vegetarianism Breastfeeding Upholstery Japanese cuisine Kashrut Technicolor Dim sum Tooth enamel Cuisine of Denmark Tom and Jerry (MGM) Fecal incontinence Vomiting Urinary incontinence Tomato Apple Snack food Cuttlefish Chinese food therapy Yohoho!
