help with sick cat okay i have a cat that is primarily an outside cat he still comes in sometimes well last week when he came inside we noticed he looked a little thinner he ended up doing nothing but laying in practically the same spot for whole days only getting up to use the cat box and to eat he still pretty much just lays and sleeps all day but he's gone back outside voluntarily a few times and goes throughout the house sometimes now too his belly still seems fairly plump and not skinny but if you run your hand along his back you can totally feel all his back bones and everything any idea what would cause anything like this thanks it sounds like he needs to be wormed with his tummy feeling plump but his frame being skinny it's a good sign that he's eating and using the litter box it's not an infection look around his backside and see if you see white pieces around the anus about the size of a grain of rice you may even see them move you can also check the litter box for stool sample and see if you see the same thing there easiest thing to do it to take a stool sample to the vet and they can confirm if he has worms or not and if so will give you meds to eliminate them the tapeworms are from fleas either what he's picked up roaming outdoors or from rats mice birds that he has caught hope this helps Cat Hamster Fancy rat Pet skunk Guinea pig Animal House Mouse Dog Diarrhea Care Bears Garfield Hedgehog Aerial (dance move) Ferret Kakapo Breastfeeding Coeliac disease 2000 Australian Grand Prix Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Toxoplasmosis Skinny Puppy Poker jargon Equine conformation Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Chicken Knife Snake Mattress Spidey Super Stories Chopsticks Obesity Mickey Mouse Sin City Tlingit Who Framed Roger Rabbit Skinny Dip Ron Weasley Colorectal cancer Sleeping sickness Coprophagia Ascariasis Wood One Piece minor characters Red Fox Skunk Urinary incontinence The Secret of NIMH Origins of baseball Felis sapiens Trichinosis Cliff Richard Vampire Opportunity rover Red Squirrel Housebreaking Diphyllobothriasis Taikyoku shogi Brown Rat 1957 World Series Mnemonic Stomach cancer Sampling (music) Tick Kashrut Tai shogi Bat RuneScape quests Tasmanian Devil House music Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Prostate cancer DDT Taboo food and drink Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Time Out of Mind Leopard Ren and Stimpy Textile manufacturing Dai dai shogi Domestic rabbit First aid Ocean's Twelve Oral sex Chronic fatigue syndrome Medical prescription The Cat in the Hat Blink-182 Cestoda Creatures in Bionicle Violin Piccolo Junior Saga Maka dai dai shogi Malaria EastEnders Cleveland Browns
