frontline for cats i have indoor cats i have one dog who is obviously in and out all day i usually buy advantage for the pets because it's inevitable that at least once a year we get fleas this year i've noticed that i can save some money by buying frontline but there aren't any weight classes for cats on petmeds com that seems really weird to me but can i just give the same dose to my lb cat as i would to my lb kitten i actually suggest a different formula it's called revolution and it's new to the market i've been using it for a year now and it's wonderful it keeps fleas off no matter what time of the year it is it also protects against heartworms ear mites and round worms it is dollars on drsfosterandsmith com for doses and as long as your kitten is older than weeks you use the same doses hope that helps Heartworm Flea Cat Dog Guinea pig Fancy rat Manx (cat) Socialization Pet skunk Kitten Ferret Domestic rabbit Feral cat RuneScape quests Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Garfield Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Puma Paracetamol Tiny Toon Adventures COX-2 inhibitor Common cold Xiaolin Showdown Doug Wal-Mart Pet Diazepam Spidey Super Stories Asthma Vivian Stanshall Ascariasis Gross domestic product Doraemon Code: Lyoko Treecat Mange Daddy Wouldn't Buy Me a Bow Wow Cats (musical) Dean Koontz Capital accumulation CatDog Ralston Purina Company Radiation therapy Japanese Bobtail (cat) Keeshond Asian financial crisis Rabbit Pet store Catgirl Allergy Capitalism Wheel of Fortune Annuity Tokyo Mew Mew Canary Azumanga Daioh The Wonderful Wizard of Oz Lie Rabies Insulin Potassium bromide Livestock Chicken Antipsychotic Chinese astrology Supply-side economics Deflation (economics) Siamese (cat) Cornish Rex Ginny Weasley StarCraft: Hybrid Donald Rumsfeld Dobermann Hamster Dog training Hello Kitty Clinical depression Turkish Angora Breastfeeding Money supply Computed tomography BattleTech technology Trade Diseases of the honeybee Serval Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Characters of The Sandman A Star is Torn Oliver and Company Money Carnivore Ionizing radiation Housebreaking Marc Antony and Pussyfoot Tick United States dollar Internet phenomenon Regent (insecticide) Balinese (cat) Illegal drug trade
