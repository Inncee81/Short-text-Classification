my cat just got stung by a bee my husband suggested i give him aspirin i remember reading somewhere that you shouldn't give cats aspirin but i'm not sure i want to help relieve my cat's pain but i don't want to kill the animal while trying does anyone know if aspirin is ok for cats please help thank you everyone for your answers i did not give him aspirin i let him drink some cold milk and he seems to be doing ok he's not running a temperature so i think he'll be fine i think he pulled the stinger out himself cause i can't find it he's got a bit of light swelling on his paw where he was stung but he's playing around now so hopefully he learned his lesson never give a cat aspirin i work at a veterinary hospital so i do have experience with this you should call your vet you can give the cat benadryl to help if she is having a reaction such as swelling at the bite site if she starts to have trouble breathing or any other serious side effects you need to get her to the vet quickly Cat Stroke Guinea pig Aspirin Venom (poison) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Breastfeeding Herpes simplex virus Veterinarian Paracetamol Genericized trademark Scorpion Chocolate Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Sulfasalazine Myocardial infarction Mosquito Carpal tunnel syndrome Spider Diving Ferret Minor Harry Potter Beasts Tarantula Animal testing Africanized bee Siegfried & Roy COX-2 inhibitor Ketamine Pet Sematary Angina Traumatic incident reduction Unreal Honeybee Scientology beliefs and practices Osteoarthritis A Course In Miracles Shaggy dog story Malaria Fancy rat Rabies Enzyme Gout Taboo food and drink First aid Theory of conduct Allergy Socialization Rofecoxib Toxoplasmosis Thermoregulation Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Weather lore Semiconductor device Pet skunk Dr. Seuss Drowning Red imported fire ant Jam (TV series) Stomach cancer Social rule Dog Snake Diseases of the honeybee Urticaria The Marshall Mathers LP Terri Irwin Milton H.
