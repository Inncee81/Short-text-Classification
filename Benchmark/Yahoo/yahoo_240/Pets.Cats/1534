why do cats climb trees my cat will just randomly run at the trees and climb it for no reason really why does she doe this cats are predators and very clever i have seen a cat watch and then mimic a squirrel in the way that is climbs a tree i kid you not there are some big cats that also use trees to hunt not only is a tree a great place to stay away from other predators like dogs who rarely figure out what a tree is for rather than marking its territory love dogs brilliant creatures it is a great place to store food to rest top spy prey on the ground and of course to hunt birds and bird eggs which cats actually hate with an animosity that goes far beyond anything i have ever seen i think it is because they prune and clean themselves as much as cats do and they are just as arrogant a bit like the english vs the french both as bloody arrogant as each other Cat Gray Wolf Leopard Kakapo Ferret Red Squirrel Hamster Dog Acorn Squirrel Capercaillie Garfield Tyrannosaurus rex RuneScape quests American Alligator Bat Charge (heraldry) Animal communication Climbing Kevin and Kell Seabird Puma American Black Bear Brown Bear Cheetah Flea Nile crocodile Gypsy moth Creatures in Bionicle Albatross Minor Harry Potter Beasts Fancy rat Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog Biological pest control Hunting Invader Zim Peafowl Apex predator Shark Fox hunting Azumanga Daioh The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius Camp Lazlo Goanna Europe Ostrich Falconry Predation Bird Lion Ranma __ characters Coconut crab Taboo food and drink The Fairly OddParents Kangaroo Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Fauna of Australia Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Asiatic Golden Cat Conker's Bad Fur Day Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Orca African Hunting Dog Tiger Animal rights Beetle Gunsmith Cats Mutts Hun-Apu Feral cat Birdwatching Clark's Nutcracker Caracal Pet skunk Discworld gods Treecat Eastern Gray Squirrel Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Sinfest Polychrotidae Egg (biology) Oddworld Kosher foods 2 Stupid Dogs Feral Kagu Xenomorph Andalite Scooby-Doo Slayers Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Taikyoku shogi Fictional crossover European Magpie Carnivore Aye-aye Yosemite Valley Teacher's Pet (Disney) Shannara creatures
