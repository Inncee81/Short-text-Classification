my bff lost her two kittens and has no idea where they are they are both girls and only one fixed the fixed one is a cream color on it's body and has blue eyes and black ears nose paws and tail that one has been missing for weeks the un fixed one is a tortie color which is like brown orange and black she has only a little bit of white mixed in here is a picture of one that looks like her http www norwegianforestcatbreeders co uk tortie tiganlea jpg this one has no white but her kitten does they both do not have collars and were lost weeks ago in o'fallon if you see one please call me or her or email me or her oh here is a picture that looks like a twin of the other kitten they are each kittens but the tortie one is younger please let me know if you see one if you see one please take it in your home and don't let it run out again http t images live com images thumbnail aspx q id d b c c ed e b b a email ijese hotmail com for the th answer they are not little bitty the cream one is months and the tortie is her baby she always is with her and acts like she is her mom so i really don't think they are dead it's possible that someone in your area found one or both of the kittens and have been taking care of them however this forum is international and since most people here probably don't know where o'fallon is you're likely wasting your time asking people here to look for the kittens your best bet is to search locally take those pictures and print them on flyers that you can attach to phone poles in the area they were lost call the local shelter and humane society if you have a local paper that allows such notices you could try that too and never let small helpless pets outside without supervision and collars with identification tags Cat Dog Puma Siamese (cat) Ferret Color Cheetah Meriones unguiculatus Kitten Pet skunk Tortoiseshell cat Internet phenomenon House Mouse Cross site scripting Fancy rat Angora (cat) Dobermann Tabby cat Turkish Van James McNeill Whistler Vehicle registration plate Photography Guinea pig Garfield Gmail Goatse.cx Labrador Retriever Domestic rabbit Computer virus Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Tag Detroit Tigers Socialization Minor Harry Potter Beasts Bob and George Google The Standard The Island (2005 film) Dog agility Cat coat genetics Ron and Fez E-mail spam Every time you masturbate___ God kills a kitten Feral cat Breastfeeding CPU cache Digital photography Tattoo What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?
