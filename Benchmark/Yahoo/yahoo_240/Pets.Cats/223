getting a second cat i have a year old indoor cat who gets bored very easily and is always chewing up my things and trying to get out while i am working i was wondering if it would be a good idea to get another cat as a companion for him so they could entertain each other or will this only make his behaviors worst i don't need cats marking their teriroty when he was a kitten him and a friend of mines cat use to fight badly so i don't know if he can play well with others however that was before he was neurtered i just don't want to get another and have him kill the other cat while i am at work please any advice would be great never underestimate just how much cat values it's territory it is their source of food love and shelter when they feel threatened that someone is trying to take it away from them they can become very hostile you know your cat better than anyone and only you can decide if he is happy being an only cat or not the selection and introduction of a new cat always needs to be done slowly to minimise any adverse reaction from your existing cat ideally the new cat should be younger smaller and female as she would be seen as less of a threat more importantly the new cat needs to be confined to one room to begin with whilst your cat has free access to the rest of your home this reassures him that he is still in control of his territory cats also rely very heavily on their sense of smell and he will feel threatened by her scent because it's unfamiliar to him it's a good idea to let them meet each other by smell before any face to face introductions are made once she has the communal scent of your home on her things will progress a lot more smoothly the web site below offers good advice on how to introduce a second cat into the home http www tulsa animalshelter org tips intro cat htm good luck Cat Dog Animal communication Fancy rat Ferret Garfield God Emperor of Dune Pet skunk Meme Socialization Phoebe Buffay's songs Felis sapiens Domestic rabbit Microeconomics Kitten Friends Cats (musical) The Critic The Wonderful Wizard of Oz Pitaten Little Britain Guinea pig Hamster World Wide Web Natural Selection (computer game) Python programming language Trademark X Window System Skunk English grammar American Black Bear Coercion EastEnders Albatross Spyware Brown Bear Bernard Williams Wget Badly Drawn Kitties Patriotism Ginny Weasley Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Scrooge McDuck Tokyo Mew Mew The Catcher in the Rye Nepeta Miss Saigon Ethics Galaxy Angel Sugar Glider Internet troll Traumatic incident reduction Abstraction Pretty Good Privacy The Apprentice 2 Feral cat Dean Koontz W.I.T.C.H.
