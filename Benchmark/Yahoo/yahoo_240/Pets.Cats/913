cat urine i am not a cat person for this very reason my sister came to visit for the day and against my wishes she brought along her cats yesterday as i was on the floor playign with my month old son the carpet smelled of cat piss i steam cleaned it with the soultion for pets and then went over it with a water bleach carpet is white solution and it still smells the carpet isnt old the house itself is under yrs old how can i get rid of this damn smell so it wont come back ive tried febreeze also febreze just coats the carpet it doesn't get rid of the smell cleaning the carpet with bleach does some good but isn't enough for two reasons first because bleach doesn't really break down the ammonia contained in cat urine and two because the padding under the carpet is probably soaked with the urine and the cleaning didn't reach it or didn't reach enough of it there are a lot of products out there that breakdown the cat urine to eliminate the lingering odor they are all enzyme based products that are meant to target the specific chemical make up of the cat urine i use simple solution myself but there are a lot of them out there to choose from ask your vet or pet store manager for the products they recommend and when using the product the key is to apply enough product to soak into the carpet padding underneath then allow it to dry completely it's the only way to get all of the problem taken care of Ammonia Hydrogen peroxide Cat Menstrual cup Carpet Hamster Fancy rat Urinal Guinea pig Wood pulp Urinary incontinence Japanese toilet Toilet humour Toilet Menstrual cycle Brewery Drug test Domestic rabbit Tofu Natt__ Tooth enamel Theory of conduct Shampoo Chlorine Animal Crossing Extreme Programming 1,4-dichlorobenzene Composting toilet Psoriasis Marine aquarium Traumatic incident reduction Social rule Coir Body piercing Paracetamol Enzyme Diaper Diabetes mellitus Tetrachloroethylene Hemp Basement Pitaten Cannabis cultivation Diseases of the honeybee Tobacco smoking Phoebe Halliwell Cyanide Dishwashing Hydrogen economy Disinfection Aladdin (1992 film) Organic peroxide Nirvana (band) Sin City Laundry detergent Dairy Hydrogen Chair Pet skunk Vitamin C Energy development Oplan Bojinka Manicure Flatulence Multiple chemical sensitivity Upholstery Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Bleach Sulfur Protein Mattress Water purification Bong Pet Sounds Ron Weasley Wound Clomipramine Dishwasher USS Ticonderoga (CV-14) Tattoo Cat litter Economics Ferret Microeconomics Neopets Shaggy dog story Esperanto grammar Skunk Piccolo Junior Saga Ozone Plastic
