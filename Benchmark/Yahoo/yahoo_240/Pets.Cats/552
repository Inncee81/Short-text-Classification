how long should it take to stop seeing worms in a dewormed kitten's poop last week on thursday i got a week old kitten from the vet's office they said she had been de wormed last friday i gave her revolution to go ahead and kick any ear mites or fleas that she may have had the revolution works for all worms tonight as i was taking a bath she was using her litterbox which i keep in the bathroom she jumped out of the box and a piece of poop flew out of the box with her and landed on the bath mat i got a piece of toilet paper and picked the poop up and saw what was either tapeworm eggs or tapeworm segments in the poop now i am terrified thinking that she is infested she has no fleas and is an indoor cat in a meticulously kept home could this just be the worms dead or what nothing was moving in the poop how long should it take for them to pass out of her system if they are dying or dead from the vet's medicine plus my revolution surely they couldn't survive all that revolution doesn't work for tapeworms and for routine deworming vets usually use a medication that also does not kill tapeworms if they are tapeworm segments white or yellow and about the size of a grain of rice you should bring the cat back to the vet or simply call them to ask if you can come in to pick up tapeworm medication Cat Pet skunk Flea Cestoda Garfield Guinea pig Aerial (dance move) Heartworm Professional wrestling attacks Piccolo Junior Saga Fancy rat RuneScape quests Diarrhea Euphemism Diseases of the honeybee Toilet humour Coprophagia Socialization Hamster Diphyllobothriasis Sin City Ferret Snake Veterinarian Kitten EastEnders National Football League Badly Drawn Kitties The Shining (film) The Inside One Piece minor characters Spidey Super Stories Animal Russian joke Pitaten Futurama (TV series - season 3) Kakapo Chicken YuYu Hakusho Professional wrestling aerial techniques Pump It Up Bubonic plague Glossary of nautical terms The Amber Spyglass Jackass: The Movie Volleyball -cide Glossary of American football Biological pest control Fecal incontinence Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Sushi Winning Streak Mario Horse colic Dog Feral cat Allergy Kain (Legacy of Kain) The Invisibles Girly Toilet Tai shogi Tenshinhan Hymenolepiasis Shaggy dog story Lycanthropy Paul Is Dead Professional wrestling throws Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Major League Baseball television contracts Dai dai shogi Hey Jude Dai shogi Schr__dinger's cat USS America (CV-66) Pork tapeworm Bubble Bobble Vermicompost Black Death Feces Soham murders Escape from New York First Battle of the Atlantic Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Halloween Internet phenomenon Ko shogi Medical prescription Ascariasis Trainspotting (novel) The Contender (television series) Turkish Angora Tenjiku shogi Doctor Who (Enemy Within) Customs and etiquette of Japan Kashrut The Subtle Knife
