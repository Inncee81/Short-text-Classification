one more cat name question i swear this is the last one i took in a cat last week her former owners called her cleo but i don't like the name i want to change her name but she is already licensed and in the vet's records as cleo and her former owners will probably visit a lot because they live across the street from me to put my mind at ease should i give her a middle name and call her by that or should i just change her name altogether i doubt she knows her name she was an only cat and so she seems to respond to cat owner voice in general i think that if you don't like the name then you should just change it altogether i am sure the vet could change his records and the previous owners will eventually get over it if they don't like you doing so too i mean it is your cat now and certainly never belonged to the vet lol Pet skunk Garfield Cyndi Lauper Ferret Philadelphia Eagles Billboard Hot 100 The Cure Metaphysics Sly & the Family Stone New York Giants Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Swift Vets and POWs for Truth Pretty Good Privacy Cleveland Browns Time Out of Mind B3ta Phoebe Buffay's songs Social rule Miss Cleo Randomness Mutts Animal euthanasia SCO v.
