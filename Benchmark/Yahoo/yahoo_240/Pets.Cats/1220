how long do allergy shots take i am allergic to cats but i love them more than any other pet we couldn't have a cat at our house because it affected my mom more than it affected me i am about to move out and get a place on my own i feel the need to get a cat to keep me company and i miss having one so much i plan on getting shots to stop me from being allergic the question is how long do shots take if the allergic reaction isn't that bad around cats would it just be okay to own one while i am getting the shots please let me know i have two cats which i am allergic to about a year after getting the second one i started getting allergy shots my symptoms had gotten so bad that i was getting sick all the time and was starting to have symptoms of asthma i started taking shots about a year ago i only got sick once last winter until about a month ago i would only wheeze if i was running the vacuum but now i don't wheeze at all my kitties are now allowed in my bedroom and the youngest sleeps snuggled up to me almost every night before pollen season came about this past spring i was no longer taking any medication your symptoms will go away gradually but for me it has taken less than a year for the cat allergies to completely disappear in the meantime you can still take allergy meds so i don't think you need to wait i was taking allegra and nasonex ever since i first got the cats now i only take nasonex but it's because i still have symptoms of pollen allergies definitely get the cat and get the shots both are worth it Allergy Hay fever Asthma Chronic fatigue syndrome Food allergy Eczema Multiple chemical sensitivity Immunoglobulin E Aspergillosis Common cold Hypersensitivity Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Decompression sickness Medicine Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story House dust mite Pitaten Conjunctivitis Coeliac disease Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Charles Darwin's illness Clomipramine Homeopathy Tuberculosis Breastfeeding Antihistamine Friends Urinary incontinence M__ni__re___s disease Sulfasalazine Nasal congestion Wheeze Psoriasis First aid Multiple sclerosis Mast cell Pok__mon Live!
