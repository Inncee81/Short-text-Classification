will i ever be able to tell the kittens apart two of our cats mated a black cat and a tiger striped cat all four of the kittens came out black all look exactly the same and now over a month and a half later the only differences we can tell are the two boys and two girls and one is really fat and one is really skinny we can't look and say who is who will it eventually get better or will the rest of their lives need to be spent with collars so they can have names and be individuals when they get older their face shape may change and you can tell the difference between all of them if not as they grow up with you you should thell the difference between them in their personalities but i would definitely keep different colored collars on them Cat Kitten Ferret Tai shogi Puberty Garfield Puma Lion Maka dai dai shogi Feral cat Phoebe Buffay's songs Tigon Cats (musical) Dai dai shogi Liger Taikyoku shogi Socialization Dog Bengal cat Doug Guinea pig Dai shogi Maltese tiger White tiger Monster Rancher monsters Black panther Treecat Species Sexual attraction Panthera hybrid Sexual differentiation Animal Comanche Vegeta Manx (cat) Bast (goddess) Detroit Tigers Wolfrider Camouflage Tokyo Mew Mew The Aristocats Xiaolin Showdown Tenchi Muyo!
