kitten help animal hospital closed what to do until morning today i found an abandoned stray kitten about weeks old i took her to the vet who gave her antibiotics and vitamins to take i've been feeding her regularly her eyes opened tonight and she seemed to be doing well then recently tonight she started breathing very heavily and hasn't stopped i called the spca and the animal hospital we took her to and they're closed so there's no one who can tell me if this is normal or what i can do so can anybody help i'm looking around online but not finding much she doesn't have trouble sleeping but breathes very quickly sometimes when she's awake she breathes through her mouth what can i do until the animal hospital opens in the morning thank you so much my mom found a animal hospital and i called and talked to someone she told me that as long as the kitten wasn't breathing through her mouth and her tongue is still pink she'll be okay i was told she probably has an upper respiratory infection but the antibiotic she's on will help fight that i just have to keep a close eye on her and make sure she's getting enough oxygen if she starts breathing through her mouth and her tongue looks kind of blue we're rushing her to the emergency vet but for now i'm told she's doing well for a stray thanks everybody she may have been sick before you found her and for that reason her mother may have abandoned her many of the kittens found all alone have been abandoned by their mothers because they are sick or defective a mother cat does this instinctively so as to reserve her milk and attention for her healthy kittens and to prevent a sick one from attracting predators to the nest the kitten may have a cleft palate that allows food to enter her respiratory system or she might have an abnormal opening between her esophagus and her trachea with the same result or she may have a heart defect or some other internal defect such as a hiatial hernia an abnormal opening in its diaphragm which allows its intestines to move up into its chest and crowded the lungs that would explain why she developed trouble breathing after you fed her for tonight i wouldn't feed her much more but offer her water from a spoon or eye dropper keep her warm if she has pneumonia from aspirating food a steamy bathroom may help her breathe hopefully she has a cold that can be treated successfully but many of these abandoned kittens are beyond help when kind people find them don't feel guilty or inadequate if she dies despite your efforts if that is the case remember that you tried and that she was warm and safe and cared for because you found her let us know what happens Cat Breastfeeding Guinea pig Lung Stomach cancer Cystic fibrosis Traumatic brain injury Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Drowning Atrial septal defect Common cold Domestic rabbit Cephalic disorder Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Hamster Premature birth Kitten Legionellosis Sleep apnea Acne Ferret Garfield Prostate cancer Dog Anemia Vomiting Liquid breathing Respiratory system Diarrhea Reptile Pet skunk Hypoglycemia Rabies Kodocha Chicken Diving regulator Gastroesophageal reflux disease Shock Vitamin C Urinary incontinence Escherichia coli O157:H7 Duchenne muscular dystrophy Tetrapod Asthma Decompression sickness Acute respiratory distress syndrome Androgen insensitivity syndrome Scuba set Folic acid Antibiotic Blue Whale Salad Fingers Psoriasis Rebreather Coprophagia Theory of conduct Cocaine Radiation therapy Poliomyelitis Friends Human lung Protein-energy malnutrition Esophageal cancer Emphysema Nutrition Halitosis Myocardial infarction Stroke AIDS Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Childbirth Fugu Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Pneumothorax Cardiopulmonary resuscitation Tocopherol Crocodilia Aspergillosis Lung cancer Botulism Whale Cancer Sin City Turner syndrome Anthrax Spider Anorexia nervosa Kakapo Fecal incontinence
