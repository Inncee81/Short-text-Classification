why does my cat keep sneezing could be allergies or a cold when i got my cats a couple of years ago one of them kept sneezing i thought it would go away and waited about two months before taking him to the vet the vet gave me some meds for my cat and the sneezing stopped shortly after he must have had some type of cold that just wouldn't go away on its own but the vet did say the meds might not work and that i could just have a sneezer on my hands my advice to you is that if this has been going on for a while talk to the vet if it's just been a couple of days give it some more time Sneeze Common cold Garfield Influenza Veterinarian Dean Koontz Tuberculosis Asthma Hay fever Russian joke The Archers Toilet humour Socialization Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Datalore (TNG episode) Housebreaking Pet skunk Calvin and Hobbes Shining Time Station Medicine Influenza pandemic Migraine Sniffles Red Ribbon Army Girly Rocko's Modern Life Dog The Inside Breastfeeding Ferret The Subtle Knife Time Out of Mind Prayer Herpes simplex virus Happy Tree Friends The Ashlee Simpson Show Tooth enamel Punisher Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma The Pet Sounds Sessions Group A streptococcal infection The Amber Spyglass Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Neighbours Pet Sounds Fancy rat Charles Darwin's illness James Herriot Jade Emperor The Catcher in the Rye Charmed Sleeping Murder Past teachings of Prem Rawat Chronic fatigue syndrome Sly Stone Shaggy dog story Blonde on Blonde The Big Goodbye (TNG episode) Rabies S.N.O.W.I.N.G.
