do your cats ever help you feel better when you feel down lonely or depressed i hear a lot about it wondering if your cats make you feel better when you are sad and how i love cats and love to hear heart warming stories about them thanks i've only really had experience with my cat since i adopted her that she really truly knew i was upset kikimo is strictly an indoor cat eventhough i'll occasionally carry her outside onto the porch so she can look around smell the outdoors she does get uncomfortable being out of the house tries to run back inside after a few minutes i also know all of her hiding sleeping places throughout the house well one afternoon i came home around the th of july couldn't find her anywhere i searched the house up down for at least an hour pleading for her to come to me then i began to panic searched the perimeter of my fenced in yard thinking somehow she may've got outside trying to escape she's deathly afraid of fireworks the neighbors did them day nite finally i came back in just broke down crying my eyes out on the stairs only then did she show herself she heard or sensed that i was upset came running put her paws on my shoulders to hug me rubbed her face on mine licked away my tears soon after i realized only when quickly following her after a very loud firework that her safe place when there are loud booms is behind the microwave on the kitchen counter i didn't even think she could fit back there so now i at least know where to find her if she's terrified Shaggy dog story Cat Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pitaten One Tree Hill (TV series) The Shining (film) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Columbine High School massacre Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) W.I.T.C.H.
