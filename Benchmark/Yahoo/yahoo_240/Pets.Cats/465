does head shoulders kill the flea eggs too how oftern can you wash a kitten with it i washed my flea kittens in head shoulders when i let the soap sit on them for minutes it killed the fleas i would like to know if it kills the eggs too and how often i should wash them in it they are only weeks too little for advantage etc thanks for all the responses tho i don't usually use human shampoo on cats as cats tend to be so sensitive to so many things and i don't know what products are safe to use on my cats i doubt that head shoulders kills flea eggs as most flea products do not you can read the product label if it can kill the eggs it will state that as this is a rare attribute and an excellent selling point for the product that can kill the fleas in the eggs as well what you did is drown the fleas the soap prevents their escape and they drown letting the kit sit with all that soap for min was a great plan now get a flea comb and comb the kitten thoroughly to comb those flea eggs out now do not repeat the shampoo anything that can kill fleas can be hard on the body if used too often so use a comb instead once you have combed the kitten then see how the flea situation looks if the kitten has been inside the house you need to treat it's bed and may need to bug bomb the house as well Shampoo Cat Flea Sento Red Hot Chili Peppers Diseases of the honeybee Feral cat Kitten Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dandruff Ranma __ characters Treecat Schistosomiasis Tattoo Hair Rebreather Columbine High School massacre Crab louse Textile manufacturing Ozzie, Slash, and Flea First aid Beetle Manx (cat) Laserdisc StarCraft: Hybrid Dairy EastEnders Kakapo RuneScape quests Guinea pig Swingout Jason Voorhees Drowning John Frusciante Shark Menstrual cup Egg (food) Soap Professional wrestling holds Equine conformation Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog Socialization Xenomorph Dog PlayStation 2 Soap opera Procter & Gamble The Apprentice 2 Chicken Ferret Dog training Hamster Domestic violence Spanking Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Minor Harry Potter Beasts Mosquito Hard disk The Amber Spyglass Insect Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Alaga__sia Puma Top-bar hive Milton H.
