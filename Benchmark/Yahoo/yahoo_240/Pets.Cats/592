should i get another cat i have a cat now and she is my love we have had her for a little over a year now and she is still kind of skiddish espescially around new people i want to get a kitten but i don't know how she would handle it i think they could learn to become good friends but i'm not sure i don't want my cat to just hide from it all the time and be sad but she might really enjoy a playmate i would still give her plenty of attention i just don't want her to become even worse with a new additon any suggestions i know this is hard but i would recomend that unless she is still very very playful not to get a new one we just introduced a kitten into our famiyl when we alreday owned a cat weeks later they are still not getting along our cat gets really mad at us and keeps pawing at the kitten so long as your happy with your kitten as it is i think you should just keep her and enjoy beign a single cat owner Cats (musical) Garfield Atomic Kitten Cat Socialization Ferret RuneScape quests Kitten B3ta Siamese (cat) Feral cat Pitaten Dean Koontz Oasis (band) Felix the Cat Humphrey Bogart Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Girly Guinea pig Turkish Van Cheshire cat Phoebe Buffay's songs The Beatles bootlegs Shaggy dog story Trailer Park Boys Big Brother UK series 5 Manx (cat) The Aristocats True Crime: Streets of LA Japanese Bobtail (cat) Happiness Azumanga Daioh Cliff Richard Ron and Fez Through the Looking-Glass El Goonish Shive Animal Collective Lie Kender Donovan Garfield and Friends Playmate Internet phenomenon Badly Drawn Kitties Lynx Pet skunk Purr Xiaolin Showdown Dog training Every time you masturbate___ God kills a kitten Doug Theory of conduct House music Bengal cat Double entendre Maneki Neko Angela Winbush The Emancipation of Mimi Saga (band) The Ashlee Simpson Show The Beatles discography Monster Rancher monsters Domestic rabbit Catgirl Turkish Angora Sphynx (cat) Friends Emotions (album) Sheryl Crow AFI 100 Years series George Burns Liu Bocheng Sluggy Freelance Time Out of Mind Artemis (Sailor Moon) Marc Antony and Pussyfoot Don Knotts Freddie Mercury Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Tennessee Williams Samurai Pizza Cats The Marshall Mathers LP Love and Theft Balinese (cat) Catwoman Krypto the Superdog Hello Kitty Pet store Abd al-Rahman ibn Sakhr The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Sting (musician) Treehouse of Horror II Sam and Fuzzy M.
