question about my diabetic cat my cat is approximately yrs old and a rescue when i took her to the vet the first time i thought she was dying it turns out that after a full physical she was suffering long term effects of diabetes she is now eating special diabetic cat food and i'm giving her insulin injections daily she has been gaining weight and looking a little better but today she has really bad diarrhea and she hasn't urinated at least not in her box or where i can find it i called my vet but he can't see her until thursday he's on vacation does anyone know about cats with diabetes should i be really concerned and try to take her to another vet tomorrow or am i getting alarmed too easily i wouldn't worry if she weren't so ill to begin with does anybody have any experience with this i think it would be a very good idea for you to at least call another vet tomorrow speaking to someone directly will let a vet get a better idea of her condition and they can advise you whether or not you need to bring her in as the first person said if she seems not to be urinating she does need to see a vet it would be less common for a female cat to block usually more of a male problem but it's certainly possible bad diarrhoea is a bit of a concern too she may become dehydrated if she's losing a lot of fluid that way and any sort of infections or inflammation will change her body's energy demands which could upset the control you've got over her diabetes at the moment is she eating you probably already know this but if she's not eating or is eating a lot less than normal you should be careful about giving her her insulin a good idea to reduce the dose usually to about half as she may become hypoglycaemic low blood sugar her blood sugar may also drop because her body is using more energy than normal if she starts looking really flat rub some honey on her gums talk to a vet you're not being too easily alarmed never mess about when you're dealing with a sick animal with diabetes hope she's okay o Diabetes mellitus Insulin Hypoglycemia Nutrition Diarrhea Guinea pig Urinary incontinence Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Atkins Nutritional Approach Chlorpromazine Stomach cancer Hyperglycemia Diabetic ketoacidosis Prostate cancer Dieting Domestic rabbit Ferret Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Growth hormone treatment Vitamin C Folic acid Crohn's disease Coeliac disease Gastroparesis Intensive insulinotherapy Pneumonia Stroke Raw food diet Diabetic neuropathy Diabetic coma Breastfeeding Milk Caffeine Low-carbohydrate diet Aspartame Diabetic nephropathy Penis Insulin resistance Sugar substitute Social rule Chronic fatigue syndrome Dialysis Oral contraceptive Terri Schiavo Tooth enamel Diabetes insipidus Garfield Blood sugar Fancy rat First aid Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia Binge eating disorder Gout Obstetrics Growth hormone deficiency Chocolate Cat Obesity Diabetic retinopathy Gastroenteritis Glucocorticoid Polycystic ovary syndrome Glucokinase Protein-energy malnutrition Osteoarthritis Dietary fiber Hamster Bodybuilding Childbirth Psoriasis Urine Cystic fibrosis Housebreaking Pet skunk Medicine Omega-3 fatty acid Blood pressure Alzheimer's disease Theory of conduct Glucose meter Rabies Atherosclerosis Intravenous therapy Equine conformation Diabetic hypoglycemia Clinical depression Death Hypertension Glycemic index Dexamethasone Clozapine Acromegaly Charles Darwin's illness
