flea problem i have an indoor cat that has somehow gotten fleas my house is always clean so that isn't the problem i dog sat for family a few weeks back and that's the only thing i can figure that would bring fleas in the house bombs don't work and my cat is allergic to the flea collars does anyone know of an easy effective fix for both the house and the cat before i go insane treat the cat go to your vet and get either advantage or frontline plus i went with advantage get yourself a flea comb and comb your cat at least once per day have a bucket with dish soap in it handy to dunk the comb in and to collect the hair fleas can't jump out of the slippery soap no point in combing them out only to have them jump back on your cat flush this down the toilet pour it down the sink or dispose of it away from your house treat your house options are a borate powder product or something that uses diatomaceous earth fleabusters bp fleago natural flea control bp or flea away natural flea powder de put about a tablespoon of this in your vacuum cleaner bag or you can cut up a flea collar to put in there just follow the directions which will vary by product but in general you'll sprinkle on the carpet and vacuum up and also sprinkle into cracks and crevices i chose fleago because it's less expensive than fleabusters i may also try flea away in time vacuum as often as possible before vacuuming stomp around the house this will bring the fleas to life because they'll think there's a tasty morsel out there then vacuum those little bastards up be sure to use your attachments to vacuum as many cracks and crevices as you can they love to hide out there wash any pet bedding in hot water and you'll want to be particularly diligent about vacuuming treating areas where your cat hangs out treat your yard even if your cat doesn't go outside fleas may enter your home if they exist in your yard there's a small chance that you or others may bring fleas in the house with you although this is unlikely get hold of some nematodes to spray in your yard i believe you only have to do this once per year these little creatures will eat the flea larva as one website put it these critters are too small to hug but they deserve it i had to order this online i wasn't able to find a place that sells them in my area and didn't feel like calling every place in the phonebook things not to do don't use any essential oils on your cat particularly anything with pennyroyal or eucalyptus they're toxic to cats don't use flea collars don't give your cat any garlic yeast formulations don't give your cat lemon baths you're going to want to continue treating your home as directed whether that be sprinkling once per week or once a month continue treating throughout flea season when it's warm you can stop during the winter months but start up again in the spring you'll nip them in the bud the key is to treat the environment not the cat if you do that you may never have to apply another flea product directly on them again Flea Diseases of the honeybee Hamster Japanese toilet Cat Dairy Menstrual cup Japanese tea ceremony Sewage treatment Brewery Bedbug Theory of conduct Bread Coffee Shampoo Fancy rat Thermal power station Soap Vacuum cleaner Fecal incontinence Plastic Upholstery Illegal drug trade Tea Shaggy dog story Equine conformation Customs and etiquette of Japan Carburetor Baptism Tattoo The Amber Spyglass Autonomous building Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Mattress Dry cleaning RuneScape quests Piccolo Junior Saga Characters in the Smurfs Domestic rabbit Guinea pig Chicken Dilbert Toilet Sin City Richard Chase Mosquito Casting Genericized trademark Energy development Manual transmission Toilet paper Chinchilla Welding Pebble bed reactor EastEnders Poker jargon Kitchen Toilet humour 613 mitzvot Menstrual cycle Linked list Blood (computer game) Vacuum tube Comanche Vacuum Spidey Super Stories Sauna Futurama (TV series - season 2) The Dalek Invasion of Earth Social rule Professional wrestling match types Water Chocolate Tofu John Frusciante Jackass: The Movie Ranma __ characters Tag Philosophy of space and time Cruising (maritime) Tick Lumber Common cold Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Soap opera Knots Landing Randomness Glossary of climbing terms Teletubbies M16 (rifle) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
