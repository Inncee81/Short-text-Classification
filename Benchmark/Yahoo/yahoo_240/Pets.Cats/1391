kitten wont sleep i just got a kitten she would not sleep at night and keeps me up all night some days she passes out if she is tired if not she wants to play help plz having a kitten is like having a new baby you don't sleep because they don't sleep it's a difficult situation that many people who adopt one kitten don't realise they are going to have to deal with really the best idea is to get another kitten they will wear each other out and can be kept in their own space through the night and have each other's company and allow you to get some sleep so i hope that's an option from you plenty of kitten available now otherwise it can be six months or more before she settles down a little and gains some respect for human sleeping schedules Atomic Kitten Narcolepsy Kitten Social rule Sleep Feral cat Apollo 8 Socialization Ferret EastEnders Siesta Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Phoebe Buffay's songs Treecat Tupac Shakur Gemini 7 The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Softball Polyphasic sleep STS-61 Urinary incontinence Feral The Rutles Tire Daylight saving time Big Brother UK series 5 Cats (musical) Mattress Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Friends Cat Theory of conduct Monday Night Football Stanley Cup Pitaten RuneScape quests Dream Sleeping Murder The Night's Dawn Trilogy Public transport Insomnia Goatse.cx OpenBSD Undergarment Carpal tunnel syndrome Sukkot First English Civil War Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Doug Saturday Night Live Knots Landing The Life and Times of Juniper Lee The Children of Men Abu Dhabi Macbeth Cuteness Crew Exploration Vehicle Thermoregulation Breastfeeding Vampire Every time you masturbate___ God kills a kitten Avenue Q Hikikomori RKO Pictures Internet phenomenon El Goonish Shive Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Sleeping sickness Euphemism AFI 100 Years series The Subtle Knife Science fiction film Planet Waves Journey (band) The Contender (television series) Jewish services United Kingdom corporation tax Hernando de Soto (explorer) Infidels Brandenburgers Silly Symphonies Zhuge Liang Edward Gibbon Wakefield Venom (comics) Bon Jovi Sleep deprivation Thor (Marvel Comics) Satchel Paige Ric Flair Irna Phillips Rosa Parks Cliff Richard Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man The Amber Spyglass Kurt Cobain Gregg Alexander The Beatles discography Surveillance The Marriage of Figaro Oasis (band)
