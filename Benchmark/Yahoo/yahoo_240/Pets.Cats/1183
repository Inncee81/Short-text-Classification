cats sick my cat has been sneezing since yesteday nothing major i think he might have a cold problem is i do not have money to spend to take him to the vet i dont even have moeny for my own health care right now i was wondering if it would be safe to take a very small dose of dayquill and mix it the water again just alittle bit or will he get better on his own also can i give him herbs such as ecancheia sp thanks tom cats have a phenomenal ability to heal themselves i would not give him any cough syrup or herbs if you think he's sick check his temp rectally cats run around normally if he has no other symptoms than sneezing it could be a seasonal allergy or time to dust if the sneezing turns into wheezing and difficulty breathing or any nasal discharge he probably will have bronchitis or pneumonia you can get a nasal bulb syringe to suck out the discharge and use otc saline spray to break things up go to an herbal store for specifics on cats by the way cats are not used for animal testing of products because they are radically different from us so don't assume if it's ok for a person it will work for your cat we have worked out a barter system with our vet we seem to get all the strays in the county currently cats kittens your vet might appreciate having someone do some cleaning or other work in exchange for services Hay fever Common cold Asthma Cat Influenza Pneumonia Guinea pig Allergy Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Sneeze Pet skunk Ferret Non-medical use of dextromethorphan Medical prescription Fancy rat Aspergillosis Medicine Domestic rabbit Rabies Urinary incontinence Nasal congestion Computed tomography Tuberculosis Traditional Chinese medicine First aid kit Cancer Jala neti H5N1 Pulmonary alveolus Barter Homeopathy Haloalkane Prostate cancer The Secret of NIMH Abortion Traumatic brain injury Hepatitis C Natural health Aloe Sinusitis Nasal irrigation Thermal power station Hamster Disease Patent medicine Legionellosis Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Biological warfare Cough medicine Diabetes mellitus Mercury (element) Vampire Vitamin C Decompression sickness Veterinarian Herbalism Diazepam Anesthesia Coffee Babe Ruth Aspartame Nasal spray Nuclear fallout Blood (computer game) Bronchitis Yarrow The Amber Spyglass Coeliac disease Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Diagon Alley Hyperthermia Alternative medicine Group A streptococcal infection Dog Hypoglycemia Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Charles Darwin's illness Cocaine Ayurveda Chlamydophila pneumoniae Smoke-screen Feral cat Garfield Fecal incontinence Brewery Botulism Clinical depression Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Azumanga Daioh Mosquito Vinegar Social rule Fire extinguisher Nepeta
