need kitten advice i have three kittens two are months and a few days ago i got another that is months one of the older kittens is hissing at the younger one and batting at her is there any advice on how to get them to adjust better and get along thanks for any help we've had cats for a couple of years got at separate times and recently adopted another the secret is to introduce the new cat very gradually and by gradually i mean even up to a month there is no hard and fast time frame you need to set up a room for the new cat with its own litter tray food drink bowls and sleeping mat play with and stroke the new kitten then go play with the established ones so that they can smell the new one and vice versa once they are used to the smell they are allowed to see each other once they are used to that they can finally meet each of these stages needs to be done thoroughly and can take days weeks any new cat kitten being introduced into a cat household will result in hissing and aggression this is because the dynamics of the 'pack' have changed and the leader needs to be confirmed usually a younger cat will happily be submissive but the more dominant ones will want to assert their authority regardless and it sounds like this is happening with you you need to leave them to it as it is natural behaviour it's like you starting a new job and trying to work out who is friendly or not who's your boss without anyone telling you etc all you need to do is monitor it to make sure it doesn't get out of hand and the batting doesn't become violent i doubt it will unless the kitten is challenging the authority of the older cat it should settle down on its own as it's rare cats in a multicat household don't get on Cat Kitten Dog Feral cat Badly Drawn Kitties Ravi Shastri Friends RuneScape quests Big Brother UK series 5 Social rule The Amazing Race Domestic rabbit Kakapo The Smoking Room West Indian cricket team Ferret Pitaten Sin City Laws of cricket Pet skunk Bat Manx (cat) StarCraft: Hybrid Treecat Blonde on Blonde Violin Fast bowling The Shining (film) Garfield Cricket Shaggy dog story Feral EastEnders Fancy rat Joy Division (band) Socialization Purr Gregorian calendar Babe Ruth Table tennis Alex Ferguson Japanese tea ceremony Breastfeeding Batting (cricket) Knots Landing The Ashes Tobacco smoking Janet Jackson Ranma __ characters Plame affair Karl Rove Tasmanian Devil Parliament of the United Kingdom Transactional analysis Bubble Bobble Homer Simpson Kodocha Timpani Ginny Weasley Politics of Russia Traumatic brain injury God Emperor of Dune Softball Gray Wolf National Football League Ocean's Twelve Sound recording Sluggy Freelance Dualism (philosophy of mind) Girly Little Britain Bottlenose Dolphin Mormonism and Judaism Harrow School Tyrannosaurus rex The Wotch Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 OpenBSD Professional wrestling match types Pok__mon Live!
