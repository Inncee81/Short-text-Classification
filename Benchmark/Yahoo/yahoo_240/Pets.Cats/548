does anyone know if the manx cat breed are born to always have the wild characteristics does anyone know if the manx breed are born to always have the wild characteristics i've had my manx for about years it lives indoors and it still bites it's bit ever since it was a kitten i can only pet it on the head or rub its neck and nothing below but if i pet longer than like minute it will turn around and take a chunk of my hand i don't even pet it rough either its light petting yet it still comes and rubs against me like it wants me to pet it and it meows if me and my family call for it and it follows us around but why does it bite us and other people i don't understand i would think if it didn't like being pet it wouldn't rub against me even after it eats and its full already it will rub against us yet then not too long it will bite us what is wrong with it is it bipolar or something i wish i had a normal cat i could pick up and hold aside from that he always hides under the coffee table and when people walk by he pounces out and jumps on our legs and claws and bites us too i always have to throw something out into the middle of the floor so it goes for that thing first before my leg so i can walk by without a mark this doesn't have anything to do with what type of breed she is manxes are usually a gentle breed most don't come from the island of man no more but have been purebred well as far as that applies to a breed that needs to be outcrossed constantly for generations for health and good character this sounds more like a problem with her upbringing the biting probably wasn't handled appropriately when she was a kitten a kitten should immediately be left alone and ignored when it bites so it learns biting means play or cuddletime is over by now it's likely just become part of her behavioral pattern and i doubt it could be changed at this stage for her it might not even be linked with aggression at all it might just be play she just never learnt where the boundaries are in that the headrubbing means she's leaving a scentmark on you to state to the world that you're part of her domain so yes she does accept and like you but it sounds like for her that's no reason not to nip at you even when treated completely by the book some cats still won't like being picked up in adulthood cats have strong personalities and can't be forced to like anything they can be trained to great extend though a cat that was picked up and cuddled a lot as a kitten from birth on is more likely to find this pleasant and comforting in adulthood too if you want to see if anything could be done even at this age you could contact a behavioral therapist for your cat good luck with her Manx (cat) Dog Domestic rabbit Dog training Garfield Guinea pig Kitten Social rule Hamster Fancy rat Milton H.
