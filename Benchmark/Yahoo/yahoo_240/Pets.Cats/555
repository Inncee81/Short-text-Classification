why do cats knead we recently put out a new pillow and one of my cats obsessively kneads on it some times he will actually lay down but most of the time he just sits there and kneads for a long time cats knead because its a comfort thing for them they knead their mothers tummy while suckling to help milk flow so even through adulthood they see it as a comfort thing and it reminds them of there mothers they tend to do it most before lying down on a person or something else soft it can be annoying and can hurt a tiny bit if the cats padding on you but dont discourage it after all how would you feel if every time you tried to get comfortable remembered your mom or displayed a comforting habit even if the kitty doesnt lie down and just kneads for a while it probably just needs some comforting or a reminder of its days as a little kitten with its mom my cat sometimes kneads on a pillow and cries i guess hes feeling lonely and needs some comfort so when he does this i pick him up and cuddle him till he falls asleep and for as long as i can afterwards when a cat kneads on a person it means they are comfortable with that person and loves them Breastfeeding Cat Atomic Kitten Little Britain Phoebe Buffay's songs Care Bears Garfield Kitten Strap-on dildo Ranma __ characters Kim Possible Jam (TV series) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Fruits Basket Lie Mattress Maison Ikkoku The Shining (film) Upholstery W.I.T.C.H.
