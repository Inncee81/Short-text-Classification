why does my cat insist on waking my wife and i up really early in the morning my wife and i have two cats that are spoiled rotten with love and attention they are healthy smart and beautiful cats one is a female a bit overweight but wears it well the other is an athletic male tabby cat he seems to want to get us up with the sun each morning funny thing is its not to feed him he's not a big eater like the female and she could care less when we get out of bed so why does this male cat insist on waking us up at sunrise every morning he is not trying to go to the bathroom a litter box is always available to him and he never seems to do that when waking us up he just wants to hang out with us one theory i have had is that he is warning us of possible dangers that could come with the day like being seen or smelled of course everything cats do is ultimately about avoiding being preyed upon or to prey on others cats are selfish and social when they choose to be social and then there are times they choose to be unsocial that's why i don't like cats too well even though i have one when my cat is up he wants us up and has no concern for our need for sleep he just knows he wants attention and to be played with he's up and we should be too that's his rational so we started teaching him that he does not dictate when we get up and that if he's awake fine but be awake and entertain yourself or go back to sleep we scold him for meowing and other forms of getting our attention and if he needs food we give it to him but try to make sure the bowl is full the night before so it won't be empty too early sometimes we'll scold him and shut him out of the bedroom as to say you are misbehaving and don't belong in here right now Cat Sin City Hamster Phoebe Buffay's songs Sleep Avenue Q Shaggy dog story Friends Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Animal communication Garfield Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pitaten Insomnia Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Minor Harry Potter Beasts Dream Humphrey Bogart Odyssey Ferret Jon Secada Domestic rabbit Characters in the Smurfs Elvis Presley Spider Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban SpongeBob SquarePants The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Tom and Jerry (MGM) Mountaineering Monster Rancher monsters Dog Kurt Cobain Fancy rat AFI 100 Years series Urinary incontinence Lion Ron and Fez Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Felis sapiens Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Bat Characters of The Sandman Social rule Japanese tea ceremony The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Out-of-body experience Mattress Dean Koontz Robert A.
