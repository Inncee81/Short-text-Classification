what would you do i am a registered cat breeder i do not get along with my mother have basically cut her out of my life when i became a breeder she made it very clear she thought this was a bad idea recently when i was ill she came around it seems she has fallen in love with an older kitten i have that i just cannot find a home for in may i had asked my mother a few key questions about getting a second cat as i knew she wanted a friend for her current cat i was going to offer her this kitten i have as i know he is exactly what she would want she made it clear that she did not want another cat at the time now she has met the kitten she is constantly dropping hints that she loves him thinks he's gorgeous etc etc i am still tempted to offer him to her again but since she basically flung my offer back in my face when i last made the suggestion i am reluctant to do so also i think my husband has fallen in love with the kitten what should i do to linda c thank you for your honest answer i'm well aware of all the costs involved as i have been a registered breeder now for quiet some time i think overall i am still about au of even coming close to breaking even not that it bothers me or my husband i want to do the right thing for this kitten as he is a real little sweetheart at this point i am figuring he will remain with us as he is a very timid but trusts us plus who wouldn't want to keep a kitten that smooches up to you under the doona everynight although having said that i might never sell a single kitten if i keep every kitten that does that cat breeding is not all kittens and cuteness it can be an expensive hobby with a lot of responsibility as a cat breeder we want to get the best possible homes for our cats irregardless of the money involved if you do it right you can't make money breeding cats anyway then there's the kitten that just doesn't find a home right away he still deserves a good home so the question is would your mother make a good home for the cat since she already has one cat and has told you that she was clear she did not want another cat i think that 's the end of the story i'd plan on talking to my husband about it and plan on keeping the kitten for now if your mother truly wants the kitten all she has to do is ask rather than hinting around because hints have a way of being misinterpreted if she loves him and says he's so gorgeous she might not necessarily want him she might just want to visit him because you and your mother don't get along you could be reading this wrong and she could be giving you mixed signals you offered the kitten once she said no she could always change her mind but then that would mean she'd need to talk to you about it i can also see that you're reluctant to offer the kitten because it's hard to accept being shot down so i'd say give it time and the answer will reveal itself as far as i'm concerned there is always room for one more cat or two Pitaten Friends Social rule EastEnders Badly Drawn Kitties Avenue Q The Amber Spyglass Kodocha Miss Saigon Theory of conduct God Emperor of Dune Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Little Britain Knots Landing About a Boy One Tree Hill (TV series) Ferret The Ashlee Simpson Show Extreme Programming Inception of Darwin's theory Jam (TV series) RuneScape quests Microeconomics The Lovely Bones Bad Wolf Current teachings of Prem Rawat The Emancipation of Mimi Kasparov versus The World Lie Characters in the Smurfs The nature of God in Western theology Neighbours Humphrey Bogart Shaggy dog story Girly Transactional analysis Great Teacher Onizuka Time Out of Mind Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Apprentice 2 Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Good Times Manx (cat) Ocean's Twelve Atomic Kitten Days of our Lives Doug Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Cat The Invisibles Mojave people Children of Dune Philosophy of mathematics Trailer Park Boys Rocko's Modern Life Monster Rancher monsters Gross domestic product Charmed Philosophy of language Incarnations of Immortality Piccolo Junior Saga Ranma __ characters Socrates Milton H.
