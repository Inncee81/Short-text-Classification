is it ever too late for a cat to get shots i got my cat in the beggining of last summer and she was already like a couple of months old so right now shes like years old she already had litters but i'm thinking about getting her spayed no it really isn't too late for either one even if your cat is already infected with one of the diseases they are vaccinating for the vaccines will not harm the cat and according to some studies they may even help slightly when i found my cat she had a respiratory infection that was likely caused by one of the diseases she was later vaccinated against of course the best reason is to make sure that she is protected against diseases she does not already have i also agree with the poster above who recommended getting her spayed at the same time there are too many cats out there and not enough homes my cat was a stray herself and she was so sick she almost died as a kitten it breaks my heart thinking about it as soon as she was old enough i got her spayed so that i would not contribute to the problem please help reduce the number of strays by spaying your cat good luck here's to many happy years with your healthier vaccinated kitty Cat Domestic rabbit Dog Feral cat Kitten Pet skunk Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Rabies Vaccine Influenza AIDS Pneumonia Tuberculosis Smallpox H5N1 MMR vaccine Autism epidemic HIV vaccine Ferret Herpes simplex virus Cancer Guinea pig Vaccination Malaria Chronic fatigue syndrome Poliomyelitis Diphtheria Human papillomavirus Asthma Measles Marburg virus Medical analysis of circumcision Antiviral drug Bioterrorism 2001 UK foot and mouth crisis Toxoplasmosis Asbestos Tobacco smoking Socialization Foot-and-mouth disease Vaccine controversy Thimerosal Influenza pandemic Cytomegalovirus Andrew Wakefield Alzheimer's disease Sickle-cell disease Cervical cancer Pertussis Autism Cocaine Lyme disease Virus Diabetes mellitus DDT Chagas disease Microeconomics Group A streptococcal infection Breastfeeding Anthrax Colorectal cancer HIV test Rocky Mountain spotted fever Natural Hygiene Mumps Medicine Tick Streptococcus pneumoniae Mathematical modelling in epidemiology Heartworm Biological warfare Animal shelter Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Sexually-transmitted infection Pitaten Omega-3 fatty acid Pathogen Disease Hamster Tetanus Urinary incontinence Spanish flu Infectious disease HIV Sleeping sickness Legionellosis Psoriasis Adverse effect (medicine) Louis Pasteur Leptospirosis Prostate cancer Cystic fibrosis Obesity Luck Avian influenza
