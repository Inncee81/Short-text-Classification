how do i get rid of fleas once and for all my cat has fleas not only are they torturing her but they are all over my house yesterday i took her to the vet for a flea dip they also gave me a frontline collar that i can't put on her for a couple of days while she was out we fogged every room in the house we've been vacuuming like crazy and spraying cracks and in and under furniture and bedding however i am afraid that my cat still has some clinging to her and the cycle will begin once again what can i do to stop this everything i've read says it's nearly impossible to rid yourself of fleas and it is an on going process is there anyway to end it once and for all thanks all of you were very helpful it is an ongoing process but once you rid your cat and home of live fleas you can go into maintenance mode and should be able to prevent future outbreaks treat the cat go to your vet and get either advantage or frontline plus i went with advantage get yourself a flea comb and comb your cat at least once per day have a bucket with dish soap in it handy to dunk the comb in and to collect the hair fleas can't jump out of the slippery soap no point in combing them out only to have them jump back on your cat flush this down the toilet pour it down the sink or dispose of it away from your house treat your house options are a borate powder product or something that uses diatomaceous earth fleabusters bp fleago natural flea control bp or flea away natural flea powder de put about a tablespoon of this in your vacuum cleaner bag or you can cut up a flea collar to put in there just follow the directions which will vary by product but in general you'll sprinkle on the carpet and vacuum up and also sprinkle into cracks and crevices i chose fleago because it's less expensive than fleabusters i may also try flea away in time vacuum as often as possible before vacuuming stomp around the house this will bring the fleas to life because they'll think there's a tasty morsel out there then vacuum those little bastards up be sure to use your attachments to vacuum as many cracks and crevices as you can they love to hide out there wash any pet bedding in hot water and you'll want to be particularly diligent about vacuuming treating areas where your cat hangs out treat your yard even if your cat doesn't go outside fleas may enter your home if they exist in your yard there's a small chance that you or others may bring fleas in the house with you although this is unlikely get hold of some nematodes to spray in your yard i believe you only have to do this once per year these little creatures will eat the flea larva as one website put it these critters are too small to hug but they deserve it i had to order this online i wasn't able to find a place that sells them in my area and didn't feel like calling every place in the phonebook things not to do don't use any essential oils on your cat particularly anything with pennyroyal or eucalyptus they're toxic to cats don't use flea collars don't give your cat any garlic yeast formulations don't give your cat lemon baths you're going to want to continue treating your home as directed whether that be sprinkling once per week or once a month continue treating throughout flea season when it's warm you can stop during the winter months but start up again in the spring you'll nip them in the bud the key is to treat the environment not the cat if you do that you may never have to apply another flea product directly on them again Flea Diseases of the honeybee Coffee Bedbug Brewery Sento Upholstery Bread Cat Japanese toilet Dairy Sewage treatment Hamster Thermal power station Japanese tea ceremony Menstrual cup Autonomous building Tea Customs and etiquette of Japan Theory of conduct Equine conformation Siphon Red Hot Chili Peppers Textile manufacturing Casting Soap Solar power Vacuum cleaner Sin City Manual transmission Dry cleaning Kitchen Chicken Fecal incontinence Pebble bed reactor Mattress Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Tobacco Blood (computer game) The Amber Spyglass Carburetor Baptism RuneScape quests Tick Soap opera Mosquito Illegal drug trade John Frusciante Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Fancy rat Genericized trademark Welding Dog training Chinchilla Richard Chase Dilbert Animal Crossing Guinea pig Nuclear power City of Heroes Ecco the Dolphin Cuisine of Denmark Menstrual cycle Shaggy dog story Pet skunk Energy development Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Toilet Professional wrestling match types Vacuum USS Vestal (AR-4) Electrophysiology M16 (rifle) Water Ranma __ characters Charmed Bulk vending Linked list The Dalek Invasion of Earth Fire fighting Spidey Super Stories Tofu Characters in the Smurfs Shampoo Sulfur Knots Landing Satchel Paige Instant coffee Lumber Philosophy of space and time Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Electric motor 2000 Australian Grand Prix
