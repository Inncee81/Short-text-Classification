what to do about our neighborhood cat lady we have this lady on our block that won't get her cats spayed all three cats have a litter of kittens every time they go into heat none of the kittens ever see a vet their eyes are always crusty and noses are drippy and even worse sometimes we find them in the middle of street after they have been hit by a car our local animal control won't pick up cats because they are free roaming animals seriously that is what the animal control officer said what can we do as neighbors to get this lady to start taking care of her cats omg this makes me so angry i want to smack something contact your local humane society or cats cradle or greyfoot something similar they will trap the cats neuter them and then return them to their environment her cats are a danger to other animals if they have drippy or crusty eyes and seriously your local animal shelter is not doing their job by not picking up these animals this lady needs to have her head examined you can't change anyone else you are only responsible for your own behavior but you can trap the cats yourself and contact local vets who may be willing to do the neutering for a reduced price you will be doing those poor kitties a huge favor and you can report your do nothing neighbor to your local police as a nuisance good luck i will pray for your success Cat Kitten Dog Socialization Ferret Pet skunk Garfield Castration Manx (cat) Thermoregulation Animal shelter Puma Cuteness Domestication Pitaten Hunting Fancy rat Sin City Tenshinhan Feral Hamster Animal euthanasia Zoning Atomic Kitten Microchip implant (animal) Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Community emergency response team Veterinarian Phoebe Buffay's songs Social rule Gray Wolf Grammatical gender Dean Koontz Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Zagreus (Doctor Who audio) Catgirl Police Dragon Booster Toxoplasmosis Tobacco smoking Animal communication Waking the Dragons Piccolo Junior Saga Shen Gong Wu Great Depression Blood (computer game) Behaviorism Tokyo Mew Mew Philadelphia Eagles Fox hunting Animal Liberation Front Winning Streak Free trade Spanking The Critic Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Dog training New York Giants The Midnight Sun Felix the Cat Tick Badly Drawn Kitties Rabies Methamphetamine RuneScape quests Microeconomics B3ta First aid RKO Pictures Richard Chase Semiconductor device Girly Peter Singer Treecat Gunsmith Cats Gasoline Xiaolin Showdown Mid-levels Jam (TV series) Bubble Bobble Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, manga or movie only characters Alignment (role-playing games) Death Note 2000 Australian Grand Prix Punk ideology Azumanga Daioh Phantom cat Oh My Goddess!
