any of you ever have allergy to accutane today is my third day of accutane a day before i start i had a big bump on the area between my two eyes i went to the pool and i accidentally hit the bump on th edge of the pool it hurt and the bump got bigger yesterday before going to sleep i putted some benyolperoxide cream on it today i just woke up and i realize that my right eyelid is sweling but doesnt hurt now i wonder if it's just the bump that made that happened or if i am allergic to acutane hi i was on acutane and didn't have any problems my thoughts are that you got some of that stuff in your eye and that caused the swelling i hope for your sake u aren't allergic because that acutane stuff works great Conjunctivitis Hay fever Isotretinoin 2000 Australian Grand Prix Allergy Shaggy dog story Acne Eczema Diving Hal Trosky Tenshinhan Jackass: The Movie Jon Secada Cat Atomic Kitten Futurama (TV series - season 5) The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie R.
