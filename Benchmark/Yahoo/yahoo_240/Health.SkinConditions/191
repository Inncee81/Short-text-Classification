my months old son has water filled bulb like boils all over his head and few on his body is this chicken pox the boils are filled with some fluid and looks transparent when consulted a doctor he said it is some infection but i still doubt if it is something else he also runs temperature which reduces with a dose of paracetamal drops and is back after to hours please specify how chicken pox rashes looks like and suggest how to treat him it sounds more like chicken pox than infection the infection your doctor mentioned is likely to be impetigo which causes small blisters which spread very quickly and need treating with antibiotics and cream if your doctor thought it was infection why didn't he prescribe something for it this sounds odd to me i would change doctors he seems to have left you confused which is not doing his job if it's chicken pox which it sounds like especially the fever keep doing what you are doing and give daily warm baths with bicarbonate of soda in just buy the regular stuff you use for baking from the shop and tip plenty in the water nothing else in the water but that this eases itching soothes the pox and helps dry them out to speed up the healing process calamine lotion at other times is also good for treating the blisters apply with cotton wool dabbing gently keep an eye on him the blisters will continue to appear for a few days then will start to heal i would double check with another doctor though just to be sure that it is chicken pox and not something else find out if any other children are suffering that you have been in contact with this is the only way he will have picked it up Eczema Group A streptococcal infection Smallpox Psoriasis Chickenpox Syphilis Common cold Stomach cancer Herpes simplex virus Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Sunburn Zinc Mouth ulcer Conjunctivitis Fecal incontinence Chicken Medical prescription Carbon dioxide Dialysis Aloe Sexually-transmitted infection Allergy Scabies Otitis externa Guinea pig Tuberculosis Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Cystoscopy First aid Rocky Mountain spotted fever Chronic fatigue syndrome Breastfeeding Fancy rat Yarrow Menstrual cup Cocaine Tattoo Domestic rabbit Lyme disease Marburg virus Dairy Doxepin Chocolate Manicure Osteoarthritis Gonorrhoea Chlorpromazine Traumatic brain injury Diarrhea Escherichia coli O157:H7 Water purification Gout Sauna Textile manufacturing Traditional Chinese medicine Pneumonia Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Social rule Omega-3 fatty acid Anthrax Hay fever Hyperthermia Mattress Electrophysiology Hypothermia Onion Hydrochloric acid Lupus erythematosus Urticaria Ice cream Boom Town (Doctor Who) Sento Thermal power station Massage Antibiotic Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Asthma Folic acid Vitamin C Al-Razi Homeopathy 28 Days Later Cephalexin Candidiasis Hard water Childbirth Agar plate Diving Hydrotherapy Insomnia Cirrhosis
