i pick at my zits constantly which causes scaps why can i not resist the temptation of letting them heal i don't know but i had the same problem i just got so self conscious of red spots all over that i made myself stop quite difficult actually just don't look at yourself when you go to take a shower or wash your hands etc try this for one week do not pick at your face unless there is an obvious white zit in which case you may pop but only that nothing else make sure to wash with soap in shower exfoliate and moisturize you'd be surprised how much your face will heal in a week maybe then you'll get some incentive to stop picking it worked for me d Acne Psoriasis Social rule Soap Milton H.
