why do insect bites feel better after you itch them i have been bitten a few times over the last couple of days on my ankles and feet why oh why is it such a relief when you actually itch them although after a while they itch even more insects pump chemicals into the skin to stop us reacting to them as they pump away our blood part of the chemical stops the blood clotting the other numbs the spot down to prevent us swotting the insect as it feeds i am talking about bites from insects midges gnats mosquitoes flies fleas mites ticks and bedbugs as opposed to stings wasps bees and hornets the sting is due to venom like a poison which the insect 'injects' into the skin you may not notice the bite although some insect bites can be quite painful particularly from a horsefly however saliva from the insect can cause a skin reaction a weal which is like a small fluid filled lump and is very itchy it may develop immediately after being bitten a weal lasts about two hours but is often followed by a small itchy solid lump papule which develops up to hours later this can last for several days before fading away these lumps occur when our body attacks this saliva and that causes the itching to start when you scratch you spread the chemicals away from the bite under your skin and they numb new areas of skin before being attacked again by our body but now you have spread the chemicals to a wider area so its more intense also the act of touching reduces the signals reaching the brain about that region of skin touch uses the same system of nerves and the brain now has two different sources to play with thus the itching is also reduced as the brain cumilates the data once you stop touching the spot the brain is free to concentrate back on the sole source of data comming in from your nerve ends of the skin that was bitten occasionally a skin infection develops following a bite particularly if you scratch a lot which can damage the skin and allow bacteria germs to get in infection causes redness and tenderness around the bite this may gradually spread and sometimes can become serious antihistamines tablets may be useful if you have lots of bites you can buy these at pharmacies or get them on prescription antihistamines block the action of histamine this is a chemical which is released in sites of skin reactions and contributes to the itch and inflammation individual bites can be treated with crotamiton ointment which you can buy at pharmacies is soothing when rubbed onto itchy skin a steroid cream may be useful to reduce any inflammation for example hydrocortisone which you can buy at pharmacies or get on prescription a doctor may prescribe a stronger steroid cream in some cases Itch Spider Acne Hay fever Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Scabies Group A streptococcal infection Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stomach cancer Intravenous therapy Hematophagy Rocky Mountain spotted fever Chronic fatigue syndrome Rosacea Asthma Gout Urinary incontinence Puberty Pneumonia Pain Insulin Prostate cancer First aid Wound healing phases Mast cell Medical prescription Stroke Bedbug Multiple sclerosis Malaria Tattoo Local anesthesia Carpal tunnel syndrome Cancer Common cold Autoimmune diseases Fecal incontinence Fertility awareness Cocaine Radiation therapy Mastocytosis Paracetamol Homeopathy Cellulitis Chlorpromazine Glucocorticoid Methamphetamine Tick Inflammation Decompression sickness Poison Fibromyalgia Rabies Urticaria Enzyme Epidural Breastfeeding Histamine Insect Gypsy moth Angioedema Eye Massage Lupus erythematosus Folic acid Tarantula Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Migraine Biological pest control Clinical depression Doxepin Scar Honeybee Heartworm Medical analysis of circumcision Onchocerciasis Anthrax Otitis externa Herpes zoster Medicine Herpes simplex virus Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Tocopherol Antihistamine Fancy rat Diabetes mellitus
