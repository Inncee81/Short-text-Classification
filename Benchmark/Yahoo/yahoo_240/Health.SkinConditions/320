how long does it take for a nd degree burn to heal and will there be scarring a few days ago i got a nd degree burn on my stomach about the size of my palm i have been using antibiotic ointment and changing the bandages everyday but i was wondering how long typically does this take to heal there are no longer any blisters just the top layer of skin is gone i was also wondering if there will be any scars and what can i do to treat that and if i can start doing that now i'm will age play in my favor and hopefully it will be minimal scarring the docters did not say whether or not to use silver silvadene i did however use it immediately after i got the burn should i continue using that any help would be greatly appreciated thanks so much keep using the silvadene it should heal in about days to weeks it should not scare but will probably have red skin on the healed area for a little while that's all good luck Acne Psoriasis Scar Sunburn Skin Ulcer Scarification Aloe Wound healing phases Pneumonia Mouth ulcer Earring Tattoo Helicobacter pylori Wart Radiation therapy Eczema Sperm Whale Burn (injury) Herpes simplex virus Witchcraft Group A streptococcal infection Conjunctivitis Intersex surgery Cellulitis Tuberculosis First aid Keloid Wound Healing Syphilis Mattress Penis enlargement Malignant melanoma Action potential Bruise Antibiotic Body piercing Suture Fecal incontinence Anthrax Dialysis Tyrannosaurus rex Stomach cancer Smoke-screen Cirrhosis Tocopherol Peptic ulcer Leaf Skin graft Dracunculiasis Diving suit Red Hot Chili Peppers Knife Hiking Deadpool Characters of Naruto Burning Man First aid kit Piccolo Junior Saga Rosacea Physical attractiveness Dobermann Hair Church of Christ, Scientist Orthopedic surgery Pok__mon Gold and Silver Wolverine (comics) Lymphogranuloma venereum Massage Babe Ruth John Frusciante Use of poison gas in World War I Adjustable gastric band Pain Althaea (genus) Reiki Flagellation Chalazion Silver Onion Cornea transplant Wolfrider Billboard Hot 100 Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sauna The Empty Child Smallpox Baseball Wild ARMs 2 Breast reduction LASIK Bone marrow transplant The Wonderful Wizard of Oz Photorefractive keratectomy Sub-Zero Table tennis Swimming Gliding
