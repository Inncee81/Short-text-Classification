how can you have two kids a housewife a new house and no job i am just curious as to any opinions as to how my brother is making his living he is and going to anesthesia school for the past years he has been in school and it is just to be an nurse who administers anesthesia he has two kids a wife who is a stay at home mom a car payment a house payment and all the house expenses he is currently unemployed so he has to pay his own insurance my mother says he has a 'cost of living' loan through the school that is only available to students is there really such thing i just don't see how this is possible to have a family and no income three possibilities he is selling drugs or has some other illegal business that he is hiding from his family wife may have money from her family whether it is inheritence personal savings etc cost of living is common to add to your loan especially for graduate work however there is this proverb when figuring out how much to borrow which sounds like your brother ignored live like a doctor in med school and you will live like a student when you are a doctor granted your brother is only going into nursing but the logic still applies he probably expects to make a lot of money nurse anethestists can earn and may be borrowing more than he needs assuming he will be rich enough to pay back when he earns that kind of money it is quite common for doctors and other professionals lawyers nurses engineers etc to live like they are already rich when they are in graduate school only to leave school with k in debt bad idea especially when you get out of med school and realize you aren't cut out to be a doctor or fail the bar as a lawyer etc Student loan Insurance Mortgage Unemployment benefit Life insurance Graduate school Health insurance Unemployment Personal finance Freeters Social Security (United States) 401(k) Microeconomics Lawyer Tax FairTax Taxation in the United States Capital accumulation Debt Education in the United States EastEnders Inflation Credit card Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Predatory lending Capitalism Juris Doctor Deficit spending Bond Medicine Money Warren Buffett Social Security debate (United States) Primerica Financial Services Knots Landing Education in the People's Republic of China Health care in the United States Microcredit Divorce Gross domestic product Great Teacher Onizuka Medicare (Canada) Economy of the United States Islamic banking Social Credit Publicly funded medicine Professor Subsidy National Kidney Foundation Singapore Babylonian law George W.
