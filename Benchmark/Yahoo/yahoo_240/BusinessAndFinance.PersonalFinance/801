we always have bills and stuff when is the point where you just get what you want and just buy what you want i want a motorcycle rd car and flat screen tv i don't want them all at once or anything but everytime i go to buy one either with cash or credit my family always comes up with the wow that's a lot of money you should save it etc etc everyone else around me seems to have no problem i have the money and or credit what should i do a good question to ask yourself is why do you want these things it isn't that you need them because there are very few people that actually need cars or a flat screen you should start paying off your bills for what you already have and save up for what you'll need in the future most everyone has to make decisions when it comes to spending sometimes you give up a few lattes in the morning to save for something more important or valuable to you also you should be thinking about the future not just living for the next purchase do you have a retirement fund an emergency cash fund or any savings that may bring you through tough times it would be a shame if all those purchases you made were repo'd because you had an emergency medical bill to pay for Personal finance Money Publicly funded medicine Monetary policy Microeconomics Internet fraud Mutual fund Money supply Health insurance Flat tax Gross domestic product FairTax Capitalism Great Depression Life insurance Poker jargon Bond PE ratio Inflation $ale of the Century Deflation (economics) Say's law Repurchase agreement Financial markets Wheel of Fortune Finance Hyperinflation Arthur Laffer The Amazing Race Economics Enron Corporation Keynesian economics Mortgage Annuity Public policy Bank Supply and demand Live 8 Electronic money Capital accumulation Stock Marshall Plan Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Surveillance Credit card Social Security (United States) Theory of conduct Commodity Institutional fund management MapleStory Citigroup EFTPOS Campaign finance reform U.S. public debt Short selling Debt W.
