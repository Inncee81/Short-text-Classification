a canvasser came to my door the other day and took my wife's bank details to set up a direct debit i know she shouldn't have given her bank details but i can't really see what anyone can do with an account number and sort code my bank is very secure and asks me loads of security questions for all transactions so just what do people do with these details if you are in the uk it is most likely a legitimate canvasser charities do this all the time and they usually outsource the canvassing to registered companies that are governed by legislation it is quite common the canvassers often get dropped of by a bus and buzz round a whole area in the space of a day they usually have id photo cards and leave a carbon copy of the direct debit mandate and there is always full contact details including address phone no etc and you have the opportunity to cancel the dd at any point even before a st collection it would be rather drastic to cancel your bank account going by the info you gave in your question all that said there is no harm in being careful if all the above mentioned applied when your wife had the canvasser round then it should be fine and can be easily cancelled if required if this was not the case and you have not been left valid contact info then certainly it would be worthwhile taking a few precautions Credit card Internet fraud Surveillance Password SmartRider EFTPOS Data retention Plame affair CPU cache Automatic teller machine Advance fee fraud Identity theft Phishing Tax Octopus card Medical prescription Wheel of Fortune Copy protection British national identity card Theory of conduct Stopping e-mail abuse Bank United States Postal Service Atari 8-bit family Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Driver's license Extreme Programming Identity document MetroCard Social rule Political campaign Canvassing X86 assembly language Gmail Microeconomics Census Mail fraud Monopoly (game) George W.
