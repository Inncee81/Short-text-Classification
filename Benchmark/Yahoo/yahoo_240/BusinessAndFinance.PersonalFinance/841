recently received credit card change in terms what if i decline i got in the mail yesterday a letter stating some of my credit card fees are going up it also says i can decline these and close my account then it says i can pay off my account at the current terms my question is how does this affect my credit score and report if i choose to decline pj thats so true i didnt think of it that way i'm trying to pay off all my cards and i was just wondering if declining and canceling the card was an easier way to go since the offer is there but so far it seems not since i have had this card the longest i think i will just pay it off and keep it open thats the best thing to do right your credit score might take a small hit closing the account will decrease your available credit which might cause your debt to available credit ratio to increase if you've had the card for an extended time you will lose that history however your score should quickly rebound Credit card Credit score Bank Student loan Neopets Bond Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Social Security (United States) Monty Hall problem Debt Mortgage Wheel of Fortune Citigroup Batting average Ford Motor Company Beatmania IIDX Contract bridge Life insurance Spam (electronic) Personal finance Mail Mutual fund Insurance Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Double-entry book-keeping Unemployment benefit Credit card fraud SAT Boston Red Sox Article One of the United States Constitution Pump It Up Billboard Hot 100 Baccarat Internet fraud Betting (poker) Economy of Russia Economy of Chile $ale of the Century Minimum wage Blackjack Xbox Live Microeconomics Annuity EFTPOS Futures contract Government debt Octopus card Topps Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Sears Holdings Corporation International League Euro Poker jargon Craps Law of value New York Giants Primerica Financial Services M16 (rifle) Voter turnout Phishing Debt consolidation Social Security debate (United States) Temasek Holdings Animal Crossing Kyoto Protocol Surveillance Babe Ruth Financial services United States Postal Service Interest Identity theft Oakland Athletics U.S. public debt Floppy disk E-mail Finance Mainframe computer Arthur Laffer America Online Bretton Woods system Capitalism Schabir Shaik Trial Stamp collecting The Amazing Race Table tennis FairTax New York Knicks Prisoner's dilemma Frequent flyer program Legal tender Slot machine Credit history World Series Advance fee fraud Monetary policy Economy of Sri Lanka Chicago Cubs Deflation (economics) Micropayment H-1B visa
