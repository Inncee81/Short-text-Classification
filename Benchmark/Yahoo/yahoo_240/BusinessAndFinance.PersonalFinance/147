my spouse and i disagree about money all the time we think really different and we both have valid pionts we both work hard one of us buys things sales them then buys more things to sale one of us works hours a week i am the one who works i am tired of them taking chances with the money we are and own car that was given to us i don't know what to do one of you likes to have feet firmly on the ground rooted in practicality and the other dreams of potential success head in the clouds can you compromise by agreeing a budget limit for stock purchase and if the resale is successful some of the profits say or whatever figure you agree would be put aside and saved selling something you get your money back with a bit of profit so the business could continue to grow on the investment capital plus that other you'd have to factor in overheads like rent advertising electricity and other expenses but you get the idea and if the resale isn't great at least everything has not been lost i have been in shoes like yours my husband was a dreamer always one scheme or another and i was the practical one we aren't together any more but i am still working hard and getting somewhere he is still reaching for that pie in the sky but he is happy doing so if you try to change your spouse it won't work that person is the way he or she is the personality you were attracted to first hopefully you can find a way to meet everybody's needs good luck Insurance Gross domestic product Annuity Mutual fund Mergers and acquisitions Illegal drug trade Surplus value Divorce Capital accumulation Warren Buffett Supply and demand Great Depression Economics Capitalism Tesco Marriage Wal-Mart Inflation Monopoly (game) Blackjack Life insurance Corporation Security (finance) Hyperinflation Internet fraud Keynesian economics Arbitrage Investment bank FairTax Short selling Contract Law of value $ale of the Century Neopets Shaggy dog story Price discrimination Economic inequality Deflation (economics) Knots Landing Social Security debate (United States) First-sale doctrine Spice Girls Electronic commerce Therion (band) Supply-side economics American individualist anarchism Gold standard British monarchy Monetary policy James T.
