any body knows someting about forex i want to invest some money and someone talk to me about forex do you have experience on this matter thanks investing in the forex market is quite a risky venture there are all sorts of companies out there trying to sell you software that claims to be able to predict foreign currency appreciation depreciation in my opinion those programs are complete garbage imagine there are people and huge companies that specialize in trading currencies for their own portfolios that risk million dollars to make a mere in one day but that could also be a loss of or much more also they have much better understanding than a lowly investor such as you or me therefore they will more often be on the winning side of a currency trade thus putting you on the losing end you want advice if you are interested in investing some money forex is not the place to begin as a beginner i would invest in mutual funds or individual stocks with solid fundamentals fundamentals you ask if you don't know what fundamentals are to a stock then that says you don't have much experience go for mutual funds Foreign exchange market Mutual fund Bond Asian financial crisis Short selling Hedge fund Exchange rate Arbitrage United States dollar Economy of Russia Investment bank Bretton Woods system PE ratio Insurance Gold as an investment Financial markets Euro Microeconomics Corporate finance Ponzi scheme Monetary policy Mad Money Venture capital Derivative (finance) Citigroup Closed-end fund Equity investment Capital asset pricing model Security (finance) Stock market index Economy of India Stock Supply-side economics Institutional fund management Software patent debate Income trust Hyperinflation Corporation Enron Corporation Keynesian economics George Soros Eugene Fama Investment Capitalism Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Financial services Warren Buffett Modern portfolio theory Chartered Financial Analyst Gold standard Exchange-traded fund Intellectual property Goldman Sachs Pound sterling Economy of Chile Mergers and acquisitions Behavioral finance Temasek Holdings Interest Privatization Deflation (economics) John Maynard Keynes Japan-United States relations Government debt Day trading Microcredit Economy of Nigeria Monetarism Toronto-Dominion Bank Marshall Plan Free trade Economy of Argentina Fiat money Inflation Stock broker Wall Street Crash of 1929 Economy of South Africa Economy of Venezuela Technical analysis Renminbi American International Group Argentine Currency Board Eliot Spitzer Supply and demand Speculation Lehman Brothers Economy of Pakistan Economy of Kuwait Long-Term Capital Management Yield curve Money Anarcho-capitalism
