anyone still going ahead with bank charges claiming back your bank charges after the banks went to the oft yes its still worth claiming your charges back in the case that the oft win its also very important that you do it now if you want to the reason for this is that you can claim back years currently under the statuate of limitiations if you wait until the results of the test case and then appeals etc which could be up to years away then you could only claim back to august however if you just send a single letter asking for charges back by recorded delivery to the bank now it will lock the date of you claim so no matter how long it takes for the test case to resolve you will still be able to claim back to august and won't lose years worth of charges which could be claimed if the worst comes to the worst and the banks win all you ve lost is the cost of stamp so its definately worthwhile doing it also means that if the oft win as you're claim is already in the system your claim will be dealt with quicker although i would normally advise people to get a total of their charges first and then write to the bank asking for your charges back because of the time this takes days i would do it the other way round first write to the bank asking for your charges back putting no figure in the letter and then you can write to the bank asking for your charges or copies of your statements for the last years which they still have to provide for more advice template letters and step by step guides have a look at my web site below the site is free to use Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act United States Postal Service Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Mail SCO-Linux controversies Password Web crawler Gettysburg Address Internet fraud Domain Name System Open access Poker jargon Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Baccarat Hyperinflation Alex Ferguson Appeal Postage stamp Financial audit CPU design Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.
