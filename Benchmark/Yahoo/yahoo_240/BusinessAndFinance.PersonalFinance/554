what action can be taken to alert people that there are scammers who ask women to cash chase travelers checks there are people on yahoo personals and i happen to chat with one and they get you in their confidences and later ask you for a favor because they are starting a new business in your state then they offer to give you money for cashing checks and the checks are bogus this is being done from benin possibly and they prey on women who want to help others the people online are actually college students and not aware of what damage they are doing to people as they have to cover these bogus checks they have cashed at their banks maybe all bank tellers need a short course on identifying these famliliar looking travelers checks maybe the law enforcement should have some safety tips posted on line about making money transactions even on dating sites a list of questions needs to be made on the yahoo personals site and any other site where women and men meet this is more common than you think the cashing of these bogus checks ok bank tellers are given extensive training on how to identify counterfit checks and travelers checks and cash the problem is that the fakes are so good now that it is hard to know if something is fake or not to compound matters the public expects tellers to be able to spot and stop fake checks on the spot and that is just not the case if people would stop doing stupid things like washing their money and paychecks it would be easier to tell the differance between counterfit and just worn also i am not sure if you are personally aware but there are about companies that provide banks with travelers checks so it is not possible to know the security features for all checks it is just not as for the other part of this statment anyone who is offered a money in exchange for cashing money should know it is a scam or at least illegal it the travelers checks are not fake then this is till money laundering money for nothing unsolicited is the biggest scam out there right now i feel the public has been well informed but i still get customers a shift who won the lottery and when you tell them they have been scamed they get mad when you put a hold on the check that doesn't even cover the time it takes for the check to come back fake because the government doesn't allow for more than days and it takes the average fake check days to come back the customers are livid so i think the burden falls on the public to be aware that money for nothing scams are not legit stay back and don't bite Internet fraud Advance fee fraud Bank fraud Confidence trick Surveillance RuneScape cheats Automatic teller machine Credit card Bank Phishing Social rule Enron Corporation Charles Ponzi Bank of China (Hong Kong) Spam (electronic) MapleStory Contract Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Poker jargon Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus FairTax E-mail Money laundering Short selling Cheque The Amazing Race Life insurance Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Mail-order bride Citigroup Microeconomics Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation United States Postal Service Mail fraud Mutual fund Theory of conduct Electronic money Monetary policy Password Security (finance) EFTPOS Betting (poker) Pyramid scheme Craps Deflation (economics) Money supply Insurance Neopets Hyperinflation Finance Gambling Debit card Sin City Futurama (TV series - season 3) Investment bank Ocean's Twelve Keynesian economics Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Inflation Financial audit Google Paintball Legal research Slot machine Lawyer Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina E-mail spam Identity theft Fiat money Financial markets Pok__mon Chronicles Anonymity Tax British House of Commons Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Arbitrage Jeff Gannon Ice hockey Gold standard Tom DeLay Katelyn Faber Octopus card Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Young Ones (TV series) Parachuting Enterprise content management The Price Is Right Blog Mad Money Medical prescription Notary public
