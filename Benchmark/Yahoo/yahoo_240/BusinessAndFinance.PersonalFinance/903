how long should i wait for pay back or should i i am not married i started dating this guy and at the beginning all was great but then he needed something and i would spot him till he got his check it of course snowballed on me because he paid promptly at first but then the 'need this' started out weighing the pay backs i would give him a lil mini 'statement' when i got my bill just as a reminder that he owed me but time past and i still have this on my card it's not that i can't pay my payments but the interest is adding up and every time i mention it he makes it like it's a personal attack he has been laid off from a couple of jobs since then but he now has a good paying job and makes more than x of what i make but he still never has money what's making me go off the deep end is that he's telling me about how he's starting to give his mom every pay check just spending time around him and not getting my but having to listen to him talk about going elsewhere with out a thought of me is killing me just ask for your money back and get another boyfriend he is only using you life is not for suffering you do not need suffering in your life there are millions humans in the world sure you can find a boyfriend who pays his own bills Kodocha Ocean's Twelve Knots Landing Internet fraud Friends FairTax Badly Drawn Kitties The Amazing Race Cheque Social Security (United States) Avenue Q St. Elmo's Fire (film) Phoebe Halliwell Schabir Shaik Trial Freeters U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 One Tree Hill (TV series) Advance fee fraud Bond Paige Matthews Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) RuneScape quests Economy of the United States Fancy Crane EastEnders Social rule Credit score United Kingdom corporation tax Great Depression Kim Possible: So the Drama Charles Ponzi Money Fred Phelps Grant Morrison Miss Saigon Laura Schlessinger Alcoholics Anonymous Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March 1957 World Series Pitaten Abramoff-Reed Indian Gambling Scandal The Ashlee Simpson Show Royal Assent Satchel Paige Great Teacher Onizuka Tax New York Giants George Costanza Tom DeLay Warren Buffett Poker jargon Annuity Charmed Futurama (TV series - season 2) Humphrey Bogart Piccolo Junior Saga Betting (poker) Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Child support Flat tax Kill Bill Fight Club Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution Marshall Plan Philip J.
