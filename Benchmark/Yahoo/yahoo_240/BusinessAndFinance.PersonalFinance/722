does anyone know what liability financial corporations have when posting cheques to you if a cheque is never received does the financial institution that allegedly posted it have any sort of responsibility duty of care to ensure that it is safeguarded if posting a cheque is not a secure method then why would they do this if anyone can point me in the direction of any sort of legal stuff on this would be most appreciated thanks thanks the cheque has been cashed not by me is high value k and the police are not interested in the least as they don't believe a crime has been committed because the institution that posted it are not filing the complaint mad isn't it am not sure where to turn next i'm an american we inherited most of our laws in this area from britian since drafts on banks and trade houses pre date the founding over here the safeguard is on the cashing end not the posting mailing of the cheque the bank or firm that takes a checue in guarantees to the maker of the cheque that they did cash it for the correct person so what happens when a cheque is lost in the post or stolen out of the post is that the person who was to receive it you complains to the sending party that it never arrived and the sending party then looks to see if it was cashed etc eventually they conclude it is lost cancel it which may require a bit of signed paper from you and write a replacement cheque for high value transactions the usual means of transmission is via wire transfer directly from bank to bank this isn't done as a routine measure because the bank charges can easily be pounds or more btw if the 'lost' cheque has been cashed but it wasn't cashed by the correct person you you'll likely be required to fill out a police report called an affidavit of forgery over here which the cheque's writer then sends in to his bank and results in the cheque being sent back to the firm that cashed it for them to try and recover their money from the crook as you'll guess this is time consuming you'll also not get a replacement cheque issued until after you've filled out and returned the affidavit at least here in the us you won't gl Cheque Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Bank fraud Credit card Money Surveillance Euro Bank Automatic teller machine Corporate governance Identity theft EFTPOS Internet fraud Annuity 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines United States Postal Service Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act United Kingdom corporation tax Microeconomics Economy of Russia Confidence trick Appeal Insurance Tax Mergers and acquisitions Corporation Schabir Shaik Trial Money supply Winning Streak Mail fraud Legal tender FairTax Wheel of Fortune Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act American Express Contract Security (finance) Bond Financial audit Monetary policy Password Poker jargon Guantanamo Bay Terri Schiavo Mortgage Enron Corporation Medical prescription Tom DeLay Fractional-reserve banking Derivative (finance) Citigroup Mensal__o scandal Stock World Bank Group John C.
