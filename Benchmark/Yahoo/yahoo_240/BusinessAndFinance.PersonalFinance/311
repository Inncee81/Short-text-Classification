can you get out of a work contract without a legit reason i signed a two year contract at my work a couple months after i got married it was really low pay and an hour away from home but since my husband made plenty of money for the two of us i figured we'd be fine i needed the experience it's now a year and months later i'm divorced making this crappy pay i didn't really get any money out of the divorce since we were only married a year or so i still live an hour away and now i'm not fine financially can i get out of my contract due to my marital circumstances changing i would have never taken this job making so little money and so far away from home had i been single and not counting on my husband's income to supplement mine local law might be very different on this issue also depend greatly on the wording in the contract my suggestion is that you take the paper work to your local non for profit legal advice council http forum freeadvice com best wishes Divorce Marriage Contract Insurance Inflation Same-sex marriage in Canada Babe Ruth Microeconomics Gambling Euro Same-sex marriage Polyamory Estoppel Economic inequality Women in Islam Tax Lawrence v.
