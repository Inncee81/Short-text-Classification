i am thinking of getting a loan from my k but does it make sense i recently took out a loan from my bank at intrest and got to thinking if it would make sense to borrow the pay off of the loan and pay intrest back to myself my k is preforming at a little over and a k loan goes at a fee so is it really saving making an extra on my k i really don't think a loan from your k is a good idea for this situation i don't know how much you make but i'm guessing that the loan probably won't take more than a few months to pay off although seems like a better deal than that fee doesn't help you for a loan that's so small that fee is equivalent to adding several percent to your rate because of that the rates are a lot closer than they seem taking money out of your k means it won't be accumulating any earnings until you put the money back not only are you missing out on the earnings you're having to pay back your k with after tax money you're not earning an extra because you're paying with your own money earnings are the money that your investments make not the extra money you invest if you want to put more money into your k you should increase the amount deducted from your pay that way it will be pre tax money going in not the after tax money you'd be putting in from the loan payments those after tax loan payments would again be taxed when you withdraw them in retirement why would you want to be taxed on the money twice the only time i could recommend a k loan is in the case of a medical emergency for which there is no other way to pay in every other situation you are better off leaving the money invested just pay back your bank loan as quickly as possible then do your best to avoid having to take out more loans in the future Insurance Bond Bank 401(k) Life insurance Social Security (United States) Credit card Money Student loan Annuity Capital accumulation Deflation (economics) Mortgage Inflation Flat tax Hyperinflation Personal finance Mutual fund Supply-side economics Debt Tax Primerica Financial Services Interest United Kingdom corporation tax FairTax Social Security debate (United States) Islamic banking Anarchism and capitalism Capitalism Microcredit Taxation in the United States Economy of Russia Bretton Woods system Microeconomics Variable universal life insurance Bank fraud Warren Buffett Keynesian economics Security (finance) Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Savings and loan association Unemployment benefit Tertiary education fees in Australia Derivative (finance) Gross domestic product Government debt Economy of the United States Advance fee fraud Surplus value Ponzi scheme Short selling Progressive tax Productive and unproductive labour Dividend Federal Reserve Gold standard Cost of capital Income trust Reaganomics Economy of Africa Marshall Plan Money creation Donald Trump Minimum wage Economy of India Deficit spending Investment Islamic economics Micropayment Monetary policy History of the United States (1918-1945) Poker jargon Economy of Pakistan Betting (poker) CPU cache PE ratio Mergers and acquisitions Finance Profit Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Leeds United F.C.
