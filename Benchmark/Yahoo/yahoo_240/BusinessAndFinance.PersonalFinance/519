what did you do to achieve your goals i would like to ask a question to all people who have their own place plenty of money a car especially the car lol most of all freedom i'm years old i always feel like i'm struggling to make ends meet although i have two wonderful jobs that both offers excellent wages hours it just doesn't feel like it's enough without sounding too pitiful a few of my most desired goals in the whole world is to finally escape from my family find a place of my own to stay preferably in a new town where i can begin a new life for myself i also desire lots of money new friends a car freedom but it all costs a lot of money unfortunately i am still teaching myself about financial matters as my parents stupidly never taught me about the responsibilities of money as a child now i'm paying for their mistake have you ever felt like you were trapped helpless then one day you finally succeeded in breaking free if so what did you do because i need help highland i think you bought up a great question most of our parents and most if not all of our schools do not teach us the essentials of finance they just give us chores or assignments to do that does not even deal with real life i was in your exact same position when i was around your age it all changed one day that day was when i discovered a book title think and grow rich i read it ferverously and i started to take action taking action is the first step to breaking free it is the cornerstone of my success and failures most people read books and they may know how a deal works but they never took action i use to do that i was on the sidelines for the most part of my life until i decided to take action the next step is abc if you have seen glengarry glen ross you know what i mean abc is always be closing that is the mindset you need to have in order to be successful in business you have to treat every financial negogiation or deal like it is your last the last step is your willingness to learn learn everything from the stock market to real estate i remember when i use to hate real estate it felt like everyone was in it and i didn't want to be like everyone else it all changed when i found how lucrative it can be by investing in abandoned code violated and condemned properties the rest was history all i can say is that you have to find what you truly love is it really the money recognition or new friends that you need you need to reevaluate your life i think that everyone aorund your age feels the exact same way is this it is this what life is you must ask yourself the very basic questions before you can delve into all of the stuff i said above charlie ps carpe diem Microeconomics Warren Buffett EastEnders Pitaten Keynesian economics The Apprentice 2 Insurance Education in the People's Republic of China Avenue Q Economic inequality Supply and demand Extreme Programming Days of our Lives Free trade Personal finance Theory of conduct Economics Ten Commandments Blackjack Volleyball New Deal The Amber Spyglass W.I.T.C.H.
