help have to make okay look i know i keep asking but i need to make i have to buy back to school clothes and my mom will not give me money i'm somehow i think that if you actually needed the clothes your mom would be more then willing to buy them for you what i see happening here is the beginning of some really poor spending habits it starts out slow then blooms into some serious debt but you do want some new clothes for school good i support that here's what you need to do it will impress your mom and get you well on the way to a secure financial future drop the requirement for worth of clothes no one really believes that it is a true need of the worth of clothes that you want select a few items that would make the most difference keep the amount you need below preferably below approach your mom your neighbors your aunts uncles etc ask for jobs that will pay some money get for washing a car for mowing a lawn etc when you have earned enough to pay for the clothes that you have selected and a few dollars more do these two things first ask your mom or dad to drive you to their bank so that you can open up an account put the money you earned over and above in the account ex if you needed but earned put the extra in the bank second ask your mom to drive you to the store so that you can buy your own special clothes for school now i can't guarantee anything but most parents are very proud and impressed when their children do things in a mature and responsible manner i would not be surprised if you mom decided to pay for some of your clothes herself if she does put the rest of the money in the bank right away by doing that you have learned two very valuable lessons one is that money costs you parents do not get money for doing nothing they work for it how many hours do you think your parents have to be at work for that second you have learned that every time you earn some money there are rewards for putting some of it away right away that money in the bank will earn interest and grow over time if you continue to put money in or at a time when you are you will have enough to make a down payment on a house or buy a new car without having to finance it best of luck Bond Money Insurance Islamic banking Capital accumulation Money supply Credit card Great Depression Microeconomics Inflation Monetary policy FairTax Bank Debt Life insurance Gold standard Deflation (economics) Student loan Poker jargon Stock Wheel of Fortune MMORPG Hyperinflation Social Security (United States) Commodity markets Capitalism Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) U.S. public debt Bretton Woods system Mortgage Estoppel Government debt Internet fraud Divorce The Amazing Race Annuity Electronic commerce Small business Social Credit Interest Gross domestic product Arbitrage Mutual fund American individualist anarchism Short selling Opportunity cost Tax Asian financial crisis Corporate finance Married... with Children Child support United States dollar Wealth Corporation Economic inequality Taxation in the United States Federal Reserve Economy of Russia Health insurance Graduate school Social Security debate (United States) Education in the United States National Kidney Foundation Singapore Marshall Plan Education in the People's Republic of China Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Anarchism and capitalism Sears Holdings Corporation The Adventures of Pete & Pete Monopoly (game) Enron Corporation Donald Trump About a Boy Finance Ocean's Twelve Investment bank Japanese tea ceremony Warren Buffett Craps Yield curve Clothing Pound sterling CPU cache Knots Landing Financial markets Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 401(k) Financial services PE ratio Campaign finance reform Flat tax Betting (poker)
