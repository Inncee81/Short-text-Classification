boy i have to babysit today for a boy and i think that he is years old but since i'm an only child and a teenager i don't have toys for little kids so what are some things i could entertain him with i have a trampoline what are games we could play outside thank you soooo much the thing is the town i live in is kinda lame we don't have a dollar store and we don't have an outdoor pool we have an indoor one but ya and it will only be for about an hour and my tramp has a net on it and ya i would rather not leave my house i wouldn't put an year old boy on a trampoline with no adults around unless it's got one of those safety net things playing outside is great for year old boys they like dirt and you could always encourage him to bring some of his favorite toys to share with you and if you act amazed and surprised about what he brings he will be even more enthusiastic to share his things with you which will make him easy to watch Tag Theory of conduct Swimming pool Fat Man and Little Boy (Simpsons) The Fairly OddParents Hiking Toy train About a Boy Cranford, New Jersey Toy Story Contemporary culture of South Korea Softball Indoor football Boy Meets World Jackass: The Movie Toy Volleyball Time Out of Mind Bicycle Our Gang Trampoline Krusty the Clown Canada at the 2004 Summer Olympics Trailer Park Boys One Tree Hill (TV series) Billiards Beavis and Butt-head Care Bears Milton H.
