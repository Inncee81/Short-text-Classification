do you think its okay for year olds to wear heavy perfume makeup and grown up clothes i am asking this question on behalf of my almost year old step daughter she thinks her father and i are just being mean over at her mom's house her mom lets her wear revealing clothes and makeup eyeshadow mascara and lipstick i don't mean gloss her mom also lets her wear and bring home heavily perfumed body washes shampoo powders and perfume itself my step daughter is fighting us on this because she thinks its okay my husband and i keep trying to tell her its okay once in a while but not for everyday at her age more for dress up she says were just mean and other parents wouldn't think this way even though none of her friends dress this way or wear makeup and perfume any thoughts either way before i choose a best answer i would like to thank everyone for their oppinions while i agree with some and don't agree with others all are appreciated i think seeing these answers really opened my daughters eyes and to those of you who don't find anything wrong with it god help you when you have kids a year old should definitely not being wearing heavy perfume makeup and grown up clothes i think it's a real problem and her mom is completely irresponsible to encourage her to dress in this way kids already grow up too fast now and are exposed to things they shouldn't even know about in the community i live in there is a girl who started wearing revealing tight clothes had her hair high lighted and acted like a teenager when she was in rd grade she's now going into th grade she's sexually active and often seen walking around with groups of boys since your step daughter's mom obviously has no sense then it's up to you and your husband to keep her from this kind of behavior when she is with you if possible then your husband should discuss this issue with his ex and let her know how strongly he feels about it and why he feels that way i have a feeling she won't listen to him but it's worth a try in the mean time just be sensible stick to your rules and explain to her why you don't allow it and let her know there is no compromising on this issue Calvin and Hobbes Theory of conduct Clothing Jennifer Lopez Laura Schlessinger Recurring South Park characters Hijab Milton H.
