year old my little sister lies about everything what people say do what happened my mom and dad are denile and say im lying to get her in trouble what do i tell my parents i keep getting in trouble for things i didnt do because of her she doesnt play with barbies or bratz try sitting down and talking to your little sister maybe she's trying to get attention of some sort and this is just a inconvenient effort to do so years old is by far old enough to understand that lying is wrong explain to her that you love her very much and it hurts your feelings when she says things that aren't true about you ask her how she would feel if you said things that weren't true about her ask her if you've done something to upset her and also remind her that 'big girls' don't lie most importantly set a good example treat her nicely spend time with her as her older sister you play a very important role in her life it sucks that your parents don't want to help you with this but if she continues to do it just try not to overreact and get defensive remember that she's only years old and it's surely a phase that will pass calmly reassure your parents that what she's saying is a fib but i think if you just keep chatting with her about it the problem should fix itself Theory of conduct Social rule Shaggy dog story Humphrey Bogart Avenue Q Transactional analysis About a Boy Philosophical skepticism Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Pok__mon Live!
