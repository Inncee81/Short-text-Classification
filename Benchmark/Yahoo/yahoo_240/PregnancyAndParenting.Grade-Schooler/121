parenting question should i let him keep it my eleven year old son has a bad habit of 'taking things from others without taking them' he will see something he likes and makes the person give the thing or another like it to him yugio cards toys ect he broke the breaks on his bike so has been bike less he came home a week later with a used bike belonging to a kid he met at the park fine i let him keep it but he has gone as far as telling kids he doesn't own swimming trunks so they will had over their extra pair for him finally last wednesday i explained to him that this must end and the next thing he gets from someone in that way he will have to turn over to me so yesterday i get home from work and see that he somehow got this used tackle box from somewhere the thing is bigger than my tackle box and my son's put together it is obviously old and used but still ok to use i love fishing w'him i know he will get upset and i'll feel bad getting rid of it for a while i guess but i should carry out what i say right beyond a shadow of a doubt i know he got it by begging for it in some way he has a tackle box already by the way he did not have any money to buy the thing either my question is should i take it and if i do will it send a bad message you've got to follow through on what you said even if it is old and possibly not worth much to whoever he got it from he still got it by engaging in the behavior you're trying to stop if you let him keep it you're sending the message that you're not very serious about stopping this behavior he's becoming a skilled manipulator he may get away with it with his peers but don't let him pull it on you too taking the tackle box may be a bit heartbreaking because it does represent an activity you like to do together but in the long run you're not doing him any favors if you let him get away with it Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Friends Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Ocean's Twelve Avenue Q Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Kimi Finster Poker jargon Jumpstart 3rd Grade Social rule Surveillance Futurama (TV series - season 5) Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, manga or movie only characters Shawn Michaels Winning Streak EastEnders Dog training Extreme Programming Knots Landing Eric Cartman American football strategy Conker's Bad Fur Day Theory of conduct One Tree Hill (TV series) Cindy Sheehan Miss Saigon Ecco the Dolphin Vernon Schillinger The Amazing Race Great Teacher Onizuka The Inside Billboard Hot 100 Dancing at Lughnasa Tag Rent (musical) Public-key cryptography Football (soccer) Hey Jude Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Procrastination Milton H.
