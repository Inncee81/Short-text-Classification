is it normal for year old boys to do this i caught my yr old son yr old neighbor watching cartoons in my son's room with their pants pulled down they were facing the tv and a good ft between them they were on there knees but straight up they both claimed they didn't know why they were doing that they got very upset l don't know what to think my boyfriend and i did talk to him about this and when the only times it was appropriate to take any clothes off he said he understood the other parents know too they were just as surprised as us i have issues with my kids and i tell them that their bodies are private just keep the lines of communication open no matter what it might be so that your kids will always come to you my children never feel embarrased to come and ask me a question now i may be embarrassed but they aren't then i explain to them the right and wrong ways to behave good luck Milton H.
