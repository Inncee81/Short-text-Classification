my friend told me my yr daughter was talking with her yr old daughter about sex my yr old daughter already has her period and we have had the whole conversations of where babies come from and what is sex my friend was very upset as she believes her yr old is too young to hear this conversations which i can understand but she told me that from now on she needs to monitor her daughter more around my daughter this made feel upset as i don't know if her daughter ask my daughter about it please i need advise i was so choked that i didn't give her any feed back my only comment was that my daughter is and has her period and that i have talked to her about sex and where babies came from i had a conversation w my daughter last and she stated that the yr kept asking her where do babies come from she felt that she had to give her an asnwer so she told her that when a mommy and daddy have s e x she spelled it out are in love they have babies and then she said but the mommy carries the baby my daughter said they come out of the mommy's vagina most of the conversation was about having babies not about sex like her mom thought my daughter is and i talked to her about puberty etc and my shy quiet girl went to school the next day and told all her friends but these are her friends and they're also the same age but i would think that if the six year old and your year old daughter are friends then this probably came up within their normal conversation i can't imagine a year old running around and saying psst kid wanna know something and at six years old she probably heard something somewhere and could have asked it's all over tv have a happy period and certainly she could have heard about periods somewhere and was looking for an answer perhaps the six year old approached her mother already but the mother blew her off not wanting to discuss this topic so the girl goes to someone else looking for an answer to her question i've included the link to the book that i gave my daughter to read it's an awesome book written for year olds perhaps recommend this book to the mom of the year old if the year old is curious then it's time to educate her that way she doesn't need to learn from peers or worse the street Kodocha The Catcher in the Rye The Ashlee Simpson Show Shaggy dog story God Emperor of Dune Social rule Humphrey Bogart Avenue Q EastEnders Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Plame affair Child sexuality True Crime: Streets of LA Friends Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Cliff Richard Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Jon Secada Milton H.
