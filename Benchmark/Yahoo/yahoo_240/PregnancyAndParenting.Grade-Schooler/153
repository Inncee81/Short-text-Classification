how can i help my year old stop wetting his pants my son wets his pants almost every day last year at school i had to take him clean pants at least once a week and sometimes that was after he wet his extras in his backpack at home he wears a diaper to bed my mom said that just makes it ok to pee but it's just at night he has been to the dr and has no medical problems like diabeates iv'e tried everything from rewards to taking away privilages to punishments please help lots of children wet the bed at night so this in itself isn't too much of a worry but it is rare for a year old to wet himself so often during the day time it could be a problem that the doctor hasn't picked up in which case i would start making a bit more of a fuss at the doctor's surgery and insist on more tests or a second opinion or a referral to a specialist utimately i don't think a year old would consciouly want to wet himself as other kids of this age can be quite cruel and may laugh at him for doing so so he will already be upset with himself for doing it so punishments probably won't help does he know when he needs to pee if he isn't aware of the feeling of a full bladder then there is almost definitely a medical problem try to get him into a routine of when to go to the toilet if he wets himself this regularly he really needs to go to the toilet to 'have a try' at least once every half an hour his school should be understanding of this and allow him to go to the bathroom this regularly a school i worked in used a timer for a little boy who soiled himself often when the timer went off he knew it was time to go to the bathroom perhaps there could be a quiet timer that could sit on his desk so it wouldn't draw too many people's attention to it the teachers wouldn't even need to say 'go to the toilet now' which may embarrass him he would know to just get up and go this may help to train his bladder to go at certain times of the day and eventually your son could increase the time between trips to the bathroom my friend's sisters sometimes wet themselves at school becuase they were too scared to ask to go to the toilet if he is a nervous child he may just try to hang on as long as he can so he won't have to ask but then pass the point of no return having the rule of going at certain times will ensure that he gets there in plenty of time and will also mean he won't have to ask it will just become his normal routine i wet the bed when i was little and as well as the usual no drinks before bedtime and going to the toilet just before getting into bed my mum would also wake me up when she came to bed just enough to be able to lead me to the toilet to pee and then straight back to bed this usually worked really well Urinary incontinence Fecal incontinence Kimberly-Clark Corporation Social rule Bedwetting Milton H.
