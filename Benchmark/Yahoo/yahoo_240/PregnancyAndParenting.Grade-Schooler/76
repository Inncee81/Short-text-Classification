how do i get my year old daughter not notice differences my year old daughter constantlly points things out loudly in public examples she told one lady that she has big teeth asked a woman with a large tummy if she was pregnant said something about someone in a wheel chair points out peoples age and race she does not mean to be rude and doesnt say the statements in negative ways more of an observation and i'm sure this is somewhat normal but i dont like it and do not know how to make her stop this help my five year old son has always been like this too when he was i was teaching him colors and he'd point and say this is green or that is black well one day we walked into walmart and the greeter was a friendly old black lady well my son pointed to her and said very loudly mommy that lady is brown i felt horrified but the lady was so sweet she just said yes honey i am and you are white that satisfied him and we went on i think if you tell them that yes they are noticing these things and that they are all normal then the child won't make a scene the same things happen to my husband and i when we are out and see kids he is only ' and children never fail to yell out things like mommy or daddy look at that little man look how little he is things like that generally the parents try to shush the child or ignore them which only results in the child being louder my husband is a good sport about it he usually laughs it off and tells the child that he just didn't grow very tall but that they probably will grow much bigger than him my son recently pointed out a man in a wheel chair and asked why he didn't walk he was just as loud as ever and i quickly explained to him how some people can't use their legs and that's how he gets around i've found that most people will be more interested in how you handle the situation than what the child said to them if you give the child an honest answer that makes sense to them then the subject is usually dropped immediately Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Kodocha Social rule Jam (TV series) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Milton H.
