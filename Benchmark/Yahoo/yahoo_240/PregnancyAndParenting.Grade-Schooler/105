how to overcome the worry which i always suffer when my yr old go to school at my childhood i was away fm my mom between months to yrs old age i am having bitter memories of my pre and gread school exp not prepared for competitions sometimes no lunch box no proper books of relevent class and it was putting me in shell i was always fearfull while going to school i am still not having any interest for making friends same thing i feel for my yr old styding in ist he is normal kid doing all what a yr can do ok in studies and enjoying everything including his school but whenever he moves to school i feel restless at my place imagning that he must be facing same as i was facing during my school days i take very extra care of him even i left my job and started working fm home still a small complain fm him stating that i am not taking good care of him make me restless i am not able to make anyone else understand this problem pls help don't feel like you're alone you're not i can absolutely understand what you are going through i also have a lot of bad childhood memories related to school so much so that i think i have blocked out a lot of the years completely i came from a family of living and times were hard and i think we all suffered from it it has made me really overprotective of my son he is going into st grade this year and i was overprotective of his older brother too who is now i sheltered my year old so much that he became very introverted pretty much not associating with the kids too much at school he is doing great now going into his junior year of high school with quite a few friends and excellent grades but i definitely share your unease when your little one leaves for school i dread both of my kids going back to school i also started working from home just like you did he even missed school because i wanted him home with me some days in kindergarten but i quickly got over that when i got a letter from the school i also realized it wasn't fair to him and i was being selfish and neurotic but you are not alone school was a frightening experience for you and you suffered much anxiety it sounds like it's not wrong for you to fear your little one will suffer in the same way try to pray for him and for your situation i pray for my kids regularly it sounds like your little one is doing fine just keep your chin up and realize that he is in a completely different situation than you were and do your best with him it sounds like you love him sooo much and you know he feels the love and i'm sure he will do fine Anxiety Shaggy dog story Humphrey Bogart Kodocha One Tree Hill (TV series) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Social rule Time Out of Mind The Fairly OddParents Boston Public Friends EastEnders The Contender (television series) Blood on the Tracks Stuttering Kindergarten Sin City Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword K' About a Boy Goodness and value theory The Adventures of Pete & Pete Avenue Q Milton H.
