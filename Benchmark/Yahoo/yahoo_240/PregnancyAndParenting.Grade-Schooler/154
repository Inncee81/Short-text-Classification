we're moving and my daughter doesn't want to change schools the neighborhood we live in has turned really ghetto i'm going to move across town with my brother to a really nice area he's a real estate agent and has a gorgeous house i'm a single mom with a ten year old and she won't stop crying i totally understand the only thing i can think to do is drive her to her old school every day but it will mean two hours of driving for me all last year they were supposed to do a school trip and it got cancelled at the last minute she's in fourth grade so they just let the fifth graders have a big trip to sea world and told her she could go next year she's really looking forward to it they get to spend the night with the manatees i feel like a bad mom for dragging her away from her life and friends but we have the chance to live the good life and she'd have a much better school i don't want to drive her all over every day but i hate listening to her sob what should i say to her i changed schools almost every year as a kid my son has also changed schools quite often both my son and i have survived this without being emotionally scarred what you're doing is in your daughter's best interests and she will make new friends tell her she can keep in touch with her old friends but to give the new school a try she'll probably make new friends quicker than she thinks i wouldn't even consider or offer to drive her to her old school i'm not even sure most schools allow students to go out of district like that and trust me the driving will become a huge pain in the butt really quickly i had to do it with my son for two months because we moved right before the school year ended and the school let him finish there on the condition that i provide transportation it got old quick remember you're the parent you're making a good choice that will improve both your lives your daughter will get over it so don't let her guilt trip you into doing what she wants she's not mature enough to be deciding that kind of stuff for herself Knots Landing Shaggy dog story Piccolo Junior Saga Theory of conduct Humphrey Bogart Kodocha The Marshall Mathers LP Good Times Sin City Cindy Sheehan Social rule The Catcher in the Rye One Tree Hill (TV series) Poker jargon Time Out of Mind 2000 Australian Grand Prix Kurt Cobain Boston Public The Fairly OddParents The Adventures of Pete & Pete EastEnders The Amazing Race Eddie Guerrero Pitaten Glen Jacobs Great Teacher Onizuka Rocko's Modern Life Hey Jude Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Jon Secada Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Charmed Rich Mullins Blood on the Tracks Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Hey Arnold!
