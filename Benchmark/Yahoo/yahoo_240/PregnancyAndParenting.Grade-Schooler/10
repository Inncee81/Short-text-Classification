how can i get the school to see that this isn't a problem my daughter is and going into the second grade she has friends and enjoys playing and interacting with friends but at times she will prefer to sit alone to read work and sometimes to eat she's not teased and she is able to form close friendships but the school keeps making a big deal out of the fact that at times she likes to be alone even going so far as to say she needs intervention and counseling so they send her to the school counselor once a week i would see this a problem if it was all the time but it's not when she wants be alone she chooses to be alone and when she wants company she chooses to go hang out with other kids she also has a very defined sense of personal space and only lets one or two very close friends hug her or sit stand close to her i don't see it as being a problem but the school and her teachers keep acting like it is has anyone else had a situation where the school sees a problem but you don't and how did you deal with it even the principal pushes the counseling and we did consent finally i don't think the counseling is doing her any harm my daughter sees it as getting to leave the classroom and go play with a nice lady and a couple of other kids which basically is what it is and the counselor doesn't seem to think my daughter has any real issues i just wish that at every conference with a teacher i didn't have to hear how she's still not socializing enough or not intiating interaction with other kids in pre school she woudln't talk to other kids at all and it was at the same school so i'm afraid that since she was labelled in pre school she'll have to carry that label with her we are supposed to be moving soon so maybe with a new school she can shake that label and the teachers won't be watching her so closely waiting for her to mess up in their opinion have you talked to the principal sometimes that helps she's your kid not theirs so they shouldn't be able to make her go to counseling without your permission i would also explain to them that they aren't really promoting individuality but instead making it seem like there's something psychologically wrong with her because she's not acting or doing all of the things that the other kids do in the end they could potentially end up making her feel like there's something wrong with her in a bad way and then really mess her up psychologically Theory of conduct Social rule Shaggy dog story Pitaten Domestic violence Plame affair Ranma __ characters Kodocha Transactional analysis Boston Public Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Milton H.
