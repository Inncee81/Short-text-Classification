can a person learn patience i have a yr old with adhd and for those of you wanting to judge me on this i am not labeling my daughter it is a disease anyways what are some ways to learn patience i have a low patience and tolerance and although i have a child with this disease i am finding it really hard to find the patience with her any suggestions i have a friend who has a child that has been labeled since he was years old when he started school it seems to me that a child is not allowed to carry on like he should everyone has a temper everyone gets mad when we don't get what we want everyone gets mad and upset when we are called names hit punched or something is taken away from us that we were enjoying it at the time think about it a lot of grownups do all these things and yet a child is told he has adhd he is full of energy get a book or go to your library and ask the librarian if they cary a book titled how to speak to your child so they will listen i don't have it in front of me i believe it is close to that tiltle but it is a book worth reading and re reading it it will tell you to re word your sentences so that your child will start hearing you talking the commands demands shouting that we do to our children they are learning to block you off come here get over here i told you you just wait i'm going to don't do that no i said no i want you then when you dish out punishment you don't follow through you say you are going to do something and don't do it they are being tought that you can't keep your word now it is time to really walk all over you so i hope you get the book it re directs you to i would like for you to pick up your toys in about min i'll be back in min so that we will clean up let me help you lets pick up your clothes off the floor and put it in the laundry basket suzy why don't we go and start the bath water for your bath we we we us us us lets not you or i keep up to your word of what you will plan on the punishment time out for one min of each year of how old the child is don't forget them while they are on time out and then get them and say now lets go to the room and i'll help you with the clean up or lets go pick up the clothes and lets put them where they belong it will not happen overnight but it will happen that they will listen to you and if you are calm they will feel it and they will love you also and of course tell them the good things they do big or small things compliment them on how good of a job they did at the doctors office of playing quietly how good of a job they did by picking up their shoes and putting them away you will have to learn to see all the little things they do do and say something nice about it to them and give lots of hugs and loving words you start while they are young and you will have great kids my little guy that i had at years old at the day care he is now no one would believe he was the way he was by seeing him now he is loving listens good temper he talks things out he and all kids need respect just like i told another person think how you would feel if someone talked to you the way you speak to your child come here go get out of here i don't want to see your face you are so sloppy why don't you ever listen shut up be quiet don't make me come there and hit you how does that sound to you if someone spoke to you that way kids are humans and need just as much respect as you want respect children taught me to have patience they are very innocent they need a lot of loving lots of hugs and kisses they taught me that it was not easy for me to give hugs and kisses until i had my own child and then i met hundred of other children now i have plenty of patience and love to give to anyone please look for the book schools are full of old and young people that do not respect children i will not say what type of people it is being said because of all the children that have gone through with the pulling and tugging and being sent to the office too many times instead of dealing with the child in a respectful way from kindergarden to high school this problem is there there are only a few very few people that the students respect by the way my little guy is not on meds any longer he acted like he had no mind while he was on it what a shame to put a loving child on such a terrible medication Social rule Humphrey Bogart Theory of conduct Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pitaten Little Britain About a Boy The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Dog training Friends Japanese tea ceremony Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Milton H.
