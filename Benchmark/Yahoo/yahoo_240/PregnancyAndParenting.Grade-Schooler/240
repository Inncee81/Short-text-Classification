why is my son so obnoxious and dosent ever listen my son he just doesent want to ever listen what ever i say for him to go do somthing but he dosent do it will take him all day lond when it should only take him at the most an hour but i ask his four year old sister do stuff she gets it done right away so i dont know hopefully sombody will have answer for me i have the same problem with my son and my daughter is the same way i honestly think it is agender difference even though most ppl won't agree i believe that girls are genetically designed to be more likely to want to clean and have a neat organized space and boys really don't care i have sons and they will pile the mess up in their room until i can't open the door and if i ask them to clean they whine and cry and stomp their feet but if i say anything about cleaning or cooking or getting dressed to my daugher she is right on it boys also need to be broken they push harder at a younger age to see how far they can get i know that i will deal with it with my girl too but right now its my boys and if there is any advice i could give it would be get your son wrapped around your finger asap i know that sounds totally mean but you really have to just like we constantly have to rope our husbands bf in and remind them to get things done we have to do the same with our sons they are just small men Shaggy dog story Social rule Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an RuneScape quests Sin City Full House The Jazz Singer Empire Burlesque Salad Fingers The Shining (film) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe American Psycho Violin Glossary of nautical terms Trailer Park Boys Ranma __ characters Aerial (dance move) Changeroom Pitaten Shawn Michaels Little Britain Menstrual cup The Marriage of Figaro Indian English Professional wrestling holds Mud People Charles Peace Taxi Driver Mixed martial arts Friends Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Time Out of Mind K' The Jeffersons (South Park) I Love Lucy Scouting Transsexuality Comanche Professional wrestling attacks Boston Public Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Miss Saigon The Beach Boys Dead Like Me Hijab Great Teacher Onizuka The Inside The McGuire Sisters The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Milton H.
