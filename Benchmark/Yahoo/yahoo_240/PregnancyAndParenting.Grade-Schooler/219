daughter and school clothes i went back to school shopping yesterday with my yr old daughter and she went into the limited too store for the first time and loved it i bought her a shirt for i can't believe i paid that much for one shirt but she really wanted it bad what other mothers have gone this this and just bought it even though it was crazy expensive hello to tell you the truth i buy my daughter's clothes from wal mart or goodwill because she grows so fast and i am not ashamed to admit that is where i get her clothes from alot of people may laugh or snicker but there is nothing wrong with shopping at wal mart especially for children and do you know that i got all of her back to school clothes including socks underwear and sneakers for my daughter is tall and skinny and alot of times she is in between sizes so it is very difficult to shop for her because she grows so fast that is why i have to go to wal mart or our local goodwill store because their clothes are so much cheaper than anywhere else call me a snob or tight with my money but i think it is ridiculous to spend so much money on children's clothing that they will only be able to wear for a year if that i don't mind buying her a special pair of shoes that give her good foot and ankle support or a really special outfit for once in a while but she is told that it is a gift and not to expect getting whatever she wants all of the time because we have a very tight budget that we have to stick to i am raising her to appreciate the things that are given to her and there is more to a person than just by the brand of clothes or shoes that they wear Social aspects of clothing Sears Holdings Corporation Wal-Mart Shoe Undergarment Clothing Married... with Children Doug Irish dance Tesco Trailer Park Boys Sock Marilyn Monroe Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an About a Boy Sweatshop Professional wrestling slang Treehouse of Horror XV Poker jargon Aerial (dance move) Animal Crossing Shaggy dog story One Tree Hill (TV series) Destiny's Child Customs and etiquette of Japan Aldi Humphrey Bogart Grunge music Hazing Sento Suit (clothes) Garfield Kilt Target Corporation Phoebe Buffay's songs Eid ul-Fitr High-heeled shoe Abercrombie & Fitch Co.
