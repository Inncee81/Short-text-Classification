year old son is overly sensntive how should this be dealt with i raised my son from ages yrs old as a single mom his dad was not a big part of his life for reasons that i won't get in to here i was remarried a year ago so his stepfather is really the only father figure he has but as with most boys who were minus a male figure for many crucial developemental years he's very sensitive and has his feelings hurt a lot by his friends his friends are just being typical boys and acting the way most boys his age do but my son is not a typical boy and quite frankly has been through more hurt than any year old should face he's very emotional and sensitive and his feelings get hurt quite easily and other boys don't understand that through no fault of their own he's been diagnosed with anxiety and depression and sees a therapist once a week it's helping but i was also curious about the thoughts of other parents as well which is why i'm asking here short of telling him stop being a baby and toughen up what should i do i think that the best way is to talk to him when he is upset about the situation at hand you need to rationalize with him how serious the incident was for example if someone calls him a name obviously he's upset so don't just fluff it off recognize that his feelings were hurt but help him to understand that its only words and that its not worth getting upset over you need to go through each incident some can be downplayed and some will be more serious do this gradually and be consistant About a Boy Transsexuality Domestic violence Shaggy dog story The Ashlee Simpson Show Transactional analysis Theory of conduct Kodocha Clinical depression Obsessive-compulsive disorder Androgen insensitivity syndrome Fathers' rights Narcissism Traumatic incident reduction Autism South Park Milton H.
