what are good chores for my yr old daughter my daughter is yrs now i think that it time for her to start learning responsibilities and start doing some basic chores she is at that age where she complains if she is told to do something and expects a lot yes she has been a little bit spoiled other than that she is a very good kid but needs to learn that life is not all about the gimme's and that she needs to earn the things she wants we live in a bed apartment and we have a cat what type of chores is good for her at her age i just want some ideas i don't want to give too much or too little chores and was wondering what other parents do too as to lisa sterwert i am a very good mother and care for my children very well and definitely not a pathetic excuse of anything ignorant comment ignorant comment from an ignorant person i would appreciate input from people who have kids of their own thank you here's what my mom used to do when ever she was doing any work like peeling potatoes she would put a chair next to her and i would help when she baked the chair was there and i helped she used to sing to me all the time we were working together i learned to love those special times it wasn't a chore it was spending time with my mom she is gone now and that time is huge in my memory so when you dust give your daughter a duster too and say some thing like lets dust and when you do laundry get ther to help you by saying let's sort laundry she will look on this as her time with you and at the same time she will be learning and eventually she will be able to do things on her own and not grumble about it explain why you do housework and why you need to keep things clean i'm sure she will understand if as you say she has been spoiled you did the spoiling and you can't expect her to jump right in and be mommies little helper now you must do the training slowly and with fun and song because of what my mom did i am a good housekeeper and so are my daughters whom i taught the same way good luck Great Teacher Onizuka Social rule Friends Milton H.
