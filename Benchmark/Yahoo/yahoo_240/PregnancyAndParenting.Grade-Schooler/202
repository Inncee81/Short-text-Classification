should i say anything to my child my son is years old and the past two nights i've sort of caught him in his room masturbating i havent seen him do it per se but i know he is doing it because of the way he was acting i know this is normal and i don't have a problem with it but should i have a talk with him or have his dad talk to him or should i just leave it be is it time for a birds and the bees talk or should we just wait until he is older might i add i am his stepmother in a relationship with his mother he lives with us full time but sees his dad on the weekends when children masturbate there is nothing sexual about it when a baby hits themself with a toy it doesn't feel good and they won't do it again boys and girls start playing with themselves very early they're exploring their bodies they touch certain spots and it does or doesn't feel good when it feels good they're gonna do it without embarrassing him you have to make sure he understands that his parts stay away until he is in his own room alone and unless it takes over his life let him enjoy himself Child sexuality Human sexual behavior About a Boy Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Friends Pitaten Infantilism Kodocha Prostate cancer Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Shining (film) The Catcher in the Rye Social rule Earth Girl Arjuna Grandview, U.S.A.
