why do you think years old boy beats his girl classmates in school no i think he is copieng somebody he keeps repeating though he was warned even by parents of female classmates well if you mean beats as in hitting them it's probably because he likes them if he's beating them as in pulling the hair a little or pushing just a little then that's normal most young boys don't know how to handle their feelings and show how they feel by annoying girls but if he's beating them like giving them bruises or making them bleed that's bad and needs to be stopped if he saw any movies or tv shows where husbands beat their wives he's probably copying it or maybe he overheard someone talking about abuse either way you have to make him stop first you have to find out why he's doing it ask him if he saw a show or movie or heard someone talking about it if he says yes ask him what show or movie or who then don't let him watch that show or movie anymore and if it was a person he heard it from talk to them and ask them politely to not talk about troubling things when there are young children around then you have to make him stop it everytime he hits someone in school take away one toy tell him why too say well i heard you hit girl's name today and that's bad you can't hit people i'm going to take his favorite toy away for a week if you don't hit anyone in a week you can have it back if you hit someone else i'll take another toy and go through with it if that doesn't work sit him down and give him a good talk tell him that he cannot hit people it is mean and no one will want to be his friend if he does be very serious so he knows you're not kidding then if he keeps hitting people talk to him again and no tv for a three days if he continues bump it up to a week if he still continues no tv and no computer for a week if he still continues talk to his teacher and ask if s he has any suggestions if nothing works take him to a children's therapist or psycologist he has to learn that what he's doing is wrong good luck i hope i could help Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Kodocha Avenue Q Milton H.
