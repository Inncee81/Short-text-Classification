i signed my yr old up for gymnastics today they placed her in acro gymnastics i i know they have a kid nastics too was this the appropiate class for a child with no prior gymnastics she did ballet and tap but not gymnastics the reason i ask was because the lady i spoke with on the phone said her class would be on wed but when i brought her in for registration the lady put her into the friday class as you may have assumed wed is kid nastics and friday is the acro gymnastics i does anyone have any experience with this that can help me i just dont want her to be behind or anything but i did see that the class acro gymnastics i is age and up once she gets going in the gymnastics program they will evaluate her abilities and they should place her in the correct class i was an instructor at a gymnastics gym and you should be allowed to veiw her during her class time sooo if you find that this class is not suited for her you can demand a change good luck and i hope your daughter does well with the gymnastics Paragliding Education in the United States Martial art GED Sport Physical education Canada at the 2004 Summer Olympics Divorce Gym Great Britain at the 2004 Summer Olympics Billboard (advertising) Luck Aerial (dance move) North Carolina State University G-Man (Half-Life) Fukuoka, Fukuoka Public domain Doomsday argument Education Minor league baseball Rhythmic gymnastics Horizontal bar Yelena Davydova Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Barbie Troms__ I.L.
