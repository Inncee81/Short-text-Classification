how can i get my son to be more interested in school he is in st grade he seems distracted and his behavior is silly he gets along great with others class clown i think all the teachers have him targeted at the kindergarten conference the teacher said to us that we are ideal parents so that was a huge compliment i just wish he could respect people and listen better i don't feel he takes pride in his work he is a smart child though i think that the teachers know that he is a handful but they all seem to like him and us i just want first grade to be great for all of us also what is the best answer to say to a teacher when she tells me there was problems with him today in class first of all the fact that you want your child to do well at school and improtantly respect his teachers is a great way of instilling a good attitude into him you are still one of his main educators and as long as he sees you giving people respect and listening to them then gradually he will learn how to do so himself you sound like a very positive role model for your child the fact that the teachers like him suggest to me that there are no serious concerns about his behaviour you say his behaviour is silly but that he gets along well with others most teachers i know have the biggest problems with children who are mean to others hit them etc if your son is just being a little irritating this sounds quite normal for a year old boy and he probably will grow out of it an important thing to remember is to back his teacher up teachers with disruptive children sometimes find they punish them only to have the child turn round the next day and say something like 'my dad said not to take any notice of you and i am allowed to do that if i want ' if this happens the child will not learn to settle down and behaviour will get worse this is obviously not an issue with your family just continue ensuring your son sees you listening to the teacher telling you about things he has done don't get panicked if she says there was a problem teachers have to talk to a different parent about various things practically every day and it is not a reflection on your parenting skills just listen to what she tells you thank her for letting you know about it and assure her that you will talk to your son at home then when you get home make sure you make time to do this discussing what he did how that made his teacher feel what he should do the next day etc have him sit by himself for a few minutes to think about his actions at school the next day when you take him to school ask him to go and apologise to the teacher first thing because he can then start the day afresh if you feel the teacher is speaking to you quite regularly after school ask her to timetable a time when you can both discuss your concerns in a little more depth don't worry about this it is part of her job to communicate with parents and as you sound very polite and keen to help your son she will be happy to speak with you during the meeting listen to the main problems she has been having with your child at school and don't be afraid to write them down as you will want to talk to your son about them ask her for her suggestions about how she can implement behaviour management strategies in school and how you could support them at home she might use a sticker chart and if he gets a certain amount of stickers you could give him a treat at hime or if he doesn't get enough you could take away a privilege as for not taking pride in his work he is and a boy not being sexist but they usually are messier writers than girls if he tends to rush through tasks do activities with him at home that will help his concentration level play 'pairs' turning over pairs of cards to find that match play 'kim's game' putting items on a tray for him to memorise then taking some away and asking him to name them read him stories and talk about them with him take him to museums and on walks discussing the interesting things you see be enthusiastic about everything if he sees you show interest in things like reading then he will start to be more interested himself if he does work that you think could be better presented it could be that his hand eye control is still developing give him activities that practise this such as tracing doing jigsaw puzzles making models and painting ask him to talk about what he has done with you and if he is happy with his 'work' then display it somewhere so he feels his efforts have worth this will lead him to trying harder with his tasks at school also get into the habit of asking him to tell you something good that he did at school that day it could be writing painting playing nicely helping the teacher whatever give him cuddles and lots of verbal praise for this he will soon start trying to do new 'good' things to tell you all about Social rule Extreme Programming Milton H.
