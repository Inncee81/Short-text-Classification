i think these pain killers are making me sick as you can tell i do not take these kinds of things often the room is starting to spin and it gets worse when i lay down if i go sit in the shower and let the water run on me will it make me feel better or would it make me feel worse wash your face with cold water hon don't get in the shower some of them do actually make you dizzy and you might faint and hitting a cold hard shower is not the thing you want to do try breathing deeply and next time cut the dosage in half it should get better in about minutes or so you can also lessen the effect by eating something bread or milk can help a lot hope you feel better be careful for us Fecal incontinence Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Hyperthermia Sauna Bread Time Out of Mind Social rule Diving Milton H.
