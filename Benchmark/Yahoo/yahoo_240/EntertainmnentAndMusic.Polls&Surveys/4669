would you like to hear a story there once was a girl she ate an apple the apple had a maggot in it she died the end i know it's a bit long but i wrote it myself what do you think of it does it need shortnening do you think it wil sell look who answered first looks scared scary scary things i am full of fear lol i think that the ending has some significant meaning i think it could change lives don't you it saves going through all the nonsense like in the other epic stories like war and piece its straight guttural to the point and does not wander from its main characters or story line like so many others before it it has a beginning a middle and a end i personally would not shorten it too much if you were going to as you could and please don't think i'm a professional critic as i'm not lose a significant part of the action in the centre of the story which was what held me there if you were to shorten it i would miss off the end as this will leave it open to a sequel maybe i look forward to any follow ups with baited breath good luck Pitaten The Secret of NIMH Swingout Snooker Billiards Theory of conduct Hiberno-English RuneScape quests The Amber Spyglass Tag Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Apple Computer Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Poker jargon Substance theory The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Wonderland (McFly album) Marathon (computer game) The Pilgrim's Progress The Lovely Bones Fiona Apple Scenes from a Memory The Exorcist Supergirl Prank flash Shaggy dog story Billboard Hot 100 10cc Drill bit Don Quixote Singlish The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Adam and Eve The Time Machine Toad Patrol First-person shooter English grammar Incarnations of Immortality Aerial (dance move) Wil Wheaton Apple II family Salad Fingers CPU cache Scary Go Round Floppy disk Hey Jude Social rule The Tracey Ullman Show shorts Milton H.
