do you ever walk into a relationship with your mind made up about what you want from this person or do you go at it laughs to see what comes of it can any option be possible or do you almost instantly put off a possible mate and move on to friendship or do you try to make friends first and later even if the person wan't that attractive to start with would you find yourself attracted to them anyway neither one really each person is different and unique in their own way and i find it better for myself personally to be flexible enough to go with the flow and allow things to take place naturally in whatever course they take between another person and myself i used to have a system in developing romantic relationships which is a common one that consisted of friendship dating if i knew the person enough to begin to date him or her commitment when i felt comfortable enough in the dating process to be open with such person intimacy if i percieved there was mutual commitment but have come to realize through time and experience that not only was i being a bit selfish in the matter meaning that he or she had to adjust to my pace instead of a mutual experience and that no matter how much one tries to do things the right way or in some sort of social order it cannot seal a perfect fate to any relationship now i just take it easy and not attempt to control the process in which another person and i will relate but only prioritize getting to know that individual and allow for things to happen naturally between us not perfectly not systematically just natural if it will happen an eventual romantic relationship then great and if it doesn't it just wasn't for either one of us which isn't a bad thing just how things are in life sometimes just want to add that i think we humans tend to complicate relationships with these hard to get games and trying to impress each other interaction among humans doesn't have to be so dramatic or intricate no matter the differences Love Theory of conduct Extreme Programming Human sexual behavior Infantilism Value system Friendship Interpersonal relationship Social rule Goodness and value theory Friends Objectivist philosophy Pitaten Rei Ayanami Friedrich Schleiermacher Social psychology Alcoholics Anonymous Supernatural Prisoner's dilemma God Emperor of Dune T'Pol Philip J.
