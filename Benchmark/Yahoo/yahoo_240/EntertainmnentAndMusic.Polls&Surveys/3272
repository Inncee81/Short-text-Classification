who is your idol who do you idolize i idolize yuri ebihara on my avatar d nikola tesla he was the smartest man that ever lived some say albert einstein i say no way tesla was born at least yrs before his time some say he invented radio the tesla coil ac power distribution ac motors and robots automation in the 's he discovered a way to modulate a power signal much like we modulate a radio signal and transmit it across the air in the 's he invented a death ray in that is better than a laser before the laser was even invented that beam weapon was called particle accelerator weapon or particle beam weapon when a laser beam strikes its target it cuts it like a knife when the particle weapon beam strikes its target the beam transfers most of its energy into the target at lower power the target detonates at higher power the target vaporizes if tesla had his way we would all have free electricity all we could ever want need forever we would not have ugly power lines all over the place your house even your car would have an antenna the power tower he was building before the government and big business of course cut his funding would supply power to your home car boat etc wirelessly via that antenna free forever all over the world there is genius very genius most genius supra genius and then there is nikola tesla albert einst who Nikola Tesla Wardenclyffe Tower Directed-energy weapon Laser Tesla coil Radio Electric motor Ionosphere Magnifying Transmitter Alternating current Galileo spacecraft Teleforce X-ray Internal combustion engine Particle accelerator Lightning Electric power Electric power transmission Welding Magnetic field Universal Century Technology History of radar Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Vacuum tube History of radio Radar Loudspeaker Transmitter George Westinghouse Dynamic theory of gravity Weapons of Star Trek Antenna (radio) Electrical engineering SETI High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program Light Linear particle accelerator Technology in the Stargate universe History of physics Photoelectric effect Diode Alternator Fusion power Wireless War of Currents Speed of light Electromagnet Raygun Railgun Battery (electricity) Torpedo Cassini-Huygens Radio control Klystron tube Gravity Laser applications Microphone Radio masts and towers Gravitational radiation Telegraphy Headlight Electromagnetic radiation Oscilloscope Electricity Federal Standard 1037C Lightning rod Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Neutrino Microwave Solar power Quantum mechanics GunBound Project Orion Cyclotron AIM-7 Sparrow Thomas Edison STS-87 Electronics Regenerative circuit Ratchet & Clank: Going Commando Free electron laser Optical fiber Telephone Shortwave
