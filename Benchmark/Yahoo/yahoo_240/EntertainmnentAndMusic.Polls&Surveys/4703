do you agree with this why when people are talking about a teenager they talk about all teens in general do you think all teens go around doing drugs and having sex i don't what about the ones who are actually remotely desent who would never do drugs and never have sex before they were married i don't think all teenagers are like that it's just a stereotype what do you think do you think all teenagers are druggies and sexoholics sometimes people have the same attitudes when talking about teens because they don't know their teen or can't deal with the issues that are in their lives this is sad because teens are our future and should be considered for all their input about life i find them realistic caring artistic and beleivers of a whole new world that us as adults can't comprehend who better to have at our sides but those same teens all grown up a determined parent is going to see teens for who they are stereo typing is going to result in only one thing in life distance i have a and yr old sons and i would be no where in life if i had these other peoples attitudes about teens listen learn love Human sexual behavior Adolescence Teenage pregnancy Sex education Teenage suicide Infantilism One Tree Hill (TV series) Polyamory Abortion debate Sexual abstinence High school subcultures Laura Schlessinger Generation X Motion picture rating system Kurt Cobain Child sexuality Straight edge Kelly Clarkson Daria Motivation Earth Girl Arjuna The Lovely Bones Degrassi Prostate cancer About a Boy Age of consent Teen drama Saved by the Bell Vernon Schillinger Degrassi: The Next Generation Kender Bradley Nowell Harm reduction Transsexuality Teen Girl Squad Autism British Board of Film Classification Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma AIDS The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Smells Like Teen Spirit The O.C.
