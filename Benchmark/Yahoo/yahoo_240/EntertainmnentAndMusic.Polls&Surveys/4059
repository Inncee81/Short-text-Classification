has your significant other caused you to lower or raise your personal standards mine has caused me to lower some of my standards and after some time now i don't like what i'm becoming i swear too much get angry too much stopped going to church and i complain alot more than i used to i don't know how to change that right now it is just bothering me i think it was bad to get involved with someone who had bad habits i didn't have and slowly start taking on those habits anyway how does your significant influence you it's because you have become him you are him aren't you in fact i don't even think this is funstuffforyou is it it's him granted every person you love always has some influence over you it's natural and it could be a positive thing if you focus on his positive traits his skills you can learn from his quirks you can be inspired by them but you sound like a women who has been married to a man who wears the pants wow how could you let yourself do that if only just to please him trust me i have been there thats how i know after years of being with someone you begin to lose your identity and in the end they lose interest because they don't really want to sleep with themselves i don't think or do they well it's not his bad habits you will never find someone who is perfect you stand your ground and go to church alone refuse to be a potty mouth just because he is doing it don't be a follower you are not him refuse to be negative just because he is you don't have to be his shadow you are a brilliant human being capable of your own will and thought and why would you want to be him you are good enough so just be you Humphrey Bogart Human nature Milton H.
