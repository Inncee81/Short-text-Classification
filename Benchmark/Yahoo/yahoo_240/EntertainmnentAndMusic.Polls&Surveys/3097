why do they put skulls and bones on little girls shoes i went shopping with my baby girls for shoes so many at least six pairs of tennies for little girls had skulls and bones on them why do they do this and b would you want your child wearing these i am thankful my girls do not like them period just curious as to what other parents opinions on this are i am sorry but when i see them i see a symbol meaning of something dead or toxic much to death not a style i would ever want a child of anyone let alone my own to want to wear and no i do my best to teach my children well but still would not under my roof allow them to wear trash i want them in every sense to succeed but of course god plays a huge roll in how i would make decisions for myself included by no means does this mean i think i am perfect quite the opp but still trying to be my best i dunno it is just one more thing visual i see that stinks about what children go through but to each there own we all have decisions to make choices to make etc i appreciate the opinions of all of you edited to the afterlife of the party i am not hypercrytical contrary to what your insenuating you see what you see and if you think i am gonna take your word for what it may or may not represent you are sadly mistaken let me clarify my kids do not want to wear this style does that mean i wont hit road bumps raising them simply said no i never said those who wear clothing such as this don't succeed i said i want mine to succeed deeper than you are seeing right now you look at the surface i tend to look a whole lot deeper there is much prettier stuff to wear than this again just my opinion they use whatever is hot in hollywood to sell things the pirate stuff is big right now i wouldn't buy them for my girls Humphrey Bogart Theodicy The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Empire Burlesque Marilyn Monroe Frankie Laine Diving Blood on the Tracks Codename: Kids Next Door Paul W.
