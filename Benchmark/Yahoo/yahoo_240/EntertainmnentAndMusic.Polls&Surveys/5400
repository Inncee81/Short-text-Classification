what are your thoughts on this people i work with had a party over the weekend the party was at a guy's house he's single and one of the women at the party age brought a friend the guy hit it off with the friend and she ended up spending the night during the party supposedly he asked if she was still in school or if she worked she said she was in school and worked he asked what year she was she said junior he asked where she worked she said rutgers he drove her home the next morning got her phone number and kissed her goodbye her mother got his license plate and called the police turns out she was and a junior in high school from what i hear she looked behaved and dressed much older i found out this morning that he could be going away for a while and if convicted must register as a sex offender i'd just like to get your thoughts on this one and in addition to your feelings on him do you think the girl who brought the year old should face any charges she definitely misled him it's really messed up these girls should be punished they are not necessarily the innocents in these situations they lie make decisions on their own to lure have sex with older men maybe if her mother would have paid more attention before the incident instead of afterwards the situation could have been avoided these are not yr old girls i knew right from wrong and i knew not to pull crap like that too my father would have had my ass i would have deserved it One Tree Hill (TV series) Friends Shaggy dog story Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 American Psycho Social rule Serial killer Humphrey Bogart Avenue Q Katelyn Faber Blood on the Tracks 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Pitaten Great Teacher Onizuka Rape Little Britain About a Boy Good Morning, Vietnam Mumia Abu-Jamal Lauren Bacall Yoko Ono Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Catcher in the Rye Full Metal Panic?
