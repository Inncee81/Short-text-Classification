is this song alright i need to write a song for school so is this one good enough i never cared so much but for you i seem to have to pick up your every fall from the floor i take your hand and pull you up so you stand here tall but from you i never had to pull my face away any time i cried because really happy only means that you have something strange to hide i'm scrawling my feelings accross the wall just for you to see the pain o feel is cause because your way too far from me oh i'd give up anything for one last embrace and i'd throw away my hopes and dreams just for one last time i'd see your face so i'll save my pennies til i'm and free because i can't help but think your too far from me so just let the tears keep falling from your face to the floor because next time you need me i'll be the one here waiting by your front door anytime o think how close we are i imagine traveling through so many hills and trees and even though it's not that far it's to e you know your way too far from me well thats it please add comments and please tell me if i can add anything or take anything away what can make the song better really awesome im always such a shitty song writter aha i love it hey who's it about The Amber Spyglass Cliff Richard Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Shaggy dog story Happy Tree Friends Professional wrestling holds The Beatles discography Time Out of Mind Miss Saigon Aerial (dance move) The Parting of the Ways One Tree Hill (TV series) Hey Jude The Emancipation of Mimi The McGuire Sisters Scenes from a Memory RuneScape quests Poker jargon Aladdin (1992 film) Janet Jackson Sin City Conspiracy (TNG episode) Professional wrestling throws Social rule Dean Koontz Remix Powerbomb Japanese tea ceremony John Berryman Liam Gallagher Coming of Age (TNG episode) Stanley Cup Combine (Half-Life 2) Journey (band) Volleyball Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Diving Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Frankie Laine Rich Mullins The Time Machine The Doors Humphrey Bogart Tag Madonna (entertainer) The Ashlee Simpson Show The Cure Swingout W.I.T.C.H.
