have you ever tried hypnotherapy did it work for you yes and unbelievably yes i had a serious phobia of wasps when i was at school i was stung on the back of my neck and my throat swelled up and i couldn't breathe before you say it yes i know now that obviously a sting on the neck will make throat swell but i was only young and seriously thought i was going to die my phobia got so bad that i have run in front of cars and worse just to escape a wasp i went to see a hypnotherapist and after a sort of regression where he took me back to the time at school i was actually stung was given some exercises to do afterwards when i felt panicky i was so cynical at the time convinced it wouldn't work but i am no longer frightened of wasps after being terrified for years plus Hypnotherapy Scenes from a Memory Anxiety Procrastination Anaphylaxis Hypnosis Milton H.
