wiccan healing my mom is having alot of trouble with her back and i saw an herbal sachet in a wiccan book i was just wondering is it okay to do everything the spell says but put the mixture in like a sock so she can heat it up in the muicrowave and put it on her back i guess what i'm asking is is it safe to put crushed herbs in the microwave i'm sure the sachet you found in the wiccan book is based in herbal medicine so it's not necessarily an exclusively wiccan healing method but one based in herbalism and folk remedies it's generally better to not microwave herbs as it can destroy some of the medicinal properties so you may want to look into steaming it warm or something similar like dropping it briefly into boiling water don't leave it in though because then the medicine will steep out into the water leaving you with a tea that may or may not be drinkable depending on the herbs what herbs are in the sachet by the way calendula is pretty much the best herb for easing muscular pain so hopefully it has some of that in it you could also get some calendula cream from a health food store and apply it topically that stuff works wonders many blessings Tea Herbalism Yarrow Coffee Traditional Chinese medicine Aloe Essential oil Witchcraft Natural health Beer Homeopathy Massage Birth control Patent medicine Garlic Alternative medicine Microwave oven Yerba mate Abortion Medieval medicine Herbology Naturopathic medicine Michael Savage (commentator) Health science Herbal tea Nettle Althaea (genus) Kava Citric acid Breastfeeding Psychopharmacology Stuttering Folk medicine Ice cream Caffeine Slow cooker Cannabinoids Nuclear power Wicca Comfrey Idli Rooibos Instant coffee Cocaine Liquorice St John's wort Complementary and alternative medicine Jewish cuisine Tofu Mid-levels Microwave Sage Chinese food therapy Teapot Cuisine of Denmark Quackery Cat Final Fantasy magic Explosive material RuneScape skills Chiropractic Bread Eczema Cantonese cuisine Nitrous oxide Word of Wisdom Vitamin C Reiki Chicken soup Medical cannabis Hemp Hyssop Lavender Dialysis Japanese tea ceremony Tlingit Onion Wiccan Rede Natural Hygiene Textile manufacturing Sugar Stinging nettle Magic (paranormal) Yoghurt Nuclear reactor Ocean thermal energy conversion Chinese wine Welding Stomach cancer Ammonia Abortifacient Anesthesia Water vapor Energy development Kitchen
