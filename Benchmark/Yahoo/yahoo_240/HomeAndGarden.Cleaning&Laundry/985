why do i still smell like a skunk i got sprayed last thursday ans i still reek should i bathe now removing the scent from objects or creatures can be difficult some home remedies suggest using tomato juice or vinegar a more complex and effective remedy includes application of a mixture containing hydrogen peroxide baking soda and liquid soap the thiols which are responsible for the odor are not water soluble even with soap but the baking soda catalyzes the oxidative ability of the peroxide which oxidizes the thiols into highly water soluble sulfonates in an episode of the television program mythbusters the hydrogen peroxide mix was found to be the most effective smell removal agent Vinegar Sulfur Hydrogen peroxide Spotted Skunk Acetic acid Ammonia Sewage treatment Organic peroxide Solvent Thiol Halitosis Soap Sulfuric acid Hydrogen sulfide Explosive material Hydrochloric acid Sulfide Nitrous oxide Sodium Perfume Hydrogen Water (molecule) Acetone peroxide Chemoluminescence Sterilization (microbiology) Laundry detergent Flue gas desulfurization Sodium hydroxide Soluble Mouth ulcer Ether Ester Diethyl ether Salt Pepper spray Cyanide Polychlorinated biphenyl Irreducible complexity Alkane Peroxide Flour Carbon dioxide Hard water Chlorine Tooth enamel Corrosion Rocket fuel Leblanc process Ozone Enzyme Oxide Bleach Oxygen Bread Sodium hypochlorite Titanium Ice cream Fatty acid metabolism Hot sauce Menstrual cup Olfaction Sulfhydryl group Methylsulfonylmethane Eczema Stink bomb Alum Common cold Starch Cat Potassium Bromine Benzoyl peroxide Soy protein Toothpaste Ozone depletion Water purification Glycerin Alcohol Hair coloring Flatulence Vulcanization Limonene Soft drink Haloalkane Cysteine Toluene Methanol Glass Uranium Ozone hole Cocaine Magnesium Gold cyanidation Calcium
