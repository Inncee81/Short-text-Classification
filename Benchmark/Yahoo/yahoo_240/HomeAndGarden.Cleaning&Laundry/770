get vinegar smell out of suede couch we have a cat and it for some unknown reason started peeing on our brand new month old micro suede couches i read suggestions and used vinegar and water the pee smell seems to be gone but i might have used a little too much because now the whole house is permeated with the strong smell i read that the vinegar smell would go away if used but it hasnt yet any suggestions first try some of that febreeze lysol nutra air or some such product for the air in your house then if the spots where you applied the vinegar are still there i would sprinkle it with either baking soda or baby powder for awhile to absorb the scent hope it works for ya Vinegar Skunk Toilet humour Ginny Weasley Bread Tofu Fish and chips French fries Sodium hydroxide Trademark Cuisine of Denmark Menstrual cup Chocolate Spotted Skunk Sulfur Kakapo Olfaction Solvent Ron and Fez AMD Food additive Ham Nutmeg Ice cream Menstrual cycle Japanese cuisine 21 July 2005 London bombings Baking powder Genericized trademark Ammonia Coca-Cola Jewish cuisine Pet skunk Carbon dioxide Sugar substitute Soft drink Rain Explosive material Mouth ulcer Glass Perfume Alcoholic beverage Potato chips Carbonated water Fire fighting Kitchen Roman eating and drinking Phosphorus Pep__ Le Pew Otitis externa Mayonnaise Herring Laundry detergent Procter & Gamble Barbecue Dim sum Gloom (Pok__mon) Ozone depletion Ramen Cocoa Paul Reubens Pancake John Couch Adams Coffeehouse Leblanc process Soy milk Animal communication Felis sapiens 1,4-dichlorobenzene Tobacco Sushi Toffee Hydrochloric acid Date Palm Hot dog Steven Wright Egg (food) Aluminium Ozone hole Sulfuric acid Carboxylic acid OK Soda Gumbo Nestl__ Toothpaste Balsamic vinegar Flatulence Soy protein Advertising Sodium Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?
