does anyone enjoy going to the laundramat i like it i find it peaceful yes if i go alone then it really is peaceful i used to get a lot of reading assignments done there that i normally would have blown off but we have a lot of quality laundromats here at the beach front and some of my friends and i get together every once in a while to just knock out all of our laundry at once its less than peaceful but more fun that way bring some drinks and music combined with the next door and a little gossip lol and we are good to go my only issue with laundromats is the fact that it seems unsanitary to wash your things with that of others but that is why we always run a rinse cycle with clorox through each of the washers before we use them and run a clorox wipe around the dryer glad to know someone else enjoys it Washing machine Laundry Toilet Cruising (maritime) Car washing techniques Clorox Washboard Laundry detergent Bulk vending First English Civil War Unconditional Love Textile manufacturing FoxTrot Sento Bikini Bottom Please Save My Earth Japanese tea ceremony New York City Subway nomenclature Tea Classics Upholstery Theory of conduct About a Boy Peter Cook Squidward Tentacles The Five Doctors Dishwasher Hand washing Spidey Super Stories Shaggy dog story Sauna T__rin Turambar Extreme Programming Nicomachean Ethics Shrek 2 LOL (Internet slang) Marie Antoinette Tea Characters in the Smurfs Japanese toilet Fable (video game) Das Lied von der Erde Genericized trademark The Champions Dry cleaning Social rule Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The One With the East German Laundry Detergent Ty Cobb The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air McMansion RuneScape quests Combine (Half-Life 2) Hard water Bob and George Wild Honey Purim Dairy Sampling (music) Spark plug Menstrual cup StarCraft: Uprising Slayers Sin City Urticaria Sport Mass noun Chinese tea culture Glossary of nautical terms Fast bowling Jan Hus Daredevil Jennifer Lopez Water Pitaten Wok B3ta Jim Morrison K' CPU cache Infantilism Knots Landing Obsessive-compulsive disorder The Invisibles The Riordans Columbine High School massacre Spontaneous human combustion Happiness The Book of Five Rings Cosmo Kramer Avenue Q Vegeta Quest for Glory Soap The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll The Beach Boys Muslim ibn Aqeel Shit Diaper
