how do you get smells out of central air systems i have an older style central air system and just of the last week have started getting a stale mold smell when it is running any tips on how and or what to clean to get the smell out check to make sure there are no leaks around your system that could create mold are you replacing your filter on your air conditioner regularly you can also have someone come out and clean out all your ducts in your home i would contact your local home improvement store and ask who they would recommend another thing that might help get a dehumidifier as well fairly inexpensive to purchase i would avoid using air freshener as a long term idea since since it will not fix the problem it does make you feel at ease until you can get it fixed hope this helps Air conditioning Home repair Computer virus HVAC Hamster Extreme Programming Bong CPU cache Cannabis cultivation Carburetor Central processing unit Windows XP Thermal power station Fume hood Dairy Tire Breastfeeding Debugging Ventilation Autonomous building Fecal incontinence Knife Jet engine Air purifier Redundant array of independent disks Hard disk Traumatic brain injury Multiple chemical sensitivity M60 machine gun Motor oil Air pollution Propeller Hearing aid Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Mattress Androgen insensitivity syndrome Halitosis Trademark Windows Vista Energy development Stuttering Dialysis Casting Web crawler Common cold Anti-aircraft warfare Mutual fund Welding X Window System Java programming language Cache System 7 (Macintosh) Sailing Contact lens E85 Electrical wiring Toyota Prius Canary Pretty Good Privacy Cheese Phishing Disc brake Pet skunk Japanese toilet Bicycle brake systems Ashton-Tate Strap-on dildo Fancy rat Soap opera Radar Object-oriented programming Surveillance Gas metal arc welding Ammonia Mach kernel Heinkel He 112 Guinea pig Burglar alarm Diving Motorcycle Heinkel He 100 Nuclear fallout Diseases of the honeybee Obsessive-compulsive disorder Bulk vending Marathon (sport) GunZ The Duel Grunge music Inflation Rebreather Steam (content delivery) Drill bit Radio controlled airplane Mitsubishi 3000GT Road-rule enforcement camera Dehumidifier PNG Geodesic dome
