how high up should water appear in a front loading washing machine i noticed at the laundrymat that the water does not appear at the bottom of the window it only rises just below presumably filling a basin below that the perforated washer chamber cylnder spins thru i know that they've had a problem with patrons putting in too much soap and causing an overflow i'm wondering if they are reducing the water level in the washer to combat that problem and cut down on their costs for water and hot water very cheap place i used the laundrymat today and my clothes seem to be clean and free of soap the rinse cycle is the same low water situation so maybe the washer is not designed to have water at the height of the door front loaders do not use as much water as top loaders if it is high efficiency it uses even less water the water does not come up to the window Washing machine Dry cleaning Sento Sewage treatment Toilet Tattoo Plumbing fixture Tidal power Two-stroke cycle IPod Dam Seismic retrofit Internal ballistics Hard water Laundry Soap Wind turbine Dishwasher Bong Krag-J__rgensen Textile manufacturing Upholstery Jet engine Dairy Dishwashing Menstrual cup M16 (rifle) Spark plug Steam engine Laundromat T-64 Garbage truck Diesel engine Thermal power station Hard disk Nuclear power Tractor Clinker (boat building) Japanese tea ceremony Recumbent bicycle Fountain Energy development Four-stroke cycle Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Mattress Stirling engine Car washing techniques Library (computer science) Brewery Bicycle Motor oil Machine gun Paintball marker Electrophysiology ZX Spectrum Panama Canal Detergent Automobile Tank Wave power Virtual memory CPU cache Soap bubble Turbocharger Tide Flush toilet Equine conformation Water RISC Cruising (maritime) Fusion power T-72 Coffee Air gun Solar cell Windows XP Hydrogen economy Motorcycle Solar power Floppy disk Air conditioning Drainage Autogyro IBM PC compatible Sport utility vehicle Carburetor Rise of the Robots M60 machine gun Electric motor Wound Fire fighting Urinal Loudspeaker Commodore 64 Oscilloscope Pebble bed reactor Toyota Prius Transformer
