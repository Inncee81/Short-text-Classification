i know partially hydrogenated oils are unhealthy what about hydrogenated oils is it the same thing or is this ok to eat fully hydrogenated oils are saturated fats they occur naturally and artificially partially hydrogenated oil is the same idea but it hasn't been fully hydrogenated and there are still one or more double bonds between the carbons in the fatty acid chains when this is done artificially the fatty acid can bend into a trans conformation making a trans fat essentially this means that the sides of the fatty acid chain bend toward each other like where represents the double bond there are some natural unsaturated fats and those have a cis conformation in which the chains bend away from each other these are more easily broken down by the enzymes our bodies make Trans fat Hydrogenation Saturated fat Omega-3 fatty acid Alkane Fatty acid metabolism Nutrition Margarine Fat Lipid Biochemistry Enzyme Medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency Carboxylic acid Amino acid Alkene Biomolecule IUPAC nomenclature Triglyceride Hair conditioner Hydrogen Protein Nutrient Protein structure Hydrocarbon Chemical formula Atkins Nutritional Approach Water (molecule) Serine protease Ethylene Hydrogen sulfide Cracking (chemistry) Acid Peanut butter Insulin Benzene Vitamin Polymerase chain reaction Propionic acid Covalent bond Ketone E number Biodiesel Cannabinoids Olive oil Polymerization Cooking oil Alcohol Veganism Biotin Haloalkane Polymer Organic chemistry Nucleic acid Cheese Acetic acid South Beach diet Sulfur Carbon dioxide Abiogenic petroleum origin Coenzyme A Milk Hydrogen bond Cellular respiration Cell (biology) Wax Hypercholesterolemia Linus Pauling Photosynthesis Energy development Alkyl Tocotrienol Tocopherol Hemoglobin Ascorbic acid Cyanide Citric acid cycle Biological membrane French fries Formic acid Peptide Gastric acid Protein-energy malnutrition Isomer Oily fish Soap Sulfuric acid Francis Crick Hypoglycemia Hydrogen chloride Soil Adrenoleukodystrophy DNA Plastic Coronary heart disease Mustard oil Petroleum Hydrogen peroxide
