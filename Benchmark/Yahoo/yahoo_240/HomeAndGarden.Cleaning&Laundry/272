how do you get white heat marks off wooden table tops the marks you have are actually caused by moisture being forced in and trapped under the wood finish and possibly into the wood fibers themselves you can try to cover this up but the best thing to do is to try to help the water escape so buy some heet gasoline additive it's designed to remove moisture from gas tanks it's basically isopropanol you should also get latex gloves and a clean white rag put on the gloves wet the rag a bit and test an inconspicuous area on the piece of furniture in question by rubbing the wet rag against it slightly isopropanol will remove and affect some finishes if the test goes ok and you see no ill effect on the finish then slowly try the same thing on the area with the white ring take your time do not rush it's not a race if the finish mars or you see color on the rage stop if not keep going you should start to see subtle improvement with each application each time you brush the surface with heet you're helping to dissipate and release some of the moisture trapped there depending on how bad the ring is you may never be able to remove it all it sounds weird but it works i've done it myself on a very nice table top just be careful and please test first to make sure that you don't have an 'old school' finish that could be affected Mattress Isopropyl alcohol Upholstery Pottery Casting Woodworking Explosive material Plastic Diving suit Gilding Bong Paint Strap-on dildo Fire extinguisher Textile manufacturing Drill bit Tattoo Brewery Fire fighting Thermal power station Dry cleaning Internal ballistics Glossary of wildland fire terms Seismic retrofit Molotov cocktail Condom Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Deforestation Fecal incontinence Carburetor Brush Spark plug Hamster Violin Manicure Gas tungsten arc welding Sewage treatment Acne Weather lore Survival skills Central processing unit Gas metal arc welding Stove Laws of cricket Shoe polish Poker jargon Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Paper Hash table Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Tire Desert Sulfuric acid Laser engraving Natural gas Drainage Tai shogi Dairy Extreme Programming M16 (rifle) Tooth Dai dai shogi Professional wrestling match types Nintendo Entertainment System Printmaking E85 Fiberglass Corrosion Tanning Carbon nanotube M60 machine gun Opportunity rover Diving regulator Urinary incontinence Friction Rebreather Nuclear explosion 2005 Atlantic hurricane season Mars Exploration Rover Hemp Soap Carbon dioxide Water Billiards Lighting Dietary fiber Transformer Chopsticks Diesel engine Electrical wiring Glossary of firefighting terms Gravity Gypsy moth Aerial (dance move) Guqin Fancy rat Vacuum cleaner
