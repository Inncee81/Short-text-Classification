whirlpool gold washer years old fills and drains won't agitate or spin but makes noises like it is washing machine experts should i try to repair or replace ps the load just prior to it breaking down had a pillow and it became unbalanced and the machine banged around alot before i heard it did i break a belt or something thanks that model has no belt it s a direct drive your problem is the coupler assembly between the motor and transmission is broken because of overloading a common problem with whirlpool and kenmore top loaders it s not really that big a deal though the coupler kit has to be replaced it s worth approximately more than that and you re getting ripped off labour takes between and minutes tops so that should give you an idea of your total cost if you phone around and get labour quotes it takes me roughly minutes from start to finish if everything goes good you may even get a good flat rate for the whole job if you pay cash and don t need a receipt dena f unfortunately that s not the problem in this case because the washer won t spin also if it was an agitator problem the washer would still spin the only reason it drains in this case is because the pump is attached to one end of the motor so as long as the motor runs it ll drain but because the coupler is broken the motor can t drive the transmission for either wash or spin Washing machine Electric motor Rail terminology IPod Toyota Prius Cruising (maritime) Commodore 64 Atari 8-bit family Thermal power station E85 Textile manufacturing Dishwasher Tractor Motorcycle Fossil fuel power plant Manual transmission Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Robot Wars Tire Ford Motor Company Winning Streak Upholstery Dry cleaning Coupling (railway) Hydraulic machinery 24 Hours of Le Mans Floppy disk Wheel of Fortune Wind turbine Surveillance Motor oil Bicycle Microeconomics Paintball Krag-J__rgensen Filling station Casting Transmission (mechanics) Airsoft Carburetor Radio controlled car Siphon Lathe Elevator Diesel engine Paintball marker Industrial Revolution Indianapolis 500 Automatic transmission Dairy Chevrolet Corvair engine Drag racing Modem Lionel Corporation American Motors Brewery Compact disc Home repair Turbocharger Table saw Weight training CPU cache Pittsburgh Steelers Ford Mustang RuneScape Mini-Games Ford Ranger EV Whitewater Spark plug Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Dialysis Labor theory of value High-voltage direct current The Amazing Race All-terrain vehicle Truck M60 machine gun Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Autogyro Electrical generator Hendrick Motorsports $ale of the Century Semi-trailer Babe Ruth Toilet humour M16 (rifle) Hybrid vehicle Slot machine Phonograph General Motors Mars Exploration Rover Inflation Ford Thunderbird T-64
