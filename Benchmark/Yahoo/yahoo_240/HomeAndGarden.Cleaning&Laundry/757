how can i keep clean laundry from smelling musty smells great after washing could it be the dryer i use fabric softener and dryer sheets sometimes things even smell good after drying but sitting in the basket they develop the odor is there some way to really super clean the dryer first when drying clothes make sure they get completely dry if they are going to sit in a basket for awhile if they are not completely dry hang them up or put them on a drying rack if they sit in a basket and are not completely dry they will develop mildew as for the smell run the washer on the hottest water setting and pour a cup of vinegar into it even if they smell great after washing now is as good a time as any to clean it as for the dryer reach in and wipe down the surface with an a clorox cleaning wipe or even a baby wipe make sure you get every nook and cranny then run the dryer on the highest heat setting with a few towels the terry cloth acts as an abrasive with a dryer sheet made with baking soda arm and hammer makes dryer sheets i think if that doesn't work then you might want to consult an appliance repair shop to see what they suggest good luck Washing machine Upholstery Menstrual cup Car washing techniques Textile manufacturing Vinegar Cookware and bakeware Sauna Diaper Dry cleaning Wok Casting Manicure Laundry Urticaria Dairy Japanese toilet Plastic Procter & Gamble Jewish cuisine Brewery Laundry detergent Japanese tea ceremony Kitchen Soap Tattoo Diving suit Tofu Bong Sodium hydroxide Printmaking Ironing Gilding Animal Crossing Cruising (maritime) Toilet paper Wound Comanche Toilet Compost Bread Feet washing Acetic acid Hydrogen peroxide Glass Sushi Clothing Hand washing Jute Sulfuric acid Lake Black pepper Blood Simple Fecal incontinence Knife Detergent Water Luck Cocoa Drill bit Paper Tlingit Home repair Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Hot air balloon Deluge (mythology) Glossary of climbing terms Steel Microfiber Laundromat Hygiene Coffee Shoe Charles Goodyear Sodium carbonate Cannabis cultivation Oxyacetylene Top-bar hive Novelty (locomotive) Domestic water system Leather Citric acid Tea Baby bottle Wudu Water purification Basement Thermal power station Hangi Repouss__ and chasing Dialysis Motor oil Garden Strawberry
