i live with two roommates and i would like help planning a cleaning schedule for the house we live in a townhouse and a large living room with bath i would much rather clean the kitchen cause i just don't like the way they do it but they don't like to empty the trash in the kitchen and it overflows i don't like emptying the trash either but i do it it's like i'm the parent and they are the kids and i do everything and they only clean unless i ask them specifically to avoid all of the asking i need help doing a cleaning schedule if i didn't clean this place would be a disaster area any suggestions i've lived in different apartments before now this being my rd my first was with guys counting myself the other were college baseball players last year it was guys counting myself of my roommates consumed more alcohol than i thought was humanly possible i wrote out every bill for years gradually they would pay me back in cash about a week after i wrote the bill the best thing for you to do is realize which out of the two roommates you have is more responsible than the other consult with them and mention how cleaning isn't getting done or just be blunt with them and tell them both straight up i know how you feel with your position because i couldn't wait to get my own apartment and keep it looking nice like an apartment should i threatened one of my roommates years ago that if he wouldn't pick up his clothes it's going out on the lawn but made sure there were no hard feelings after all they are still your friends just sometime make them realize what you do point it out and make sure you do it face to face over the phone or in an email won't do it but make them realize what you do and what they don't do you'll probably have to be the parent of the house and run things if you really start to notice than one particular person does not take out the trash tell them to if they say no ask them when the last time they took it out was more than likely they'll stutter best of luck addition although it all seems completely like common sense to you i still have pitty for my old roommates that they were either too spoiled growing up or had many things handed to them some just have problems and some are too lazy and don't realize some things only take seconds like rinsing out a bowl or a plate hopefully you get everything figured out and sometimes just relax Friends Avenue Q Shaggy dog story Social rule Humphrey Bogart The Contender (television series) The Amazing Race Piccolo Junior Saga The Catcher in the Rye Major League Baseball television contracts Sento About a Boy The Apprentice 2 Blonde on Blonde Ben Johnson (athlete) The Fairly OddParents Aerial (dance move) Blood on the Tracks The Inside Transactional analysis 2000 Australian Grand Prix Textile manufacturing Customs and etiquette of Japan Rent (musical) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Pittsburgh Steelers Poker jargon Recurring South Park characters Please Save My Earth New York Giants Jumpstart 3rd Grade Satchel Paige Pok__mon Live!
