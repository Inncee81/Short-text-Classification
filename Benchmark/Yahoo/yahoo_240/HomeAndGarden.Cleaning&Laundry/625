why are the fleas worse i tried flea bombs that didn't work tried the home made solutions yesterday salt borax lemon water mothballs and this morning it's worse took out a mattress they seemed to love now what no it's not dangerous to use bombs in an room house with a basement and i did call an exterminator who told me it would take days to kill fleas and told me some of these home remedies well flea bombs only kill the live fleas they do nothing to kill the eggs larve so i'm guessing you are in the middle of a new cycle of little pests or some of your foggers may not have discharged properly and if that is was the case the fleas may have fled to a room that wasn't treated like say a basement or attic space if that is the case you may be able to call the number and get a refund if you have the receipt it's important when treating your home for fleas that you leave closets and cabinets open and treat all floors enen a basement so having said here's what you do go to the wholesale club and buy yourself some baking soda lbs for and iodized salt and mix them together in a ziplock or whatever sprinkle that on your carpets the baking soda will smoother the larve and the salt will puncture and kill the eggs i would leave this on overnight it's not harmful to pets or children get a flea collar and put it in your bagless vacuum or in the bag and the next day vacuum really really well and either throw away the bag in a sealed grocery bag or empty the bagless outside away from the house you can use the baking soda salt on the furniture as well if you have an animal it would be a good time to go to petsmart and get zodiac flea drops for your pet they are a lot cheaper than frontline advantage and they work treat your pet if you are worried give your pet a bath and use dawn dishsoap or any dishsoap you have and leave it on for about min that will kill any fleas on your pet if you do not have a pet talk to some friends that do and see if you can borrow their pet before it is treated with flea tick drops and use it as bait let the pet hang out at your house for acouple days and then use the drops the fleas will be killed you also may want to treat your yard with a flea bomb or liquid treatment i know that ortho makes several wet dry applications you still may need to in acouple weeks bomb and keep up with the vacuuming to check for more fleas leave a desk lamp out at night shining into a white light dish with a bit of water and some dishsoap the fleas are attracted to the warm light and when they jump into the water the dishsoap makes them stick and they die good luck Flea Bedbug Hamster Mattress Vacuum cleaner Chicken Bread Plastic Tea Cannabis cultivation The Inside Dog Fancy rat Carbon dioxide Animal Crossing Toilet humour Diseases of the honeybee Kitchen EastEnders Cat James Hanratty Tofu Mouth ulcer Jewish cuisine Sea-Monkey Garfield Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Sodium Theory of conduct Spidey Super Stories Ultraviolet Lighting Egg (food) Vinegar Shaggy dog story Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Battery (electricity) Dialysis Basement Illegal drug trade USS Tunny (SS-282) Tlingit Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Water (molecule) Pancake Autonomous building Vacuum Dairy John Frusciante Brewery Pet skunk The Dalek Invasion of Earth Red Hot Chili Peppers Insomnia Dog training Solar power Rabies Ocean's Twelve Rebreather Customs and etiquette of Japan Bacon The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe The Pet Sounds Sessions Fire fighting Breakfast Chinchilla Kodocha Domestic rabbit Urinary incontinence The Young Ones (TV series) Electrophysiology Water Coffee Hydroponics Charles Peace Betting (poker) Reservoir Dogs The Lovely Bones Donald Rumsfeld Ferret Sin City Fire extinguisher Paint Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Planet of the Daleks Social rule StarCraft: Uprising Tobacco I Want to Hold Your Hand Night (book) Bong Columbine High School massacre Carburetor First aid
