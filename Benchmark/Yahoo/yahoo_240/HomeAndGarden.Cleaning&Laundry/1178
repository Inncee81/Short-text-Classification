is it safe to use laundry dye on my screen tees http www hottopic com hottopic store product jsp folder c efolder id product c eprd id bmuid is it safe to use laundry die on this shirt along with my other screen tees you can re dye screened tees but you may find that the dye will also go in between small spaces left inside the screened design this is especially true if the t shirt is an older one and the screened design is cracked or thin please note the suggestions i'm giving are for dying fabric the same color or very close to the original color trying to change a fabric's color completely is more involved for instance you can dye an orange shirt red but you can't make it yellow if the shirt is black it's got to stay black you can redye the shirt and protect the design in two ways take a q tip dip into a bit of dye and put a small dab on a tiny part of the design to test let it sit for ten minutes or so the dye should wipe away with a damp cloth leaving the design clean put something between the layers of the t shirt so the dye doesn't get on the back of the shirt if you want to make sure the dye doesn't adhere to the design cover the design with a resist this involves patience and a steady hand because you'll be painting the resist over the design ensuring that no dye will seep in common resists are waxes or gutta i would use gutta because it's easier to work with and you don't have to heat it make sure you test the gutta to see if it dissolves the paint though again test a tiny area if you use this method be sure to put something behind the design so you don't have any bleeding through the fabric you can buy clear gutta from dharma trading company online they can also answer questions you may have sounds like a lot of work huh it is rit dye costs about per package gutta will also run five or six bucks if you're not happy with the shirt's color it might be easier and just about as cheap to buy a new one personally i would skip trying the resist and just dye the shirt after testing an area good luck Plastic Casting Upholstery Textile manufacturing Printed circuit board Pysanka Light-emitting diode Undergarment Floppy disk Inkjet printer Batik Compact disc Welding Tattoo Wind turbine Color Paint Paintball Cochineal Solar cell Condom B-47 Stratojet Paul Is Dead Kimono Chromium Integrated circuit Christmas tree Leather Circuit design Aluminium Technicolor Extreme Programming Electrophysiology Textile manufacturing terminology Strap-on dildo JavaServer Pages Internal ballistics The Warriors Clothing CPU design Poker jargon Traditional animation Seismic retrofit Aerial (dance move) Staining (biology) Printmaking Titanium Shirt M16 (rifle) Windows 2000 Animal Crossing Parachute Brewery Knife Equine conformation Mattress Dairy Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act DVD Social rule Tag T-shirt CD-R MP3 Bong Tie-dye Weaving Curling Top-bar hive Diseases of the honeybee Dry cleaning Indigo dye Sento Leaf Pottery Wood carving Illegal drug trade Diamond enhancement Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Glossary of American football Menstrual cup Ironing Chicago White Sox Typewriter Fire fighting Oxyacetylene Doctor (Doctor Who)
