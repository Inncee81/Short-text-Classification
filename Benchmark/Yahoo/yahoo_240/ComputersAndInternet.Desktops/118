a question about my pc's power supply how do i determine the wattage voltage on my power supply i've looked at it but it doesn't have any text on it the sticker may be on the closed side of the case or just out of plain view with the cover off with the computer off try to look at all six sides of the power supply for a sticer if your computer is a dell or made by a popular manufacture you can usually get default machine specifications on there website note i know little about electricity but never open a power supply unless you are trained as fatal amounts of electricity pass through your power supply hope this helps mike Operational amplifier Floppy disk Welding Circuit design Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Incandescent light bulb Transformer Transistor Capacitor Hall effect Liquid crystal display Overclocking Electrical generator Electric motor Battery (electricity) Action potential Computer case Thermal power station C programming language Commodore 64 GunBound Uninterruptible power supply Gas metal arc welding Rail transport modelling Turing machine Central processing unit Password Universal Serial Bus Electronic power supply Wind turbine Solar cell Loudspeaker Diode Third rail High-voltage hazards Arc welding Vacuum tube Laptop TGV Synthesizer Volt Overhead lines Hybrid vehicle Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME O scale Electronic amplifier Pinball Mouse (computing) 2003 North America blackout Welding power supply Spacecraft propulsion ATX Bicycle lighting Capacitor plague Electrophysiology Electric power Monopsony STS-61 Mainframe computer Computer Alternating current Spark plug Labor theory of value Law of value MOSFET Microphone Apple II family Residual-current device Power supply Solar power Circuit breaker Resistor Internal combustion engine Hard disk Altair 8800 Overhead powerline Magnet Current source Computer-aided design War of Currents SmartRider Expert system Windows XP Stage lighting On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Sinclair ZX81 Electricity pylon Water turbine Impedance matching Monty Hall problem Semiconductor device Cathode ray tube XML Audiophile Voltage source Dairy DVD Internal ballistics
