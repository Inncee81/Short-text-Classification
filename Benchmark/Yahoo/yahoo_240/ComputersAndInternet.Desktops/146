buying a computer help hi i am supposed to be buying a computer for work unfortunately i don't really know what i am looking for i tried to build one on dell but i ended up confusing myself so if anyone has a minute and could help me out i'd be very grateful the requirement i need are ghz processor mb ram gig hard drive k modem mbps ethernet nerwork card and a mb zip or flash drive thanks my suggestion would be to build one but i'm not sure of your computer expertise if you are looking for a system then there are some relatively cheap systems that fit your needs see link below the only thing is that a zip drive is not going to come standard with almost any modern system so you'll need to buy one they are relatively inexpensive though and any local computer shop could sell you one as well as install it IMac IBook USB flash drive Personal computer Laptop Commodore 64 Floppy disk PlayStation 3 PlayStation 2 PowerPC IBM PC compatible Apple Macintosh Mac mini Apple II family Ethernet Overclocking Binary prefix Booting Nintendo Revolution Modem Computer hardware The Sims 2 Apple Newton Hard disk Windows XP Desktop computer Computer ThinkPad Redundant array of independent disks Copy protection Wi-Fi Sharp Zaurus Atari 8-bit family Sega Saturn Apple IIGS Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Computer bus PC Engine Xserve IBM PC Xerox Star CompactFlash Universal Serial Bus Digital Subscriber Line Atari ST MAME Windows 2000 Embedded system Random access memory Timeline of computing 1990-forward Symbolics AirPort Windows Vista Zip drive Computer and video games Nintendo Entertainment System Nintendo GameCube History of computing hardware (1960s-present) Amiga ZX Spectrum Commodore International Xbox 360 NeXT TRS-80 Color Computer Sega Dreamcast TiVo Wireless LAN PowerBook IBM Personal System/2 Linux EMac WiMAX Microcontroller Atari 2600 64-bit MSX System/36 IPod Kaypro Acorn Computers IEEE 802.11 IBM Amstrad CPC AmigaOS Gigabyte Windows XP Media Center Edition Windows 3.x PC motherboard Computer network IPAQ Secure Digital card Computing Sound Blaster Surveillance History of computer and video games Doom 3 Digital Equipment Corporation Mainframe computer
