does dell or alienware have crap software if there is other brand computers that aint got no crap software please list them thanksss alienware was bought by dell in so don't expect a whole lot of difference in the software provided by either one dell has said that it would be cutting back on the amount of crapware installed on some of their machine but most will still remain unless you purchase a computer with no pre installed software expect to get some crapware the best way to avoid it is to build your own computer and install what you want heck depending on ones definition windows could be considered to have crapware included drm for example or it is even considered to be totally crapware by some remember with only a very rare exceptions you don't really buy software you buy a license to use it as is and agree not to alter it Spyware Windows XP Digital rights management Linux Mac OS X Commodore International Copyright infringement of software Alienware Dell, Inc.
