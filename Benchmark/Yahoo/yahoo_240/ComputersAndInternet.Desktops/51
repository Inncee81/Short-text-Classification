what should i upgrade next on my computer alright here are my specs my processor is an amd dual core i have gigs of ram gigs of hardrive space left my graphics card is a sapphire x xt mb pcie now according to my vista score my processor gets a and it is the lowest score but i don't want to base my upgrade on just vista i have two slots of dual memory channel left and my processor slot is am my computer's model is an hp a n with a thermaltake purepower express watt power supply that is soley for the graphics card i want to turn my computer into a gaming rig as of now i can run most games at max to med settings i don't want to upgrade if i wont see at least a fps increase i really dont want to change my motherboard and seeing as it only has one pcie slot i cant go crossfire or sli i really dont plan on upgrading the graphics card for some time as i just got it and it does wonders for me the psu is made just for the graphic cards and all it provides is two v at so im good there i have another psu for the acutual computer to be honest that's a pretty sturdy gaming rig you've got there the cpu would probably be the first thing i'd upgrade if you've got cash to burn the amd x only costs about www pricegrabber co uk and will give you a good performance boost you might be able to overclock the one you've already got if you improve the cooling but this does come with risks the next thing would be the graphics card the x xt was one of the best dx cards out there but it's about a year old now and all the talk is about dx direct x compatible cards being the future of gaming however the only dx game right now is lost planet and that game really isn't anything special so until they start releasing decent dx or even dx only games i'd save you money and wait for the price on dx cards to drop so cards like the gtx ultra which will never run with a w psu which cost well over are probably a waste of money right now if you're serious about gaming you might want to consider getting two identical hdds and running them in a raid configuration this turns the two drives into one with double the data transfer rate and before someone flames me they don't need to be identical it's just easier more ram is always good but gb should be adequate for your needs as you start upgrading your cpu and graphics cards your system will require more power so a more powerful psu will be needed i always recommend buying bigger than you need as stressing your psu by running it close to max power output will cause it to fail sooner rather than later and they can take all sorts of things down with them when they go i really hope that all this helps you out good luck upgrading and happy gaming ATI Technologies Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Atari 8-bit family CPU cache Apple Macintosh CPU design RISC Microprocessor Windows XP PC motherboard Amiga Pentium 4 Windows Vista 3dfx Redundant array of independent disks IBM PC Athlon PC Engine Opteron AMD Laptop MIPS architecture Apple IIGS Celeron PlayStation 2 Scalable Link Interface Apple II family NVIDIA Commodore 64 TRS-80 Color Computer IMac ZX Spectrum Sega Saturn Power Macintosh G3 Computer bus Hard disk NForce4 64-bit Linux kernel Nintendo Revolution MSX Nintendo 64 PowerPC Xbox 360 Data General Nova PCI Express PlayStation Portable IA-32 Timeline of computing 1990-forward GeForce 7 Series VIA Technologies Poker jargon Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Windows 2000 X86 Mac OS X Atari 2600 Amstrad CPC Cyrix Game Boy Advance Dual-core Nintendo GameCube Front side bus Mach kernel Computer and video games Xbox NX bit Microsoft Windows Floppy disk AmigaOS Computer workstation SETI@home INMOS Transputer Intellivision SAM Coup__ Computer CDC 6600 Linux System/36 Pentium M Sinclair ZX81 Accelerated Graphics Port
