graphics memory problem with ati radeon xpress hi guys my pc has an ati radeon xpress chip built into the motherboard not seperate card and i recently went on to sandra lite and it stated that out of the mb of ram it has of it from the system memory and is from the module itself is their any way i can change this balance so that my computer has more ram for other tasks thanks thereds different types of intergrated graphics theres s m a shared memory architecture which is when the graphics permenently borrows a part of the system memory such as mb to add to its own mb onboard video memory which gives it mb video memory then theres turbocache memory built into stand alone graphic cards which the cards come with say mb and can borrow as much as it needs normally up to mb and will give the memory back as soon as its finished the application or game this is better as you dont actually lose the memory such as when you look in system propereties there will be gb there were as in s m a you would only see mb or round about as the onboard video has borrowed it onboard video can be altered in some bios settings however it depends on a the type of chipset b the type of bios c the amount of system ram go into set up press delete at start up and go to either advanced chipset features or pnp pci configurations and locate the settings which allow you to alter the amount of video memory note some bios set ups simply wont allow you to do this or it may not be there to do in the first place it all depends on the bios version in some bios you can lower your video to as low as mb however this is not recommended as it will affect your p c s performace the lowest i would ever set your p c s video memory is mb however at this you would struggle to play games but it would be fine for general internet and office tasks after any changes allways go back to the main set up screen and save and exit set up to save any changes to the cmos while it saves the changes to cmos do not turn off your p c i hope this helps good luck mate Radeon 3dfx Apple Macintosh GeForce 4 Personal computer IBM PC compatible Windows 2000 Windows Vista Graphics card Radeon X Series Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Graphics processing unit The Sims 2 Commodore 64 Amiga Atari 8-bit family AmigaOS Nintendo GameCube PlayStation Portable Atari ST Blue screen of death Modchip Counter-Strike GeForce FX Redundant array of independent disks Commodore 128 Sound Blaster Power Macintosh G3 Dynamic random access memory PlayStation 3 Original Amiga chipset CMOS Computer bus PC Engine Apple II family History of Microsoft Windows Xbox 360 DDR2 SDRAM Front side bus Microprocessor Windows XP IBM PC Sega Dreamcast Apple IIGS Knoppix Computer VIA Technologies Northbridge (computing) Embedded system NForce4 Read-only memory Advanced Technology Attachment Emacs CPU design AMD History of operating systems MSX Far Cry Acorn Electron Slot machine Doom 3 Sinclair ZX81 Motherboard S3 Graphics Power-On Self Test Industry Standard Architecture Nintendo Entertainment System Microsoft Windows Neo-Geo X Window System Overclocking GeForce Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Mac OS X PlayStation 2 Nintendo 64 Amstrad CPC Texas Instruments TI-99/4A CPU cache ZX Spectrum Computer forensics Virtual memory Betting (poker) Sega Saturn Cisco PIX OpenGL Computer role-playing game Mouse (computing) NForce2 Creative Technology
