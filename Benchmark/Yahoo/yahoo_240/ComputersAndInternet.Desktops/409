can i reinstall windows on my dell can i do this myself i know how to or do i have to send it to dell can you understand that i already know how to do it i know how to reformat partitions make new ones etc i just want to fix it for my buddy i reinstall windows on my custom pc all the time i just want to know if they have to retarded rule or program that makes it send it to them because its dell it depends on a couple things do you have all the installation cd's windows driver files have you backed up all the data that's important and stored all the information required to reconfigure email and internet have you done this before imho if you have not done it before get some help or send it off if you have then go ahead i would strongly recommend formatting the drive before re installing if you decide to go ahead then basically re boot the computer with the windows cd in the drive during re boot it should ask if you want to boot from cd say yes once into the setup program follow the prompts and make sure you choose new installation at the drive assignments delete them first then re create the partition this ensures the drive will be formatted before proceeding this can be a risky process if you don't have the drivers and do not have another computer handy to connect to the internet to get drivers before starting i suggest to go to the dell web site enter the express service code and download all the drivers onto a mem stick or burn them onto a cd for use when you have finished the installation during the installation just make sure to read all the prompts and understand what they say again if you have not done it before then i suggest getting some help or sending it away the nice thing about installing yourself is then you don't have a lot of excess programs and settings just plain windows and drivers to start with you will notice it runs quite good before all the crap of a couple years drags it down good luck brad Windows XP Linux Windows 2000 Computer virus AmigaOS MDAC Knoppix Booting Partition (computing) Spyware Pretty Good Privacy Common Unix Printing System File system ITunes Hard disk Virtual memory Portable Document Format DOS Redundant array of independent disks Gmail USB flash drive System 7 (Macintosh) Windows registry Domain Name System System/36 CPU cache Microsoft Windows Malware Perl Novell NetWare Disk cloning IPod MS-DOS IBM PC compatible Computer forensics NTFS Computer Modem Rootkit Windows 3.x Copy protection E-mail spam XML Logo programming language Java programming language System/34 MAME MP3 History of Microsoft Windows OS/2 Unicode Windows Vista Windows Server 2003 Commodore 64 Floppy disk Web crawler PaX Expert system E-mail Digital rights management Architecture of Windows 2000 Extreme Programming Surveillance Bluetooth OpenOffice.org Blue screen of death CPU design Linked list AOL Instant Messenger X Window System Disk formatting Internet Relay Chat Atari 8-bit family Btrieve Online music store Common criticisms of Microsoft Filename extension Microsoft Jet Database Engine Digital photography PNG DragonFly BSD Debugging Library (computer science) Trusted computing Apple Computer Data retention Macromedia Flash HTTP cookie Outlook Express Enterprise content management Stopping e-mail abuse Computer security GIF Visual Basic
