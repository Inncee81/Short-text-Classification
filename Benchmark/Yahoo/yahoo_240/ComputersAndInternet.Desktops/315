why do i have a black error message when i turn on my dell computer my son turned the computer off at the tower and when i turned it on the next day it had a black screen with an error message about being shut down incorrectly but gives the option to start with the last known work configuration it switches over to the dell startup screen and then goes right back to the error black screen how can i fix this the black screen you are seeing is the windows startup menu you will see this window if your system fails to shut down properly or if you have some type of error sounds like your son shutdown the computer improperly you can't just turn off the computer you need to choose start shut down turn off if you use xp when the system restarts use the up down arrows and choose start windows normally this should get you back into windows if there is a problem your system may restart itself and you will be back to the start menu again if this is the case you have an error either hardware or software that is preventing windows from starting up normally you can as the other responder said choose use last know good configuration that might fix the issue if not you will need to get the system to a knowledgeable repair center or person to see what is going on Blue screen of death Windows XP Embedded system Windows 2000 Screenshot Microsoft Windows AmigaOS Booting IBM PC compatible System/36 Software bug Computer virus Ethernet Windows Vista Atari 8-bit family System/34 Windows Mobile Mouse (computing) Linux X Window System System 7 (Macintosh) Virtual memory Opera (web browser) Software testing Debugging Commodore 64 Steam (content delivery) Exception handling Common Unix Printing System Toyota Prius History of Microsoft Windows IPod Modem Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Pretty Good Privacy Personal computer Hello world program Year 2000 problem Floppy disk Apple Computer MDAC Mozilla Firefox Apple II family IBM PC keyboard Redundant array of independent disks Oscilloscope Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Expert system Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Newline Architecture of Windows 2000 Windows registry OpenBSD Interrupt Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 2 Motorola 68000 DR-DOS Mach kernel Spam (electronic) ZX Spectrum Global Positioning System Atari ST PaX Unicode Buffer overflow DVD Blaster worm Spyware Emacs Anonymous remailer Btrieve Apple IIGS Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Amiga Crash (computing) Mac OS X v10.4 Musical Instrument Digital Interface Capacitor plague MAME MAC address Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Amstrad CPC DESQview Windows Server 2003 Library (computer science) Common criticisms of Microsoft Server Esperanto orthography Microsoft BIOS Game programming Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME PlayStation 2 Information Technology Infrastructure Library
