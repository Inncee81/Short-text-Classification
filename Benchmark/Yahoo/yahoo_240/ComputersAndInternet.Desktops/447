pc issues files no longer there my pc froze up a few days ago so i had no choice but to turn it off my holding the power button in for a few seconds the problem was when i turned it back on the next day the pc acted like it was the first time i turned on ever like i just bought it asking me how i connect to the internet etc the settings i want to use etc and ive had this pc for almost a year well that for the most part is taken care off if nothing else it was annoying to go through the real issue is i am missing a lot of files for example my napster program is still on my pc but my music files are gone microsoft money is on my pc but my file i use that has all my financial info on it is missing like i have programs still on the pc that i installed after i first got it but a lot of the files i use with them are missing now could it be that i had a created directory the files were in and now they are just misplaced its hard for me to believe that the files just got deleted but most programs are fine if you have pertinent info you need in microsoft money it would be wise to take it to a reputable technician to recover the files if your daring then try system restore in the system tools of your programs to a time earlier than the malfunction remember when using system restore that anything you did from the time chosen to now will be deleted you can always download your napster stuff again if it isn't copyrighted material number one rule backup and often good luck File sharing Windows XP AmigaOS ITunes Microsoft Windows MDAC Online music store Linux Backup MP3 Peer-to-peer Windows Me Napster Computer virus Internet Relay Chat Digital rights management Macromedia Flash File system IPod Spyware MAME Microsoft Mouse (computing) Embedded system Copyright infringement of software Computer security Gnutella Kazaa Windows Server 2003 Windows registry Nintendo Malware NTFS E-mail System 7 (Macintosh) TeX BitTorrent Public domain Copy protection Screenshot Steam (content delivery) Java programming language SCO-Linux controversies Wget Windows 2000 Trusted computing History of Microsoft Windows Poker jargon Domain Name System Novell NetWare Library (computer science) Mozilla Firefox File Allocation Table ITunes Music Store Windows Installer Filename extension Pretty Good Privacy GunZ The Duel Streaming media System/36 Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Pitaten Cheating in Counter-Strike ROM image Btrieve Computer insecurity SonicStage Symbolic link Redundant array of independent disks System/34 Disk cloning DCPlusPlus OpenDocument ZX Spectrum Virtual memory Rootkit Year 2000 problem Computer Doctor Who missing episodes Floppy disk PHP Outlook Express Napster (pay service) Digital circuit Computer file Mac OS X Debugging IBM PC compatible WordStar CPU cache Podcasting Emacs Concurrent Versions System Microsoft .NET Pump It Up Justin Frankel Oracle database
