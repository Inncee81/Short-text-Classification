multiple os's multi format partitions i want to re partition my hard drive to house multiple operating systems but my question regards the partition format for example some os are ntfs and others are fat for example is it possible to have differently formatted partitions on the same hard disk and also is it possible to repartition without losing my files yes you can have multiple partitions on the same drive formatted differently fat is generally a good default format to start with especially for different flavors of microsoft windows as it is almost universally readable writable and you can later convert fat partitions to ntfs without losing your data programs like partitionmagic make the partitioning process pretty easy NTFS Partition (computing) File Allocation Table File system Windows 2000 Defragmentation Comparison of file systems Disk formatting MS-DOS File format Disk cloning Redundant array of independent disks Windows XP DOS Microsoft Windows AmigaOS NTLDR Ghost (software) USB mass storage device class Backup Mach kernel Floppy disk Filename extension NTFS junction point Linux Apple II family Booting History of Microsoft Windows Quicksort Fork (filesystem) Hard disk Knoppix Architecture of Windows 2000 Flash memory DragonFly BSD Universal Disk Format NX bit AS/400 Computer virus System 7 (Macintosh) Computer file XML System/36 Windows Vista Operating system Dual boot USB flash drive Portable Document Format Drive letter assignment MUMPS Hello world program Copy protection Dd (Unix) MP3 FreeDOS Library (computer science) Pretty Good Privacy Buffer overflow Visual Basic Symbolic link Enterprise content management Computer forensics ZIP (file format) Blue screen of death Btrieve Thread (computer science) HFS Plus Job Control Language Microdrive Secure Digital card RAM disk Binary and text files Common Unix Printing System Master Control Program MVS Magneto-optical drive X86 DOS Comparison Windows Server 2003 OpenVMS Data remanence Fdisk Windows Me .NET assemblies Screenshot Microsoft Binary prefix Universal Serial Bus Personal computer PaX ReiserFS Ontology (computer science) Computer storage DVD OpenOffice.org ITunes
