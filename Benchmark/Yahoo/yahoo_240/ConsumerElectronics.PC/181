can i play high quality pc games e g gta counter strike on the internet whithout installing them when you say high quality do you mean graphic wise or how well the game is made if you mean graphic wise then no and game with any amount of decent graphics will require your install something on your computer or else you will be loading packets and graphic information from the game's server all day and all that waiting time would make the game very boring to play indeed if you mean quality of the game content itself there's a limit of how much content you could put into let's say a flash based game for loading purposes so the games that you play exclusively on line will be fairly limited i personally find games at shockwave com and certain text based mudds fairly entertaining but i wouldn't call them high quality Macromedia Flash Website Xbox Web crawler Counter-Strike Computer MSN Messenger Windows XP Game programmer Computer role-playing game IBM PC compatible MMORPG Final Fantasy XI Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories Steam (content delivery) Domain Name System Teletext Embedded system Video game developer Four square Windows 2000 CPU cache Web design PNG Stars!
