my sons step mum has told my son that she will set him an email address i am worried that it will not be safe for him he is years old and i have not let him set one up because he can use my email then at least i can keep a check on them have i got good reason to tell her not to do it i'm a stepmother and my kids' biological mother let them onto the computer a few years ago i was strenuously opposed and was proved right the internet is a very hazardous street to let children play in and personally i'd rather my kids hadn't had it however you shouldn't tell her not to give him an e mail address first of all she isn't the person you should take these concerns to you only have authority to deal with your ex actually it makes perfect sense to voice your concerns to your ex but here's an irony i would do it over e mail so you have documentation of your conversation should things go to court if that's not an issue all you can do is voice your concerns to him in person and deal with whatever decision is made you can't control this because it's not illegal or a violation of your custody agreement your son is going to encounter the internet one way or another if he hasn't already so many parents just let their kids dive into it and odds are his friends have already given him a shot at it what you should do is make sure the computer in your home has netnanny or something similar that you know how to access history and are able to monitor him parentally and educate him about computers it might be good to sit down with him and want a dateline episode of to catch a predator and explain gently to him that there are very bad people on the internet and that he needs to update his don't talk to strangers for the new technology Plame affair E-mail Theory of conduct Surveillance Pretty Good Privacy Gmail Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Theodicy Karl Rove E-mail spam EastEnders Computer security Abortion debate Blue screen of death Computer virus God Emperor of Dune Anonymous remailer 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Computer forensics Spyware Scientology beliefs and practices Spam (electronic) Internet fraud Shaggy dog story The Fairly OddParents Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Neopets G-Man (Half-Life) Consensus decision-making CPU cache British national identity card Medicine 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities The Critic Social rule Internet pornography Opera (web browser) Infantilism Cyber bullying Sender Policy Framework Hearing impairment Password Motion picture rating system Polyamory Whaling The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Contract Friends Columbine High School massacre Public domain World Wide Web Child pornography Education Internet Transformers: Cybertron The Strangerhood Identity theft RuneScape cheats Same-sex marriage The Long Game Computer-supported collaboration Email authentication Copyright infringement of software Drug test Legal research Information Technology Infrastructure Library Stopping e-mail abuse Kender Fathers' rights Kyle Broflovski Trusted computing Computer Avenue Q SCO-Linux controversies The Big Goodbye (TNG episode) Kevin and Kell Game theory Transactional analysis Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Fathers' rights movement in the UK Little Britain Poker jargon Free will Domestic violence Software engineering Floppy disk Abramoff-Reed Indian Gambling Scandal Data retention Ben Johnson (athlete) MSN Messenger Kazaa Code: Lyoko XML Appeal Glen Jacobs
