lesbians do you go after straight women even if you know they are not gay i am curious my boss is a lesbian and even though i have nothing against homosexuals i feel very uncomfortable around her i catch her looking at me and i don't like it one bit she knows i am straight so i want to know if you give up after you find out the person you are interested in is not gay i really want to know i don't mean to insult anyone the problem is that she pays special attention to me like what i like to eat my hairstyle it does bug me but she is my boss and i need the job irvos depend on the guy if i like him then i won't mind it otherwise i would see it as nuisance artsparky thanks i never go after straight women because i know they aren't interested too much drama is involved now there are lesbians that find it a challenge to try to go after a straight woman much like how guys try to pick up girls you can never say that someone is or isn't interested purely by their sexual orientation if she continues to look at you look back at her the same way you would look at a guy showing you aren't interested showing her that you realize what she is doing she might get the hint and stop looking if she continues then say something to her maybe you are reading too much into the situation the majority of lesbians though do not chase after straight women Lesbian Gay Friends Human sexual behavior Sexual orientation Ex-gay LGBT Gender role Gay slang Kyle Broflovski Bisexuality Biology and sexual orientation Coming out Gay rights Homosexuality and transgender Anal sex Something Positive Transgender Domestic violence Anglican views of homosexuality Queer Will & Grace Kender Same-sex marriage Homosexuality Herbert Garrison Reparative therapy Aerial (dance move) Theory of conduct Strap-on dildo Yuri (animation) Choice and sexual orientation Stewie Griffin Homosexuality and Judaism Same-sex marriage in the United States The Critic Totally Spies!
