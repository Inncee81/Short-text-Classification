someone explain to me what the goddess is and it's connection to the lesbian community the origin rituals and how widely the religion is practiced if it is a religion it's either wicca dianism dianicism or dianic wicca i would wager one of the latter two if it's being related specifically to the lesbian community wicca usually involves worship of the god and the goddess equally and is populated by both men and women dianic wicca is a combination of regular or eclectic wicca and dianism explained below because it's a longer explanation dianism also dianicism is divided into two types old dianic and feminist dianic old dianic places greater importance in the goddess and honours the god as merely her consort both women and men are included in the same group feminist dianics worship the goddess alone in her triple goddess aspects maiden mother and crone only women are allowed in the groups most are accepting of any sexual orientation but a few covens consist of only lesbians while wiccans who gather in groups or circles almost always have a high priestess high priest or both dianics usually distribute responsibility among the entire group zsuzsanna budapest is one of the pioneering mothers of feminist dianism which began in the late s contrary to the name they do not worship only diana some don't include her in their personal 'pantheon' of deities at all wicca was started by gerald gardner in the s few of its components are original has been borrowed and pieced together from 'old religions' meaning almost every pagan religion under the sun can be found in it somewhere rituals vary enormously within each type and among every group or circle there are millions of wiccans around the world though i'm not sure exactly how many dianics there are Witchcraft Magic (paranormal) Hecate Goddess worship Anarchism and religion Feminism Zsuzsanna Budapest Sacrifice Roman mythology Diana (goddess) Horned God Triple Goddess Feminist movement Margaret Murray Paganism Gender role Lady Frieda Harris Voodoo Satanism Celtic mythology Neo-druidism Animism Gardnerian Wicca Ancient Greek religion Babylonian and Assyrian religion Polytheism Judaism Persecution of Wiccans Shinto Sexual orientation Priest The Two Babylons Homosexuality Religion God and gender Dionysus Trimurti God Mother goddess Isis Gerina Dunwich Marriage Prophet Biology and sexual orientation Greek mythology Satan Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Idolatry Magic and religion Witch-hunt Syncretism Germanic paganism Same-sex marriage Gaia (mythology) Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Sky father Baal Historical persecution by Christians Fundamentalism Thealogy Hinduism Slavic mythology El (god) Coven Religion and sexuality Lesbian Woman Demeter Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches Saint Sacred king Religious Society of Friends Matriarchy Love Aphrodite Roman Catholic Church Sabbath Maya mythology Prayer Human Wonder Woman Unitarian Universalism Wiccan Rede Mithraism Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Celtic polytheism Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Religion and sexual orientation Theology 613 mitzvot Religion and mythology
