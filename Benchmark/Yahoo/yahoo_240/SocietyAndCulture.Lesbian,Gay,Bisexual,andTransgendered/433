what's with the gay guys are always at the gym working out stereotype isn't it contradicting usually on tv we're shown as the skinny effeminate guys which isn't the case most of the time i know but now it's the guy who is always at the gym is the gay guy i don't know the stereotypes confuse me i don't let my tv define my world in fact i barely watch it i only watch the colbert report the office and hell's kitchen on my dvr but you know what i'm talking about and you know it's true there's totally a gay stereotype when it comes to television i don't agree with it at all did you see dusting in big brother or his ex they seem like stereotypical gays to me in the little tv i do watch i see the gay stereotypes some stereotypes are weird i guess if you see one gay guy at a gym it's automatically assumed that the guys always at the gym are gay that's how i think stereotypes start edit i barely watch tv but the way gays are portrayed are very stereotypical i agree the media has a lot to do with stereotypes and how they form i'm sure if they portrayed gays in a more diverse way stereotypes like that wouldn't be so out there Kyle Broflovski Friends Philosophical skepticism Gender role MTV Theory of conduct Canon (fiction) 2004 Democratic National Convention Humphrey Bogart Clone High Ren and Stimpy Pok__mon Live!
