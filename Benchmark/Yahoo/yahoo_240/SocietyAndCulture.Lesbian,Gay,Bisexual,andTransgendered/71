seriously what is wrong with this country ok so of course there should be nothing wrong with being gay and etc i did a whole senior project about homophobia but now that i've broadened my horizons and fed more into the homosexual world now i must come to solve why it is that most gay males are so darn superficial not to mention fake or maybe its just my area but then again this comes from the general problem of stereotyping already being fat is defintely not what society makes it nowadays being feminem as a male doesn't make unacceptable and 'hot' guys really aint that hot when u dig past the looks but labels just cover the truth now i'm one to not go by what the world thinks or society rather i go more by a little thing called personality ive met some of the coolest so called dorks and fatties that no one seems to want why can't people uphold this notion of diversity and acceptance for all everyone's always talking about cuz hooking up preferences is more a privilege not a right right on i agree with that people need to stop assuming that they are being kind towards others when they are really racist and act like they own the world and shove everyone away like outcasts people need to realize that but sadly most of them don't mostly because of religion too Homophobia Gay Sexual orientation Homosexuality and transgender Bisexuality Theory of conduct Gay rights Friends Human sexual behavior Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Transgender Religion and sexual orientation Avenue Q Transsexuality Homosexuality Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Asperger syndrome Little Britain Physical attractiveness Value system Racism Hate speech Aesthetic Realism Boston Public Gender role Societal attitudes towards homosexuality Abortion debate Simone Weil Marriage Same-sex marriage Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Separation of church and state Political correctness Social justice Characters from Arrested Development Religion and sexuality Religious Society of Friends The nature of God in Western theology EastEnders Jon Secada Evil Religion Homosexuality and Bah__'__ Faith Goodness and value theory Epistemology Utilitarianism Anderson Cooper Sapir-Whorf hypothesis Childlove movement Hip hop rivalries Garth Brooks Eric Cartman Alcoholics Anonymous Homosexuality in China Homosexuality and Christianity Reality Choice and sexual orientation Philosophy of language Homosexuality and Voodoo Ex-gay Postmodernism Jiddu Krishnamurti Michel Foucault Religious conversion Ethics Social rule Bertrand Russell Gay rights timeline Age disparity in sexual relationships BDSM Russian joke Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Outing Property (ownership right) Sin City Demographics of sexual orientation Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Biology and sexual orientation U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Joke The Ashlee Simpson Show Liberalism Nerd Generation X Democracy Discordianism Conservatism Cole Porter Ed, Edd n Eddy Atheism Homer Simpson Vernon Schillinger Transactional analysis Philosophy Rick Santorum Nigger Slander and libel
