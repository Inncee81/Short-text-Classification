calling all lgbt people what if there was a gay religion okay hear me out i just thought of this and i'm wondering if it'll work because we have freedom of religion in the constitution people are allowed to join or create any religion they want without being treated differently under law christian religions have the right to legally marry one man and one woman because its part of their religion just like in the us muslims and mormons are legally allowed the right to polygamy marriage of one man with more than one woman eg the husband has wives at once they're allowed to do this legally because its part of their religion and under the constitution its their right does that mean that if i was to start a religion that allowed both marriage between a man and a woman and same sex marriage they would also have to give that religion the right to legally preform the marriage even if it does mean giving gays the right to marriage after all denying it would be unconstitutional and illegal would this work i believe you have to have members to be legally recognized as a religion you shouldn't have any problem getting them though you would have to set the rules of the church which should allow no hate for anyone and that all would be welcome to the church which i believe is standard till bush started the gay hate thing Marriage Same-sex marriage Polygamy Same-sex marriage in Canada Gay rights Same-sex marriage in the United States Religion and sexuality Defense of Marriage Act Separation of church and state Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Israeli Arab Civil union Status of religious freedom in Malaysia Federal Marriage Amendment History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Lawrence v.
