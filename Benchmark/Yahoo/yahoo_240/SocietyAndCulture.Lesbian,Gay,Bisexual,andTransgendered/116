please answer this question yes or no for women an men and if you have an added opinion s i understand that in some overseas countries women don't shave their legs arm pitts etc isn't it disgusting to have hairy legs it's not at all attractive not to mention sexy goes out the door yes i understand that possibly some gay men may shave their legs but i even think that that picture doesnt even look right men look sexy with hair on their legs arms and chest so long it's not so much like a jungle and even then some women also find that sexy but hair on a woman's legs or arm pitts is just down right degrading to all of the female race women are soft and curvy smooth to touch now that's what i call sexy and i believe that the magority of my readers will agree by a land slide unless your the type that likes trashy trash i'm i right or am i just being a manly pig myself yeah but no but yeah but no but yeah i work in the beauty industry so i know beauty women who are hairy in general is a turn off but wait there's more i once was at whole foods in austin tx and when i was checking out a really nice and pretty hippie girl with a mustache was my cashier i was so enamored with her beauty and pleasant energy and despite her mustache and me being gay i would have loved to have gazed into her eyes all day and tell her how beautiful she is and one other time my friend dragged me this puppy mill pet shop and the person in charge was this really fat person in a spandex top and bottom so it was obvious in her spandex bottom she was a girl or he could have tucked it under but why bother if you're not going to shave your face wasn't sure if it was a girl or a guy she he it had a full beard and was really creepy i think it was a woman who had a really hairy face and had her hair pulled back in a ponytail it was really gross so it's all attitude Friends Hair Beard Kodocha Professional wrestling throws Little Britain Aerial (dance move) Gay slang Professional wrestling attacks Ron and Fez Moustache Professional wrestling holds Pubic hair Physical attractiveness Jon Secada Salad Fingers Sin City Humphrey Bogart Barbie Baldness The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie The Fairly OddParents The Ashlee Simpson Show The Amber Spyglass Skinhead Cliff Richard Joke Sexual attraction Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Rod Stewart Haircut Eric Cartman Marilyn Monroe Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story!
