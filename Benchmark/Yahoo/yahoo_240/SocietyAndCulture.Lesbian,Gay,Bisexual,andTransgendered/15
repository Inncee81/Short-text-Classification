what do you think of this message i got from another user message personally i don't think anything you read or anything i could provide you with will change the way you are or the way you think you are the way you are and nothing anyone says will ever change it yes i am a christian but i don't believe in going around and trying to convert anyone to my way of thinking i happened to begin to think that being gay was wrong after subleting a room from lesebians i didn't know they were gay but even if i had i wouldn't had thought anything of it but i got a good inside look at their life style and how they treated each other and then how they treated me because i'm not gay i was called a 'breeder' and they were even pissed off because i shave my legs and arm pits and wear deodorant and make up and act like a decent human being most of what they said seemed insane to me and they just would not leave me alone and they always fought with each other they also made a huge issue out of sex and having sex and how they have sex and even brought out their toys to immitate having sex with in front of me the gays they brought over to visit were just like them and acted just as hostile towards me my dislike of homosexuals has nothing to do with being a christian it has everything to do with how they treat each other and how they treat those of us who arent gay this was from a mother i thought it sounded like she made the whole thing up myself i think this person should not stereotype the entire gay population based on a few people i know a lot of straight people who are rude i know a lot of people in straight relationships where the men are nothing but controlling and abusive toward their wives and think that it's the woman's job to obey her husband the way a child should obey their parents do i automatically assume all straight people and straight relationships are this way no everyone has their own personality sexuality doesn't have anything to do with attitude the only thing sexuality does is determine what gender they are attracted to it does kinda sound made up to me too but then you really would be amazed at some of the kinds of people there are in this world so there is a possibility she was telling the truth Human sexual behavior Gender role Sexual orientation Ex-gay Homophobia Gay Homosexuality and transgender Friends Social rule Heterosexuality Religion and sexuality Theory of conduct Laura Schlessinger Little Britain Bisexuality Same-sex marriage The Smoking Room Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Gay slang Homosexuality and Christianity Anal sex Transsexuality Strap-on dildo Religion and sexual orientation Transgender Homosexuality Gay rights Domestic violence History of sex Theodicy Polyamory Marriage One Tree Hill (TV series) Gay bathhouse EastEnders Zoophilia Societal attitudes towards homosexuality Reparative therapy Recurring South Park characters Homosexuality and Bah__'__ Faith Toilet Homosexuality and Judaism Human sexuality Age of consent Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Lesbian Skinhead Gender-neutral language Married... with Children Aesthetic Realism Love Feminism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Anti-gay slogan Queer Male prostitute Herbert Garrison Sex Outing Asexuality Incest Sexism Kodocha Women in the Victorian era Condom Boston Public James Dobson Sex and the City Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Abortion debate The Marshall Mathers LP North American Man/Boy Love Association Childlove movement Germaine Greer Debugging Physical attractiveness Nudity Anglican views of homosexuality Mojave people Dog training Effeminacy Sexual attraction Philosophical skepticism Political correctness Group sex
