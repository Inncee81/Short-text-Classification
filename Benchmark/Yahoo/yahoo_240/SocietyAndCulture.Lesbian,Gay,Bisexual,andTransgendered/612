the bisexual conundrum do they exist i have seen more times than i can count 'bisexuals are just confused blah blah' what are your thoughts jamu we have to stop meeting like this the neighbours will talk j k i know that i am bisexual and that i am not confused you are right this is something that is brought up quite a lot according to alot of people bisexuals are either confused or nymphomaniacs i am neither confused nor a nymphomaniac what surprises me is that this is not just an argument i have heard from straights but gays as well i always thought gays would be more understanding but they are trying to force me to be something i am not just as any straight would i will never try to be some one i am not i have known for years that i am physically attracted to both males and females it is as simple as that i don't understand why some people cannot seen to make sense of this especially the gays who feel we are confused or not accepting our true gayness i am who i am i love my self i am proud of my self i will never pretend to be any one but my self for any one and i will not hide that i am bisexual because some people to not seem to think it exists every one should love and respect not only them selves but every one around them i am a bisexual women and i love a bisexual man we have been together for years and i love him fully i have no issues with commitment or monogamy should he want monogamy that would be fine i could spend the rest of my life with him and him alone currently how ever we are both open we have brought long time partners into our relationship note that i said partner not play mate these were women that we cared about emotionally and enjoyed physically threesomes do not have to be purely sexual and for us they are not they are emotional full of caring and love how ever despite that we have formed such relationships in the past does not mean that we could not be monogamous with each other and in all honesty that is how we started out the first was a close dearly loved friend of ours we helped her heal her emotional wounds with support and friendship she asked us if we could be more after my fiance and i talked about it she became a third in our relationship we did truly love her time and family brought us our different ways and to different coasts so perhaps that only proves that bisexuals cannot be happy with out both well it doesn't we have never shared out bed with a second man my fiance as i said is bisexual and finds men physically attractive but we've never shared our bed with a man because we have never bonded so closely with a man as we did that female friend of ours we are happy with just each other we don't need any one else but we do not limit the extent our love can spread either Sexual orientation Polyamory Marriage Infantilism Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Gay Polygamy Monogamy Gender role Swinging Homophobia Homosexuality and Christianity Transgender Reparative therapy Ex-gay Zoophilia Interpersonal relationship EastEnders Avenue Q Transsexuality Anal sex Same-sex marriage Group sex Friendship Gay slang God Emperor of Dune Social rule Domestic violence Lesbian Homosexuality and transgender Friends BDSM The Invisibles Coming out About a Boy Love Sex and the City William Shakespeare Religion and sexuality Homosexuality and Judaism Homosexuality and Islam Socrates Vulcan (Star Trek) Asexuality Heterosexuality Gay rights Jon Secada The nature of God in Western theology History of sex LGBT Gay bathhouse The Smoking Room American Psycho Theory of conduct The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Homosexuality and Neopaganism The Amber Spyglass Oscar Wilde Theodicy Dead Like Me Pitaten K' Rent (musical) Orgasm Divorce Will & Grace Another Side of Bob Dylan Domination & submission (BDSM) Pedophilia Jiddu Krishnamurti Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Laura Schlessinger Simone Weil Borderline personality disorder Phoebe Buffay's songs Ten Commandments Humphrey Bogart 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Marvin Gaye Shaggy dog story Physical attractiveness Kodocha Past teachings of Prem Rawat Little Britain I, the Jury Bi-curious Biology and sexual orientation Abortion debate T'Pol Knots Landing Stewie Griffin Fathers' rights Gay community
