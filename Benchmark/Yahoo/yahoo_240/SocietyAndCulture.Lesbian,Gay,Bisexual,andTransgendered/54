are there any gay people who do not agree with gay marriage are there any other gay people that aren't totally for gay marriage i am gay but i'm not really pushing the whole marriage thing i am all for unions and i will not settle for anything but equal rights but marriage technically isn't the same right the law doesn't give you the right to marry the person you love just says to be able to marry someone of the opp sex y'know this is not really religious argument whether or not it started that way is another question but we're equal doesn't mean that things are exactly the same every once in a while it turns out we need different things anybody sigh i already have a feeling i'm gonna get eaten up for this one i'm catholic but even outside of that there are arguments well what i say to the separate but equal argument which i knew was only a matter of minutes away is this my opinion on the matter is that we don't really need the marriage separate but equal in case you didn't was proved unequal partly based on the experiments that were conducted by a black psychologist that asked children questions as to which doll they thought looked better was richer etc therefore the institution of education was unequal really in that you couldn't deny that these institutions were shoddy if we were able to actually make these institutions completely equal teachers buildings then but with civil unions and fully civil rights what is it that is unequal i think that this situation is more controllable than the situation of brown to troy that's what i mean by we don't need it sometimes pushing marriage explicitly sort of is an attempt to be just like the gay community forgive the fact that it's not fresh writing but i'm going to cut and paste my thoughts on this from my blog i consider myself to be moderate and invariably this will lead to some clashes in opinion with friends of mine i recently had a discussion with a friend who could not see how i could support civil unions and not gay marriage so consider this allegory i think this will work for many people as we all know religious freedom is guaranteed in the first amendment and a very large portion of our nation is christian so most folks celebrate christmas i know such risky statements so far suppose someone from a smaller religion comes in and wants their religious celebration recognized as 'christmas' maybe the costanzas decide to rename festivus to christmas they want to impose their definition of christmas upon the already existing one so that everyone would pretty much be nudged to recognize that christmas can be decorating a tree or touching a pole and sharing a list of grievances before pinning someone to declare the holiday over for the many christians what's the first reaction 'what no i'm not going to totally uproot my time honored tradition's definition to accomodate you ' we don't like feeling pushed around it's why atheists get so much flack for trying to get 'in god we trust' off of money feels like a superimposition of their religious views so now take that and apply it to 'marriage' a sacred time honored tradition is now going to have to be redefined what you've known and celebrated is now just not it's not the same this isn't even a prejudice more just an attachment to the way things are already defined i feel we should honor that but when i decide to consummate my union to a guy i expect all the same rights as a heterosexual couple i want no special treatment but i don't want any discrimination i want the same legal rights when my partner is hospitalized i want to be able to adopt children if found to be an acceptable parent measured by the same standards as a heterosexual i want to be able to make medical decisions for my partner if somehow i don't have a legal document drawn up for that specific decision i want the same taxation rights i want the same access to health care in short whatever a married couple has access to in terms of legal right i want a union to have the same that's why i love my state connecticut did about all it could it passed legislation to recognize civil unions while still defining marriage as between a man and a woman all we need is a national legislation that would protect gay rights while not infringing on the definition of marriage equal rights does not mean strongarming the same term a man and a woman are different but equal a gay couple and straight couple are different but equal no matter who we are we're all hopefully after the same thing unless we're being unreasonably selfish we want equal treatment and to not be strongarmed by someone else's beliefs or way of life the gay marriage debate isn't a hard one to decide for me i recognize what's important for both sides and i believe i can see what's fair Homosexuality and Judaism Ethics Democracy Status of religious freedom in France French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Roe v.
