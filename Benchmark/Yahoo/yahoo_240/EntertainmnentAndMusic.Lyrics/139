what's this song sorry i don't remember the exact lyrics but here goes at the beginning she is talking about how winter is was not the season for her then towards the end she is talking about how the words of her diary are screaming off the page or something i think she is probably singing about a breakup i'm not sure if that is enough information is it just breathe by anna nalick anna nalick lyrics breathe am am and she calls me 'cause i'm still awake can you help me unravel my latest mistake i don't love him winter just wasn't my season yeah we walk through the doors so accusing their eyes like they have any right at all to criticize hypocrites you're all here for the very same reason 'cause you can't jump the track we're like cars on a cable and life's like an hourglass glued to the table no one can find the rewind button girl so cradle your head in your hands and breathe just breathe oh breathe just breathe may he turn on the base at fort bliss just a day he said down to the flask in his fist ain't been sober since maybe october of last year here in town you can tell he's been down for a while but my god it's so beautiful when the boy smiles wanna hold him maybe i'll just sing about it cause you can't jump the track we're like cars on a cable and life's like an hourglass glued to the table no one can find the rewind button boys so cradle your head in your hands and breathe just breathe oh breathe just breathe there's a light at each end of this tunnel you shout 'cause you're just as far in as you'll ever be out and these mistakes you've made you'll just make them again if you only try turning around am and i'm still awake writing a song if i get it all down on paper it's no longer inside of me threatening the life it belongs to and i feel like i'm naked in front of the crowd cause these words are my diary screaming out loud and i know that you'll use them however you want to but you can't jump the track we're like cars on a cable and life's like an hourglass glued to the table no one can find the rewind button now sing it if you understand and breathe just breathe woah breathe just breathe oh breathe just breathe oh breathe just breathe Jon Secada Prank flash John Lennon Shaggy dog story The Ashlee Simpson Show Cliff Richard Paul Is Dead The Shining (film) The Beatles The Jazz Singer She Loves You The Marshall Mathers LP Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie I Want to Hold Your Hand Frankie Laine Please Please Me Harry Nilsson Yoko Ono Mixtape Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Scenes from a Memory Billboard Hot 100 Blonde on Blonde Van Halen Gregg Alexander Anna Nalick The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy The Beach Boys Salad Fingers Aquemini History of the Beatles Blood on the Tracks The Isley Brothers Guy Sigsworth Tag Hey Jude The Chemical Brothers The Inside The Beatles discography Infidels Tom Jones (singer) Spice Girls Incarnations of Immortality Anne Frank Diving Unreleased Madonna songs Single certification Little Britain The Death Gate Cycle Aerial (dance move) Empire Burlesque Conker's Bad Fur Day Academy Award for Best Song The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Figure skating Past teachings of Prem Rawat Karaoke Revolution The Emancipation of Mimi Current teachings of Prem Rawat Sin City Hip hop rivalries Rose (Doctor Who) Bob Dylan Yu-Gi-Oh!
