harry potter and the thestrals how comes harry can't see thestrals in the first place when he witnessed his parents die in my last question i asked this but i have just finished reading the goblet of fire where cedric dies and as harry leaves the school after cedric's death all three of them are waiting for the carriages at the front of the gate and harry is looking out yet still the carriage pullers are invisiable and i think he would of noticed a black horse with fangs strutting around hogwarts page i think in the children's edition what do you think for those saying it hadn't sunk in etc etc doesn't that seem like a cop out from the storyline just like how he saw his parents die as he got older the death woud of sunk in by the time of hogwarts and he knew his parents were dead she could of just skipped out harry waiting for the coach as it adds nothing to the storyline she slipped up in my mind no one's perfect thats a very good point perhaps an overlook on the author's part Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Minor Harry Potter Beasts Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film) Harry Potter (character) Hogwarts Minor Slytherins Blood purity (Harry Potter) Minor Hufflepuffs Hogwarts Houses Dates in Harry Potter Severus Snape Wizarding world Triwizard Tournament Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Harry Potter Hogwarts Express Harry Potter: Book Seven Albus Dumbledore Hermione Granger Rubeus Hagrid Hogwarts subjects Minor characters associated with Quidditch Diagon Alley Cho Chang Hogwarts Floor Directory Ron Weasley Minor Ministry officials in the Harry Potter books Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Luna Lovegood Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Magic (Harry Potter) Harry Potter newspapers and magazines J.
