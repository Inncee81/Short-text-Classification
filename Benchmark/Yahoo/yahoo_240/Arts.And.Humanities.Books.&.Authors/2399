harry potter question how come voldemort died if harry's blood was in i read the book but i always thought that the same blood protection that was with harry was also with voldemort when harry died for that brief minute and had a talk with dumbledore he ended up living because voldemort had actually killed the part of him that was in harry the rest of harry still lived that part of voldemort that was in harry was a horcrux therefore when the snake was killed by neville all the horcruxes had been destroyed so voldemort died even though harry still lived does this answer your question hope it helped Lord Voldemort Harry Potter: Book Seven Harry Potter (character) Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Horcrux Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Albus Dumbledore Dates in Harry Potter R.A.B.
