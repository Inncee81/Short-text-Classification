modernized version of walden by henry david thoreau i know it seems somewhat desperate but for a summer reading requirement in my school we have to read walden and answer questions about it its not that the reading is difficult for me it's just that some of the paraboles and paradox's and the like are somewhat difficult for me to interpret is there anywhere else besides a cliffsnotes site that would have something to help me i think you just have to take your time and perhaps even read the book with a good dictionary handy so that if you hit a sentence that makes no sense you can look up the words in it to see if they might have had a different meaning in the th century for instance when thoreau makes a pun about sleepers it helps to know that the word is another name for railroad ties otherwise you might read through the wikipedia entry to get an overview of the book as a whole if you take your time you may find that the book is funnier and more engaging that it appears if you try to read it fast like a novel but i'd also say that this is a book that's really more fun to read in an on going class so that some of the things that you might otherwise miss can be pointed out as you read still i'm sure you can enjoy the book on your own if you don't feel like you have to catch every pun or reference Henry David Thoreau Walden Deconstruction Philosophy of language Pun Tetragrammaton English grammar Simple living Beat generation Swahili language I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Crossword The Book of Five Rings German language A Course In Miracles Goodness and value theory Russell's paradox Whose Line Is It Anyway?
