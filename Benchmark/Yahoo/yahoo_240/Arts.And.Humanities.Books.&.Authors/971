i have a question about new moon by stephenie meyer what was the big deal with the character heidi they kept talking about how they had to leave before heidi got back i didn't understand that i mean i knew they didn't want bella to witness all those people getting killed but it sounded like they were scared of bella even meeting heidi i have been on stephenie's twilight lexicon and i have read heidi's profile but i still don t understand did anyone else feel bed for jacob at the end of new moon i mean he was reaching out to bella and edward refused to let her hug him i thought that was a little extreme i believe bella can be friends with jacob and be in a relationship with edward at the same time i don t see why he absolutely refuses to allow bella to speak with or be near jacob she was with him for months while he was a werewolf and nothing happened why would it be any different now let me know what you think go vegetarian vampires okay so i think they wanted to keep bella away from her because of bella's relationship to edward and because heidi is evil i'm really not sure and could be wrong but i did feel bad for jacob i almost prefer him to edward gasp yes i said it and i do believe what edward did was a bit extreme i don't think bella can have relations with both jacob and edward it is a bit stupid but because of the ancient war and everything there is no way they can live in harmony i think it's just vengeance a fued that goes back so far is a hard thing to stop and i don't think edward sees jacob as well jacob i think all he sees is a werewolf Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Glen Jacobs The Smoking Room Theory of conduct Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Shaggy dog story Ewoks: The Battle for Endor Survivor: Palau Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Scenes from a Memory Humphrey Bogart Social rule Avenue Q Pitaten Knots Landing Hey Jude Piccolo Junior Saga Jon Secada She Loves You Jacob Milton H.
