several questions on the harry potter book may contain spoilers for those who haven t finished the book so i got the whole thing read but there are a few parts i do not understand in the bank when the three go after the gold cup that s a horcrux the goblin gets away with the sword of gryffindor but at the end of the book nevil kills youknowwho s snake with the sword where did it come from my cousin said the trio gave the goblin the fake sword but wouldn t he have noticed it wasn t real since goblins can always tell with goblin made things i don t know if anyone can answer this for real but who do you think teddy lupin grew up with harry was joking that he should just move in with them so i got the idea he didn t take teddy in so did you think he lived with his grandmother or where ron s kids named after any characters in the book that may have died i thought i paid pretty good attention and harry s and ginny s kids names were pretty obvious but i didn t recognize the two the sword of gryffindor will be available to any gryffindor in need dumbledore said this in cos after harry rescued ginny and all that hoop la so since neville proved that he was brave one of the traits of a gryffindor he was able to pull the sword from the hat even tho the goblin stole it it still belongs to godric i really can't think of anyone that teddy would have grown up with other than andromeda tonks who seems like the logical choice with help from harry and the weasley's of course ron and hermione's kids are not named after anyone inparticular but i'm sure there is meaning in there names somewhere all will be clear after the release of jk's encyclopedia Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Ginny Weasley Harry Potter (character) Magical objects in Harry Potter Hogwarts Hogwarts Houses Dates in Harry Potter Minor Ravenclaws Harry Potter: Book Seven Hermione Granger Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Lord Voldemort Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game) Weasley family Neville Longbottom Blood purity (Harry Potter) Minor characters associated with Quidditch Tom Riddle's diary Horcrux Lucius Malfoy Diagon Alley Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film) Battle of Hogwarts Fred and George Weasley Dumbledore's Army Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game) Hogwarts subjects Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Nymphadora Tonks Sirius Black Fawkes Magic (Harry Potter) Luna Lovegood Rubeus Hagrid Money in Harry Potter Albus Dumbledore Cho Chang Draco Malfoy Cormac McLaggen Horace Slughorn Harry Potter newspapers and magazines Ministry of Magic Severus Snape Sybill Trelawney Mary Sue Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film) James and Lily Potter Wizarding world Minor Harry Potter Beasts Portraits in Hogwarts Minor Slytherins Boggart (Harry Potter) Viktor Krum Theory of conduct Felix Felicis Hogwarts Floor Directory Rita Skeeter Minor Ministry officials in the Harry Potter books Harry Potter Order of the Phoenix Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film) Bill Weasley Fleur Delacour Quidditch Humphrey Bogart Remus Lupin Peter Pettigrew Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter Ludo Bagman Little Britain The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Hobgoblin (comics) Minor members of the Order of the Phoenix RuneScape quests The Hobbit Regulus Black Professor Quirrell Fan fiction Molly Weasley The Slug Club Gilderoy Lockhart Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Desire (album) Magical beasts (Harry Potter) Rupert Grint
