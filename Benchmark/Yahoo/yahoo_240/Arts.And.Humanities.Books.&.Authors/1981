question about epilogue of harry potter and the deathly hallows spoiler warning if you haven't read the book ok here is one of the things i was confused about after reading the epilogue of book why is harry glad not to have to say hello to percy on platform harry thought he heard percy discoursing loudly on broomstick regulations and was quite glad of the excuse not to stop and say hello when i read that line i thought it meant percy had gone back to his unlikeable and pompous old self after we had just seen him redeem himself to his family and return to the good side after all many things haven't changed in the wizarding world in the scene nineteen years later e g themes of blood purity traditional house conflicts gryffindor vs slytherin same sort of life at hogwarts he was glad because he was in no mood to listen to percy's lecture its percy's nature to be like that that doesnt make him bad he did redeem himself by fighting for the good side nineteen years in the future the sorting into houses and other things havent changed it is hogwarts tradition to have the students sorted it has been the wish of the founders to let it happen as for evil like dumbledore says it has to be fought all the time to be kept at bay it isnt possible to entirely eradicate it Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Hogwarts Hogwarts Houses Magical objects in Harry Potter Minor Ravenclaws Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Minor Hufflepuffs Dates in Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Hogwarts subjects Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Blood purity (Harry Potter) Minor Slytherins Lord Voldemort Wizarding world Severus Snape Ron Weasley Albus Dumbledore Harry Potter (character) Diagon Alley Weasley family Magic (Harry Potter) The Hogwarts Founders Rubeus Hagrid Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game) Horace Slughorn Minerva McGonagall Hermione Granger Draco Malfoy Harry Potter: Book Seven Horcrux Harry Potter newspapers and magazines Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game) Fred and George Weasley Harry Potter Ginny Weasley Minor Ministry officials in the Harry Potter books Hogwarts ghosts Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film) Hogwarts Floor Directory Death Eater Ministry of Magic Sybill Trelawney Percy Weasley Luna Lovegood Hogsmeade Grimmauld Place House-elf Remus Lupin Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film) Broomsticks in Harry Potter Dolores Umbridge Harry Potter: Quidditch World Cup Tom Riddle Professor Quirrell Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter Battle of Hogwarts R.A.B.
