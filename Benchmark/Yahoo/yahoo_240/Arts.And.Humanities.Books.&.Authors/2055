has anyone read the book return to labyrinth i just found it on ebay and bought it i'm a huge labyrinth fan it's been my favorite movie since i was two even though it's a sequel to a movie and it's in book form i thought i'd post the question in the book section i didn't even know this book existed til last night i'm so excited i've read fanfiction and things of that nature but i didn't know that they had actually published a sequel return to labyrinth is book one of a three book manga series book two is supposed to hit the shelves in october but reviews are mixed it has some adult themes which may be troubling and apparently some of the characters are not treated with as much respect as the readers would have liked i hope you enjoy your copy i stuck a few links below i would recommend that you get the th anniversary copy of goblins by brian froud it will probably be more satisfying for you if you don't already have it Manga Trigun Fan fiction The Star Wars Holiday Special Anne Rice Labyrinth (film) Harry Potter The Lord of the Rings Avenue Q The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Dragon Ball canon The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Frank Herbert Douglas Adams The Chronicles of Amber Yu-Gi-Oh!
