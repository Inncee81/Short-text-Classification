what do you think of this intro for my story good morning jerry it was her voice the same angelic voice he had heard every morning it had been years since he had heard it in person his mother had long since passed away but still the mechanical recording brought pleasant memories flooding back to his head if only for a moment the city was in trouble common people had started to go missing sometime in april and while it began with only a few disappearances a week it soon grew into a daily occurrence the missing to much surprise had always returned but had procured such deterioration of the mind and body that they had to be executed on the gallows in the public square lord farling had called the mysterious condition the curse the catchall term he used for anyone who went mad but there hadn t been a miscreant in the city for almost twenty years a record he humbly claimed and so this new threat had greatly disheartened him and the rumours spreading through the streets jerry quickly recalled while stepping out of bed into his private lavatory were doing very little to calm the old man people throughout the city boasted having seen darkly cloaked strangers dashing through the streets of sector twelve the infamous part of the city where the missing were found bleeding and acting like savages they claimed that unlawful imprisonment and torture were the cause for blame but the king had dismissed their wild allegations highly imaginative delusions jerry thought as he stepped out of the lavatory into the tiny sleeping chamber he stood in front of an oval mirror removing lint from his black pants admiring the single stripe of red and gold running along the length of each leg his frame filled his view his unusually bright blue eyes dulled by the lack of sleep making him appear older than his years his jaw was round and strong but softened considerably when he smiled something he seldom did he brushed his hands through his thick brown hair revealing deep lines on his high forehead he reached for his long red robe hanging on the wall and while doing so his eyes casually glanced at the small ornate box sitting on his dresser it had belonged to his father ignoring the container he continued to get dressed brushing the creases out of his uniform and double checking to see if his bootlaces were tied in the proper fashion being the king s jerry has its perks christopher lord farling had once told him when he earned his promotion to stand by the king s side but attention to detail is a must if one is to be trusted with my secrets satisfied with his appearance jerry looked into the mirror once more a meagre smile met his glance and he soon turned away returning his gaze to the box made of bone sighing jerry shook his head and reached for the box it still harboured the faint smell of jasmine a spice his mother had used around the house to eliminate odours upon opening it he removed the tiny dirty blonde lock of hair that was hidden inside it was the only treasure he had of his mother and suddenly he remembered the hardships it took to obtain it okay so i've actually finished the story back in march three people have a copy of it it's pages but no one has gotten back to me with their opinion my bf read and edited the story for me but he offered absolutely nothing in the way of constructive criticism or thought about it argh wow that introduction was really good it was very descriptive and it actually got me into the story i really enjoyed it i am trying to be a writer as well and i thoguht that your introduction sounded better then any of the stories i have written i want to know more you should email me more of the story as you get it it was really good and i enjoyed it bravo and keep writing oh yeah i also like that it is like in the future and also it sparked my interest i love it just from the introduction please email me more of the story Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Comanche Poker jargon RuneScape quests Paul Is Dead The Shining (film) Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 G-Man (Half-Life) Kingdom Hearts II Darth Vader New York Giants Cleveland Browns Blonde on Blonde Dragon Booster Marie Antoinette The Amber Spyglass Wood carving Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus The Time Machine Professional wrestling throws Buckingham Palace EastEnders Social rule Transformers: Cybertron The Death Gate Cycle The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe One Tree Hill (TV series) Sydney Riot of 1879 Columbine High School massacre Equine conformation The Curse of Fenric The writing of Principia Mathematica Professional wrestling match types The Empty Child House of M Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Humphrey Bogart Rose (Doctor Who) Futurama (TV series -
