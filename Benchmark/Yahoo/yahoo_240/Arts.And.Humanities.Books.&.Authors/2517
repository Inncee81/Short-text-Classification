the elder wand the unanswered question in the 'harry potter and the deathly hallows' how the hell did grindelwald get defeated by dumbledore when he had the elder wand which could not have possibly been defeated if you say that grindelwald stole the wand so he was not its owner then how come the ownership got passed on to dumbledore if grindelwald did not had the ownership then his defeat could not have transferred it to dumbledore actually you have asked two questions how could grindelwald be defeated by dumbledore and how could dumbledore have ownership of the wand if grindelwald did not first the undefeatable wand that says it all if you remember the story in the book dumbledore left hermoine the brother asked death for a wand that could not be defeated he did not however ask for a wand that would make the wizard holding it unable to be defeated regular wands can be destroyed or broken harry's wand by hermoine and lucius malfoy's wand by harry's when voldemort used it the elder wand cannot so dumbledore could defeat grindelwald since it was not just a matter of how powerful the wand was the wizard owning it had to be skilled dumbledore was more skilled that grindelwald so he was able to defeat but not kill him although the elder wand had a bloody history when harry asked olivander whether it had to be taken that way he was told no it was just that the wand was such a desirable object that it attracted violence a wand can pass in other ways and it is possible that in allowing the wand to be stolen gregorovitch showed his unsuitability to own the wand and it transferred it's allegiance also we are never told how gregorovitch came into possession of the wand could he have stolen it or could someone have given it to him from the hints given it appears that a wand does not have to be won through battle voldemort however could not use the wand to it's best advantage as draco had won the wand from dumbledore when he disarmed him in book although voldemort took the wand from dumbledore's grave dumbledore was no longer the master of the wand harry was the true master of the elder wand as he defeated draco by disarming him since he held draco's wand the elder wand recongnized that he had defeated it's owner and hary then became the master of the elder wand Albus Dumbledore Dates in Harry Potter Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter Death Eater Magic (Harry Potter) Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Harry Potter (character) Hogwarts subjects Ron Weasley Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Rubeus Hagrid Ginny Weasley Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Severus Snape Battle of Hogwarts Horace Slughorn Order of the Phoenix Draco Malfoy Harry Potter: Book Seven Lucius Malfoy Diagon Alley Horcrux Hogwarts Bellatrix Lestrange Regulus Black Minor Ministry officials in the Harry Potter books Blood purity (Harry Potter) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Sybill Trelawney Fred and George Weasley Dark Art R.A.B.
