harry potter behind the veil what is there behind the veil in the ministry of magic why was sirius killed or even better gone for ever when he fell behind it and i don't remember bellatrix killing him with ak but a red light was sent to him rowling didn't make this part of the fifth book clear i always though that we would find out in the seventh book and that sirius would come back and sirius was bearly mentioned so what really happened i know a lot of you had been wondering if he'd reappear in the th book i had hoped he would re appear i love sirius so sad that he had to live his remaining life hidden so as not to be sent back to azkaban or have to suffer the dementor's kiss i was really upset that i never learned they mystery of the veil i think though that it was a passage way to the afterlife and once you go in you can't get back out i had hoped that sirius would have the other part of the mirror with him still that he had it in his pocket or something when he fell through the veil and somehow be able to contact harry still through it turns out someone else aquired it which broke my heart i miss sirius i suppose rowling just wanted to leave it as that sirius was a strong risky character he died rushing to protect harry his godson and in that there is a certain honor i guess she just thought it best to leave it that way since harry had his talk with dumbledore it would have been too outragous to re construct another character in somewhat the same fashion however he was shown with james his best friend that in itself leaves in the air that he is happy and really has no need to return Sirius Black Harry Potter (character) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Lord Voldemort Blood purity (Harry Potter) Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter Ginny Weasley Harry Potter: Book Seven Death Eater Magical objects in Harry Potter Severus Snape Remus Lupin Ron Weasley Order of the Phoenix R.A.B.
