why do you all hate eclipse i've heard that a bunch of people are pissed off about what happened in the book why i feel the same way you do i liked the book i got a lot of information i wanted to know i thought the love triangle with bella edward and jacob was very realistic that kind of stuff does happen people are mad because bella didn't get turned and she fell in love with jacob but just because she fell in love with jacob doesn't mean she is going to choose jacob she even states it repeatedly that she chooses edward so i don't know way people are so worked up i was pretty happy with the way the story played out i was happy to finally see that there is a physical relationship between bella and edward i was beginning to wonder if that sort of thing was possible for vampires i liked to know more about jasper and i loved the indian stories i liked the book not as much as new moon but i did like it Time Out of Mind Knots Landing Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Book of Isaiah Theory of conduct Nine Inch Nails The Ashlee Simpson Show Bat Lash Scenes from a Memory Humphrey Bogart Shaggy dog story Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) W.I.T.C.H.
