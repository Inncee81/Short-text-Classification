is the a e's jane austen's emma more like the book or the one with gwyneth paltrow o come on sum answer i just saw both of them and i love them both there were certain things i like more about the a e one and some things more with the one with gwnyth paltrow i have a feeling there are some things more like the book in either one they both took things out but that's just a guess i've never read the book but i love the story let me know of your opinion on the book movie s and which one is closer to the book additional details minutes ago and also would someone mind telling me what the first answer meant ignore the first additional details d they are both fairly accurate in terms of plot and characters but both take their liberties the television version with kate beckinsale originally produced by the bbc not a e is often considered more accurate but i think both versions are about equal in this regard the bbc version has a more serious tone and includes more scenes from the book but also adds fantasy sequences for emma some characters actually seem more unpleasant here than in the book the film version with gwyneth paltrow adds a bit of extra humor and makes everything nicer than the original text the best thing to do is read the book yourself and then you'll see how the tv and film versions compare fair warning the novel emma starts off rather slowly so don't be put off if the first chapter seems a bit boring give it a chance to get going and you should enjoy it as you already know and like the story Emma Gwyneth Paltrow Jane Austen Seven (film) Shakespeare on screen Novel EastEnders Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Fantastic Four (2005 film) Theory of conduct The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Avenue Q The Talented Mr. Ripley Pride and Prejudice Anne Rice The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Friends Social rule A Series of Unfortunate Events Shakespeare in Love Sense and Sensibility Taxi Driver Canon (fiction) Notable lines in the Star Wars series Dial M for Murder Peter Pan I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Little Shop of Horrors The writing of Principia Mathematica About a Boy Book of Esther Eugene Onegin Douglas Adams Our Friends in the North Expanded Universe (Star Wars) The Catcher in the Rye The Secret of NIMH Authentic performance Goldstein's book Star Trek: The Motion Picture The Brothers Karamazov 24 (television) Little Britain Blythe Danner Serial Doctor Who spin-offs Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire Alfred Hitchcock Meta-reference The Book of One Thousand and One Nights Star Wars The Unquiet Dead Scientology beliefs and practices Shaggy dog story Kate Beckinsale Pride and Prejudice (BBC) She Loves You London Underground Clueless Blackadder James Bond House of Leaves Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Innocence: Ghost in the Shell Chrono Trigger The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (film) Charles Dickens Final Fantasy VI Sexual orientation Machinima King Lear Titanic (1997 film) Singlish Soap opera Bad Wolf Quatermass and the Pit Great Expectations (film) Sinfest The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (film) Lunar: Silver Star Story Complete Film colorization Wheel of Fortune Napier's bones BBC television drama For Your Eyes Only Great Expectations Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Modesty Blaise Cate Blanchett Rod Stewart The Avengers (TV series) Doctor Who (Enemy Within) Wuthering Heights Extras (sitcom) Coupling (TV series) Gulliver's Travels Mansfield Park Neil Gaiman
