can never end stories i'm a young writer and i get lots of compliments on my writer the only problem i have is that i'll write about pages of a story and never end it i'll ignore it and move on and write a new story how can i push myself to write stories start to end sometimes if i push myself it gets boring and no fun so i figure the reader won't like it either thanks for any advice future writer as a future writer to another i recommend you to think of your climax and then work from here how you would like your story to proceed to the climax and how you would like your story to finish from the climax it always works for me most readers are always interested in the climax so use that to your advantage Extreme Programming Doctor Who spin-offs Screenwriting Sherlock Holmes Genre fiction Zadie Smith Children's literature Science fiction Am730 Isaac Asimov Professional wrestling slang Amiga Power Chuck Palahniuk Don Rosa Daredevil Screenplay Gospel of Mark Grant Morrison Kindaichi Case Files Aerial (dance move) Lemony Snicket Oxford English Dictionary C.
