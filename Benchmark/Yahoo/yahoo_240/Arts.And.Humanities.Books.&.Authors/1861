do you like the author patricia cornwall i love her but second to james patterson the master of serial killers i love patricia cornwell's books i have read all the kay scarpetta novels plus the other books i don't feel p cornwell is nd to james patterson although i do read all of his alex cross books the one thing i find annoying about patterson is that he writes too many books with other authors i don't enjoy that i can always tell the different writing styles and it makes the book choppy at least that's how i feel one thing i like you do too it seems is reading books that are a series where each new book has the same main characters this way you get a new story but you already know the main players so you can get right into it plus you get to follow the lives of the main characters as far as serial killer books go one of the best authors in that genre is john sandford he writes the prey series each book's title ends with the word prey if you haven't read any of his books the first one is rules of prey which is good the nd rd books weren't the best but they are necessary for character development after those the books really take off john sandford has written about or more prey books and the main character is lucas davenport lucas is a high level detective but he also no no no i can't say any more i hope you enjoy them if you haven't read them yet Patricia Cornwell Days of our Lives Expanded Universe (Star Wars) Bernard Cornwell Crime fiction The Foundation Series Another World (TV series) Little Britain Detective fiction Star Wars live-action TV series One Tree Hill (TV series) Serial Star Wars Indiana Jones Superhero Mercedes Lackey Anne Rice One Life to Live Blue Heelers Robert A.
