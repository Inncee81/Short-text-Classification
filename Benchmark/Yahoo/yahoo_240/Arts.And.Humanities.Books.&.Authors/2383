spoiler alert snape question what do you think happens to snape after he dies i want to know what happens to snape after he dies we found out what happened to dumbledore i want to know if snape was reunited with lily and if they were friends once again i dont want to make it sound like i think that it would have been better with snape and lily rather than james and lily but i cant help but wonder im starting to think that snape was a better man than james and a braver one to i certainly like snape better and it made me very sad to read about how much he loved lily but never got a chance to be happy please tell me what you think i think snape was a bitter selfish man and thus i give his heroism more merit then i do say james potter who was raised to behave heroically however i think lily had a higher chance of happiness with james as the obsessive love snape gave her wasn't healthy it was pretty darn romantic and i sighed and teared up in the scene when he showed dumbledore his patronus after all these years still always but it would have been hard to live with we never saw james or lily we just saw them in other people's memories of them and those were colored by that person's feelings towards that person snape gave most of our material on james and he hated him so i don't think i can judge him based on that i know my second favorite character lupin loved james like a brother dumbledore thought well enough of him to induct him into the order of the phoenix and he and lily defeated defied voldemort three times so i don't think james was a bad person as for what happened to snape i think he found peace he was my favorite character i loved him for a lot of reasons his sarcasm his twisted motives his mystery and finding out his story was satisfying on many levels Severus Snape James and Lily Potter Harry Potter (character) Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Lord Voldemort Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Remus Lupin Sirius Black Dates in Harry Potter Hogwarts subjects Death Eater Order of the Phoenix Albus Dumbledore Harry Potter: Book Seven Magic (Harry Potter) Ron Weasley Battle of Hogwarts Blood purity (Harry Potter) Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter Ginny Weasley Hermione Granger Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Magical objects in Harry Potter Horace Slughorn Potions in Harry Potter Fan fiction Peter Pettigrew Half-Blood Prince (character) Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Sybill Trelawney Nymphadora Tonks Slash fiction Rubeus Hagrid History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Hogwarts Houses Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Theory of conduct Minor Ravenclaws Scenes from a Memory The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Minor Hufflepuffs Blood on the Tracks Ministry of Magic Draco Malfoy Occlumency Hogwarts Neville Longbottom Time Out of Mind Sant Thakar Singh History of As the World Turns (1980-1989) Dursley family Legilimency Rita Skeeter Dementor Lili Lucius Malfoy Patronus Charm Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film) Professor Quirrell Harry Potter newspapers and magazines Another World (TV series) Happiness Nine Inch Nails Crossing Jordan Star Trek: First Contact Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game) Shaggy dog story Friends The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Jon Secada Queen (band) Dumbledore's Army Horcrux Timeline of fictional historical events Luna Lovegood Current teachings of Prem Rawat Humphrey Bogart Tekken characters The Catcher in the Rye Alena EastEnders Revolutionary Girl Utena Alignment (role-playing games) Hogwarts Floor Directory Alan Rickman Nicomachean Ethics Iago Aberforth Dumbledore Minerva McGonagall
