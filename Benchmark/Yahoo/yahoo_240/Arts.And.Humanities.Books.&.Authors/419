illegal downloads it has come to the attention of several authors who hang out on this board and help others that there are several here who run sites containing illegal downloads of copyrighted material like harry potter and the stephanie meyer books keyword illegal these books are protected by federal copyright laws distributing them is illegal and a federal offense read the us copyright laws if you can download the books you can download the laws too let it be known that several authors here are sick and tired of seeing the hard work of authors stolen authors write for a living and they have every right to be compensated for their work in other words paid for their books posting and sharing illegal sites with illegal copies of these and other books will not be tolerated we will report you to abuse we will also contact the publishers scholastic little brown etc as well as the american agents who represent these authors if you get caught they can and will press charges authors have the right to make a living writing they sell books if you enjoy their work do not steal from them it is just like walking into their homes and stealing a tv set it is a crime and a very serious one your ip address can be traced to the company that provides your internet service a warrant can require that company to reveal the name of their customer if your internet service is in your parents names you are subjecting your parents to a lot of trouble including fines and even possibly arrest ask any kid who got their parents in trouble stealing music from napster this is not a joke this is a genuine and serious crime also do not visit these sites traffic there is also traceable in addition many of the sites are virused don't download anything these books cost less than bucks if you cannot afford one borrow one from a friend or the library or get a babysitting job and buy one this is no longer funny you will be reported trust me on that pax one of several authors tired of seeing people's work stolen by irresponsible kids if you are an author and you see such abuse here please report it to yahoo immediately the next book they steal could be yours here is my question who is going to turn these thieves into yahoo abuse community guidelines don'ts number post content that violates federal state or local law good point divinatum cconsult i want a set of louis vuitton luggage but i can't afford it does that give me the right to steal it because louis vuitton doesn't bring the price down hardly if you can't afford a book use the library stealing is stealing isn't it there another question shekikak if you don't know the basic difference between borrowing and stealing there is something basically wrong authors understand that their books will be borrowed and checked out of libraries and yes even sold used however it is the blatant stealing we object to what is the difference between borrowing and stealing another question you can get as high handed as you want to about this but the fact is the internet used to be a free forum where people shared things the music and publishing industry turned it's nose up at it and refused to acknowledge that it's content had a place there when the distributors discovered that they were actually losing money to this grand social experiment they decided to change the rules much as bill gates did when he discovered that there really was a reason for people to have more than kb on a personal computer and there really was money to be made in web pages after yahoo and google ran away with it now the music and publishing industry is faced with the dreadful task of convincing people that it really didn't mean it when it said that it didn't care what people did on the internet they are trying to convince people that their content is worth money while they are busy giving it away to attract people to their sites they are going to win this eventually but there is really no reason to get officious over this the distributors made their own bed when they decided to be short sighted and forgo jumping on the bandwagon when it first took off now they are forced to play catchup and no amount of moralizing is going to change that they are also wringing their hands over the fact that over three hundred thousand books in the public domain are lost to them forever because they did not figure out a way to make money off of them fast enough would you like us to feel bad for them over that as well j k rowling specifically stated that she would not allow the seventh harry potter book to be published electronically that leaves several million potential readers with palm pilots and e book readers out in the cold how is that fair to them she has a right to do this by the way but if she does and she does not realize the consequences then whoever is advising her is a complete fool if you are sick and tired of having your work stolen put it online for a reasonable price taking into consideration that there are no stocking fees no material fees and nothing more than the website to sustain which means that the e book doesn't have to cost as much as the hardcover or paperback then you will have the moral high ground until then please refrain from preaching and ask a question p s before you even check all of my posts lists sources that are in the public domain if anything on the website fails that litmus test it is the web designer's responsibility to take the offending material down and as soon as you notify them i am sure they will be happy to comply many even say it on the home page of their sites there is a vast difference between sharing material in the public domain and illegally uploading copy written material and every i s p in america is already supposed to be on guard against it when and if you see anything that goes against those guidelines report it as we all do instead of trying to act like the internet f b i and scare us all into submission response to divinatum we happen to own a perfectly legitimate copy of mrs rowling's latest opus as we do the other six if she wants to know who is going to turn the scofflaws in obviously it is her and maybe even you that question was asked after the fact however and my point concerning the original diatribe stands silly creature this is getting fun i don't believe your luggage manufacturers ever declined to sell their luggage and ignore the buying public as the publishing industry obviously did the issue was not the price but the availability if your luggage manufacturers decided to stop selling the luggage to train passengers for instance do you think for a moment that they would simply pack their belongings in cardboard boxes when a segment of the market is ignored something will replace the sucking black hole which is the vacuum which ensues i do not begrudge anyone their thirty pieces of silver render unto caesar and all of that it is when they say never mind and then come back and say oops we didn't mean it that i cease to exude sympathy i have a large collection of legal books records cd's legitimate software and legal connections to both my cable television and broadband internet i am as legal as you can get if you want me to show sympathy for an abused ignored market base that has just recently begun to wake up to the fact that it was dead wrong however you are sadly mistaken by the way if stealing is wrong isn't unfair restriction of trade refusing to sell to the e book industry and antitrust a crime as well you said if you can't afford a book use the library back in the good old days when i was neither good nor old i used to borrow books from friends i suppose this is no longer legal either oh and how about the internet libraries i suppose they should all dry up and blow away as well why not make it possible to pay the author their royalty and cut out the distributor altogether that would be legal right but i don't suppose the industry would look too kindly toward that solution either the difference between borrowing and stealing is that when you borrow from an individual it is a one on one transaction when you steal the material and sell it for profit such as they do in swap meets and even legitimate businesses want to bet i can find knockoffs of your louie v luggage it is stealing when people ask for a way to purchase something legitimately and the publishing company says no that is restriction of trade when the publishing companies get together and say that they will sell in print but not in electronic media that is collusion which falls by definition into the antitrust area of the house i noticed that you are ignoring my other challenge as well what is the difference between asking a question and using yahoo answers as a soapbox to vent your frustrations rant or otherwise violate the question and answer format since this is still here i will add one thought ethics aside how do you account for the fact that in every study in which file sharing was encouraged the author's composer's sales figures actually went up audiogalaxy actually refused to share my silly little mp files for free because they claimed that the riaa prohibited them from doing so even though i was the composer author and gave them permission i now share my silly little mp s on soundclick com i am not vain enough to presume that i could actually sell my silly little mp s and make a profit from them but i am a little put off by the idea that a regulating agency would restrict my legal right to share them
