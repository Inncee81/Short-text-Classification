non fiction vs fiction books i don't read stories they're not real and it takes longer than a film i find it's a waste of time i prefer to read non fiction i much prefer to learn something during my reads what do you think and are you mainly a fiction or non fiction reader leah i see beauty in the world in the workings of the mind and the universe in human actions in the past a bunch of rhyming words i e poems doesn't make anything more beautiful pip interesting thought you're my favourite for best answer so far but i still find non fiction more compelling catch is still a story about war but i find rape of nanjing much more hard hitting because it's very very real some of the things i couldn't believe i was reading and yes i shed a few tears some people are side lining non fiction as dull why just like fiction there are engaging story tellers and the most mundane stories people in glass houses steph p i don't really limit myself to a specific genre all of the above i guess some that come to mind a brief history of time by stephen hawking i think this is poetry the concepts are hard but the revelations are so beautiful that it has tremendous humility i can see why jim studied it the art of war by sun tzu you have got to appreciate how this book is so influential in history a child called it by david pelzer harrowing i can't read too much of these liketolisten use your head by tony buzan very interesting a kind of manual for the brain i guess i do tend to gravitate towards popular psychology and philosophy i have many of these books at home but they're written by non famous writers btw i study something completely different to any of these subjects msc phd biochemistry if people must know i know what you mean pip about student loans sure the details and specific points of a story are not real but the ideas and people that they represent are the point of non fiction is generally to communicate facts while good fiction will emphasize ideas it is important to understand both fiction exists to say things that you can't just say that people won't listen to if you state outright for instance joseph heller could have released a statement saying hey war is bad uh ok no kidding but instead he wrote catch which showed in its own measly fictional way why war is bad how it affects people etc of course you could get a book documenting the facts of specific wars and that's important too but that book by using immense exaggeration for comedic and functional purposes communicated something that a non fiction book never could if you're basing your opinion of fiction as a whole on books like harry potter not that i'm undermining the importance of escapist literature i love harry potter then i can understand your confusion as to fiction's value but look more closely at the books that have really changed things in the world and you'll realize that it was animal farm not a complete guide to modern communism that convinced people that a communist government is easily corrupted therefore making communism a second choice to other socialist options it's oliver twist and hard times that we look at now for reference and understanding not a dull and complete documentation of the life of the poor in victorian east london the facts of non fiction build the reality of fiction making it just as valid a learning tool as non fiction in response to your response d yes the rape of nanjing was definitely hard hitting i was blown away by it however it was a different sort of gut twisting than you would get if you read a fictionalization of the same event and i am by no means undermining the effects of the all the facts ma'am this is what's going on approach i think that's vastly important in fact reporting on such things are what i'm currently planning to do with my life and immersing myself deeply in student loan debts to do so fact genocide is a terrible thing you can be told this either through a non fictional medium like the rape of nanjing or a fictional one someone could write a science fiction story about mass genocide in a made up society that would also move people to hate violence and brutality each medium can be compelling in its own way if done well in fact i think when examining an issue a healthy balance of informative fiction and non fiction is probably best for me at least interesting question by the way i usually
