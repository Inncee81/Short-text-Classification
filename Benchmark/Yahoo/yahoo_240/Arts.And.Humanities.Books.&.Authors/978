i want to write a book please tell me what i should keep in mind so you want to write a book that's the point where you need to begin no point in looking any further until the manuscript is finished once that's done then you as a writer have to decide between three choices you can self publish it this is the shortest avenue it offers instant satisfaction if all you want is for your work to be available to friends and family lulu com is a free service and is easy to use you can seek an agent to represent you agents are difficult to obtain but are necessary if publication from large publishing companies is what you're seeking you can submit your manuscript directly to small independent publishers who accept submissions from unagented writers to obtain either an agent or a publisher use books like the literary marketplace or the writers market or web sites like preditors editors and writerswall com search for agents or publishers that represent or publish books in the genre you've written follow their submission guidelines to the letter that's why they supply them use only the format they ask for make certain your work is perfect free from errors in spelling punctuation and grammar learn how to write a sensational synopsis and a query letter each agent or publisher will ask for a query letter and or a synopsis very few will want the entire work in the initial package be patient with the submission process expect some rejections but make sure you don't allow them to discourage you instead learn something from those letters that can make the next contact even better never ever pay an agent to represent you that's not how it works agents get paid when they sell your work i don't normally recommend new writers pay for editing services because these fees are often very high i am a published writer with books on the market and getting ready for release and i have never paid to have my work edited while i make every conscientious effort to make certain my work is as near perfect as i can get it i also know that i'll be assigned a book editor once the manuscript has been optioned for publication the book editor and story editor will pick up what i've missed as well as identify what might need additional tweaking mind you i am not forced to make changes to the story but out of times when an edit is suggested i'll make it i have in the past not agreed with a suggestion and have won the 'battle' but sincerely the editing process need not be fretted over i view it as a chance to learn more which can never hurt a person eh the important thing for you to concentrate on right now is getting the manuscript completed and error free if you haven't already done this no point in submitting to agents or publishers without a completed manuscript they don't want ideas they want the finished product good luck to you o Peer review Open Directory Project Style guide Oxford English Dictionary A Course In Miracles Screenplay Software testing GED Plame affair Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Search engine optimization Microeconomics Scholarly method Extreme Programming Patent Social rule Copyright Perl The Amazing Race Screenwriting XML Network effect Doctor Who spin-offs Theory of conduct Windows XP Royal Assent Dark Phoenix Saga United States Postal Service PNG Labour economics Francis Crick Richard Bentley Academic publishing The Man with the Golden Gun ISO 9000 Self-publishing Advertising Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Open access Friedrich Schleiermacher SAT The Internet Movie Database Ebook Crossword Scientific method Trademark H2G2 Microsoft Pharmaceutical company Academia New Testament Free will Jean-Jacques Rousseau Gmail Resident Evil (video game) Internet Group Management Protocol Alcoholics Anonymous Strategic management Neopets Mary Wollstonecraft American and British English differences Stock Contract Scientology beliefs and practices Patent application Divorce College admissions Economics Coercion Advance fee fraud Amazon.com Milton H.
