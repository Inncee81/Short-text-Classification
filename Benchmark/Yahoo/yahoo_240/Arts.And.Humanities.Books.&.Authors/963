why was harry potter the rightful owner of the elder plus other book questions i just read harry potter the deathly hallows stop reading this question if you haven t finished the book and i can t help but be confused by the ending here are my questions why exactly was harry the rightful owner of the elder wand and why didn t voltemorte s spells cause any damage to harry while harry was looking into the pensieve he saw snape having a conversation with dumbledore in which dumbledore stated that harry and voltemorte would have to kill each other in order to end voltemorte s existence apparently a piece of voltemort s soul had entered harry after he was killed so the only way to finish him was to make sure that harry died too however harry lives at the end of the book was dumbledore simply incorrect about harry needing to die when harry is knocked out with the killing curse he goes into a dream like state he has a conversation with dumbledore and there is a crying baby in the dream what was this crying baby ok it seems that a number of your are very strongly mistaken so i will go ahead and clear some things up for you it is discovered by the end of the book that the elder wand is passed simply by defeating its owner not by death therefore when malfoy disarmed dumbledore in the th book before snape finishes him off malfoy becomes the rightful owner of the elder wand furthermore when harry ron and hermoine get captured by fenrir grayback and are brought to the malfoy residence harry ends up stealing draco's wand thus defeating him making him the rightful owner of the elder wand in the last scene when harry kills voldemort the elder wand refuses to kill harry because the wand knows that harry is the wands owner dumbledore was not incorrect at all yes he knew that harry had to receive the killing curse from voldemort once again to destroy the fragment of his soul that lived inside of harry however dumbledore also strongly speculated that because voldemort had reconstructed his resurrected body using harry's blood that the protection charm cast upon harry from his mother years ago would live on that is what protected harry from being killed when he was a baby and then finally in the forbidden forest it protected him once more so instead of destroying him voldemort only destroyed the fragment of his own soul living inside of harry and finally the little crying figure in the corner is the fragment of voldemort's soul that was just destroyed inside of harry Hogwarts subjects Ron Weasley Battle of Hogwarts Harry Potter: Book Seven Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter Draco Malfoy Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Order of the Phoenix Blood purity (Harry Potter) Diagon Alley Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film) Sirius Black Horace Slughorn Horcrux Minor Hufflepuffs Hermione Granger Ginny Weasley Bellatrix Lestrange Minor Ministry officials in the Harry Potter books Professor Quirrell Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game) Dumbledore's Army Peter Pettigrew Cedric Diggory Remus Lupin Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game) Dark Art Sybill Trelawney Neville Longbottom Weasley family Messiahs in fiction and fantasy James and Lily Potter Ministry of Magic Tom Riddle's diary Wizarding world Potions in Harry Potter Narcissa Malfoy Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year House-elf Occlumency Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game) Cho Chang Nymphadora Tonks Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film) Fred and George Weasley Half-Blood Prince (character) Hogwarts Houses Kain (Legacy of Kain) R.A.B.
