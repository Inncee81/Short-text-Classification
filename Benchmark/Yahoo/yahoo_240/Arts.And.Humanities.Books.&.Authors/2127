in the exorcist the book is father karras gay i have just recently finished reading the exorcist and was wondring if father karras was gay to me there were some vague references to it such as when him and dyer are talking about leaving the order and dyer says something about because a lot of homosexuals are but it is never said does anyone have any idea is this his crisis of faith or is it because his mother is in such a bad way or is it a mixture of both been so long since i read it and i don't remember that dialog but i seem to remember that father dyer was a bit of a character and the comment may have been a joke funny or not based on the fact that karras was talking about leaving i will be trying to find this passage i believe that his faith crisis rested solely in his mother's condition The Exorcist III The Exorcist Regan MacNeil Avenue Q Theory of conduct Gay Social rule Laura Schlessinger Kodocha Little Britain South Park Knots Landing Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Exorcism Slashdot trolling phenomena Rich Mullins Sexual orientation Ten Commandments Friends Richard Littlejohn Slashdot subculture Homosexuality and Christianity I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Alex Karras Whose Line Is It Anyway?
