question about stephenie meyers eclipse warning major spoilers and very long summaries and questions who else loved felt a bit sad about eclipse i loved all the information and backrounds but i wish they wouldve told more about jasper and alices relationship hehe i liked how jasper didnt even let alice fight that was funny overprotective fool alice i also liked how edward wasnt so cautious about kissing bella and he was so nice and mature throughout the whole thing i like the action yes again cuz of bella but its not her fault just her luck lol but i did enjoy it the stories at the bonfire the sam emily and leah triangle and of course finally a wedding but about feeling sad because of some of the parts i couldnt believe balla loved both edward and jacob it made me hurt for edward i mean i actually felt like smacking bella for hurting edward so much i actually like bella shes a good friend but i love edward and i have no problem with jacob but he made things more complicated and he was sort of immature with edward throughout the whole book i fet so bad when he found out that she loved jacob too i wanted to cry so much throughout the book this one part made me really sad and glad edward couldnt read her mind at first it was worse because there was a smaller part of me smaller but getting louder and angrier every minute screaming at the rest of me that craved a different set of arms so then there was fresh guilt to season the pain bella when she broke down after telling jacob who she chose some of me thinks she only chose edward because she felt like she owed it to him and cuz she didnt want to hurt him anymore that she really did want to choose jacob ha how many of you emailed stephenie about that bella loving jacob i wanted to so bad just to ask her if she would choose him and leave edward in breaking dawn oh another question sorry guys what did edward mean by writing she was afraid of hurtin you and she didnt want to make you feel obligated in any way but i know that if things had gone the other way i wouldve wanted the choice thank you for her foreverything ok did he mean that she didnt want to hurt jacob by not sending him an invitation or by choosing eward over jacob and by if things gone the other way i wouldve wanted a choice what did he mean by that and the last part meant that he thanked jacob for surrenduring her to him i still cant believe bella thought that jacob loved her more than edward remember when he surrendered i know she thought that edward would do it for her and sshe didnt want to argue with jacob but part of me really thinks she believed it to conclude i wish stephenie didnt have to make bella love jake i still dont hate him but it made everything more complicated oh and all the stuff about edward and bella doing it didnt bug me their adults anyways i did love it more than new moon but i still have to read eclipse again about more times to even compare it to twilight if any of you did email stephenie what did she reply back what do you guys think of the cover now that youve read it ha told you my summaries and questions would be long ok the note edward sent jacob was talking about the invitations bella didn't send him one because she didn't want to hurt him any more but edward went ahead and sent him one because if she had of chosen jacob edward would still have wanted the choice of whether or not to go to the wedding so he was giving jacob the choice by sending him the invite i didn't email stephenie because i thought bella falling in love with jacob was natural edward left her and jacob was there to pick up the pieces i don't blame bella for going back to edward because i think he is her soul mate but jacob was her rock when she felt she was no longer whole haven t you ever heard of people falling in love with their best friends well i thought it was very realistic for her to be in love with both edward and jacob at the same time besides edward gets things to easily he needed a little competition i am very proud of edward for the way he handled things i think that might have been a really prominent reason why bella chose him because all he wanted was her happiness not to win her jacob is the bestest of best friends i would be happy to claim him as a friend of mine but bella and edward belong together jacob will understand when he finds the person he is supposed to imprint on he doesn't know any greater love because he hasn't found it yet i think the reason steph doesn't put more about alice and jasper is because their relationship has no word that can describe it she uses their actions to show their love for one another like when jasper went all vampire on bella alice was there to sooth him and during the fight jasper protected alice with all the power he has i think very subtly she is telling us about their relationship through was they do for each other oh and i loved the part when the werewolves were at the cullen's and jacob boxed bella and alice in jasper was there before jacob could blink now that is true protectiveness sorry it was so long Theory of conduct Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Jon Secada Avenue Q Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an
