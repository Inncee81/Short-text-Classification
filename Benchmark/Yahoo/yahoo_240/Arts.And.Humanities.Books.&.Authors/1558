where do i get a manager to help me publish my poetry and short stories i think you meant a literary agent right if you truly desire publication there are several things you can do avenues to take let's discuss the poetry first if it's traditional publishing you seek then you'll need to either look for an agent or make submissions directly to publishers neither one is easy you can go to the library and use the literary marketplace which is a book of publishers and agents look for ones that specialize in poetry chapbooks once you have several of them selected make sure you follow their submissions guidelines exactly as they have them listed sending in your work your way as opposed to their way marks you as an amateur something you want to avoid if you want to skip the library then go to preditors editors web site and use the comprehensive listing of agents and publishers they have there if you want to self publish the book then visit lulu com where you can publish anything for free as for the short fiction look at magazines that accept short fiction pieces from freelance writers if you go to the preditors editors website they have a detailed listing of magazines and e zines also at the same site there is a listing of writing competitions this is a good arena for short fiction because a lot of competitions put together a compilation book of the winning entry plus the runners up avoid competitions that charge high entrance fees usually it's the entrance fees collected that make up the prize money and generally the host makes a huge profit there are tons of reputable competitions out there that result in publication of your work these are the best because aside from whatever cash prize there is you get a publishing credit avoid places that publish anthologies of every single entrant's work they only sell the finished product to the people who entered not a good publishing credit good luck to you o Publishing Literature Harlan Ellison Fan fiction Doctor Who spin-offs Copyleft Japanese literature Vanity press Imagism Poker jargon Thomas M.
