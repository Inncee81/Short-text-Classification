what's the row of numbers on the copyright page of books you open a book and like at the copyright page you see a list of number example taken from harry potter book what does this mean i know it must have something to do with the printing but the and have me all confused usually the numbers will look like this in a book and the lowest means it's a second printing of the book can someone explain these numbers to me my father in law use to be a book aprasal person in his younger years and we actually went through a whole afternoon one time him telling me all about books and books he's read and he could even recall old really old books and their authors and publishers lol well i thought it was cool but here goes the smallest number tells you which printing of the book you have for example if you see then you have a fourth printing it has to do with how books are historically made each page of a book is converted to a metal plate which is used to make impressions if another printing run is necessary you load the plates back onto the printing machine and off you go but how do you indicate that this is a second printing it would be expensive to burn a brand new plate just to change the word first to second on the copyright page instead you pre load all the printing numbers onto your master and each time you start a new printing run you scratch off the lowest number even though a lot of book printing nowadays is done with computers rather than metal plates the old method of indicating a printing is retained out of tradition Book Printing press Typeface Copy protection CDC 6600 Movie projector Ebook MAME Digital photography Copyright Glass Photocopying Compact disc Cray-1 Typewriter German car number plates Hello world program Harry Potter Forth programming language Trademark Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince ZX Spectrum Open access J.
