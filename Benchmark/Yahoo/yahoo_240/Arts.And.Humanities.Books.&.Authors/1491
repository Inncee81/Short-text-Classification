what's so great about harry potter books i don't see why people like them so much i mean i was into the whole harry potter thing in rd grade and if you asked me then i would've said they were my favorite books i just bought the th and th ones last weekend and they're really boring i can't get through all the fillers yes i do believe jk rowling stuffs the books with useless fillers to make it longer i don't care about wizard politics i hardly care about real life muggle politics i skimmed like every other chapter the only thing slightly interesting are the hogwarts scenes and even those are poorly written and fail to catch my attention no i'm not ignorant i love reading books with depth something thought provoking or moving or just plain funny interesting okay i know i'm gonna get a lot of hate messages right here but instead of railing against me why don't you guys tell me why i should even bother finishing the series it all depends on you don't read if you don't bother but the fact is that you grossly outnumbered the number of people who have read harry potter and not liked it is about in every we feel sorry for you sorry for being rude but harry potter doesn't sell million copies worldwide not for nothing Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire J.
