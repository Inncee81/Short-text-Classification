how can i get out of my comic writer's block i'm in a horrible writer's block for the first story of a comic can someone help me the comic is called weird stories of human stupidity the idea is that i can take some everyday situations say a night at a resturaunt or a pit stop at a dingy's diner and turn it to something horrible like this one guy i'll have an ice tea waitress is a nestea alright one guy hell no actually yeah panels later waitress did you want fries with that one guy well what the hell do you think or that public restroom involves a guy screaming in pain in a stall until suddenly the stall explodes i also take popular culture like that new harry potter movie order of the phoenix and twist a scene where harry and other kids are flying on brooms through the streets and show it where one of the kids in the scene either gets eaten by a shark or sent to a crash after hitting a bird well this happens to me a lot and i try the wierdest things like looking at random words in the dictionary trying to spark something but my best bet is to look through joke books or research jokes and watch the news then combine the story or place with a joke and there ya go Teen Girl Squad The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Garfield Little Britain Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Late Night with Conan O'Brien Sin City Whose Line Is It Anyway?
