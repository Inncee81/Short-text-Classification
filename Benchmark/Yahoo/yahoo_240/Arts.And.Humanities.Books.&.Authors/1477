how can i get a short story published okay i have a couple of short story ideas that i would like published they're both in the horror suspense etc type of story but they're not really ghost stories they're kinda crime drama psychopath stories where's a good place to send them in thanks look at magazines that accept short fiction pieces from freelance writers if you go to the preditors editors website they have a detailed listing of magazines and e zines also at the same site there is a listing of writing competitions this is a good arena for short fiction because a lot of competitions put together a compilation book of the winning entry plus the runners up avoid competitions that charge high entrance fees usually it's the entrance fees collected that make up the prize money and generally the host makes a huge profit there are tons of reputable competitions out there that result in publication of your work these are the best because aside from whatever cash prize there is you get a publishing credit avoid places that publish anthologies of every single entrant's work they only sell the finished product to the people who entered not a good publishing credit good luck to you o Atlas Comics (1950s) Credit card Bank Literature Poker jargon Chuck Palahniuk Crime fiction Bernice Summerfield UK Singles Chart Copyleft Internet fraud Monopoly Fan fiction Thomas M.
