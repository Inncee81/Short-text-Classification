my major harry potter and the deathly hallows question warning spoilers when harry died in the forest after voldemort used the killing spell why was he able to return my last question has left many of me and my friends in a debate some state he was able to return because he was the master of death others state he was able to come back because harry's blood still runs in voldemorts veins voldemort made the mistake of using harry's blood in the th book to re generate him self there for lily's protection still lives on others state that voldemort really didn't kill harry but only the horcrux in him others state it was simply his sacrafice and love that allowed him to come back my theory is and he was able to come back due to the protection that his mother gave him which still flows in voldemort's veins the curse hit the horcrux in harry and not him so he was able to come back but these contradict b c then he came back due to the curse hitting the horcrux and not harry or was the blood the reason for his revival if it is his blood in lord voldemort that allowed for his survival then wouldn't he just keep coming back to life if he kept dieing hypothetically if lv hit him with the curse again could he come back to life because of the blood also this all has to do with harry dieing in the forest and coming back nothing to do with the duel between them in hogwarts dumbledore explains it in the next chapter voldemort did something really stupid by insisting he had to take harry's blood to regain a physical body in effect he made himself akin to a horcrux for harry though not a true horcrux he still became an anchor to allow harry to return to life should he be killed harry had the choice he could have died or he could return and he'd always have that choice as long as voldemort lived in that particular body the problem with a living horcrux is that it doesn't have to physically be destroyed in some manner in order to be of no use as a horcrux should it die either through being killed or through some other means it destroys the piece of the soul within it harry was an unintentional horcrux that is to say that voldemort never planned to make him a horcrux and he didn't realize he had done so the night he tried killing him as a baby so he had to die in order for the part of him that was the horcrux to be destroyed but he didn't truely die rather he was very near to death when he met dumbledore at what looked like king's cross station i've seen this as suggesting king's cross is more than just a place where muggles and witches and wizard's catch a train it's also a place where the near dead and those who have crossed over to the spirit realm can meet and talk which is exactly what was happening between him and dumbledore and dumbledore told him he had the choice he could choose to board a train meaning he could choose to truely die and finally be with his parents again or he could return to the world of the living fully alive rather than being a ghost harry chose the latter but the piece of voldemort's spirit he'd brought with him could do so it would forever be stuck between the two plains of exsistence had someone destroyed voldemort's physical form before all his horcruxes had been destroyed and he'd been reborn without using harry's blood to do so then harry's sacrificing himself would have truely meant he would have died now when i said earlier that voldemort was akin to a horcrux for harry i was not saying he had a part of harry's soul in himself harry's soul was not shattered in order to make a horcrux but a part of him flowed through voldemort's veins a part of him would always be alive as long as voldemort's physical form remained as it was the night he returned and it was that that made him akin to a horcrux for harry as long as he had harry's blood in him harry could return from the dead Blood purity (Harry Potter) James and Lily Potter Horace Slughorn Minor Ministry officials in the Harry Potter books Battle of Hogwarts Ginny Weasley Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Hogwarts subjects Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Order of the Phoenix Kain (Legacy of Kain) R.A.B.
