is there any romantic books written about irene marcos and mr araneta it is said imee marcos and bombong marcos had always the limelight while irene had always kept a low profile i think some journalist or novelist should explore the possibility of writing a romantic novel about irene and her husband or is there already a book written about the subject if you mean imelda marcos leader in the philippino islands all i know is that marcos was a hero in the fight against the japs in ww and much revered by the u s that's also why he got to be president i'm not sure he intended to be a dictator but he became one and that's bad to a certain extent he was more like a father forcing his kid to drink milk i think he was more of a despot than a dictator now for the romantic side maybe and probably he was in love with imelda between the two he probably the romatic party she had been a miss something in a beauty contest she was very supportive of the marcos regime but she also had the biggest shoe collection ever seen this was found out when they left in a hurry the country on this my feeling is that she probably abused him and led him to his downfall Imelda Marcos Ferdinand Marcos Benigno Aquino, Jr. EDSA Revolution Philippines Anti-communism EastEnders Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, manga or movie only characters Quezon City Marco Polo Novel Paul Wolfowitz Amnesty International History of the Beatles Democracy Philippine general election, 2004 Nella Larsen Rape Literature High-heeled shoe Shoe Mystique (comics) King Lear Dictator Jaime Cardinal Sin Jos__ Figueres Ferrer Italian general election, 2006 Lolita Zapatista Army of National Liberation Neoconservatism in the United States Jinyong Marcos P__rez Jim__nez Divorce Robert Falcon Scott Robert Mugabe E.
