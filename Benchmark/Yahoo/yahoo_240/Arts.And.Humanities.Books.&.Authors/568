hp encyclopedia i know that rowlling is planing to write a hp encyclopedia although not in the near future but ive heard that she has written like hp encyclopedias or sth like that is it true so are they in sale only in uk or can i download them from the internet other than the seven harry potter books j k rowling has written two spin off books for the british charity comic relief based on two books that hogwarts students use in the actual books they are fantastic beasts and where to find them by newt scamander and quidditch through the ages by kennilworthy whisp and are written in a primarily in universe style that is to say they are written by fictional authors and in the case of fantastic beasts have humorous commentary from harry ron and hermione they aren't encyclopedias per se they are more like informational books on two different subjects i suppose they are encyclopedias but very much slimmed down fantastic beasts and where to find them documents various beasts in the harry potter universe and quidditch through the ages goes in depth on the sport of quidditch and its origins they are available worldwide i believe and no you can't download them from the internet Harry Potter Minor characters associated with Quidditch J.
