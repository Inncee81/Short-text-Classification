attn harry potter fans serious question on book spoiler i don't understand one part of the storyline why couldn't dumbledore let harry know that when lord voldermort tries to kill him it will only kill the bit of sould inside harry why did harry need to think that when he gives himself up to lord voldermort he will die dumbledore could've told that to snape at least no what was the need of keeping it secret and harry thinking that he has to die in order for voldermort to die too explain please thanks i think because harry had to be willing to die and willing to face death on his own if dumbledore had told him then he would know that he truly wasn't facing death if dumbledore hadn't made the journey difficult for harry harry's hot head might dominate his good heart if presented with the facts harry might try to seize the hallows at the wrong time for the wrong reasons p dumbledore also says that harry is the true master of death because the true master does not seek to run away from death he accepts that he must die and understands that there are far far worse things in the living world than dying p i hope this helps try re reading ch king's cross here's where dumbledore explains everything Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Harry Potter (character) Lord Voldemort Severus Snape Albus Dumbledore Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Death Eater Ginny Weasley Harry Potter: Book Seven Dates in Harry Potter Hogwarts subjects Magic (Harry Potter) Order of the Phoenix Magical objects in Harry Potter Sybill Trelawney Minor Hufflepuffs Hermione Granger Battle of Hogwarts Horace Slughorn Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Minor Ravenclaws Horcrux Draco Malfoy Ministry of Magic Wizarding world James and Lily Potter Theory of conduct Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Hogwarts Neville Longbottom Professor Quirrell Bellatrix Lestrange Harry Potter newspapers and magazines Ron Weasley R.A.B.
