what did you think when you read the last page of harry potter deathly hallows how did you feel knowing that this would be the last time you would be hearing from harry and friends i was sad but at the same time happy i thought it was a great book but the epilogue could have been a little better i can't believe some people didn't think it was dramatic enough since harry didn't die in their opinion if you really think about it he did die but since it was a self sacrifice he came back i think it was really dramatic with so many wonderful characters getting killed i will miss the excitement that comes each time a new book comes out though but the series ended well so that is all that really matters Harry Potter (character) Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Ron Weasley Minor Ravenclaws Toad Patrol Ginny Weasley Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Severus Snape Shaggy dog story Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Scenes from a Memory Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sirius Black Nico Robin Colonel Potter Sydney Riot of 1879 Minor Hufflepuffs Minor Slytherins J.
