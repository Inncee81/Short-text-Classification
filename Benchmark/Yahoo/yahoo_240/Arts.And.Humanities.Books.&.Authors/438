i read frankenstien and i have a few questions how the story came about why the facination with science fiction what are the themes the fascination is not with science fiction but with nature remember the shelleys and byron were part of the second romantic movement the theme here is hubris or acting godlike the fascination was for writing a book about creating life and the subject of nature vs nurture the creature was created but not nurtured by its creator it was left loose in nature to fend for itself totally unprepared for what it would find outside the walls of victor frankenstein's room the book is not really considered sci fi but rather gothic and romantic period the discussion that prompted the creation of the book was about romanticism and nature vs nurture and the subject came up concerning what would happen if a creature was created by man and then left to take care of itself would it be able to survive how much does nurturing account for the kind of people we become how much does nature and our environment play a role in our development i wrote two very successful academic papers on this book i taught it several times get the sci fi aspect out of your head the actual creation of the creature is one single page in the book the rest has absolutely nothing to do with sci fi think of it as a romantic or gothic period novel more romantic than gothic one question i always ask students with regards to this book is what happens when science is wrong pax c Science fiction Frankenstein French literature of the 19th century Gothic novel Mary Shelley Frank Herbert Frankenstein's monster Creation-evolution controversy Young Earth creationism English literature Literature God Victor Hugo Science fiction film Urantia Horror film George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron Theodicy Themes in Blade Runner Romanticism Francis Galton A Course In Miracles Supernatural Middle Ages in history Nature versus nurture Culture History of modern literature Percy Bysshe Shelley Intelligent design Mythology Creationism Sexual orientation John Polidori Fictional character Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Creation science Atomism Sociobiology Earthsea Evolutionary creationism Summa Theologiae Origin belief Infantilism Michael Crichton Don Rosa Teach the Controversy Arthur C.
