the order of the phoenix where did they go obviously during deathly hallows voldemort was very much in control but why do you think the order was so seemingly unorganized was it because no clear leader emerged perhaps because of moody's death they managed to move harry successfully sort of but after that they seemed to be working seperately and in stealth why didn't they form an actual army and prepare for a big battle as they knew must come perhaps then their losses wouldn't have been so great the order of the phoenix was not able to continue because their headquarters had been invaded and due to voldemort's rise to power they would die faster if they stayed together so therefore the order of the phoenix had a temporary split up but as you might already know near the end of the book in the battle of hogwarts trhey all reunited in the room of requirement and you got to remember the only person who would have been able to keep the order going would have been dumbledore and if not him then moody of course others wanted the order ot continue but c'mon nobody was powerful enough to find a safe way to do so and also ther could havee been intruders in the order imperiused members why do you think they ahd to check like lupin had to say i am remus john lupin werewolf married to nymphadora tonks and in some ocassions also known as moony i hope i was of any help thanks Order of the Phoenix Remus Lupin Nymphadora Tonks Death Eater Magical objects in Harry Potter Battle of Hogwarts Severus Snape Sirius Black Lord Voldemort Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Harry Potter (character) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Dates in Harry Potter Minor Ministry officials in the Harry Potter books Hogwarts Magic (Harry Potter) Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Hogwarts subjects Alastor Moody Albus Dumbledore Ron Weasley Blood purity (Harry Potter) Hogwarts Houses Minor Hufflepuffs James and Lily Potter Minor members of the Order of the Phoenix Draco Malfoy Peter Pettigrew Magical beasts (Harry Potter) Dumbledore's Army Half-Blood Prince (character) Horcrux Bellatrix Lestrange Lucius Malfoy Harry Potter: Book Seven Potions in Harry Potter Dolores Umbridge Minor Ravenclaws Hermione Granger Patronus Charm Dementor Sybill Trelawney Ginny Weasley Rita Skeeter Barty Crouch Hogwarts Floor Directory House-elf Narcissa Malfoy Minor Hogwarts teachers Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year R.A.B.
