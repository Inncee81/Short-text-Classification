there's something i don't get about the harry potter books in the harry potter books the weasley's are always worrying about how to pay for school supplies right but they never say anything about tuition cost in fact paying for the actual schooling and housing never comes up anywhere are we just supposed to assume that tuition at hogwarts is free i remember in one of the books dumbledore said somthing to tom riddle that the school had a fund to help out students in need when dumbledore had told tom that he could come to school there tom said he had no money and dumbledore told him the school had a fund to help out students that didn't have a means to pay maybe the weasleys got help from the school or maybe they got to go for free because their father worked for the ministry not sure but since the weasleys were friends with dumbledore i'm sure that he found a way for their kids to attend school their no matter what Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Ginny Weasley Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Ron Weasley Lord Voldemort Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Dates in Harry Potter Rubeus Hagrid Hogwarts Houses Hogwarts Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Diagon Alley Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Hogwarts subjects Albus Dumbledore Death Eater Harry Potter (character) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Dumbledore's Army Hermione Granger Minor Ravenclaws Lucius Malfoy Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Minor Hufflepuffs Horace Slughorn Fred and George Weasley Harry Potter: Book Seven Sybill Trelawney Minor Ministry officials in the Harry Potter books Tom Riddle's diary J.
