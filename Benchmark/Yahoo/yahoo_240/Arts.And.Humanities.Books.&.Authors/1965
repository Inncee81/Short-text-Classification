why are people proud not to have read any harry potter books i don't get why people sounds so happy to have not read it don't they understand that all they are doing is missing out ok i'm no criticising people who just don't like them i just wonder why it is something to be proud of and not simply a fact as far as books go i hate lord of the rings and the da vinci code but i'm not proud of that fact i just do nivekb you really have no idea what a complete lemming you sound do you i love the argument that it's a kid's book and it would be so below an adult to read them whatever to each his or her own i'm and i loved them i have never met a book about teenage wizards before sorry i didn't know they were so prevalent i thought they were very well written and very enthralling i think people are really limiting themselves by refusing to read books that are labeled as children's books they could really be missing some good entertaining material i know there are many ya novels that i have really enjoyed why should it matter if it was written for adults or not if i enjoy it i enjoy it no matter how hard the vocabulary is and of course there are always people who seem to hate whatever is popular just because it is popular and they just like going against the tide but anyways to the question writer just ignore the prideful remarks and enjoy the series edit just to be clear if you have no interest or really didn't like them that's cool it's just the uppity attitude that bugs me The Chronicles of Narnia Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Tolkien fandom Anne Rice Novel Humphrey Bogart Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Neil Gaiman Socrates Charles Dickens Theory of conduct Fan fiction Censorship in Australia Children's literature The Fairly OddParents Intelligent design Transactional analysis Nicomachean Ethics Isaac Asimov Atheism The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Deconstruction Canon (fiction) Esperanto as an international language John Howard Yoder David Hume The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Nigger Discworld Motivation Literacy Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Fundamentalism Harry Potter (character) Asperger syndrome Plame affair Hungarian language Fahrenheit 451 Objectivist philosophy C.
