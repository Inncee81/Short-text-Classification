need sound resources to publish my own book besides wheatmark lulu or iuniverse anyone the above poster is essentially right however you as the writer have to determine for yourself how you want your work published according to your question you've already determined self publishing to be the route you want to take i'm not going to change your mind nor will i attempt to self publishing costs the writer money in every case except with lulu com the drawback is that you won't get a single bit of promotional or marketing help without buying those packages using the ones you've listed or some others there's usually a promise of promotion marketing that usually never materializes i own a website for writers and there are some members who've gone the self publishing route some have been 'successful' in that they've sold books have had some good marketing tools and are pleased with the final product others have not been so lucky iuniverse is one of the choices people have not been happy with a couple of the members have used booksurge now that it is owned and operated by amazon with booksurge there are different types of packages a writer can choose from depending on how much they want to spend and what services they're looking for plus the book is listed for sale on amazon and their other 'bookstores' personally if a writer has decided to go with self publishing then lulu com sounds like the best avenue because you can use your money for marketing instead of for the book but if a writer is looking for some editing and additional help services then booksurge sounds good too as with all self publishing the problem lies in the fact the manuscripts aren't properly edited prior to publication like traditional publishing good luck to you hope this answers your question o Publishing Vanity press Microeconomics Textbook Economics Trademark UK Singles Chart Capitalism Amazon.com Wealth Supply and demand Labour economics Electronic commerce Legal research Windows XP Monetary policy Gross domestic product Survivor (TV series) Mein Kampf Advertising Monopoly (game) The Joker's Wild IBM PC compatible Marketing Dot-com Password Law of value Ashton-Tate $ale of the Century Copyright Privatization Cable television Neuro-linguistic programming Commodity United States Postal Service Surplus value Ethics Prices of production TLC Avenue Q Anarchism and capitalism Productive and unproductive labour The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Retailer Infocom Public good Product Lifecycle Management Pyramid scheme Theory of conduct The Skeptical Environmentalist DVD Model (economics) Social rule The Apprentice 2 Philosophy of business Children's literature CPU cache Oxford English Dictionary FairTax Inflation Public domain East Germany Commodore International Copy protection Economy of India Labor theory of value Nicomachean Ethics Stock Goodness and value theory Windows 2000 Laserdisc Amway Divorce Contract Unemployment Wheel of Fortune Free trade Scientology beliefs and practices Microsoft Capital accumulation Price discrimination Economic calculation problem Relations of production Intellectual property Mariah Carey (album) Externality Inventory Health insurance Ethernet The Emancipation of Mimi Fair use Extreme Programming Labor-power Apple Macintosh Exchange value Marvel Comics
