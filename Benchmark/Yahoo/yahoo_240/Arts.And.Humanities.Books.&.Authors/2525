do any other authors use music as a means of evoking an emotion required to write a passage basically what the title suggests do authors use music to evoke the emotions needed to write an emotional passage or scene in their works i have used this method before and found that it creates a more dynamic and interesting writing because the emotions felt by the characters are being felt by the author creating a more believable experience i don't know if this directly addresses your concerns but i have noticed over years of time that fanfiction authors often use the theme of a song either its lyrics or music or both to structure short stories and create a feel inside themselves to attach non original characters to i'm sure this is probably used by original character authors as well as it is a valid method of creation however as songs are mostly short and more a musing on an underlying theme they should not be used as more than the dressing for a passage as you say they are a great device for tying in a scene to a larger theme though tolkien's works are filled with original songs that evoke an emotional link to the past of middle earth or valinor and his legend of the creation of ea arda the world encompassing the west and middle earth an unnamed lands beyond by eru the one almost like god but not quite is cast in terms of the music of creation p s i suppose one could extend the idea into the old epics stories that are songs songs are stories in this sense music is the wind that blows upon the storyteller and sends his or her words floating to others the point of view will always be somewhat altered for the reader but the skillful writer will almost be able to make the reader hear the tune as the words flow Storytelling Arda Screenwriting Poetry The Lord of the Rings Aul__ Deconstruction Book of Mormon Scientology beliefs and practices Time travel The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Ainulindal__ Creation according to Genesis Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Baroque music A Course In Miracles Apostolic Fathers Serialism Classical music era God and gender Michael Moorcock Emotions (album) Genre fiction Stuttering Robert A.
