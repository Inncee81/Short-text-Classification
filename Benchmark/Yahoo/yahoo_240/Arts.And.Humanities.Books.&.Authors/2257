did you cry over the last potter book i did and after only five minutes of idle browsing through it in a bookstore too i was so disappointed after all that hype this was the result what an anticlimax it is my opinion that rowling really bombed out this time i've read every potter book at least three times but this last is probably one i'll finish from beginning to end only once if at all anybody else feel this way i've started reading harry potter when i was seven before it became this crazy hype i'm fourteen now i did cry over the last book i also cried over the second book when i thought harry was dying in the fifth book when sirius died the sixth book when dumbledore died and the seventh book when snape died even before reading the prince's tale i knew snape was good all along it was depressing to learn about snape's past i knew something was up when harry saw snape's worst memory in the fifth book i'm glad everything came to light in the seven book but it was still sad that snape died snape's history was probably the only part i really liked in the book i wasn't completely satisfied with the last book though there was just too much focus on harry and the epilogue was extraneous when jk rowling said two main characters would die i believed that harry and ron would die and the last book came as a disappointment it seemed like she only killed off two semi main characters i also hated how she passed off some of the characters' death as insignificant although there were lags in the story as well this came as a shock because it's the only book where i thought she lagged this book didn't make me long for more and so it wasn't my favorite Severus Snape Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Harry Potter (character) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Hogwarts subjects Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Harry Potter: Book Seven Dates in Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Hermione Granger Lord Voldemort Hogwarts Houses Sybill Trelawney Sirius Black Minor Hufflepuffs Magic (Harry Potter) Ginny Weasley Order of the Phoenix Half-Blood Prince (character) Remus Lupin James and Lily Potter Horace Slughorn Albus Dumbledore Ron Weasley Draco Malfoy Rita Skeeter Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Blood purity (Harry Potter) Magical objects in Harry Potter Rubeus Hagrid Battle of Hogwarts Minor Ravenclaws Peter Pettigrew Fan fiction Neville Longbottom Ministry of Magic Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter R.A.B.
