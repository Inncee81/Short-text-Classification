do you like this st chapter in my book ok its a mystery chapter something s different here it is the last day of school better yet the last day of johnson academy junior high it s a minute till the bell we sit on the edge of our seats staring at the clock with our finished exams being taken up by our old monotone teacher i ll be glad to leave her behind if i hear beth stop staring at the clock and pay attention i will rip my hair from the roots then suddenly we hear the bell ring almost like god calling us through the gates of heaven the gates being the exit doors of our dreaded school we all shoot out of our seats and race to the door have a great summer and make good decisions bellowed the dreaded teacher i meet up with my group of friends mandi angela and christi we giddied up and strode out of the door with confident victorious looks on our faces we were ranting about the after school party we were having party in our definition was a get together with all of us instead of the parties the upper class girls would have including all the boys and girls worthy enough to step foot on their grass but party or not we always had a lot of fun we walked down the sidewalk leading to my neighborhood and yammered on when he caught my attention it was joseph summers the hottest guy to hit puberty with his almond hair and eyes of emerald green as sung by dolly parton he was sure to make every girl in the room swoon but something was different about him he was walking alone on side walk on the other side of the street looking at his feet while he stalked his whole gait was different he usually had this confident stride with his hair blowing in the breeze smiling as the girls all stared but now he walked briskly shuffling his feet he wore a black hoodie even though it felt like a thousand degrees out side then i saw something very peculiar he wiped his cheek and up around his eye as if he was weeping angela stopped her endless yacking when christi nudged her and pointed to joseph they all silenced and noticed the same thing i did he looked at us probably noticing the sudden silence we all looked down and at each other as if to cover up by talking again joseph lives right in front of me and i loved him since i was ten we never spoke our parents never really got along something about our dads don t like each other i was too young to recall he always seems normal happy had a lot of good guy friends i never thought the day would come when i see him cry just as i thought i ve seen everything he all of a sudden pulls a gun out of his jacket and points it to his head on impulse i sprint to him everything is in slow motion in my head cars stop and honk when i run in front of them stop no i scream he shocked looked at me then when i m almost to him he pulls the trigger yes yes i know gramma and punc errors this is a rough draft i'm giving it to an editor and we are going to talk it over if you want the secon chapter e mail me some people wanted to read the second chapter to fully understand this is not it the second shapter is too long this is a clip from a chap as i step out of my door and into the sun i can feel the warmth caress my skin i take a deep breath as a comforting cool breeze tickles my cheeks and lifts my hair i take my steps on the sidewalk leading down my front yard i can hear birds singing as if greeting me as i stride down my sidewalk and into my driveway i almost hear heavens chorus singing behind me then i see the house he used to live in i stop and stare at it then i remember what happened painful memories come back stabbing me ripping me apart then i see him blood draining down his head i scream and wake up from my mental hell i look around at the white walls then i remember where i m at the mental hospital then comes rushing in clarice the nurse she looks at me with sorrowful eyes and holds my strapped down arms and says its only a dream your fine its all over to be honest i read the first or so sentences didn't like the simile bell ring almost like god calling us through the gates of heaven think the first sentence needs to be more capturing its boring doesn't capture the reader's attention hmm lemme see i finished reading it too many run on sentences too many redundant and unnecessary sentences explanations you get off topic from the story uhh punctuation errors its not long enough to be a chapter you changed tenses too much went from present to past tense or vice versa when you weren't talking about the past example he looked at us probably noticing the sudden silence we all looked down and at each other as if to cover up by talking again i thought i ve seen everything he all of a sudden pulls a gun out of his jacket and points it to his head keep writing though skills
