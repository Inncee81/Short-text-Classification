jk rowling her books are incredibly successful but i heard from different sources that they are not well written is this true i like the books and have read every one of them they are actually the reason i started reading in the first place but whats wrong with them personally i don't think they are well written but that just gets a lot of negative comments here i blame her editor jk's writing drives me nuts with all her superfluous uses of the word that a definite no no any editor would tell you to remove she also writes in the passive tense again any editor would correct that those are two things you learn very early on in writing i have commented a lot here lately on the fact so many people seem to have questions about the last book it seems to me the book asks more questions than it answers not a good scenario for a final book of a series is it and when jk has to literally go on tv and online to explain her book something is wrong with it right she has made up all kinds of extra information for the epilogue she has explained what the crying being meant she has even had to explain the pensieve which has been in her stories since way back the stories are entertaining i do not deny that i do have another problem with her work but i won't mention that because i am negotiating now with a magazine to publish an article on that and i don't want to give it away her stories are fine she is just not technically the best author out there today if you asked me who is i think i might say daniel silva though you wouldn't know who he is since he doesn't write for kids pax c Theory of conduct Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Anne Rice Extreme Programming Theodicy Crossword Biblical inerrancy English grammar Time Out of Mind Social rule Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Piccolo Junior Saga Fight Club Philosophical skepticism Philosophy of language German grammar U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 God Amiga Power Literature Deconstruction Supernatural Science The nature of God in Western theology Philosophical Investigations Chuck Palahniuk Richard Littlejohn Guns, Germs, and Steel Slashdot subculture Epistemology Current teachings of Prem Rawat Goodness and value theory Avenue Q Floppy disk Downing Street memo Plame affair timeline Monty Hall problem Drama Discordianism Have I Got News For You Scientology beliefs and practices The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Book of Daniel XML Answers in Genesis Qur'an Sant Thakar Singh The Apprentice 2 The Joker's Wild A Course In Miracles Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Don Rosa Paul W.
