deathly hallows spoiler ok for some reason the death of hedwig bothered me the most out of all the other characters then dobby and fred i cant stand it does anyone else feel the same way i guess it was the way they went out hedwig and fred just kind of died it wasnt heroic or anything dobby was amazing though and i was almost expecting lupin to die and tonks couldnt live without him i was surprised that harry rowling did not send hedwig off to hogwarts or something for the duration of his hunt for the horcruxes it is stated in the previous books especially when harry is communicating with sirius that hedwig is easily recognizable as harry's owl if they were trying to confuse people as to which harry was really harry the owl should have not been with him when trying to escape the dursley's she is a dead give away as to which was the real harry in my opinion i thought that bit was disjointed and a rather unnecessary death it brought nothing to the book i thought fred tonks and lupin were over the top as well one would have sufficed to show the sacrifices made on the good side p s i did anticipate mad eye and lupin though that old defence against the dark arts teacher's curse had to be followed through Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Harry Potter (character) Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Ron Weasley Magical objects in Harry Potter Dates in Harry Potter Severus Snape Harry Potter: Book Seven Remus Lupin Blood purity (Harry Potter) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Sirius Black Diagon Alley Magic (Harry Potter) Lord Voldemort Battle of Hogwarts Hogwarts subjects Nymphadora Tonks Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter Death Eater House-elf Hogwarts Floor Directory Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game) James and Lily Potter Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Ginny Weasley Albus Dumbledore Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film) Lupin III R.A.B.
