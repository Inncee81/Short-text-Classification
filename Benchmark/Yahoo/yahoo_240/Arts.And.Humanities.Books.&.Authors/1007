jk rowling ok is it just me or does it bug you that jk rowling knows all this info about harry ron hermione and ginny like their jobs and stuff like that that she is telling to people in iterviews but she never wrote it into the final harry potter book i would just like some input i think she would have put all that stuff in the epilogue and she did originally but it just became too long and readers wouldn't have enjoyed it so she kept it to herself and will hopefully put out an encyclopedia in the future that tells us more Ginny Weasley Ron Weasley Hermione Granger Harry Potter (character) Harry Potter: Book Seven Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Harry Potter fandom Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Harry Potter Diagon Alley Weasley family J.
