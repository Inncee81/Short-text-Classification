not another teen book so i've been meaning to write a part story for a few years now but looking at the first few drafts saved on word i really had no person experiance to be writing about a teen's life now that i'm a few years older i'm planning on picking it up again but everytime i try i get into the same old sappy girl likes boy boy finally notices girl they go out the girl meets a guy who is way more perfect for her and she dumps first guy and goes out with new guy and they live happily ever after now i realize that adding charracter flaws and having little fights between the couples is a way to make it realistic but does anyone have tips for me so that i don't make it some perfect teen story i really want it to be realistic but not too dramatic so any tips also if you don't mind imputing funny things that have happened to you or you're friends that aren't too embarrasing would really be a help so i'm not just going off my personal experiances and making this a book about my life you could make it like they have phases where the girl likes him for awhile gives up on him and then the boy starts to gain an interest in her and then after awhile they finally come together or you could do a story were both the boy and the girl are scared about rejection and don't want to admit their feelings for the other one until their friends finally help them out a bit im not sure but there are a lot of different scenarios to think about hope this gives you a few ideas Friends Jon Secada Earth Girl Arjuna Time Out of Mind Mary Jane Watson The Lovely Bones Scrooge McDuck The Catcher in the Rye About a Boy Extreme Programming Milton H.
