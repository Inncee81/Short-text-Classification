harry potter deathly hallows question spoiler don't read if you don't want to hear about the ending it's about lupin and tonks' kid harry's the godfather so who raised the kid if it wasn't harry this was a little unclear plus the kid was at the end too old for hogwarts why was he on the train ok what you all said makes sense i just re read the last chapter and although it's not explicit in there he wasn't necessarily on the train he could have been just dropping off victoire as far as who raised him the book says nothing about this but it makes sense that it was his grandmother since harry was so young i guess you have to read listen to the interviews for the full story thanks j k rowling said in a live chat on july that lupin and tonk's kid ted was raised by his grandmother harry didn't raise him but was certainly there for emotional support and other godfatherly duties as for why he was at the train station he was just dropping off his girlfriend who is bill and fleur's daughter don't worry they're not cousins victoire is related through ginny and harry is teddy's god father which means he's not related Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Blood purity (Harry Potter) Nymphadora Tonks Severus Snape Sirius Black Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Weasley family Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Minor Ravenclaws Dates in Harry Potter Hogwarts Harry Potter: Book Seven Ron Weasley Battle of Hogwarts Ginny Weasley Remus Lupin Harry Potter Fleur Delacour Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Hermione Granger Lord Voldemort Hogwarts subjects Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year J.
