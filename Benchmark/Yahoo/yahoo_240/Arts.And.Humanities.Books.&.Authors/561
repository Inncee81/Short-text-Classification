are the portraits of harry potter an extension of life portraits can carry on conversations and stuff and that's cool but it throws me that some portraits are of actual people what are the rules of the portraits how do portraits come to possess personalities and consciences of their own how do portraits come to be different from every day paintings i know pics in the daily prophet or quibbler can move around but that's very different of course if someone dies and a portrait of them is made does the portrait entity live on with all of the memories of its living self is it practically the same person or just a cheap imitation how does all this work if a moving portrait is made of a still living person i think of the moving portraits to be sort of like moony wormtail padfoot and prongs in the marauder's map it just reacts like they would Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Magical objects in Harry Potter Harry Potter (character) Harry Potter newspapers and magazines Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Peter Pettigrew Coercion Sirius Black John Howard Yoder Hogwarts Theory of conduct Portrait Portrait miniature Blood purity (Harry Potter) Simone Weil Kitsch Exorcism Dates in Harry Potter Ginny Weasley Amedeo Modigliani __douard Manet Dutch Golden Age Minor Slytherins Fictional character Diagon Alley Christian monasticism Head of state Pinturicchio Merit Tom Riddle's diary Jehovah's Witnesses Salvator Rosa Rolf Harris Harry Potter Fuller Potter Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Socrate Volleyball J.
