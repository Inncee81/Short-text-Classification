i'm trying to write a fiction book not publish it any good tips ok so i might not be that old yet but i'm writing a book just for the fun of it you know see how it turns out i just need a few tips to help polish what i've written so far it can be about anything planning writing thinking whatevs and if you want to be the one with the best answer the tip s should be easy to remember not necessarily quick but clear and understandable thx start over you'll be able to use most of what you've already written but you need a plan before you write any more first create your characters not just their appearances but their drives their worldviews their tag lines the way they talk their mannerisms their abilities and the ways they approach problem solving next create an outline start with the ending and set up up a series of way points tasks ordeals and insights that lead up to the ending be sure that each way point reveals to the reader something about the characters then turn your characters loose approach each event in the story by asking yourself what the characters would do how would he react to this what would she say how could they have missed that clue if you've created characters vivid enough in your own mind they'll write the story for you that's the real reason why some authors keep using the same characters partly because the characters develop fans of their own but mostly because in the writer's imagination the characters develop lives of their own that makes them easy to write about just keep in mind that whatever happens in a story it's always about people even if those people aren't human the more real those people are to you and the more real you can make them for your readers the better your novel will be start with some fan fic stories somebody else has already done the hard part and once you learn to understand those characters you'll have a good idea of how to build your own Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Theory of conduct Extreme Programming Fan fiction Fight Club Philosophy of language Ontological argument Logic Storytelling Novel Whodunit Science fiction Canon (fiction) Leo Strauss Religion Sinfest Psychology Paul Is Dead Charles Dickens W.
