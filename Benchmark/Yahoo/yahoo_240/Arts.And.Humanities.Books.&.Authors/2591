i have a question about harry potter and the order of the phoenix i read the book and recently saw the movie and for some reason i must've missed something note if you haven't read book five don't read any further what was dolores umbridge's motive for making the lives of the hogwarts students miserable why was she in denial about using spells in the defense of the dark arts class why did she insist that there was nothing to worry about was she in cahoots with voldemort i really doubt this but i'm just asking well first of all she suffers from a strong case of kleptomania she wants power and lots of it she and fudge's power blinds them from the truth voldemort's back and since fudge is minister he uses his current power to reflect his beliefs on the most of the ministry of magic the ministry and umbridge are also paranoid that dumbledore wants their power and is forming an army of students in hogwarts to overthrow the ministry therefore umbridge works has hard as the decrees allow her to stop dumbledore from gaining power which is absurd because it is not what he is doing at all she retards routine life at hogwarts if there is such a thing lol to reflect the ministry she is not really in denial against the defense against the dark arts spells but rather in fear she does not want the students in dumbledore's supposed army i am not referring to harry's da to fight back against the ministry she is in denial however about voldemort out of influence from fudge and her own natural fear and unwillingness to accept voldemort's return she tries to tell the students to have no worries she is not in cahoots with voldemort on our free will but her fear of the dark lord causes her to do some dark things ex setting the dementors on harry and almost using the cruciatus curse on him and eventually become brainwashed and turned to his side see book Hogwarts Hogwarts subjects Sybill Trelawney Dumbledore's Army Harry Potter newspapers and magazines Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Magic (Harry Potter) Ginny Weasley Dates in Harry Potter Minor Ministry officials in the Harry Potter books Harry Potter (character) Hermione Granger Minerva McGonagall Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Ministry of Magic Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter Harry Potter: Book Seven Fred and George Weasley Rubeus Hagrid Remus Lupin Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Rita Skeeter Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Horace Slughorn Minor Hufflepuffs Diagon Alley Fawkes Ron Weasley Blood purity (Harry Potter) Battle of Hogwarts Dementor Minor Ravenclaws Sirius Black Percy Weasley James and Lily Potter Minor members of the Order of the Phoenix Minor Hogwarts teachers Horcrux Dark Art Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game) Bellatrix Lestrange Tom Riddle's diary Rufus Scrimgeour Azkaban Professor Quirrell Lucius Malfoy Hogwarts Floor Directory R.A.B.
