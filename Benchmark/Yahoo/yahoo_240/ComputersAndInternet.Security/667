i just opened an attachment from a spam email should i be worried i opened a pdf attachment from an email that i thought was from my friend had a similar email address but it turns out it was spam before i opened it yahoo mail said it scanned it and it had no virus is there anything else to worry about like spyware or keystroke logger thingamajigs d the pdf was for some stock offering thing shanmugam p yes i opened the pdf and it had about pages of text about this particular company's stock no don't worry about it used to be that there were all these spam e mails about a hot penny stock that was set to explode or whatever the idea was that the sender of the spam would buy this worthless stock get a bunch of people to buy it and drive the price up then sell and make a large profit driving the price back down those who bought because of the e mail then were left holding worthless stock more recent spam filters started detecting keywords that were used in these stock tips so the spammers started embedding graphics into the e mails that had the stock information in it but the spam filters improved to where they could read the text in the embedded graphics so the spammers started sending out the stock tips in pdf files because the filters couldn't read the contents of that kind of file also while it's not impossible it is very difficult to embed any kind of virus in a pdf file someone demonstrated a basic virus embedded in a pdf file a few years ago but it was pretty benign and there hasn't been any recent developments with viruses in pdfs so you're safe don't worry about it Stopping e-mail abuse Gmail Spam (electronic) E-mail Computer virus Make money fast Malware Email authentication Google Internet fraud Pretty Good Privacy CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 Spam Prevention Early Warning System Mac OS X Spyware Bayesian filtering Anonymous remailer Computer forensics Trojan horse (computing) Portable Document Format Phishing Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Search engine optimization Open mail relay Usenet Neopets Spamdexing Hashcash Enterprise content management Logo programming language Outlook Express OpenDocument Proxy server Whois Windows XP Google search Hard disk DNSBL RuneScape cheats Advance fee fraud Blog Microsoft Outlook SpamAssassin Ebook Webmail Computer worm Link spam Embedded system Emacs Macromedia Flash Opera (web browser) Microsoft Windows XML Denial-of-service attack Peer-to-peer United States Postal Service Computer Information overload Steganography Advertising Mydoom Mozilla Application Suite AOL Instant Messenger Cross site scripting Surveillance Internet pornography Public domain Mac OS X v10.4 ZX Spectrum PHP Microsoft Digital photography HyperCard Mad Money Honeypot Sanford Wallace Domain Name System Qmail Anchor Short message service OpenOffice.org Apple Macintosh Microsoft Office Comparison of web browsers FidoNet Mozilla Firefox Citigroup Short selling Windows Vista AmigaOS Messaging spam America Online
