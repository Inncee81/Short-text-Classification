browser launches with mouse movement read info please this problem started when i switched from mcaffee to norton internet security virus detection may or may not be related to this change the browser i use firefox but it happens to whatever the default browser is launches with every mouse movement a new window which means very quickly i can have browser windows opened and it is darn difficult to do anything else on the computer i have a laptop and this does not happen when using the touchpad only when using an attached mouse or my graphics tablet this is a problem though as i like to dock my laptop i have run numerous spyware registry checkers anti virus done research online and everything i can think of including a complete reformat which did not solve the problem any experienced suggestions greatly appreciated i believe i know your problem and it's actually a very simple one both ie and firefox will open a new tab if the center button on your mouse is clicked like right click and then selecting 'open in new tab' if your wheel button is stuck guess what a million tabs will have opened and since your touch pad doesn't have this center wheel it won't have the problem to correct it try pressing the center wheel a couple of time and see if that clears it that's what i have to do if a shift or control key gets stuck that way if that still fails to work switch to a different mouse and that should solve it Windows XP Opera (web browser) Comparison of web browsers Spyware Macromedia Flash Screenshot Microsoft Windows IPod AmigaOS Gmail Mozilla Application Suite Computer virus Internet Explorer Object Desktop Game controller Tab (GUI) Laptop Web browser HTTP cookie USB flash drive IBM PC compatible Windows 2000 X Window System Touchpad Stopping e-mail abuse Mouse gesture Option key Browser wars Malware Sega Dreamcast Apple Macintosh Ebook Microsoft Trusted computing Pop-up ad Emacs Unicode Visual Basic Netscape Browser Minesweeper (computer game) Tabbed document interface Spread Firefox Apple Computer Rootkit Password History of the graphical user interface Trojan horse (computing) Cascading Style Sheets Blue screen of death Avant Browser Manual transmission Stardock Domain Name System Computer security Computer and video game genres Mac OS X v10.4 NPAPI Floppy disk Double-click (computing) Anti-virus software Bluetooth Mandriva Linux AOL Instant Messenger E-mail E-mail spam Konqueror Palm OS PlayStation 2 Knoppix Screensaver Ajax (programming) XML History of Microsoft Windows Control Panel (Windows) MSN Messenger PlayStation Portable Pinball MDAC Cheating in Counter-Strike Hello world program Expos__ (Mac OS X) HyperCard Component Object Model Internationalized domain name International Phonetic Alphabet Internet security Macintosh Finder Phishing Kazaa MMORPG Netscape Communications Corporation Favicon Digital rights management Timeline of computing 1990-forward
