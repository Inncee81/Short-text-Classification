why do all big law firms hire associates before they receive bar exam results i keep telling myself once i get that degree more opportunities will open up when that didn't happen i went to law school and believed that more awaited me after getting a law degree that didn't open up many job propects either so i took the bar and thought well i have to pass the bar to get any law firm's attention now i've done that and got licensed i was only able to interview with one firm a solo practicioner he wouldn't talk to me until i passed the bar when i passed he said let's wait until you get sworn in when i got sworn in he offered me a year what an insult i feel that my efforts were fruitless i'm wondering how some associates at major law firms are able to start work there unlicensed well this is pretty simple first the numbers you hear about the big firms are limited to a very few graduates or sometimes they stay on the average a few years because of the number of billable hours they impose on them they take only the top students from the top schools or top students with special backgrounds accountants engineers specialists where they can bill them at high rates because they already know something they bill the associates so high they make a big profit on them there is no problem with taking bar first since they know they will pass sooner or later from their background and can bill them from the start if no client contact now for the real world most attorneys don't make much money the profession is so overcrowded the lower end cuts fees to the extent there is no profit you can only make money working where you get big billable hours because someone has clients or if you can bring in clients and have someone else do the work there was a study in illinois a few years ago that showed the median half attorneys over half under salary for attorneys was sorry if you want my advice take the job you can get and learn how to practice develop a specialty then work like crazy to develop some good clients i don't mean cheapo divorces or that kind of thing get small corporations or a niche that no one wants for instance i knew an attorney that made a fortune representing cemeteries only person i knew that did it and he cornered market i was one of the top in the country in my specialty there is room at the top and can make big money but competition is viscous and have to work like a dog and claw your way to the top i would be happy to discuss with you Lawyer Paralegal Attorney at Law Law firm Barrister Juris Doctor Graduate school McKinsey & Company Plame affair Education in Portugal MMORPG Insurance Shaggy dog story Microeconomics Physician Law school Education in the United States Knots Landing Education in the People's Republic of China Software patent debate Corporate governance Social rule Milton H.
