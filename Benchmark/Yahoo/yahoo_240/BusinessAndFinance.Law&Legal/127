legal obligation to interview and management development do companies both internally and externally have any legal obligation to advertise and interview for a new post if there is clearly more than one person interested in applying also are there any legal guidelines for the use of management development programmes for employees ie can people simply join if they decide they want to follow no particular structure and obtain a job at any point completion is not relevant as there is no structure on nothing but the decision of one manager help much appreciated thansk fengirl does this mean that two employees on the same management development programme neither obviously better than the other with one receiving obvious favouritism and subsequent promotion is legal and is in fact at the managers discretion there is no legal obligation in the uk to advertise any post unless for instance its in the voluntary sector and the funder requires it however it makes good business sense to advertise and get the best person for the job again management development programmes are an internal issue and not covered by employment law however a contract of employment might specify an employee undertaking specific training and that would be binding on both parties internal promotion which is what you are talking about is again not covered by employment law however if such things as promotion and development programmes are mentioned in staff handbooks employers should be aware that they may be considered to form part of an employee's terms and conditions of employment and so be legally binding Contract Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Corporate governance Corporation Treaty Trade union Mediation Apprenticeship Management Judicial review Plame affair Social contract Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe Paralegal Legal aspects of transsexualism Motion picture rating system International law Civil rights Arbitration Lawyer Law of the People's Republic of China Juris Doctor Coercion Theory of conduct International law and the Arab-Israeli conflict ISO 9000 Halakha Trademark Divorce Appeal United Kingdom corporation tax Software engineering ITV Public domain Insurance Employment in Hong Kong Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Business ethics Estoppel Anarcho-capitalism Capitalism Copyright law of the United Kingdom Australian constitutional law Coalition Provisional Authority Right Employment State G__del's incompleteness theorem Efficiency wages Roman law Anarchism and capitalism Advertising Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Leasing Politics of Hong Kong Article One of the United States Constitution Law Unlawful combatant Unemployment Constitution of Ireland Annuity Microeconomics Commonwealth of Nations Controlled Substances Act Blog Nuclear proliferation French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Intellectual property Probation officer Nurse Who is a Jew?
