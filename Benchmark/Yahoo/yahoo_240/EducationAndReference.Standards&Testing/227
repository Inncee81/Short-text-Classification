how do sats compare to psats i took the psat test last fall and scored in the th percentile and plan to take the sats this fall i don't expect to do nearly as well but should i expect to do a lot worse my grade average was there s really no telling when you get an sat score they give you your score and next to it a range where you re likely to score with repeated testing as scores tend to go up and down but don t put too much weight on the percentiles my perfect in critical reading according to the report is in the th percentile nationally but only the th percentile in my state go figure the psat is different than the sat but people do tend to get similar scores on both especially when you re in the th percentile you are going to do well on the sat when i took the psat in th grade i got a high enough for national merit in my state and two months later i got on the sat the same score when i took the sat again the following fall my score went up but one of my friends with about the same score as me had hers go down a little your score is more likely to go up if you study for it a bit too and it really shouldn t drop too much from the psat to the sat if it does to give you an idea maybe college board will now let you look at a more detailed score report online and they have this information critical reading among students with your critical reading score score higher on a second testing score lower and receive the same score on average a person with your score experiences a change of points on a second testing the year before among students with your critical reading score score higher on a second testing score lower and receive the same score on average a person with your score experiences a change of points on a second testing writing among students with your writing score score higher on a second testing score lower and receive the same score on average a person with your score experiences a change of points on a second testing my math score s nowhere near the th percentile lol so that won t tell you anything that s from sat testing to sat testing though not the psat you ll probably just have to take it and see i m sure you ll do well even if you don t get in quite as high a percentile as you did on the psat good luck PSAT/NMSQT Intelligence quotient GED Grade (education) Scholarship National Merit Scholarship Test (student assessment) IQ and the Wealth of Nations Standardized testing College Board Homeschooling Sex and intelligence Race and intelligence (Average gaps among races) Graduate school Gifted Charter school Advanced Placement Program College admissions ELO rating system Affirmative action Quizbowl Education in Romania Graduate Record Examination A-level Regression toward the mean Race and intelligence Education in Hong Kong United States Academic Decathlon Education in Taiwan Crash test dummy Hunter College High School Education in England Education in Germany Mensa International High school Bowl Championship Series Electrophysiology Educational Testing Service Theory of multiple intelligences Body mass index No Child Left Behind Act Education in the People's Republic of China Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Kaplan Marilyn vos Savant Batting average Go ranks and ratings IB Diploma Programme Juris Doctor African American contemporary issues Sumo History of Test cricket (1890 to 1900) Program for the Exceptionally Gifted Growth hormone treatment Speed limit Stuyvesant High School New Trier High School Normal distribution Social rule Law school Law School Admissions Test Sea level rise Supply and demand Education in Finland Universities Admission Index E85 Education in Sweden Baccalaur__at Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Education in Singapore Item response theory Lynbrook High School Milton H.
