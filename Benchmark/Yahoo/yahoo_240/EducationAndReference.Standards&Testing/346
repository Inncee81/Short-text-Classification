what's the difference between ap and ib i'm attending an ib based school and some of my friends switch to different schools just so they can take ap courses which one of those two is better and what is ib it seems like ap is more well known than ib actually ap and ib are equally well respected in terms of getting admission to college here's my advice if you want to go to college in some country other than the united states take ib courses the ib diploma is respected internationally if you want to go to college in the united states do the ap program take as many courses as you like from what i hear i think you can get more college credit through ap of course that is not an official statement but i have done enough research by looking at ap credit tables and ib credit tables for colleges in my states it seems like you can rack up a lot more credit through ap courses if you take a good number of them like or more depending on the courses you take i suggest you mix hard ones with easy ones you won't be completly overwhelmed if you are taking like per year also ap courses are easier i can tell that from all the hard work my friends in ib had to go through but they are not any less respected at many institutions you will not be able to get credit for ib standard level courses rather you have to take higher level courses to get the credit and you will have to take at least and probably of your courses standard level so that may mean that you can only earn college credit for of your ib courses at many us colleges and universities this is just my very biased opinion but again i think ap is a lot better Juris Doctor Education in the United States Education in Australia High school Education in Portugal IB Diploma Programme Advanced Placement Program Community college Physician Graduate school Education in Germany Student loan Institute of technology Grade (education) Education in Hong Kong Education in Singapore College Master's degree College admissions Dog agility Ontario Academic Credit Education in Malaysia Medical school Distance education Open University Affirmative action Secondary education in the United States Education in the People's Republic of China Australian Qualifications Framework UCAS Law school Johns Hopkins University Education in Sweden Secondary education Education in the Republic of Ireland Bologna process University of Cambridge London Metropolitan University Scottish Qualifications Authority Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Education in France Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology National Certificate of Educational Achievement SAT Middle Tennessee State University Associate's degree University of Bristol University of Toronto Appeal A-level Trinity College, Dublin Education in Canada College and university rankings Education in Austria City and Guilds of London Institute Academic degree Capitalism Bachelor of Arts Barrister Education in New Zealand Credit card Athabasca University Pennsylvania State University Kwantlen University College Cour de cassation Higher education in Japan Dublin City University Education in Finland Education in Romania University of California, San Diego University of Michigan Art school Professor Doctorate Culture of the United States Secondary education in France Pump It Up Lawyer Higher School Certificate University of Maryland, College Park Inflation GED American and British English differences Charles William Eliot School accreditation University Elections in the United States Divorce Ivy League Alcoholics Anonymous Statistical survey Institute for Christian Studies Brown University Darmstadt University of Technology Homeschooling Table tennis Air Education and Training Command Coeducation Margin of error Secondary education in Japan
