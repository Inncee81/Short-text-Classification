act test how can i do better in the reading and science sections of the act what type of shortcuts are there for being able to be faster at gathering the inforamtion they give you in the charts graphs and passages and answering the questions should i read the questions first thanks for answering i probably should mention that i got a the first time i took it i haven't taken it since then though but i am planning to take it in september i am aiming for a total score i had trouble with the reading and science sections as well mostly it is because they are towards the end that you encounter your problems a simple solution would be to start off doing a lot of reading and then analyzing pick up a copy of bill bryson's a brief history of nearly everything his excerpts will be very similar to the passages you might read on the reading and even on the science too after reading anything take time to analyze what it means and the main point of the passage of course you will not have time to do that on the actual act exam but preparing in this manner will definitely heighten your analysis skills and improve your understanding of passages when you get to them on the actual exam read the questions first for the reading part so that you know what information you need and what you can neglect then skim through the passage and take what you need from the passage just remember that there will be certain questions that will ask you to make inferences about the passage in its entirety or just a certain point that the author was trying to make make sure you pay special attention to that when you are reading as far as the science goes don't let the time and the questions intimidate you just use the charts as a reference don't spend more than seconds looking at the charts taking time to actually memorize the information on the chart will get you nowhere and it is highly time consuming as long as you get the general idea of what the charts graphs are talking about you are set to answer the questions you can always refer back to the chart when the question asks for the science passages i'm afraid there is no easy shortcut but to actually sit there and try to comprehend what the passage is talking about if you get the brief idea then you should be set just remember that the majority of the questions will ask you to refer back to the passage rather than make predictions and infer for this section take an educated guess when it comes to inferences that are especially hard to make just don't let the terminology scare you that's their tactic just read through the science questions quickly if you run into a passage and then skim through the passage to get the main idea refer back to the passage occasionally to help answer questions but conserve time hope that helped and good luck The Princeton Review Expert system CPU cache Test (student assessment) Quizbowl Extreme Programming Theory of conduct Social rule SAT Speed reading Economics Logic Education in Romania Dyslexia Mathematics American and British English differences Supply and demand English grammar Reading (activity) Coming of Age (TNG episode) Compiler optimization Philosophy of language Plame affair Natural deduction The nature of God in Western theology Wheel of Fortune Scientific method I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Modem Graph theory Password She Loves You Keynesian economics Causality New York Giants Royal Assent Science Fast bowling Law School Admissions Test Web crawler Time travel $ale of the Century Cognitive science The Apprentice 2 Ra (board game) Tennessee State Constitution Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Requirements analysis Science Bowl Scientology beliefs and practices NP-complete Tropical cyclone Many-worlds interpretation Volleyball Geographic information system Sudoku Intelligence (trait) Quantum computer G__del's incompleteness theorem Stomach cancer Autism CPU design Random walk Education in Portugal Randomness Same-sex marriage in Canada Standardized testing Singlish Second language acquisition Lebesgue integration Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Bogdanov Affair Case study Unix time Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Education reform Meaning of life Bayesian inference RISC Item response theory Legal research Doomsday argument TOEFL Software engineering Cheating in Counter-Strike Function (mathematics) Welfare economics Chess problem Game theory Microeconomics
