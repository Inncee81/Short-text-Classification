how would you feel if how would you feel if you failed the dmv signs test two times in a row to add to it both times you miss passing by one question i'm going to be a senior in high school and this is me don't get me wrong i'm not stupid my gpa is like but i have no clue why i'm not passing i studied for the test school starts next week and i have to have my mom drive me to school how pathetic anyway can anyone give me advice on this see if your dmv has practice questions for the test on the website practicing will help you also consult your driver's manual if you took a driver's ed class and still have notes consult any handouts you had on signs if it makes you feel any better of people fail the knowledge test on their first try even though i have never earned lower than a b in school i still barely passed the knowledge exam on my first shot even though i studied i can relate to your concerns about not being able to drive but for another reason mom thinking that driving with any kid is dangerous wouldn't let me actually start driving until i had had some driver's ed and i couldn't work that into my schedule until the summer after my senior year which is this year she thought i was too irresponsible to learn how to drive when i was since all people are too irresponsible to drive when they are in her opinion i actually had time to learn how to drive then so basically mom had to cart me around to all my activities during my senior year which is lame and i had to ride the bus to school which is embarrassing when you are a senior since nobody rides the bus when they are seniors now i'm going off to college in a couple of weeks and i still don't have a license i'm probably the only one other than the physically disabled so i can relate to your feelings of being pathetic for not being licensed at this point but you will eventually be licensed and you probably will have your licence before you go off to college if that's what you do or soon thereafter after all this embarassment i finally have the ability to be licensed all i have to do is turn in a log of hours of driving and i get my license i passed the road skills test and all just keep studying and i am sure you will pass i cannot say that not being licensed at this point isn't going to irk the heck out of you though Driver's license GED Grade (education) Education in the United States Education in Romania Shaggy dog story Philosophical skepticism Education in the People's Republic of China Graduate school SAT Driving Drunk driving (United States) Quizbowl Indianapolis 500 Social rule The Adventures of Pete & Pete Physician Vehicular cycling Test (student assessment) Affirmative action Scuderia Ferrari Theory of conduct School bus God Emperor of Dune Education in Germany Speed limit Extreme Programming Paul Is Dead Hendrick Motorsports Windows 2000 Jeopardy!
