what is a good iq score i got a on an online test but i dont know if thats good oh and if you could tell me a more reliable iq test that would be great esp you nikki k it's my opinion that iq tests are very inaccurate tellings of intelligence in fact what it really measures if anything is how advanced your mind is relative to the average the way one computes an iq score is this mental age actual age x the test is based on a standardized scale for levels of brain development that makes the average score for example a year old's mental age is so is and x additional note iq isn't supposed to change with age it doesn't matter if you score a when you're or when you're it means the same that's the point iq tests measure age ratios trust me that's how it works i think if one surpasses they are considered geniuses but like i said i think that iq tests are inaccurate because it's standardized not personalized personally i scored a on some online iq test but i highly doubt that's true Intelligence quotient ELO rating system Psychometrics SAT Item response theory Theory of conduct Race and intelligence Normal distribution Intelligence (trait) Grade (education) Mental retardation Philosophical skepticism Batting average General intelligence factor Marilyn vos Savant Person IQ and the Wealth of Nations Bayesian inference Transsexuality Classical test theory Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Debugging Cheating in Counter-Strike Reliability (statistics) Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Supply and demand Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Lie Autism MP3 Artificial consciousness Blood alcohol content Contract Psychology Special relativity Sex and intelligence String theory Dualism (philosophy of mind) Gross domestic product Graduate Record Examination Yao Ming Parallax Turing test Factor analysis Capitalism Brain Goodness and value theory Donald Davidson (philosopher) Cognitive science Beatmania IIDX Standardized testing Big Bang Standard deviation Extreme Programming Expert system Rasch model Inflation Plame affair Race and intelligence (Average gaps among races) Gravity Computer role-playing game Scientific skepticism Philosophy of mathematics Belief revision Neuro-linguistic programming Causality Advanced Placement Program Affirmative action Mind Creationist cosmologies Social psychology Intelligent design Quantitative marketing research Scale (social sciences) Scientific method Mass Regression toward the mean Theory of multiple intelligences Left-handed Sydney Riot of 1879 Victorian Certificate of Education The Mismeasure of Man Classified information Real number Password Unemployment Test (student assessment) Jumpstart 3rd Grade Working memory Cognition GED Quicksort Labor theory of value Scientology beliefs and practices Parapsychology Ontological argument Zener card Reliability engineering Internet troll Brian Lara
