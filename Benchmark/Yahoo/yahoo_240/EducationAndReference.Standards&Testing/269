is this unethical of princeton review i'm currently taking the princeton review sat course they give you a refund if you don't increase your score by pts however for the first diagnostic sat test that they gave me they took the lowest number of my sat score range on the second test they took the highest number i did worse on critical reading the second time but my scaled score increased from to there isn't much difference in difficulty between the first and second tests what do you guys think about this yea i kinda figured that too on first test verbal wrong and they changed my answer for the math grid in and writing wrong essay rd time wrong in reading wrong in grammar grammar and essay i think they do that to keep un enlightened students in the dark and use it as leverage to say that you are improving and encourage the student also the pt guarantee is for the real sat the problem is that they say they will work with you untill u reach your pt increase but who has the time and effort to do something that didnt work for them the first time those few details i just mentioned are unethical in my opinion but then again they are a business and need to make money SAT GED Test (student assessment) Medical College Admission Test Graduate Record Examination Graduate school Education in the United States Jeopardy!
