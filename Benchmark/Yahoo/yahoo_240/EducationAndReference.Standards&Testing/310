how hard is the ap bio class im not very good at science in my school we dont take bio as a freshman it goes from physics to chem to bio ap bio can be very difficult there is literally tons and tons of information to memorize i'd recommend that you do honors if possible you might consider taking ap bio during your senior year though if you do well in your biology class this year th grade if i am correct biology is just a lot of memorization for the most part but i loathe having to memorize biology since it doesn't really interest me actually unlike the poster above me thinks it is better to get a b in an ap class than it is to get an a in a regular class however if you are not very good at science you might get a c in the ap bio class which would be worse cs look bad ap or not also just because ap bio is so much work you should be careful Secondary education in the United States Education in the United States Graduate school The Citadel (Military College) Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology The Sims 2: University Science Advanced Placement Program Education in Romania Biology IBM PC compatible GED SAT Education in Taiwan W.
