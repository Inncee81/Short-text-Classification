i need shown how to find the following antiderivatives please show steps if u can x x x x please answer at least one if you can if u can all thatd be great use the rule that the anti derivative of x n is x n n except where n then you get the anti derivative of x x is lnx x x so the anti derivative is x x x x x the anti derivative is lnx x x x x the anti derivative is x lnx x lnx x lnx if you differentiate each of my answers you will get your questions back again Numerical integration Integral Calculus Arbitrary constant of integration Antiderivative Derivative Trigonometric identity Fundamental theorem of calculus Dynamical system Ordinary differential equation Integration by parts Trigonometric function Noncommutative geometry Lie derivative Formal power series Same-sex marriage in Canada Complexity classes P and NP Expert system Natural deduction Longest word in English Taylor's theorem Almost complex manifold Product rule Covariant derivative Dirac delta function Tamil language Family Feud Mathematics Natural logarithm Zeno's paradoxes Anti-Zionism Johnny Speight Estimation theory Path integral formulation Propositional calculus Euler's formula Chain rule Finite element method Greed (game show) Right to silence Surface integral Question Socialist Workers Party (UK) Science Bowl Meaning of life Win Ben Stein's Money Universal Century Nations and Factions RC circuit Newton's method Improper integral RLC circuit Same-sex marriage G__del's incompleteness theorem Interpolation Reach for the Top Model (economics) TI-89 series Tic-Tac-Dough Signal transduction Resident Evil Outbreak: File 2 Combinatorics Leet Lebesgue integration Jeopardy!
