help please with geometry hw can you use similar triangles to derive the corollary below if so name the triangles and the proportion used to prove it if the altitude is drawn to the hypotenuse of a right triangle then the square of the length of either leg equals the product of the lengths of the hypotenuse and the segment of the hypotenuse adjacent to that leg annd suppose you know a kite has an angle of elevation of degrees and you know that is has used up feet of the string attached can you find the height of the kite i'm taking an online course in geometry and im realllly confused on these two questions i'd appreciate anyone's help so much thanks and im still trying this i've spent too much time on these please help let abc be the triangle with the right angle at b and d be the point where the altitude from b meets ac let the lengths of cb be a ba be c ca be b cd be d and da be e then in triangle dbc d a sin dbc angle dbc deg angle bca sum of angles of bcd in triangle abc a c sin cab angle cab deg angle bca sum of angles of abc from and angle dbc angle cab from and d a a c multiiplying equation by ac cd a similarly from triangles bad and abc it follows that ae c height of kite sin deg ft Trigonometric function Pythagorean theorem Circle Angle Trigonometric identity Geometry Parallel postulate Square root of 2 Ellipse Pi Similarity (mathematics) Altitude Complex number Polygon Archimedes Trajectory Euclidean geometry Ruler-and-compass construction Cissoid of Diocles Hipparchus (astronomer) Josip Plemelj Congruence (geometry) Euclid's Elements Geodesy Kepler's laws of planetary motion Wallpaper group GED Haversine formula Geographic coordinate system Fibonacci number Orthogonal matrix Pentagram Vector (spatial) Professional wrestling holds Parabola Billiards Golden ratio Collision detection Astrodynamics Polarization Euclidean plane isometry Hyperbolic geometry Spherical trigonometry Kitesurfing Affine transformation Pendulum Aberration in optical systems Quadrilateral Inner product space Geography of Africa Desargues' theorem Circumcircle Diamond cut Logo programming language Conjugacy class Mathematics of general relativity Conic section Area (geometry) Exponentiation Isaac Newton's early life and achievements Planetary orbit Ancient Egyptian weights and measures Uses of trigonometry Rational trigonometry Force Binomial coefficient Normal distribution Affine geometry Ordinary differential equation Hyperbolic motion Slide rule Quaternion Knife Platonic solid Equine conformation Diffraction Lattice (group) Point groups in three dimensions Einstein-Cartan theory Lebesgue integration Black hole Constructible polygon Dot product Trace (linear algebra) Torque Ontological argument Tangent L__vy C curve Scapula Formal power series Riemann___Roch theorem Archery
