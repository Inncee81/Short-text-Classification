help with calculus the noted english mathematician sir cumference decided to approximate the areaof a circle of radius units by obtaining a formula s n for the sum of the areas of n identical triangles inside the circle a show that s n n sin pi n b he obtains the exact area of the circle by finding lim n infinity of s n explain how this results in the formula a pi for the area a of a circle with radius additional info there are triangles in the circle angle size pi n with n isosceles triangles the angle of one triangle at the centre of the circle is n deg pi n radians the area of one triangle is r sin pi n and therefore with n triangles the area of the circle is r n sin pi n putting r gives n sin pi n n sin pi n lim n infinity n sin pi n lim k sin pi k k lim k sin pi k pi k pi putting pi k u this becomes lim u sin u u pi pi pi substituting this value of the limit in gives pi pi for the area of the circle Triangle Trigonometric function Trigonometric identity Pi Circle Pythagorean theorem Archimedes Exponentiation Hipparchus (astronomer) Multiple integral Cissoid of Diocles Complex number Fundamental theorem of calculus Haversine formula Basel problem Radius of convergence Kepler's laws of planetary motion Josip Plemelj Lebesgue integration Astrodynamics Parallax Polygon Spherical trigonometry Pentagram Torque Fractal L'H__pital's rule Trigonometry Series (mathematics) Gibbs phenomenon 3D projection 3-sphere Limit superior and limit inferior Integral Joseph Louis Lagrange Calculus Taylor series Ellipse Pascal's triangle Frame fields in general relativity Coordinates (mathematics) Sphere Regular polytope Stirling's approximation Improper integral M__bius transformation Addition Euclidean geometry Geometry Prosthaphaeresis Fibonacci number Derivative Euclid's Elements Boy's surface Cross product Timeline of mathematics Hausdorff dimension Function (mathematics) Finite element method Methods of contour integration Z-transform Dirac delta function John Wallis Planck's law of black body radiation Spherical harmonics Inversive geometry Leonhard Euler Three-phase Convergence of Fourier series Hyperbolic geometry Conic section Diffraction Quaternions and spatial rotation Force Degree (angle) Phase-shift keying Norm (mathematics) Apollonian gasket Proper time Rotation group Product rule Polylogarithm Extrapolation RLC circuit Keplerian problem Mandelbrot set Collision detection S matrix Lens (optics) Glossary of graph theory Debye model Formal power series Characterizations of the exponential function Squeeze theorem Rotating reference frame
