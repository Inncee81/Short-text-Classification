who can please distinguish the difference between average accelaration and instantaneous acceleration please do elaborate well for me to understand also arigato average accelaration is the change in velocity divided by time a vf vi tf ti for example starting at noon you push a car for seconds and it goes from mps to m per second plugging in the formual m s s meters per second squard instant accelaration is the change of velocity within an instant defined as dv dt for example lets say an instant is one millionth of second and lets say while you were pushing the car you wanted to know the instantaneous acceleration at to one millionth of a second after that and during that time the velocity of the m s to then using dv dt you get m s Velocity Calculus Force Special relativity Speed Derivative Specific impulse Acceleration Coriolis effect Newton's laws of motion Zeno's paradoxes Membrane potential Angular velocity Tropical year Gravity Gee Tide Explosive material World line Spacecraft propulsion Fictitious force Classical mechanics Unix time Carburetor Planetary orbit Speed of light Diesel engine Toyota Prius Action potential Puberty Mass Turbocharger Frame of reference Precession Energy Power (physics) Escape velocity Black hole Pendulum Global Positioning System Faster-than-light Gravitational redshift Geodesy Centrifugal force Dynamical system Terminal velocity Oscilloscope Time travel Project Orion Center of mass Lift (force) Temperature Tsiolkovsky rocket equation Time Julian day Drag racing Vector (spatial) Planck units Delta-v Hebrew calendar Guilty Gear Day Mass spectrometry Kinematics Dot-com Analog-to-digital converter Big Bang Bussard ramjet Hour Michelson-Morley experiment Leap second Orbital speed Audi Variable speed of light Inflation Kepler's laws of planetary motion General relativity Automatic transmission Seismometer Proper time F-Zero X Momentum SI prefix Neutron star Diving Astrodynamics Rigid body Kalman filter Two-body problem Maxwell's equations Electromagnetic field Refractive index Internal ballistics Streamline Equation of motion M16 (rifle) Collision detection Saturn V Dark energy
