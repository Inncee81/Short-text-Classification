is anyone a precalculus wiz cuz i need help what's the answer an airplane flies at a speed of mph in a bearing of north west degrees there is a due easterly wind blowing at mph find the plane's new speed and bearing i hope your teacher isn't stupid enough to give credit for an answer versus for showing your work solve it using vectors and triangles draw a diagram for bearing you need some idea of time passed for speed draw a line that is falls in the fourth quadrant for the airplane's motion and along the line y for the wind the angle between them is degrees and the length are the speeds and respectively from there you just need to use the law of cosines to calculate speed once you know the speed multiply it times the time and add that to the original bearings to calculate the new bearings that's pretty much it Triangle Trigonometric function Vector (spatial) Fixed-wing aircraft Angle Gravity Helicopter Pythagorean theorem World line Trigonometry Projective transformation Cissoid of Diocles Collision detection Complex number Speed of light Euclidean plane isometry Trajectory Circle Slide rule Pi Fourth dimension Special relativity Autogyro Prosthaphaeresis Planetary orbit Quaternion Torque Haversine formula Archimedes 3D projection Cartesian coordinate system Faster-than-light Calculus Airport Napier's bones Force Douglas Skyrocket Dot product P-61 Black Widow Affine transformation Trigonometric identity Luminiferous aether Spherical trigonometry Coriolis effect Polynomial Navigation Augustus De Morgan Wind Parallax Astrodynamics Michelson-Morley experiment F-16 Fighting Falcon Polarization Air navigation Geographic coordinate system Aviation history Rotation Ellipse Newton's laws of motion Radio controlled airplane Jet engine Sonic boom Poker jargon Spacetime Polygon Hipparchus (astronomer) Wind power Spline (mathematics) Circuit design Joseph Louis Lagrange Geometry GED M__bius transformation Classical mechanics Wallpaper group Adjoint functors SR-71 Blackbird GunBound Wire Parabola Climate of the United Kingdom B-25 Mitchell Stall (flight) Random walk Snell's law Rail tracks Orthogonal matrix Fast bowling Airplane!
