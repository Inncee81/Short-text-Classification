can someone show me how these algebra statement is wrote in english x x x thank you the difference of x minus five is equal to the sum of x plus one two times the sum of x plus is equal to hope that helped Boolean algebra Elementary arithmetic Boolean logic P-adic number Riemann integral Direct sum of modules Binary numeral system Plus and minus signs Addition Negative binomial distribution Mathematical induction Algebra over a field Clifford algebra Wallpaper group Pascal's triangle Rank (linear algebra) Matrix (mathematics) Relational algebra Dirac equation Polynomial Fundamental theorem of calculus Series (mathematics) Point groups in three dimensions Surreal number Vector (spatial) Labour economics Lebesgue integration Levi-Civita symbol Exponentiation Topology glossary Weierstrass's elliptic functions Boolean prime ideal theorem Combinatorial species Hilbert space Symmetric function Trigonometric identity Multiplication algorithm Orbital period Enriques-Kodaira classification Exact sequence Bayes' theorem Module (mathematics) Z-transform Universal property Discrete Fourier transform Riemann___Roch theorem ALGOL 68 Explosive material Fundamental theorem of algebra Vulgar fraction Basel problem Matrix addition Calculus Complex number Associative algebra Simplex Partial fraction Coalgebra Negation Derivative Real number ___1 (number) Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Matrix subtraction Naive set theory Noether's theorem Local ring Nyquist___Shannon sampling theorem Proof that 0.999... equals 1 Linear regression Von Neumann algebra Multiplication Representation theory of finite groups Probability distribution BASIC programming language Standard deviation Number theory Cumulant Two-body problem Casimir effect Binomial theorem Semidirect product Taylor series Complexity classes P and NP Big O notation Expected value Inner product space Completeness (order theory) Rational number Zorn's lemma Gauge theory Manifold Condorcet method Laws of Form Angular velocity Cross product Determinant Quaternion Dirac delta function __tale cohomology
