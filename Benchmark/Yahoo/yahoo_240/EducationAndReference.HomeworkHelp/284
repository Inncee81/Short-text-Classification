what are the components in graphite lead that allows them to write in paper carbon it is the same eliment that makes up diamonds and charcoal it comes in many different forms and structures graphite is really just compressed and superheated charcoal it writes by rubbing off microscopic portions of itself which adhere to the paper creating series of microscopic dots that are visible in groups Carbon Phase (matter) Graphite Drawing Diamond Iron Steel Pencil Allotropy Material properties of diamond Carbon nanotube Charcoal Eraser Impact crater Surrealist techniques Carbon fiber Fusion power Corrosion Scanning tunneling microscope Activated carbon Pebble bed reactor Carbon dioxide Figure drawing Cast iron Pyrolytic carbon Eyeglass prescription Anthracite coal Space elevator Nanotechnology Graphite-reinforced plastic Reinforced concrete Casting Knife Fire extinguisher Metallurgy Hornfels Fullerene Wood Motor oil Printed circuit board Crystal Spectroscopy Electron microscope Glass Die making Solar cell Black powder Composite material Guitar Enzyme Friction Crucible steel Circuit design Bacteria JPEG Plastic Emergence Mars Exploration Rover Typewriter Galileo spacecraft Liquid crystal Biochemistry Pencil lead Phosphorus Wrought iron Incandescent light bulb Bass guitar Golf club (equipment) Soldering Photocopying Explosive material Barbecue Graphene Antarctic krill Potentiometer Information entropy Cerium Pottery Integrated circuit Staining (biology) Rosalind Franklin Arc lamp Ocean thermal energy conversion Virus Chromium Georgia O'Keeffe Opportunity rover Animal Internal combustion engine Drill bit Diamond enhancement Algae Maxwell's equations Water purification Nuclear explosion Coke (fuel) Writing Magnesium Microscope slide
