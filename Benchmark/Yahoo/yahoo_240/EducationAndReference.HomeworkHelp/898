trigonometric function a concession stand is to be built in the arena in the shape of a regular hexagon each side of the hexagon is to measure m if the hexagon is centered at the origin of a coordinate grid with a scale of square m determine the exact coordinates of all vertices if this is a regular hexagon then if you draw the lines from the origin to the vetex you will get equilateral triangles so if 'a' is each side of the hexagon then distance from origin to one of the vertical sides sqrt a pythagoras theorm then the six vertices will be sqrt a a sqrt a a a sqrt a a sqrt a a a substitute a in the above to get the points Triangle Trigonometric function Wallpaper group Hexagonal lattice Polygon Conic section Rotational symmetry Cissoid of Diocles Ellipse Parabola Circle Lattice (group) Regular polytope Complex number Tetrahedron Pentagon Pi Coordinates (mathematics) Angle Pentagram Trigonometric identity Boy's surface Tessellation Crystallographic restriction theorem Simplex Platonic solid Trajectory Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Multiple integral Polyhedron Octahedron Catalan number Reuleaux triangle Hyperbolic function Square root Pascal's triangle Area (geometry) Golden ratio Pythagorean theorem Johnson solid Vector (spatial) Symmetry Ruler-and-compass construction Rational trigonometry Cubic (crystal system) Pendulum Determinant Glossary of graph theory Projective transformation British national grid reference system Semiregular polyhedra Standard deviation Similarity (mathematics) Distance Random walk Geographic coordinate system Methods of contour integration Quaternion Trigonometry Quartic equation Mandelbrot set Tiling by regular polygons Fano plane Spherical harmonics Polyomino Cartesian coordinate system Collision detection Dirac equation Discrete Fourier transform Special relativity Icosahedron Dimensional analysis Schwarzschild coordinates Comoving distance Map projection Cellular automaton Roman surface Square root of 2 Slide rule Invalid proof Inner product space Pappus of Alexandria Normal distribution Real number Desargues' theorem Dodecahedron Laplace operator Cubic equation Phonon Euclidean geometry Eye Antenna (radio) Norm (mathematics) Irrational number Linear differential equation M__bius transformation Trilateration Euclidean space
