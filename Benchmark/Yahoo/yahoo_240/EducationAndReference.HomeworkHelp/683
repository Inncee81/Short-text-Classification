look for help on the matter and there is no music or television or telescreen in my room in a tale of two cities the author charles dickens uses a great deal of irony in the opening chapter to draw the reader into the story by using a slew of contradictory statements in the opening paragraph the author forces the reader to further investigate the meaning of the cryptic opening line it was the best of times it was the worst of times symbolism look for the meanings of symbolic names in a tale of two cities in his novels stories and other works dickens placed great importance on the names he gave his characters names for dickens were often a type of shorthand a way of communicating something essential about a character in a tale of two cities stryver is the ambitious lawyer working his way up the social ladder another example is lucie whose name comes from the latin word for light notice how often dickens refers to her as a bright and shining example to inspire the other characters as you read look for the meanings of other symbolic names in a tale of two cities what does the name cruncher suggest to you what english words does charles darnay's real name evr monde sound like and what might dickens be suggesting by naming one of his main characters charles darnay and giving him the initials c d other symbols broken wine casket knitting the marquis personification a figure of speech in which an animal object or idea is given human form or characteristics is called personification dickens was a master of this technique and used it often to help create striking descriptions or moods in his novels for example the concept of hunger is described in chapter as staring down from the chimneys of the poor and rattling its dry bones in chapter dickens uses personification to enrich his description of a noble's castle foreshadowing is a literary technique in which the author uses clues to prepare readers for what will happen later in the story both the first and second section of a tale of two cities contain much foreshadowing of future events in book the first chapter a wine cask shatters after describing hands feet and mouths stained red from the spilled wine dickens says the time will come when the people will be stained red with another substance blood another instance of foreshadowing in earlier chapters is the footsteps lucie hears outside her home in london toward the end of this section the footsteps draw nearer and nearer to lucie and her family conflict the final conflict between miss pross and madame defarge also represents a larger conflict between love and hate by having miss pross triumph over madame defarge dickens indicates that love can conquer even the strongest hatred carton similarly defeats madame defarge when he orchestrates darnay s freedom out of love for lucie however in both cases the struggle exacts a price for evil s defeat miss pross loses her hearing and carton loses his life dickens seems to be saying that good will overcome evil but not without suffering and sacrifice Creation according to Genesis George Orwell Literature Goldstein's book Nineteen Eighty-Four The Tale of Genji The Brothers Karamazov Yoga
