i'm doing a debate where i have to debate against homework ideas needed i'm doing a debate on why we shouldn't get homework if anyone can help it would be great thanx kills the trees because of all the paper you have to use even though it's recyclable the use of pens which aren't recyclable means that you have to use transportation to get to the library pollution on the roads o reasonable amount of homework is fine to practice the skills but if it is just going to be swampfuls of homework that are unreasonable and don't allow for time to be spent on other subjects then it really burning out the kid and the kid is not going to remember anything which is the whole intent of homework which is to reinforce the skills unreasonable loads of homework would mean that the kid is too tired to remember anything and will be too tired the next day when he she goes back to school and won't be able to learn new things in school to take back home the next day to do the next round of unreasonable homework not to mention hate the subjects hate school hate homework hate the teachers and hate learning and reading books Homework Theory of conduct Avenue Q Singlish Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Bart chalkboard gags Calvin and Hobbes Shaggy dog story Homeschooling GED Mutual fund Asperger syndrome The Marshall Mathers LP Test (student assessment) Waste management David Hume Boston and Lowell Railroad Speed limit Social rule Anne Rice Stoicism Education in Romania Miyamoto Musashi Tripartite System Education in the People's Republic of China Propaganda The Book of Five Rings Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Mathematics Learning Incineration Psychoanalysis University of Massachusetts Amherst Scientology beliefs and practices The Contender (television series) Samurai Deeper Kyo Epistemology Milton H.
