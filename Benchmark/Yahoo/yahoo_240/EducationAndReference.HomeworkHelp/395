is it possible to make a stem and leaf chart with numbers that are all decimals for a statistics assignment part of one of the problems says we're supposed to take four groups of data and make a stem and leaf plot for each one of the groups is composed entirely of decimals and i'm not sure of how to construct it so i would appreciate any guidance anyone could give me you can multiply everything by a factor of etc whatever it would take to make all of the numbers not decimals anymore make the stem and leaf plot with the resulting integers then divide everything by the number that you multiplied everything by in order to get back to the original numbers Binary numeral system Continued fraction Vulgar fraction P-adic number Mental calculation Decimal Irrational number Numeral system Napier's bones Prime number Shor's algorithm Quadratic sieve Apollo Guidance Computer Logarithm Pi Recurring decimal Proof that 0.999... equals 1 Elementary arithmetic Divisor Pascal's triangle Bayesian inference Floating point Division (mathematics) Dither On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm CPU design Real number Hamming code Two's complement Identical particles Fundamental theorem of arithmetic Slide rule Central processing unit RSA Transcendental number Prime factorization algorithm Counter Orthogonal matrix Multiplication algorithm Compiler optimization Complex number Multiplication Euclidean plane isometry GED Unix time Golden ratio Joseph Louis Lagrange IPv4 Sturm-Liouville theory Cantor's diagonal argument Scientific notation Classic RISC pipeline Grade (education) Positional notation Factor analysis Egyptian mathematics Ackermann function Intel BCD opcodes Unicode Infinity BASIC programming language Ideal class group Integer factorization 3D projection Riemann zeta function Motorola 68000 Polynomial Group of Lie type Multiplier (Fourier analysis) Dimensional analysis Normal distribution Function (mathematics) Cellular automaton Large numbers Forcing (mathematics) Simon Stevin COBOL Basel problem 1729 (number) Preferred number 0 (number) Gaussian elimination Significant figures Number IPv6 Orders of magnitude Clifford algebra Halting problem Code division multiple access Integer (computer science) Idempotent Trigonometric function Geographic coordinate system Prior probability Orders of magnitude (numbers) Exponentiation
