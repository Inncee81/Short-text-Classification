help me please a p prt solve for t amount of simple interest i need help with the steps this is how the problem show in the text so you just need to solve the expression for t factor out p on the right side a p rt divide both sides by p a p rt subtract one from both sides a p rt divide both sides by r a p r t if the way i typed it doesn't makes sense here it is in words a divided by p minus all divided by r equals t hope this helped Quartic equation Complexity classes P and NP Elementary algebra Cissoid of Diocles Microeconomics Trigonometric function Vedic mathematics Grade (education) Trigonometric identity Dimensional analysis Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Ruler-and-compass construction Halting problem XML Prostate cancer Random walk Gravity P-adic number Gross domestic product Personal rapid transit Two-body problem Operational amplifier Algorithm Zeno's paradoxes Point groups in three dimensions Reduction (complexity) Kernel (algebra) Quantum computer Plus and minus signs Adjoint functors G__del's incompleteness theorem Dash Quadratic equation Ordinary differential equation Binary numeral system Keynesian economics Computer Theory of constraints Explosive material Polynomial Complex number Commodity Welfare economics Catalan number Consensus decision-making Programming language Law of value Square root Surplus value History of mathematics Goodness and value theory Land use forecasting Theory of conduct Circle Basel problem Apollo Guidance Computer Prime number Capitalism Equation solving Mathematics Combinatorial species C plus plus Specific impulse Arbitrary constant of integration Binary GCD algorithm Frame problem Invalid proof Labour economics Philosophical Investigations Glossary of partner dance terms Jumpstart 3rd Grade Force Circuit design Divide and conquer algorithm Production theory basics One-time pad Finite element method Large numbers Measures of national income and output Problem solving Particle in a box Garbage collection (computer science) Gaussian elimination Infantilism Inequality Collision detection Slide rule Recursion RISC Decibel Hypoglycemia Path integral formulation Mortgage Eyeglass prescription Prices of production Computer chess Continued fraction Expert system
