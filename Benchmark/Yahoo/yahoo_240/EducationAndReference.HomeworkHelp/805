what is the exact value of cos degrees exact value in radian the correct way to this problem is to somehow change to some degree that we know the exact values of and take it from there we know the exact values for degrees such as etc having said that we can think of as here is the equation needed to solve this problem cos cos cos cos sin sin this will simplify by knowing the following values cos cos sin sin substituting these values we will get x x which will simplify to short version the exact value in radian is which is a negative value good luck Trigonometric function Trigonometric identity RLC circuit Complex number Euler's formula Ordinary differential equation Particle in a box Multiple integral Angle Phase-locked loop Pendulum Boundary value problem Newton's method Cissoid of Diocles Haversine formula Regression analysis TI-89 series Great-circle distance Equation of time Generating trigonometric tables Horizontal coordinate system Phase-shift keying 3D projection Coordinates (mathematics) Trigonometry Harmonic oscillator Kepler's laws of planetary motion Cubic equation Linear differential equation Derivative Pi Arbitrary constant of integration Mathieu function Impedance Examples of differential equations Triangle Declination Projective transformation Bessel function 3-sphere Exponentiation Torque Green's function Proper time Coordinate rotation Ruler-and-compass construction Three-phase Quaternions and spatial rotation Rotating reference frame Orthogonal matrix Particle in a one-dimensional lattice (periodic potential) Theta function Sturm-Liouville theory Joseph Louis Lagrange Trigonometric rational function Circular motion Fourier series Spherical harmonics Chebyshev polynomials Grover's algorithm Alternating current Natural logarithm Lagrangian mechanics Parallax Uses of trigonometry Taylor series Phasor (electronics) Amplitude modulation Ellipse Microeconomics Nondimensionalization Absolute value Quartic equation Damping Frequency spectrum Debye model Boy's surface Centripetal force Heat equation Classical mechanics Compton scattering Hipparchus (astronomer) Phonon Vector field Circuit design Quaternion Action (physics) Integration by parts Basis (linear algebra) Conic section Julia set Abul W__fa Prosthaphaeresis Kerr metric Roman surface Elementary algebra
