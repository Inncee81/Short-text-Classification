shawshank redemption i'am trying to figure out what role colour plays in shawshank i have already used the fact that red and andy are contrasting colours do you know of anyothers thanks for your help contrasting colors but mirror images just the same weren't they i think that reds lengthy sentence and the fact that he is repeatedly turned down for parole has to do with his color as i recall red comitted only crime ever until he left the country to join andy i remember the distrustful distasteful and suspicious way the parole board looked at red gave me the impression thier minds were made up the moment they saw him and it seems like some of the guards always thought of red as dumb they never seemed to suspect him of anything it never does say anything about him getting caught doing his supply business and he never has a shakedown of his cell that i recall while andy who is allowed a lot of priveliges always seems to be watched carefully hard to believe the horror master steven king wrote such a stirring tale isn't it The Shawshank Redemption Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption EastEnders Sin City Stephen King The Internet Movie Database Sharon Tate Theory of conduct Murder Poker jargon Days of our Lives Tenshinhan The Invisibles Technicolor The Shining (film) Forty-seven Ronin Guantanamo Bay Time Out of Mind The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Alexander I of Russia Charmed Tag Parole The Devil Wears Prada Vegeta Television Mnemonic Derren Brown Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Blood on the Tracks Others look into the Dreyfus Affair Public Eye Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Color Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Color blindness Charles Manson Ty Cobb Human rights in post-Saddam Hussein Iraq Late Night with Conan O'Brien Wallpaper group Shaggy dog story Hearsay Cheating in Counter-Strike James Bulger Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Flag of Denmark Nintendo Entertainment System Capital punishment Palpatine Adventure game Video game controversy Saruman Roger Ebert's most hated films W.I.T.C.H.
