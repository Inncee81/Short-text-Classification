homework help challenging problems suppose that a rectangle has an area of square meters express the perimeter p as a function of the length x of one of the sides p x find the slope of the line passing through the points a a and a h a h m an open rectangular box no top with volume cubic meters has a square base express the surface area s of the box as a function of the length x of one of the sides s x no has been done let the other side of the rectangle be y so the area is xy which is so xy so y x the perimeter p x y so substitute y x and you get p x x so p x x i m assuming that x is the side of the base let y be the height of the box v x y so y x total surface area of the box area of base add area of the four sides so s x xy so substitute y x and you get s x x x so s x x hope this helps twiggy Area (geometry) Triangle Fourth dimension Collision detection Lebesgue integration Fundamental theorem of calculus Cissoid of Diocles Function (mathematics) Particle in a box Volume Great Pyramid of Giza Pi Quartic equation Fibonacci number Normal distribution Stairway Manifold Polygon Archimedes Ruler-and-compass construction Square root Antioch, Pisidia Multiple integral Diving Spline (mathematics) Integral Crossword Riemann integral Wallpaper group Flag Principle of indifference Mount St. Helens Circle Trigonometric function Loudspeaker U.S. customary units Combinatory logic Flag of the People's Republic of China Derivative Unicode Panama Canal Numerical integration Interpolation Dimensional analysis Golden ratio Dominoes Pythagorean theorem Pick's theorem Drill bit Volleyball Sea level rise Glossary of partner dance terms Ultimate (sport) Vector (spatial) Determinant Green's function Map projection Production theory basics Boy's surface Cubic equation Cellular automaton Avalanche Playfair cipher Heat equation Geodesy Independent Subway System Qix American handball Water polo Bayesian inference Dundas Square Football (soccer) Ordinary differential equation Point groups in three dimensions Dog agility Transformer Welfare economics Window Gas in a box Glacier Polynomial Siphon Conic section Apollonius of Perga Translational symmetry Slope Explosive material Temperature Lattice (group) Pappus of Alexandria Kepler's laws of planetary motion Coordinate system ATLAS experiment Descriptive geometry Timeline of mathematics Mount Pinatubo Trail Symmetry combinations Projective transformation Colours, standards and guidons
