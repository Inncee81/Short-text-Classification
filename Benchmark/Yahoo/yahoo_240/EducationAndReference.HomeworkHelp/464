s the pearl musical songs play an important role in how kino sees things his people had once been great makers of songs so that everything they saw or thought or did or heard became a song ch pg from this quote we can infer that the musical songs have been important to kino for quite a long time as much as kino enjoys some of the songs such as the song of the family or the song of the undersea not all of the songs are as pleasant when they first find the pearl the song that it emits is a joyous one that complements the song of the family but soon the song becomes the song of evil when the pearl causes so much damage to their family through all of this we see what a major role musical songs play in steinbeck s novel pearl in john steinbeck s the pearl we see how something of value in this case a pearl can bring out the worst in people at first the pearl seems to bring them joy and the music of the pearl rose like a chorus of trumpets in his ear ch pg in this quote we see how excited he is about what the pearl will bring them yet human nature causes things to go wrong because it is only human nature for the other townspeople to be jealous and want the pearl for themselves i was attacked in the dark said kino and in the fight i have killed a man ch pg from that quote we see that a terrible thing can happen as a result of greed the changes brought about by the pearl force kino and his family to flee town through all of this we learn how with human nature involved anything of value like a pearl can cause people to change contrast between the city and the village in john seinbeck s the pearl we see two totally different atmospheres one in the city and one in the village we have this description as they are on their way to the doctor s house in town they came to the place where the brush houses stopped and the city of stone and plaster began the city of harsh outer walls and inner cool gardens where a little water played and the bougainvillaea crusted the walls with purple and brick red and white ch pg this quote shows the physical difference between the two places the book also mentions the thing had become a neighborhood affair ch pg this quote shows that the village is a close knit one where the townspeople care for one another we can assume this because in the city all of the neighbors go and join kino and his wife when their son coyotito is ill whereas in the city the people there did not care about kino and his family but they cared about their money in the beginning of the story kino and his wife juana go to the doctor who lives in the city but he won t treat their son because he knows of their poverty however after they find their fortune the news came to the doctor and when it was made plain who kino was the doctor grew stern and judicious at the same time he is a client of mine the doctor said ch pgs from this quote we see that the doctor wanted to treat kino s son now that they had money through all of the aforemention quotes we learn how very different the city and the village are wishes in john steinbeck s the pearl when kino finds the pearl of the world he thinks that he will be able to fulfill his many wishes however it is human nature that causes everyone to think differently of kino when he is now able to fulfill his wishes and juan tom s who squatted on kino s right hand because he was his brother asked what will you do now that you have become a rich man we will be married in the church ch pg at first his main wish is to get officially married but as his circumstances change he realizes that another wish is now more important to him his lips moved hesitantly over this a rifle he said ch pg this wish represents his instinct to protect his family from all of this we can see how being able to fulfill his wishes changed kino conflicts in john steinbeck s the pearl kino and his wife juana face many difficult conflicts the first conflict arises when their child coyotito is stung by a scorpion it is a little indian with a baby he says a scorpion stung it the doctor put his cup down gently before he let his anger rise have i nothing better to do than cure insect bites for little indians i am a doctor not a veterinary ch pg this quote represents the prejudice that people used to have prior to kino s finding the pearl another conflict arises when the pearl dealers claim that kino s pearl isn t worth as much as he thought it was i do not want it this is not a pearl it is a monstrosity ch pg it is kino s pride that causes him not to believe what others say and he is determined to sell the pearl for what he expects it to bring him the third conflict that we see arise is an internal conflict and kino was afraid never in his life had he been far from home he was afraid of strangers and strange places ch pg even though kino is afraid it is only human nature for him to want to prove that he is brave enough to travel to the capital those are just some of the conflicts that kino and his wife juana have to face neighbors in john steinbeck s the pearl kino s neighbors symbolize the human nature in most people when kino and juana s neighbors follow them to the doctor s house and also to the pearl dealers not only does it show how most people are curious and nosy but it makes it seem like the neighbors care about kino and his wife they are making a party to search the shore the men will look for you ch pg from this quote we see how the neighbors quickly turn their back on kino because they think he murdered a man but they do not know the full story what we learn is that the human nature in all of us can often bring out our worst qualities as well as blind us to what is actually happening around us so we quickly assume or jump to conclusions the end you are welcome o by the way you did very well some minor changes punctuation here and there and if you noticed i took out all your because of s anyways i took the because of s out because i still to this day don t know if because of is acceptable english grammar i don t know if nowadays has changed so that it s now acceptable back then lol use of that was discouraged maybe things have changed since anyways feel free to keep what i have or change what i have or revert back to what you had also i m not too familiar with mla format is that what you are using if so then if the sentence before your quote is a full sentence then the period of that sentence gets replace with a colon only if you have partial sentences preceding the quote do you put a comma before the quote and if the word that precedes your quote then there is no comma between that and your quote refer to http www lehigh edu incent old site writing quotes quotes htm you're a really good writer wish i could write as well as you do just makes sure that the quotes and the surrounding text follow whatever format you are using as for the grammar and other stuff i think you're good to go well i hope this helps Plame affair Milton H.
