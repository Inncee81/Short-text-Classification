find out the length of the median ad of a triangle whose vertices are a b c please help me i am desperately waiting here for the answer will be very grateful if you work out the problem and say me the answer with steps it is based on coordinate geometry i am having all the hopes on yahoo answers community please post ur reply if u know to solve it well you already know off the bat that median ad is going to bisect side bc of the triangle what is the slope of side bc b x y c x y slope m y y x x okay so halfway would mean so a change in y of and a change in x of so point d is d d now you just have to use the distance formula to find the length of median ad so you need to find the distance between point a and d distance formula is d sqrt x x y y sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt hence the length of median ad of triangle abc is sqrt Triangle Circle Cissoid of Diocles Trigonometric function Conic section Trigonometric identity Simplex Angle Ellipse Complex number Pi Area (geometry) Collision detection Analytic geometry Square root Heron's formula Pendulum Parabola Euclidean geometry Geometry Pentagram Archimedes Multiple integral Pythagorean theorem Tetrahedron Great-circle distance Catalan number Pentagon Polygon Trajectory Pascal's triangle Special relativity Golden ratio Combinatorics Quartic equation Random walk Norm (mathematics) Traveling salesman problem M__bius transformation Trilateration Coordinates (mathematics) Quadrilateral Quadratic equation Similarity (mathematics) Wallpaper group Boy's surface Ruler-and-compass construction Two-body problem Standard deviation Trigonometry Semi-major axis Parallax Proper time John Wallis Dirac equation Vector (spatial) Metric space Quantum tunneling Frame fields in general relativity Slope Arthur Cayley Josip Plemelj Octahedron Calculus Coordinate system Astrodynamics Lattice (group) Roman surface Desargues' theorem RLC circuit Reuleaux triangle Platonic solid Duality (projective geometry) Coordinate rotation Quantum harmonic oscillator Square root of 2 Graph theory Projective transformation Hexagonal lattice Lagrangian point Particle in a box Zeno's paradoxes Algebraic geometry Absolute value Hipparchus (astronomer) Kepler's laws of planetary motion Length of an arc Rotational symmetry Ancient Egyptian weights and measures Escape velocity Christoffel symbols TI-89 series Spherical trigonometry Circumcircle Augustus De Morgan GED Leonhard Euler
