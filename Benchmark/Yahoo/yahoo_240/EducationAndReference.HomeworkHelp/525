physics problem solving acceleratoin and velocity with solution please asap please a car traveling at m s crashes into an embankment and stops in second calculate its acceleration and indicate the direction of the acceleration relative to the initial velocity acceleration is a change in velocity over time or acceleration velocity time velocity distance time thus acceleration is distance time time or distance time you know that the velocity of the car changed from to m s in seconds divide by to get the equivalent velocity change in second m s s m s s or m s the direction of acceleration is opposite the direction of initial velocity Escape velocity Velocity Acceleration Force Classical mechanics Faster-than-light General relativity Special relativity Spacecraft propulsion Gravity Specific impulse Zeno's paradoxes Newton's laws of motion Kepler's laws of planetary motion Speed of light Frame of reference Dark energy Electromagnetic field Fictitious force Calculus Coriolis effect Hubble's law Friction Big Bang Gravitational slingshot Tide Two-body problem Momentum Black hole Trajectory Equivalence principle Twin paradox Kinetic energy Modified Newtonian dynamics Inertial guidance system Energy Comoving distance Equation of motion Tsiolkovsky rocket equation Bussard ramjet Rocket Tests of general relativity Explosive material Torque Mass Time travel Magnetic field Spatial disorientation Kinematics Project Orion Lift (force) Philosophy of space and time Sagnac effect Electromagnetic radiation Parallax Kalman filter Astrodynamics Solar wind Principle of relativity Centrifugal force Michelson-Morley experiment Time dilation Navier-Stokes equations Angular velocity M__bius transformation Nuclear fusion Proper time Maxwell's equations Interstellar travel Harmonic oscillator Plasma (physics) Space elevator Sonar Doppler effect Centripetal force Jet engine Double layer Center of mass Car handling Warp drive Attitude control Inflation Potential energy Inertia Wave Lagrangian mechanics Internal ballistics Physical cosmology Physics Speed Sound Modern geocentrism Hipparchus (astronomer) Time Aerodynamics Action potential Dispersion (optics)
