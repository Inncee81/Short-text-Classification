chemistry question hello i need help with the question that i am stumped on i think i have an idea but i'm not sure here it is hydrogen sulfide is composed of two elements hydrogen and sulfur in an experiment g of hydrogen sulfide is full decomposed into its elements a if g of hydrogen is obtained in this experiemtn how many grams of sulfur must be ontained so are you just supposed to subtract from your help will be greatly apprecitated h s h s yeah you r right conservation of mass it would be different if you were talking about concentrations or something else Sulfur Hydrogen Sulfuric acid Hydrogen peroxide Chemical element Mineral Sulfide Explosive material Alternative biochemistry Water (molecule) Hydride Iron Origin of life Atom Nickel Ammonia Jupiter Mustard gas Flue gas desulfurization Sodium sulfate Silver Rocket fuel Photosynthesis Ultramarine Organic chemistry Chemistry Antoine Lavoisier Energy development Hydrogen chloride Alcohol Selenium Neutron Permian-Triassic extinction event Hydrogen atom Sulfur dioxide Haloalkane Titanium Halitosis Helium Fluorine Quantum mechanics Battery (electricity) Base (chemistry) Experiment Hydrofluoric acid Nuclear fusion Copper extraction Arsenic History of chemistry Technetium Alcohol fuel Acid mine drainage Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Atomism Zinc Black powder Bacteria Solar system Volcano Mercury (element) Molecule Hydrogen economy Lunar Prospector Nuclear weapon design Isotope separation Proton Gold Catalytic converter Vacuum Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics) Semiconductor Nuclear fission Electrolysis Mass Supernova Mole (unit) Hydrochloric acid Air pollution Antimony Future energy development Aluminium Acetic acid Nuclear weapon Concentration Periodic table Leblanc process Flatulence Abundance of the chemical elements Venus Sterling silver Nutrient Poison Analytical chemistry Teller-Ulam design Alum Nitroglycerin Ruthenium Io (moon) Salt
