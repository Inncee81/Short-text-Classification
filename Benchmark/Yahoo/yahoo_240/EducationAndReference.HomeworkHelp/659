cos x sin x simplify all i know is that the answer is pi over and i don't know why cos x sin x sin x sin x sin x sin x should be not sin x sin x x pi plus any multiple of pi i've made a mistake when i correct it in square brackets the solution is not pi Kepler's laws of planetary motion Complex number Trigonometric function Newton's method Euler's formula Trigonometric identity Regression analysis Quaternion Multiple integral 3D projection Fourier series Orthogonal group Basel problem Frequency mixer Cubic equation Orthogonal matrix TI-89 series Trajectory Coordinate rotation Haversine formula Prosthaphaeresis Harmonic oscillator Quaternions and spatial rotation Spherical harmonics Bessel function RLC circuit 3-sphere Gibbs phenomenon Particle in a box Uses of trigonometry Proper time Ordinary differential equation M__bius strip Particle in a one-dimensional lattice (periodic potential) Debye model Triangle Grover's algorithm Examples of differential equations Potential flow Linear differential equation Trigonometric rational function Operator Pendulum Ellipse Equation of time Pascal's theorem Theta function Sin Lorentz group Tetration Klein bottle Imaginary unit Three-phase Derivative Trigonometry Golden ratio Radius of convergence Exponential function Coordinates (mathematics) Phase-locked loop Arbitrary constant of integration Formal power series Timeline of mathematics Euclidean plane isometry Integration by parts On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Exponentiation Great-circle distance Cissoid of Diocles Dihedral group A Course In Miracles Green's function Boundary value problem Impedance Chinese character Sturm-Liouville theory Stefan-Boltzmann law Normal mode Schwarzschild coordinates Theodicy QR decomposition Madhava of Sangamagrama Torus Transformation matrix Window function Infant baptism Snell's law L'H__pital's rule Action (physics) Joseph Louis Lagrange Standing wave ratio Tangent half-angle formula Boy's surface Phasor (electronics) Diffraction Dot product Alternating current Euler's identity Product rule Additive synthesis
