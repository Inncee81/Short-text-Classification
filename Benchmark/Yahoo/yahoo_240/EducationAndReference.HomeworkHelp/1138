find the missing values that solve this equation y x help each set of numbers within the parentheses represents x y since you are given the x in each set and are asked to find the y simply replace each x in the original equation with the given number for example y or y x y thus the first answer is repeat the process for the other two problems Ordinary differential equation Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Exponentiation Expert system Mathematics of general relativity Sudoku Recurrence relation Elementary algebra Negative and non-negative numbers Numerical analysis Halting problem System of linear equations Measurement in quantum mechanics Stochastic process Sturm-Liouville theory Mathematics Polynomial Optimization (mathematics) Cubic equation Projective transformation Lisp programming language Dither Path integral formulation Boolean satisfiability problem Complex number Laws of Form Equation solving Arbitrary constant of integration Algorithm Quadratic sieve Quartic equation Dirac equation Boolean logic Bose gas Dynamic programming Artificial neural network Particle in a box Hydrogeology Chemical equation Partial differential equation Julia set Collision detection Root-finding algorithm Simulated annealing Gaussian elimination Unicode Cissoid of Diocles Dynamical system Trajectory Galois theory Heat equation Quantum harmonic oscillator Pascal's triangle G__del's incompleteness theorem Navier-Stokes equations Mathematical model Newton's method Prime number Matiyasevich's theorem Einstein's field equation Random walk Atomic orbital Genetic algorithm State space (controls) Nonlinearity P-adic number Discrete Fourier transform Quintic equation TI-89 series Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics) Associativity Linear differential equation Atanasoff Berry Computer IP (complexity) Large numbers Prices of production Computer simulation Polynomial interpolation Boolean algebra $ale of the Century RLC circuit Compiler optimization Analog computer Fluid dynamics Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics Gauge theory Transformation problem Quantum mechanics Fibonacci number Gas in a box Invertible matrix Kalman filter Two's complement Unix time Basel problem Catalan number Nondimensionalization Archimedes Conic section Naive set theory
