chem help what are the effects of atomic ionic radii on properties of elements this is a really broad question as atomic and ionic radii pretty much affect everything in general ions with a large ionic radii are negative anions and ions with a smaller ionic radii are positive cations because ionic radii is directly related to how many electrons an element has and how strongly the pull of the nucleus acts of these electrons therefore the atomic radii of an element can also affect the element's ionization energy or the amount of energy required to create a cation from a given element because an element with a small atomic radius will have only a few electrons held tightly close in to the nucleus these electrons are difficult to remove and so the ionization energy of this element is high the ionization energy of an element with large atomic radius is low because it is relatively easy to remove one of the many and loosely held electrons of this element accordingly an element with low ionization energy like an alkali metal which is likely to become a cation starts out with a larger atomic radius and shrinks rapidly in ionic radius upon ionization trends in electron affinity likelihood of an element becoming an anion and electronegativity ability of an atom of attract electrons to itself in a covalent bong follow directly from this trend in ionization energy in summary as atomic radius decreases ionization energy increases electron affinity increases electronegativity increases Electronegativity Ionic bond Water (molecule) Corona discharge Ionization potential Atom Corrosion Hydrogen Ionizing radiation Chemistry Helium Transition metal Hydrogen bond Carbon Nuclear fission Capillary electrophoresis Technetium Rubidium Iron Plasma (physics) Caesium Plutonium Atomic nucleus Uranium Potassium Aluminium Sodium Magnesium Semiconductor Mass spectrometry Ruthenium Alkane Sulfur Nitrogen Fluorine Ionosphere Isotope separation Oxidation number Atomic orbital Nuclear weapon design Inertial confinement fusion Lanthanum Sun Strontium Xenon Vacuum Hydride Ammonia Chlorine Boron Spark plug Titanium Tellurium Beryllium Systematic name Action potential Electron Spectroscopy Phase (matter) Compact star Permittivity Enzyme Radiography Electrical resistance Hydrogen sulfide Lutetium Membrane potential Metal Thallium Radiation hardening Mercury (element) Langmuir probe Tin Haloalkane Chromium Iodine Lead Tesla coil Nuclear explosion Yttrium Cobalt Copper Calcium Germanium Solar cell Indium Zirconium Chemical bond Chemical reaction Neutron Acid Silver
