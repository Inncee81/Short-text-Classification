slop intercept form an airplane maintain a landing approach of a constant rate of descent of ft for every ft traveled horizontally what is the slope of the line that represents the planes landing approach you are a sales clerk in a clothing store you receive a salary of a week plus a commission on all sales write an equation to represent ur weekly salrary what is the slope and y intercept of your equation you are renting a car from economy rent a car it will cost you a day plus a mile per day write an equation to represent the daily cost of renting the car what is the slope and y intercept of ur equation slope is equal to y x which is equal to rise run rise or in this case descent hence the negative run reduce reduced weekly salary the initial payment x stands for the percent and x is the variable for the number of sales slope intercept form y mx b where m is the slope and b is the y intercept so the slope y intercept cost of rent x slope y intercept Microeconomics Slope Trigonometric function Derivative Linear equation Supply and demand Toyota Prius Conic section Trajectory Inflation Anarchism and capitalism Monetary policy Jet engine F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Value product Maxwell's equations Discrete Fourier transform State space (controls) Production function M__bius transformation Public transport Labour economics Action potential Polynomial Taxation in the United States Economic rent Capital accumulation Leasehold estate FairTax Gross domestic product Exponential function Projective transformation Surplus value Airport Production theory basics Speed of light Calculus Progressive tax Insurance Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Transport in Hong Kong Curve fitting Stairway Tax Fixed-wing aircraft Planetary orbit E85 BC Rail Mutual fund American individualist anarchism UK Singles Chart Heat equation Explosive material Radar Operating surplus Unemployment Circuit design United States House of Representatives Organic composition of capital Cerritos, California Ordinary differential equation Black-Scholes Aberration in optical systems Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Cubic equation Principal-agent problem Utility cycling Labor-power Special relativity Member of the European Parliament Welfare economics Hydrogen economy Transformation problem Parabola Price discrimination Child support Labor theory of value Wind turbine Economy of India Resistor Dirac equation Law of value Siphon Minkowski diagram Salt Lake City, Utah Movie studio National Insurance Apollo 15 Estoppel Mohamed Atta al-Sayed Transformer Gaussian elimination Economy of Fiji Profit maximization Ellipse Real estate bubble Car handling Polarization USS Tunny (SS-282)
