plot analysis fo daughter of venice by donna jo napoli i actually just finished this book last week the main character donata is the daughter of a member of the aristocracy the custom of the day is that only the oldest son and the oldest daughter can get married so her future is pretty much already planned for her because she is not the oldest she believes she will be forced into life at a convent she craves a life of her own she surreptitiously learns to read and write while her parents surprise her with the news that they've decided to break tradition and have chosen a husband for her she decides to follow her own path instead of the life they've chosen and finds a way to let her twin sister get married instead she convinces her parents to let her continue her studies at a university if i were going to do a plot analysis i'd talk about the small decisions donata makes that lead her to find her future i'd do comparisons between her and her twin sister and also her family and the jewish family she meets my conclusion would talk about whether the ending is a happy one or a sad one does everyone get what they want do you think they'll be happy in their decisions or the decisions made for them i hope this helps it's a good read although i found the beginning thirty pages or so really dry keep reading through it because it does get more interesting Knots Landing Days of our Lives Charmed About a Boy Fiddler on the Roof Kodocha Children of Dune Pitaten God Emperor of Dune The Catcher in the Rye Michael Garibaldi Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Phoebe Halliwell Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Ashlee Simpson Show Friends Sharon Tate Religious Society of Friends Big Brother (USA TV series) Anna Karenina Batman Beyond The Pilgrim's Progress Happiness The Human Stain Spice Girls Artemisia Gentileschi Alena Theory of conduct Sunset Beach (soap opera) Avenue Q Divorce Neighbours Runaways (comics) Marie Antoinette Mary I of Scotland Survivor (novel) Chapterhouse Dune Incarnations of Immortality CPU cache History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Another World (TV series) Jean Grey 2004 Republican National Convention Line of succession to the British Throne Mary Wollstonecraft Tiberius Percy Bysshe Shelley Family name Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Wolfrider Jacen Solo Le Malade imaginaire Fight Club Back to the Future timeline Scenes from a Memory The Death Gate Cycle Captain Marvel (DC Comics) The Star Wars Holiday Special Queen of Wands Star Trek: Enterprise Kurt Cobain Alcoholics Anonymous A Course In Miracles 7th Heaven Christian eschatology Jacob Neusner Gundam W G-Unit: Last Outpost The Tale of Genji Marco Polo Extreme Programming Guiding Light Paul von Hindenburg Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords Memento (film) Information Services Procurement Library Vernon Schillinger Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Louis XV of France Carl Barks Lex Luthor People associated with Anne Frank Everwood Dead Like Me Happy Days The Mother Adam and Eve Lunar: Silver Star Story Complete One Tree Hill (TV series) Bernice Summerfield History of the English Bible Luke and Laura Spencer About Schmidt Marie de Rabutin-Chantal, marquise de S__vign__ Twin Transactional analysis
