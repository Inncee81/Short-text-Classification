can you pls solve this physics problem sum for me a certain for exerted for sec raises the speed of an object from m s to m s later the same force is applied for sec by how much does the speed chage in sec thanks a lot energy is force times distance that means if a force is applied for one second at an average speed of ten mph and one sec at an average speed of the second is twice the energy that is good because with a constant force acceleration is constant at all speeds a m s therefore the force applied for seconds increases the velocity by m s final speed m s Force Escape velocity Classical mechanics Torque Velocity Trajectory Gravity Mass Faster-than-light Momentum Frame of reference Kinetic energy Spacecraft propulsion Speed of light Black hole Special relativity Angular momentum Second General relativity Orbital speed Jet engine Explosive material Center of mass Acceleration Scramjet Two-body problem Semi-major axis Speed Tide Lagrangian mechanics Coriolis effect Equivalence principle Modified Newtonian dynamics Physical cosmology Electromagnetic radiation Gravitational slingshot Astrodynamics Cyclotron Friction Potential energy Hubble's law Electric field Zeno's paradoxes Project Orion Wind power Calculus Fictitious force Nuclear explosion Specific orbital energy Kepler's laws of planetary motion Action potential Specific impulse Aerodynamics Phonon Galileo spacecraft Wind turbine Rocket Terminal velocity World line Propeller Harmonic oscillator Magnetic field Variable speed of light Action (physics) Big Bang Speed of sound Space elevator Dimensional analysis Inertial frame of reference Tsiolkovsky rocket equation Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution Neutron star Electromagnetic field Tests of general relativity Centripetal force Ordinary differential equation Moment of inertia Light Creationist cosmologies Turbocharger Difference between sub-orbital and orbital spaceflights Planck units Plasma (physics) Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Siphon Centrifugal force Temperature Car handling Honda Civic Event horizon Particle in a box Trigonometric function Photon Particle accelerator
