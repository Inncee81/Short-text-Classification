what is the ethical dilemma associated with plea bargaining in my opinion you are saying that doing the right thing later being honest diminishes the wrong the earlier the criminal offense if you plea bargain the defendant admits to a crime or gives the names of others involved in exchange for diminished sentencing in reality the situation could be considered two potential crimes the original crime then purgery if someone refuses to plea guilty and is found guilty so instead of lessening the sentence for those that cooperate the courts could increase it for those that don't if this is a homework assignment the answer i gave probably doesn't help you much you would want to look into the prosectution selling justice for an easier job Plea bargain Jury trial Plame affair Adversarial system Theory of conduct Capital punishment Nolo contendere Ethics Trials since the Fiji coup of 2000 Inquisitorial system Insanity defense Jury Appeal Probation officer Plea Prisoner's dilemma Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Double jeopardy Ronnie Earle 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Judicial functions of the House of Lords Schapelle Corby Lynndie England W.
