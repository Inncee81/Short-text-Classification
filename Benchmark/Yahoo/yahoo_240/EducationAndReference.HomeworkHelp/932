algebra problems that you could walk me through find the value of x in the following system of equations x y y x and another problem what is the slope of a line parallel to the line y x thanx muchoo love first problem we have y x so let's substitute that in for y in the first equation x x x x x to check that this is right we now have y y and y y y since they both come out as we know x is correct for the second problem y x the slope of this line is whatever x is being multiplied by is the slope any line parallel to this would have to have the exact same slope otherwise it would eventually intersect parallel means they never intersect or cross to see that this is true you can graph it on graph paper you'd start at y x and then plot another point at y the in means its increasing from the original point and x the in means its increasing from the original point then draw a straight line that goes through both of your points any line that isn't going over and up no matter how far away you put it to begin with on the y axis will eventually cross your original line Cissoid of Diocles Parabola Projective transformation Polynomial Slope Conic section Supply and demand Trigonometric function Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Random walk Linear equation Incidence (geometry) Complex number Geometry Cartesian coordinate system Algebraic geometry Elliptic curve Vector (spatial) Newton's method Exponential function Quadratic equation Tangent Mathematics Microeconomics IS/LM model Ordinary differential equation Arthur Cayley Covariance and contravariance Duality (projective geometry) Calculus Roman surface Collision detection Quantum harmonic oscillator Perspective (graphical) Production function Glossary of graph theory Equation of time IP (complexity) Graph theory Elementary algebra Aberration in optical systems Bresenham's line algorithm Topology Boy's surface Ruler-and-compass construction Joseph Louis Lagrange Sundial Cubic equation Line at infinity Phase diagram Mathematics of general relativity Planar graph Special relativity Curve Augustus De Morgan Laws of Form Keynesian economics Minkowski diagram Simplex algorithm Euclidean plane isometry Circuit design Map projection Desargues' theorem Action potential Matroid M__bius transformation Transformation problem Astrodynamics Geographic coordinate system Non-Euclidean geometry Cournot competition Exponentiation Dirac equation Production theory basics Nomogram Dividing a circle into areas Ellipse Independent Subway System Orthogonal matrix Square root P-adic number Curve fitting Line (mathematics) Magnetic field Topological space Denotational semantics Logic Faster-than-light CPU cache Quartic equation Racetrack (game) Angle Perspective projection distortion Gaussian elimination Yield curve Elementary arithmetic Function (mathematics) Halting problem Quaternion
