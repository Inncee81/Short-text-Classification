i need help with this math problem oabc is a parallelogram and m is a point on ab angle amo deg and angleabc find angles aom diagram link below http img imageshack us img image dq th jpg because it is a parallelogram adjacent angles are supplementary and add to degrees therefore angle oam is now you look at the triangle oam where you have two of the three angles the third being the angle aom which you are looking for remember that the three angles of a triangle add to angle aom degrees Triangle Cissoid of Diocles Wallpaper group Angle Pythagorean theorem Trigonometric function Lattice (group) Vector (spatial) Quadrilateral Coordinate system Parallax Symmetry Affine transformation Pi Symmetry combinations Complex number Similarity (mathematics) Collision detection Rotational symmetry CIE 1931 color space Polygon Archimedes Pantograph Euclidean plane isometry Delaunay triangulation Helicopter Geographic coordinate system Geometry Aberration in optical systems Penrose tiling Milan De Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter Degree (mathematics) Trigonometry Gray code HSV color space Castor angle Root system Trigonometric identity Euclidean geometry Circle Spherical trigonometry HyperText Transfer Protocol Prosthaphaeresis Haversine formula Magnetic declination Soap bubble Descriptive geometry Ruler-and-compass construction Bloodstain pattern analysis Phong shading Josip Plemelj Drill bit Curve fitting Glossary of graph theory Unified Modeling Language Softball Order of Australia Platonic solid GED Navigation Celestial navigation Napier's bones Pascal's triangle Euclid's Elements L__vy C curve Parabola Acousto-optic modulator Tiling by regular polygons Faster-than-light HTML element Antenna (radio) Eye Orthographic projection Congruence (geometry) Astrodynamics Kepler's laws of planetary motion Graphics Inner product space Slide rule Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite Clementine mission Super Nintendo Entertainment System Axial compressor Interactive geometry software Microphone Circumcircle B__zier curve Spaceship Earth (Disney) Hexagonal lattice Orthogonal matrix Phasor (physics) Hipparchus (astronomer) Rotation Modular group Gemini 8 Jet engine Adjoint functors On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Engine balance
