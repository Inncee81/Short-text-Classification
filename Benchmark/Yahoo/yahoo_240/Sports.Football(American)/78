should the vikings trade jackson and their pick next year to the raiders for jamarcus russell this would solve problems for both teams i think the vikings need a true number qb and the raiders need to get rid of a signing problem the raiders have culpepper and i don't think he is going to let go of the starting job for a couple of years it would be trading an unproven for another unproven but the talent swing is huge between them never would happen raiders 'eaned' the number one pick in the draft and out of all the players they picked russel he's a rookie and probably not expected to do much the first year he'll ride the bench and most likely take over next year culpepper signed a year deal he wants to show he's still got it in an effort to sign with another team next year if he starts this season which isn't a given but very likely he'll be gone at the end of the year for russel why would the vikings want to give up their qb they picked him last year and will start him this year they have a good rb which will take the pressure off the young qb and who's to say he would be easy to sign with the vikes many picks hold out that's why oakland went ahead and signed culpepper to a year deal Oakland Raiders Pittsburgh Steelers New York Giants Daunte Culpepper New England Patriots New York Knicks Super Bowl IX Cincinnati Bengals Buffalo Bills Oakland Athletics Chicago Bulls Cleveland Browns New York Jets Randy Moss Reggie Jackson San Francisco 49ers Utah Jazz Minnesota Vikings AFL-NFL Merger Super Bowl XXVII Boston Bruins Jeff George Baltimore Ravens Cris Carter Canberra Raiders American Football League National Football League Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl XI Carolina Panthers St. Louis Rams Dallas Cowboys Los Angeles Clippers National Football League Lore January 2005 in sports Madden NFL NFL playoffs, 2004-05 New York Mets NFL playoffs, 2000-01 Houston Rockets Miami Dolphins Indiana Pacers Seattle Mariners Minor league baseball Toronto Blue Jays 1957 World Series Pittsburgh Penguins Detroit Red Wings Super Bowl XXVI Tampa Bay Buccaneers Brett Favre Wayne Gretzky Los Angeles Kings NFL Draft New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Sammy Sosa Monday Night Football Ted Hendricks NBA Draft NBA Finals Super Bowl X Super Bowl XV Yao Ming Boston Red Sox Alex Rodriguez Wilt Chamberlain Hendrick Motorsports Orlando Magic Cleveland Cavaliers Atlanta Flames Babe Ruth Kerry Collins Cincinnati Reds Willie Brown (football player) September 2005 in sports Detroit Tigers Florida Marlins WNBA Draft Super Bowl New Jersey Nets Draft (sports) Super Bowl XIX Penske Racing 2000 Australian Grand Prix Kansas City Royals Portland Trail Blazers LeBron James October 2004 in sports Super Bowl XII Philadelphia Flyers Jon Gruden December 2004 in sports Joe Gibbs Donovan McNabb Robin Ventura Norway national football team
