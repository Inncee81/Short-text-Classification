why is football american called football they rarely use there feet why do they called football and why did they steal it from football soccer the real football american football or football as we know it in america is a made up sport like any other i think partly they appropiated the word because it would be easier to sell the sport to people when the league had barely begun they called it american football because the game in several ways resembles rugby which is an english and australian sport so they wanted to differentiate themselves from those images while at the same time borrowing and exploiting the similarities of american football to rugby it was smart marketing the game itself is perfect for marketing purposes there are several well timed breaks for tv commercials every quarter also i like that one explanation where we learn that football was a name given to any sport that involved the use of foot and feet however that makes no sense when it comes to gaelic football since gaelic football is played with a tiny ball being carried on a flat paddle like stick it is almost like lacrosse except that the ball is smaller and the area where you rest it on the paddle like stick is flat and much smaller so the rationale that all sports involving feet and ball are called football doesnt apply to the gaelic football example it does bring up the possibility that football is really a name that has been freely used to name a lot of sports for a variety of reasons American football Football Football (soccer) Australian rules football Gaelic football Rugby football Rugby league Baseball Rugby union Canadian football Hurling Lacrosse Gaelic Athletic Association Football (ball) Rugby union positions Sport Table tennis National pastime Playoff Major League Soccer Softball Scotland Glossary of American football Water polo Rugby league in Australia Professional sports Tennis Mouse (computing) New Zealand English Marching band History of rugby league Arena football Indoor football All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship Major professional sports league The Football League Melbourne Cricket Ground Ball Canadian Football League Hat-trick Sport in the United Kingdom EA Sports Origins of baseball Sydney Football in the United Kingdom Whitewater Cheerleading History of rugby union Fast bowling Snooker International rules football Spanking Football culture Hazing Sudden death Sport in Ireland Billiards Super League (Australia) National Rugby League Atlantic Coast Conference Super Bowl Bobby Charlton Poker jargon State of Origin Rugby league in England IBM PC compatible Football (soccer) positions History of Test cricket (1884 to 1889) New York Giants Roller hockey Drop kick Ultimate (sport) Goalkeeper Scrum (rugby) Theodicy Croke Park Paintball Manual transmission Tackle (football) Eskrima Badminton Equine conformation Ulster Kayak
