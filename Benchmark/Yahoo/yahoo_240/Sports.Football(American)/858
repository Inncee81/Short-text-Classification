football help okay i am mexican american and brought up in a mexican culture so we watched soccer and boxing instead of football my boyfriend and i plan on watching some games together he loves football and i love him i just want to share this with him from a not so ignorant stance and have fun where can i find info on understanding football here are two posts i made before on the topic the first is about the positions and the second is an overview of the basic gameplay positions offense quarterback of the time takes the snaps and throws to receivers runs with it or hands it off to a halfback fullback halfback the team's priority running back can also take passes fullback the team's secondary running back he doesn't get the ball as often offensive line center and guards blocks for the quarterback and running backs tight end an extension of the offensive line only they are allowed to receive passes wide receiver catch passes from the quarterback defense defensive line in front of the offensive line rush the quarterback usually depending on the play linebackers either blitz cover a receiver runningback or cover the middle of the field in zone defenses safety strong weak basically the last line of the defense they make sure no one gets by them on the pass and the run cornerback the receivers of the defense in man coverage they cover the wide receivers general gameplay basics you get plays st down nd down rd down th down to move yards if you move yards in plays you get a first down another plays to try to get yards this repeats until any of five things happen you score a touchdown by running or passing the ball into the end zone points after a touchdown you can kick an extra point point or go for a point conversion points you kick a field goal points you punt the ball to the other team this is done on th down if it is say th down and yards to go when you punt it the other team catches it and wherever they are tackled is where they get the ball the point is you are giving them worse field position putting them further away from scoring if you don't punt on th down and say you don't get the yards i just mentioned the other team gets the ball where it is at the end of that play the last thing that can happen is you can turn the ball over fumbles happen when someone carrying the ball drops it if they recover it play resumes as if there was no fumble if the other team recovers the ball it is their first down wherever the ball is an interception occurs when the defense catches a pass from the offense and possession who is trying to score changes finally a safety can occur when you are trying to move the ball upfield but are tackled in the end zone behind you the one you're not trying to make it to this gives your opponent points and then they get the ball too during the game there are a number of penalties that can be called here are a couple basics offsides defense is past the line of scrimmage an imaginary line from sideline to sideline going through the ball when the ball is snapped when the play begins yards forward for the offense false start can be anything from a flinch to a jump its the same as offsides only the offense does it yards back for the offense holding while blocking the blocker holds whoever they are trying to block either holding the jersey or wrapping their arms around the blockee in a loving embrace pass interference offense or defense can do this while the ball is being thrown either the defense hits the receiver before he catches the ball or the offense hits the defense before that ball is caught in college this is a yard penalty and an automatic first down however as long as either player is making an attempt at catching the ball and is not trying just to stop the other person from catching it there is no pass interference so there's football in a nutshell hope it helps back to work for me Philadelphia Eagles Basketball World Football League Super Bowl XXIX Donovan McNabb Super Bowl IV Snap (American football) Super Bowl XXXVII Indianapolis Colts Baltimore Ravens Harrow Football Field hockey NFL playoffs, 2001-02 Play from scrimmage Fielding (cricket)
