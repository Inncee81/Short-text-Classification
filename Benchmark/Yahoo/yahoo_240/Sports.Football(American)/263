what is uscs' record against lsu c'mon trojans let's hear from you where are y'all at i think they played twice and split wins one of the best games ive ever been to was when usc came to lsu in ' i think they had charles white who won the heisman the same year i remember usc's defense was incredible that year and up to that point in the season no one had scored a td on them lsu stadium went absolutely nuts when we scored a td in the first quarter with only a few seconds on the clock and lsu leading usc had a fourth and goal and the pass was broken up some idiot ref called roughing the passer on benji thibodeaux he didnt touch the qb and gave usc st and goal with a few seconds left they pulled that win out of their sses on a bad call needless to say i want this bcs championship matchup between lsu and usc to happen so badly we were the champs in not them since the bcs has been the accepted system until those crybabies didnt make it and being the media darlings they are claimed the title time to settle it edit the st meeting at lsu in ' was something like final score and that was one of two games auburn that i feel the refs cheated us out of the nd meeting was at usc and lsu blew them out Bowl Championship Series USC Trojans Football Iron Bowl New England Patriots December 2004 in sports Mack Brown Super Bowl XXIII Texas Longhorn Athletics Cleveland Browns 2004 College World Series Pittsburgh Steelers September 2005 in sports Cincinnati Bengals January 2005 in sports Super Bowl XXV Super Bowl XXVII New York Giants Super Bowl XVIII Super Bowl XXVI Super Bowl XXXVI November 2004 in sports NBA Finals October 2005 in sports Auburn University Tulane University Super Bowl XXXIV All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship BCS title game Alex Ferguson Boston College Athletics Super Bowl XIII New York Jets Super Bowl V Super Bowl XV Super Bowl XI Water polo Sam Barry Super Bowl XXXIII Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl XXXVIII Playoff NFL playoffs, 2004-05 Super Bowl XIV New York Knicks American Football League Super Bowl III University of Southern California Super Bowl XIX Super Bowl XVII Super Bowl XXII Carolina Panthers Super Bowl VI Super Bowl IX Super Bowl XXI Super Bowl XXXI Larry Bird Super Bowl XXXV American football Super Bowl XXXII FA Cup NCAA Division I-A national football champions Shaquille O'Neal Arkansas Razorbacks Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.
