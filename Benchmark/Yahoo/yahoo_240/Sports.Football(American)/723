who will have a better carrer reggie bush or vince young so i think it's a lot easier for a rb to have a good career than it is for a qb a guy like barry sanders had a phenomenal career playing for a mostly mediocre lions team the reason they were able to be mediocre was barry sanders without him they would have just been bad barry sanders is in the hall of fame and never really came close to a super bowl on the other hand every time a qb is talked about they bring up the question of winning how many super bowls has he won the only qb who seems to have gotten past that talk is dan marino he is still credited as one of the greats but he never won a super bowl though unlike barry he played in one so i think vince young is going to have to win games to have his career considered great while reggie bush will just have to accumulate stats so my answer to your question is that reggie bush's career will be labeled the better career Pittsburgh Steelers Barry Sanders Brett Favre Green Bay Packers Dan Marino Super Bowl XXXVIII Super Bowl XXII Super Bowl XXVI Reggie White Miami Dolphins Carolina Panthers Cleveland Browns San Francisco 49ers Kansas City Chiefs 2004 World Series Super Bowl I Reggie Miller New York Giants Indianapolis Colts Deion Sanders National Football League Super Bowl Super Bowl XIV Washington Redskins Pro Football Hall of Fame Super Bowl XI Super Bowl XXXVI Super Bowl XIX Cincinnati Bengals Super Bowl X Super Bowl IX Dallas Cowboys Minnesota Vikings Detroit Lions Reggie Bush National Football League Lore Buffalo Bills Denver Broncos Super Bowl XXXI Sam Barry Joe Gibbs Norway national football team Hank Stram Super Bowl XXV New York Mets Super Bowl XXVII Super Bowl XXIX December 2004 in sports Babe Ruth Peyton Manning Super Bowl XVII October 2005 in sports Barry Bonds Fast bowling Don Shula Super Bowl VI English cricket team Scott Hall Super Bowl XV Madden NFL Super Bowl XXXII Super Bowl XXXV Iron Bowl New York Knicks Home run Super Bowl XX Bee Gees Super Bowl XVI Vince Lombardi Super Bowl XXXIX Al Michaels Super Bowl XXI October 20 in baseball Tom Brady Baltimore Ravens The NFL Today Kurt Warner Game show Super Bowl XVIII Steve Young (athlete) Paul Hornung St. Louis Rams Nolan Ryan Indiana Pacers The Joker's Wild Super Bowl XXIII Major League Baseball television contracts Stanley Cup Super Bowl XXXIII San Diego Chargers Jacksonville Jaguars Dream Team New England Patriots Arkansas Razorbacks Super Bowl VII October 12 in baseball Oakland Athletics
