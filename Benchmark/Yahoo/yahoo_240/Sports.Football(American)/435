watching the nfl hall of fame the other day brought one thought to my mind seeing the replays of irvin laying there on the ground at veteran stadium and just remember all the eagles fans cheering that he wasn't getting up made me wonder why in the world does philly fans have so little respect b c i can imagine if another team did that to mcnabb who seems to get hurt everytime you turn around now or if it happened to dawkins eagles fans would be complaining about how wrong it was yeah but that's not as bad as when cleveland fans started cheering when their own qb got hurt tim couch got absolutely murdered for that team for years behind a non existant o line pretty much every game they won from was purely from his force of will pulling games out of the fire then he gets hurt and his own fans start cheering then when he gets upset and cries at the press conference the fans start calling him a baby so yes what the philly fans did was a cheap shot but it could have been alot worse and i also can remember dallas fans cheering when wade wilson got hurt a few years back Philadelphia Eagles Cleveland Browns Pittsburgh Steelers National Football League Lore Philadelphia Phillies New York Giants Cincinnati Bengals Donovan McNabb Dallas Cowboys Carolina Panthers New England Patriots Miami Dolphins Kansas City Chiefs Veterans Stadium American Football League San Francisco 49ers Satchel Paige Theory of conduct Super Bowl Babe Ruth Minnesota Vikings Oakland Athletics Super Bowl XXVII Major League Baseball television contracts Super Bowl XXXIX Toronto Blue Jays Indiana Pacers Negro league baseball St. Louis Rams Terrell Owens San Francisco Giants Jon Secada Hank Aaron Chicago Cubs New York Knicks World Series Los Angeles Dodgers Tris Speaker Citizens Bank Park 1957 World Series NFL playoffs, 2002-03 Seattle Mariners Playoff Baltimore Ravens Torquay United F.C.
