who is the sleeper team this year i think i know who do you think will be the team that goes that no one thought was going to be a legit contender this year i think that it's going to be the steelers with bruce arians as their new offensive coordinator they are going to spread the field that creates space for a smallish back such as fast willie parker to gain chunks of yards without having to run between the tackles i e edgerin james as a colt as opposed to bettis as a steeler plus the steelers finished in the top in total offense and total defense last year i don't think more than teams did that i think last years was an anomoly and the steelers will be playing late into january and don't answer with the patriots or the chargers or the bears i'm talking about sleepers not pre season favorites answer intelligently please the reason i select the steelers is because i can't find an online expert who picks them above rd in their own division everyone is so in love with the ravens d and the bengals o i personally think that the bengals are a joke and the ravens are too old on offense ok let me define this better any team that made the playoff last year is out and as for the ers fans frank gore has a broken hand that could linger all year i think you are overlooking how huge that injury actually is any helmet on that hand could lose him for a month think portis last year for the 'skins portis is a much more proven back than gore but that early training camp injury plagued him all season the broncos maybe who picked up dre bly danial graham brandon stokley and travis henry champ bailey and dre bly will be very difficult to throw against while jarvis moss elvis dumervil and courtney brown will be hard to run against if brandon stokley's injury doesn't hurt him too much he javon walker brandon marshall and danial graham will all have good receiving yards travis henry fits very nicely into the broncos blocking schemes the only problem i see is an old o line that could get injured a lot and a middle backer dilemma john kitna and the lions think they will win games but they are smoking something strong September 2005 in sports Denver Broncos Super Bowl IX Super Bowl XXXV Super Bowl XXXIV Running back Super Bowl XXVII St. Louis Rams Super Bowl XXXVI Super Bowl XXI Dallas Cowboys Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl XIII Super Bowl X Super Bowl V NFL playoffs, 2003-04 Super Bowl XXIV Super Bowl NFL playoffs, 2004-05 Super Bowl XXIII Super Bowl XVII Super Bowl XI Jacksonville Jaguars December 2004 in sports Super Bowl XXV Tennessee Titans Super Bowl XXXI Super Bowl XXII National Football League San Diego Chargers American football Super Bowl XIX Super Bowl XII Washington Redskins Super Bowl XXXIII Oakland Raiders Super Bowl XVIII Philadelphia Eagles Minnesota Vikings November 2004 in sports Super Bowl XVI January 2005 in sports American football strategy Toronto Raptors October 2005 in sports NFL playoffs, 2001-02 New Jersey Nets Super Bowl XXVIII Super Bowl III Cris Carter Professional American football championship games Super Bowl I New York Knicks Super Bowl XXXII NFL playoffs, 1996-97 Super Bowl XXXVIII Donovan McNabb Detroit Tigers St. Louis Cardinals Super Bowl XXX Super Bowl XX Glossary of American football Cleveland Indians Chicago Bulls Miami Hurricanes Football NFL playoffs, 2002-03 NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 2005 Pro Bowl October 2004 in sports Ben Roethlisberger NFL playoffs, 1994-95 Super Bowl VII Madden NFL Boston Bruins Indiana Pacers Brett Favre Robin Ventura Marvin Lewis Joe Gibbs Los Angeles Kings Terrell Owens NFL playoffs, 1997-98
