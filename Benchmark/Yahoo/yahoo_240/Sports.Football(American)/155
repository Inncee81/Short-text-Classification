how does college football work i don't understand how college football works how come last year ohio state played florida in the championship shouldn't they have played boise state and what are all the different divisions like pac and big east and stuff what do they have to do with anything i understand nfl and their playoffs and stuff but for some reason i can't quite understand college sadly it's all based on the opinions of sports writers and coaches and stats entered into bcs computers it considers things like strength of schedule that's why boise got robbed most schools are aligned with conferences and play a majority of their games against fellow conference members every year there are more conferences than there are divisions in the nfl because there are a lot more college teams than pro teams usually conference alignment is loosely based on geographic location more and more it's based on revenue for the schools conferences are expanding because ncaa rules state that a certain minimum of schools must belong to a conference in order for them to have a championship game the championship game of course brings extra to the conf which all teams share to some extent there are many who have advocated a playoff system in college but it hasn't happened yet mostly because the traditional powerhouse programs are against it National Football League College football Playoff Big East Conference Atlantic Coast Conference College basketball Cincinnati Bengals Kansas City Chiefs Southeastern Conference Joe Paterno St. Louis Rams New York Giants Buffalo Bills University of Texas at Austin Miami Dolphins NFL playoffs American football Super Bowl American Football League San Francisco 49ers Jacksonville Jaguars Minnesota Vikings Cleveland Browns Arizona Cardinals Auburn University Detroit Lions Playoff format Carolina Panthers Dallas Cowboys NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 Pacific Ten Conference Green Bay Packers National Football League Lore National Basketball Association San Diego Chargers NCAA Division I-A national football champions Indianapolis Colts Canadian Football League University of Florida Super Bowl XXVI Tulane University Sudden death Oakland Raiders Tennessee Titans Clemson University The Football League Atlanta Falcons Baltimore Ravens Super Bowl XXXVI Big Ten Conference Super Bowl XXV Middle Tennessee State University National Football League championships USC Trojans Football Tampa Bay Buccaneers Philadelphia Eagles Arizona State University National Collegiate Athletic Association Rose Bowl (game) Boston College Athletics Super Bowl V World Football League Georgia Institute of Technology Super Bowl XXVII Monday Night Football New England Patriots Boise State University New Mexico Lobo Basketball Super Bowl III Florida State University BCS title game 2005 NFL season University of Houston West Virginia University University of Notre Dame Super Bowl IX AFL-NFL Merger Miami University Donovan McNabb Los Angeles Kings Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University University of Connecticut Houston Nutt Chicago Cubs Super Bowl XXIV University of San Francisco Super Bowl XXXI Super Bowl XIII Ben Roethlisberger
