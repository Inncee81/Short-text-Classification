challenges in preseason i honetly think the challenges shouldnt be done in the first preseason games just wanted some input from others preseason doesnt matter in wins or losses i just feel that the challenges drag on forever in a meaningless game where do you stand on this i disagree challenges since they are a part of the game need to be practiced as well the clock ticks the same way in preseason just as it does in regular season the referees officiate the games the coaches call plays and the players play everyone involved needs the work practice everyone needs to be sharp as far as the challenges go coaches and refs alike need to get use to the challenge system regardless of the role practice or procedure they all can be improved upon provided they are practiced rehearsed again and again another reason coaches need to practice challenges is so that they are familiar with the system in regards to the proper time and plays to challenge and how to manage their challenges properly how many times have we either seen the coach fail to make the challenge in time how many times have the guys upstairs fail to advise the coach to make the challenge how many times has it taken the ref mins to make a determination after going to the video how many times have we seen the calls blown trust me they need to practice this New England Patriots Stanley Cup National Football League Ice hockey Baseball Appeal Cleveland Browns Instant replay St. Louis Rams Bowl Championship Series Jacksonville Jaguars 2005 NFL season Judicial functions of the House of Lords Game programmer Exhibition game New York Giants Los Angeles Kings Dance Dance Revolution Overclocking Wayne Gretzky USC Trojans Football Judicial review American football Alex Ferguson West Bromwich Albion F.C.
