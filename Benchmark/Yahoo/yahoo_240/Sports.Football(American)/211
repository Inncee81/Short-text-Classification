mike tomlin do you think he can bring the steelers back to the super bowl i think he can they will go and will make the playoffs this year if you consider everything that went wrong for them last year they only missed the playoffs by one game last year the steelers lost a few games just because of muffed punts but this year i expect them to have one of the best returners in the league with willie reid being healthy i also think several of their players will have a better year i expect ike taylor to have a breakout season i think he has talent and is becoming more skilled at the corner position i also expect lawernce timmons to play a big part in the steelers defensive with joey porter gone timmons will fill the role of a pass rushing linebacker very well ben roethlisberger is going to be better a quarterback this year he has had a full year to recover from his motorcycle accident ben also said that he usually takes months off in the off season but this year he said he only took weeks off this year this will make him a better quarterback and more resistant to injury the steelers second year players will really shine too santonio holmes will do great last year he showed flashes of greatness i also believe anthony smith will have a good year last year i did not think bill cowher did a good job coaching in all the years i could remember the steelers were always coached very well by cohwer they were always motivated and got very few penalties however last year was different they seemed sloppy and not very well coached however i am not saying that the new coach mike tomlin will be a big improvement his first year but he will not be a big drop off from what cowher was last year however one problem the steelers will have is their secondary there is no doubt that troy polamalu will have another pro bowl season but the other cornerbacks and safeties will have to make a big improvement i think tomlin will help these defensive backs tomlin was the defensive backs coach with the tampa bay buccaneers so my prediction for the steelers this year is this may be a very generous prediction if they make the playoffs anything can happen Super Bowl XXIV Miami Dolphins National Football League Lore Super Bowl XXVI San Francisco 49ers Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl XXIII Super Bowl XXV Super Bowl XXXV St. Louis Rams Super Bowl XXI Baltimore Ravens Super Bowl XI National Football League Buffalo Bills Super Bowl XVIII Super Bowl V September 2005 in sports Super Bowl III Minnesota Vikings Philadelphia Eagles American football strategy Super Bowl VII American football Super Bowl XXVIII Super Bowl Ben Roethlisberger Super Bowl XII Jacksonville Jaguars Indianapolis Colts NFL playoffs, 2004-05 Bill Cowher Oakland Raiders Super Bowl XXII Super Bowl XXXIX Super Bowl I Super Bowl XX Super Bowl XXXI Super Bowl XVII Tampa Bay Buccaneers Super Bowl XXX Brett Favre Super Bowl VI Super Bowl XXXVII October 2005 in sports Super Bowl XIX Tony Dungy Super Bowl XXXIII November 2004 in sports Joe Gibbs December 2004 in sports Toronto Raptors January 2005 in sports Dan Marino Donovan McNabb Tennessee Titans NFL playoffs, 2003-04 San Diego Chargers Super Bowl XXXII Denver Broncos NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 Super Bowl II NFL playoffs, 1982-83 Super Bowl XVI Super Bowl XXXVIII NFL playoffs, 2001-02 Running back Monday Night Football New York Knicks Boston Bruins Green Bay Packers Washington Redskins NFL playoffs, 1997-98 XFL Terrell Owens Houston Rockets Los Angeles Kings Super Bowl IV American Football League Warren Sapp Troy Aikman Defensive team Tampa Bay Lightning
