what is the toughest conference in college football i would say the sec it has some of the best defenses in the game and great offenses too i like the university of south carolina they finished fourth in the sec east last year and look at the game against florida they lost by one point then florida goes and blows out the next best team so by scores the fourth best team in the sec east could have won the national championship that is what i say tell me who you think has the toughtest conference and give me your argument to all of you who say that the sec hasnt won many national titles this is why the sec has the hardest teams to play inside of it it is hard to win every single game like the other conferences can because they only have one or two good teams even the small teams like vanderbilt and kentucky have pontential to be florida lsu arkansas and others this is a tough one but i agree with the sec statement the league usually has six or seven teams every year who can win the sec title with two or three of those having national title potential the road schedule can be brutal lsu had to go on the road to arkansas tennesee auburn and florida in the same year not too many people have whole schedules that difficult and you can't take a week off even against lightweights like vanderbilt and miss st sec has claimed nat titles in years had a record in bowl games last year and leads the nation in attendance the only complaint that i have is that they barely travel to play top teams in the other leauges out of conference acc Bowl Championship Series Atlantic Coast Conference NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 Arkansas Razorbacks Iron Bowl Houston Nutt Big East Conference Cincinnati Bengals College football National Football League New York Giants Miami Dolphins Super Bowl XXXVI Playoff Auburn University Carolina Panthers Pittsburgh Steelers Super Bowl XXIV 2005 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament Super Bowl XXV New England Patriots Super Bowl XXVII Cleveland Browns International League Super Bowl XXI NBA Finals Boston College Athletics Bear Bryant Super Bowl V Indianapolis Colts Super Bowl XVIII Buffalo Bills Nick Saban New York Jets Super Bowl XXXVIII Florida Marlins University of Florida College rivalry USC Trojans Football Super Bowl XXXIV Super Bowl XI Super Bowl X Super Bowl XXVI College basketball Super Bowl XIV Steve Spurrier Tennessee Titans The Football League Joe Paterno Chicago Bulls Super Bowl XXXIII Super Bowl XXXV Kansas City Chiefs Minnesota Vikings Super Bowl XXXI Super Bowl XXII American Football League Super Bowl IX January 2005 in sports December 2004 in sports Indiana Pacers St. Louis Rams Super Bowl Donovan McNabb 2005 NBA Finals Super Bowl XIX October 2005 in sports Super Bowl XVII American football Super Bowl XXIII Super Bowl III Super Bowl XXVIII Detroit Tigers Water polo Jacksonville Jaguars Mario Lemieux Baltimore Ravens Miami Hurricanes Football Tennessee Pete Sampras Bundesliga (football) University of Kentucky University of Alabama Joe Gibbs Alex Ferguson Hayden Fry University of Arkansas Pete Rose Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Playoff format
