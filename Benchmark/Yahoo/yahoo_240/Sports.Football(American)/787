do men find women football fans unattractive i've always thought that guys would love girls who are into football i'm not talking about the girls who buy a jersey because they think it's cute i'm talking about women such as myself who have a knowledge of the game and don't think that their favorite team is superior to all the others and have an appreciation for the sport i would much rather watch monday night football than the new lifetime movie thats coming out on monday night but i've found in the past that some guys think its weird that i like football as much as i do and i've heard from many men that they prefer their women to be more girly because it takes away from the time and conversations they have with their male friends my boyfriend thinks its great that i like football and other sports also but football is my favorite but other guys don't think this is so cool i'd like to hear some opinions the reason i am asking this here instead of singles and dating is because i know ill find more football fans here hell yah girl thats hot now we dont have to be answering questions during the game your boyfriend is lucky as hell Jennifer Lopez Married... with Children Ron and Fez Humphrey Bogart About a Boy American football Phoebe Buffay's songs Football (soccer) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Game show Friends Social rule Cliff Richard National Football League Can't Hardly Wait The Ashlee Simpson Show Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Kodocha Monday Night Football Garfield EastEnders Frankie Laine Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle Sex and the City The Lovely Bones Daria The Shining (film) Time Out of Mind Cary Grant Shaggy dog story New York Giants Girly Little Britain The Emancipation of Mimi Norway national football team Eric Bischoff Philadelphia Eagles Shawn Michaels Jon Secada Jeopardy! in culture Cool (song) "Weird Al" Yankovic Football chant Bish__jo game Shake It Off Otaku AFI 100 Years series Eurotrip Knots Landing Cincinnati Bengals The Adventures of Pete & Pete Garth Brooks Conan the Barbarian National Football League Lore Physical attractiveness Urusei Yatsura Terrell Owens 50 First Dates Kylie Minogue Marilyn Monroe Moonraker The Beach Boys Hey Arnold!
