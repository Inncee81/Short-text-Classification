new england patriots how will the new england patriots do in the season what will thier record be will they make it to the playoffs with a revamped receveing corp will we have a shot at superbowl xlii tom brady made it the afc championship game with okay recievers and would've won it with stallworth and moss in my opinion let me be the first to say the patriots is going to win the super bowl why here why the patriots got the best qb in the league in tom brady who's playoff record is the best for any active players including peyton manning he's gonna put up some huge number again especially with the help of moss and stallworth at the wr's spot which they sorely miss last year no help in the passing games the best young running back in lawrence maroney he can do it all run and catch the ball out of the back field and a defense that's is as good as anybody out there lead by richard seymour and the offensive line is solid as usual protect tom brady so my pick is the patriots to go all the way and win it Super Bowl XXXVI New England Patriots Pittsburgh Steelers Super Bowl XIV New York Giants Tom Brady Cincinnati Bengals National Football League Lore Super Bowl XXXI NFL playoffs, 2004-05 Miami Dolphins Super Bowl XIII Buffalo Bills Super Bowl X Carolina Panthers Cleveland Browns Super Bowl NFL playoffs, 2003-04 Super Bowl XXXIX Peyton Manning St. Louis Rams Super Bowl XV Super Bowl XXXIV Super Bowl XXVI Indianapolis Colts Super Bowl XXI Super Bowl V Super Bowl XXVII Super Bowl XXIV Super Bowl VII New York Jets Super Bowl XVII Super Bowl XI Super Bowl IX Super Bowl I San Francisco 49ers NFL playoffs, 2001-02 Super Bowl XX Super Bowl XXIII Super Bowl XII Super Bowl XXII Super Bowl III Super Bowl XIX Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl XXVIII Super Bowl XXXIII National Football League Super Bowl XVIII Super Bowl XXXV Oakland Raiders Tennessee Titans San Diego Chargers Jacksonville Jaguars Super Bowl VI Super Bowl XVI Super Bowl XXXII January 2005 in sports NFL playoffs, 2002-03 Dallas Cowboys Super Bowl II American football Dan Marino Donovan McNabb NFL playoffs, 1999-2000 Drew Bledsoe American Football League NFL playoffs, 1998-99 September 2005 in sports Chicago Bulls Minnesota Vikings Baltimore Ravens 2005 NFL season 2005 Pro Bowl Cris Carter NFL playoffs, 1982-83 Joe Gibbs Wide receiver Doug Flutie Super Bowl IV Rodney Harrison NFL playoffs, 1978-79 Super Bowl XXX NFL playoffs, 1984-85 NFL playoffs, 1996-97 New York Knicks Seattle Mariners Philadelphia Eagles Canadian football Super Bowl XXIX Cincinnati Reds 2005 World Series World Series
