how do you think the kansas city chiefs will do this football season do you think brodie croyle will finally start and do some good for the chiefs what about priest and him coming back or not you think that would help the poor team also what is your take on larry johnson do you think he's a good player or an overrated jock basically i'm just wondering what everyone is expecting from kc this year please answer oh and if you dont like the chiefs please just dont bother answer this question what i meant by referring to lj as an overrated jock was that he always plays yeah because he's good but can't herm give someone else a chance also do you think lj can continue to deliver like he did last year huard is going to make croyle battle for it and either way they don't have much to work with in terms of receivers so another good year for gonzo priest is back but i don't know how much he'll play at first i thought it was just a stunt to get lj into camp but it seems like they are serious now they keep losing quality offensive linemen and that's not good for lj or priest lj is a talented back but is he going to hold out every year now unfortunately i expect about and no play offs this year but at least i get to watch them drub the raiders twice Pittsburgh Steelers Kansas City Chiefs Miami Dolphins Cincinnati Bengals Cleveland Browns National Football League Lore Super Bowl XXVII Glossary of American football Super Bowl IX New England Patriots Oakland Raiders American Football League All-Time Team American Football League Super Bowl American football Super Bowl X Toronto Argonauts New York Knicks Super Bowl I Super Bowl XIII Super Bowl III Super Bowl XVIII Super Bowl XXXVI Super Bowl XIX Super Bowl XXV Dallas Cowboys Offensive team David Cooper (footballer) Minnesota Vikings Defensive team American football strategy Oakland Athletics NBA Finals National Football League Super Bowl XII Super Bowl XIV 1957 World Series Leeds United F.C.
