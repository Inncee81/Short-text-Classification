college football vs cfl who do you think would win in a game one of the best college team michigan usc florida etc or the worst cfl team i dunno normally i would say pros like in any ncaa team vs nfl team however the cfl is a different situation the cfl has a mandatory roster requirement for canadians players that did not play college football in america they may have played football in canada but honestly canada is not known as a hotbed of football talent true they do have american players on cfl teams but they are all players who weren't good enough for the nfl i think an ncaa team vs cfl team would be a lot closer matchup than ncaa team vs nfl team would be but a lot of that would depend on whose rules you play by if you play using cfl rules obviously the cfl team has a distinct advantage its their game however if you played ncaa rules i don't know if a cfl team would have the same overall skill advantage an nfl team would have i think a game played under ncaa football rules might tip the scales in favor of a really good ncaa team because of the inexperience of the canadian players in the american college football style for example canadian players most likely have never had to play against the option for instance and wouldn't be sure how to defend it properly while an nfl player that played in college might have Canadian Football League Comparison of Canadian and American football Canadian football National Football League Major professional sports league American Football League Salary cap Doug Flutie College football Damon Allen Toronto Argonauts Ricky Ray Glossary of American football Kansas City Chiefs Playoff Cincinnati Bengals Montreal Alouettes Joe Paterno Rugby football Jacksonville Jaguars Tennessee Titans World Football League New York Giants Cleveland Browns Passer rating Pittsburgh Steelers Basketball Warren Moon NFL Draft Super Bowl I Super Bowl XXVII 2005 NFL season Football (soccer) Exhibition game Super Bowl XXIII American football strategy Sudden death Lacrosse Denver Broncos Indianapolis Colts Ice hockey XFL Super Bowl Canadian Football League West Division Major League Soccer Detroit Lions Nick Saban West Virginia University New York Jets Arizona State University Volleyball St. Louis Rams United States Football League Dallas Cowboys History of American football Jerry Rice National Football League Lore Buffalo Bills Super Bowl XXXIII Oakland Raiders Steve Nash Tampa Bay Buccaneers Arena football Syracuse University Orange Grey Cup Mack Brown Playoff format Pro Bowl Clemson University 2002 CFL season Baltimore Ravens Minor league baseball Deion Sanders Marv Levy Randy Moss Arizona Cardinals Hubert H.
