hopefully this will put an end to all those stupid vick questions why does everyone turn against him when all the evidence the prosecutors have is one guy saying that vick was there they have no visual evidence he was there and it was at his house so what that doesnt prove anything he has relatives he has friends who have access to his house just because the house is under his name makes him the ring leader that doesnt make much sense the case should be dismissed because its one guys word against anothers why does everyone think he is a pig for doing this when it hasnt even been proved the reaspn i have the evidence is because they say it on t v duh and are u kidding me it hasnt quieted down its being picked up because the trial is getting closer the police would indite a famous person for every little thing they would indite a dollar ticket to famous person who jaywalked or ran a redlight police now days will do anything they can to get press involved another thing prosecutors do need exposure y do u think some lawyers make more money than others they win big cases and have there name put out there so your the one who doesnt know what he is talking about hey man unlike all these other haters i got to agree with u on this one nobody has one piece not one single piece of evidence that vick was in on it now im not saying he didnt kno about it but i dont think he was in on it the people he let go on his property were the people who were doing it not vick now i dont think will get away with that and i can guarantee he wont play this season but i dont think he did it and this is coming from a dog lover my dog is my favorite thing in the world but i believe vick isnt stupid enough to go in on it in the biggest years of his life thats all i got good question Atomic Kitten Plame affair Michael Vick Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Glen Jacobs 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Kyle Broflovski Contract Trailer Park Boys Schapelle Corby Appeal Watergate scandal Friends O.
