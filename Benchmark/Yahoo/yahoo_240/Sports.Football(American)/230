priest holmes returns triumphant or disappointing i freaking loved ph a few years back in fantasy given that he missed last year due to head and neck injuries not injuries affecting his running per se will he be able to come back to full form or will he look anemic and slow like ricky williams in his return support your answer as much as you can he's going to be really rusty since he's been gone for so long but i guess we'll see how he performs in the pre season as a chargers fan i obviously don't want the priest holmes of old to come back as a football fan however i hope he does well if nothing else someone needs to come in and knock larry johnson off his high horse and remind him that he's not the only person that can run the ball for kansas city Kansas City Chiefs Cincinnati Bengals New England Patriots Pittsburgh Steelers New York Jets Running back New York Giants National Football League Lore Philadelphia Eagles Carolina Panthers Los Angeles Clippers Detroit Tigers Super Bowl XXVII Michael Vick Billboard Hot 100 Super Bowl XXVI September 2005 in sports Larry Johnson (football) San Diego Chargers Houston Rockets Satchel Paige Indiana Pacers Babe Ruth Mois__s Alou American football Ricky Williams Equine conformation New York Knicks Dallas Cowboys Oakland Raiders Penske Racing Crystal Palace F.C.
