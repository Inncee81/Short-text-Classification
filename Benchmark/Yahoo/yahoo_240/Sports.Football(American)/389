wtf pacman jones is going to wrestle now today tna wrestling confirmed on their website that they have signed jones is he going to wrestle i doubt he will be doing any actual wrestling his nfl contract prevents him from doing anything overly physical off the field and wrestling would be one of those things even if he is suspended he won't be able to do any wrestling mostly likely he's just going to make a few appearances and maybe participate in some sort of non wrestling capacity A.J.
