can someone tell me if the nfl has a rule that says players can only wear reebok shoes a co worker of mine contends that players have been fined for wearing their ownn shoe per their contract this sounds absurd to me can anyone verify this what the hell are shoe contracts for more or less since the nfl has limited to some extent what shoes a player can wear since reebok has a billion dollar decade long contract the shoes are generally reebok also nike does have an agreement with the nfl allowing players to wear the shoes other companies don't so the logos must be covered now reggie bush has an adidas contract adidas does not have an nfl agreement so if adidas logo shoes are seen that will prompt a fine this is ironic since adidas and reebok have merged in the last year Adidas Reebok Adidas-Salomon Nike, Inc.
