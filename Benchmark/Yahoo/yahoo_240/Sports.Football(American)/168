best game what do you think the best game of this ncaa year will be i got florida lsu i am a huge gator fan and death valley pm is a scarey place for anyone to play this will be a battle and hopefully my gators will come out on top but you will see a rematch in atlanta on dec runner ups alabama vs fsu in jacksonville va tech lsu usc nebraska what game are you waiting to see edit to deacon i will be excited to see florida beat the crap out of auburn this year but i don t think it will be much of a game because we play in the swamp this year and auburn can't bring their own refs like they had at home last year see florida game incomplete pass called a fumble lsu game receiver got tackled but not pass interference i'm eager to see the start of a rivalry between alabama and my noles however i can't be convinced that it will be in the national spotlight considering both team's recent stumbles hopefully they'll have good years for national title implications your pick of fl vs lsu is good and i'll throw in osu vs michigan because i look forward to that every year and it could have title implications once again Bowl Championship Series Iron Bowl October 2005 in sports Southeastern Conference College football Fight song Mack Brown 2004 College World Series December 2004 in sports Auburn University Nick Saban New England Patriots USC Trojans Football Florida State University American football Cincinnati Bengals College rivalry Jacksonville Jaguars University of Florida 2005 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament National Football League Lore Arkansas Razorbacks National Football League Houston Nutt Super Bowl XIII University of Georgia Pittsburgh Steelers Atlantic Coast Conference Boston College Athletics Miami Hurricanes Football International League Kansas City Chiefs Cleveland Browns Louisiana State University Miami Dolphins Glossary of American football Texas Longhorn Athletics New York Jets Negro league baseball Super Bowl XXXIV Buffalo Bills Super Bowl XXVII Super Bowl III NBA Finals Daunte Culpepper San Francisco 49ers March 2005 in sports 1957 World Series American Football League All-Time Team Super Bowl V University of Alabama Rugby union State university Current sports events Auburn, Alabama November 2004 in sports Ben Hill Griffin Stadium Super Bowl XXVI Super Bowl XXXIII Georgia Institute of Technology Clemson University Baseball Syracuse University Orange Oklahoma State University - Stillwater 2005 World Series Super Bowl X The World's Largest Outdoor Cocktail Party Michael Vick Super Bowl XXIII September 2005 in sports Super Bowl IX Newsweek's List of the 1,000 Top U.S. Schools (2005) New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Hulk Hogan Super Bowl XXXVI NCAA football bowl games, 2005-06 Ice hockey Canadian football NCAA Division I-A national football champions Super Bowl XVIII Super Bowl XX English cricket team Super Bowl XIX Steve Spurrier Jordan-Hare Stadium Norway national football team June 2004 in sports Comparison of Canadian and American football Florida Marlins College World Series Eddie Guerrero Rugby league Super Bowl XXV
