how do u become an actress one of the biggest difficulties faced by those of us who decide to become professional actors is a large group of folks i call the bad advice crowd the bad advice crowd bacs are a diverse group which includes smart alecks wise guys nay sayers fear mongers cynics gossips fact checkers dummies failures rumor repeaters experts and even those poor souls who are worried about what other people will think a bac becomes a bac because a bac is unable to see the reality of any situation generally this happens because the bac is so wrapped up in his own vision of how things are or how things should be that he cannot see the truth please take my word for it you will encounter many bacs in your quest for professional acting success the first group of bacs you will encounter are a little surprising people in your family moms dads sisters brothers second cousins and maiden aunts can assault you with their fears concerns and prejudices they will do this because you have decided to go off the beaten path and they are worried about you this is cathy she s our actress is the least debilitating of these sorts of comments some others include acting how will you make a living that s not the sort of thing people like us do what makes you think you can act my goodness you ve got to stop dreaming and get a decent job who told you that you could do that the second group of bacs are surprising and a llittle sad other actors that's right people just like you will also rain on your parade the odd part is that most of them will actually be in circumstances much like your own these are people who are in the same boat with you telling you how to get out of the boat think about it the comments suggestions and advice you get from these kinds of actors is literally unbelievable if they knew as much as they purport to know well they wouldn t be there in the boat with you would they this is a dog eat dog business is something you will hear from other actors a lot if you don t have the look you don t stand a chance this town is only interested in who you know your type doesn t get much work you ve got to spend a fortune on headshots or they won t work without an agent you re dead in the water don t do extra work they won t give you parts if you do that they only hire their friends if you want to make it you ve got to be willing to do anything a lot of people date their way to the top there are many more comments in this category but i think you get the gist in fact what they are really doing is raining on their own parade don't listen they're talking to themselves and you need to stay far away from people like that all of these so called statements of fact are utter hogwash the third and most dangerous group of bacs are composed of agents managers casting directors producers and other executives these people can have a devastating effect on your career with just a word or two if you listen i don t think you have what it takes you re not movie star material you have no talent why are you wasting your time you need my help i can get you to the top if you sleep with me i ll see to it that you get that part there are millions of wannabes what makes you any different if you want to make it you ve got to be willing to compromise your values now will you date me the fourth bac well i ll get to that one in a minute the downside of the bad advice crowd is this they are ruinous to your attitude why is your attitude important because attitude 'mind set' is the secret weapon of successful people i was watching the biography channel yesterday and mike meyers talked about his secret of success i just wouldn t give up no matter what i would just keep doing it this is the attitude the mind set of practically every professional actor i ve ever met or read about you cannot allow anyone to chip away at this attitude with their bad advice no doubt you love your family but don t listen if they don t support you if they do support you then listen carefully they may give you very good advice as far as other struggling actors giving you good advice let s just say that s about as likely as paulie shore winning an oscar most of the time when you hear smart actors talking about the rules and the way things are you are hearing an excuse they are making up for later their chatter is a rehearsal for the eventual explanation they will give for their own failure to achieve their goals it s a crap shoot you gotta get the breaks it s so competitive and i m just not a competitive sort of person i just won t sleep around to get ahead it s not easy to hear someone in a position of authority tell you that you should go back to omaha because you just don t have it there are going to be people like this in your life it s a guarantee how do i know this because of people like harrison ford julia roberts denzel washington clint eastwood lucille ball and ray romano all these actors and thousands of others probably every last man jack of us have been told they didn t stand a chance many were fired for being without talent or too ugly or too much like someone else almost all were turned down by agents managers producers and executives a group who have proven over the years that they cannot see a movie star in the making any more than they can see subatomic quarks colliding with protons with their naked eye the great writer william goldman put it best nobody knows you are going to hear this stuff you must ignore it think about it if you are being told that your dream is not worthy this is very bad information your dream is what your life is all about people who do what they love without any thought of giving up are the most astounding successes in our little world period love it and don t give up those are the real rules of success please listen closely you must ignore these people in your life they are everywhere and they never shut up so you have to learn to ignore them can you do it of course you can you are able to ignore anything you choose to ignore like traffic elevator music or aol cd's in your mail box you do it every day now apply your skill to all this baloon juice you get from other people it s an exercise how can you ignore all these people and still be a nice person don t hang with them who you hang out with will have an astounding effect on your outcome if you hang with a group of idle less than ambitious people with excuses for the lack of forward progress it will cost you if you like these people or even love them they will have a negative effect on your mind set by the same token if the people in your crowd talk about their own dreams of success becoming professional actors getting to the top making it etc then you will find it easier to stay focused on your own goals love your family but ignore them on this issue if they aren t supporters of your dream choose your friends carefully those who support your dream are going to help you those that scoff or question or present you with the facts are going to hold you back in work situations you will not have the choice about your associates but you do have a choice about whether to listen to them or not it s just that simple make up your mind which is why it s called a mind set to only 'take in' the advice that will help you learn to tell the difference ignore the bacs just like you ignore cable access shows about accounting you can do it oh that fourth bac well it's not really a crowd unless you are a multiple personality that's right it's you you have to keep an eye on yourself and the things you say to yourself if you repeat the kinds of things we've been talking about to other less experienced actors you are rehearsing your own excuse don't do that if you are constantly looking for 'reasons' that things aren't working out for you it's rehearsal again don't do it if you are negative about your skills your looks your finances your lack of contacts your lack of an agent etc it will cost you big time in fact it will cost you the very thing you desire so if you want to succeed get into the right 'mind set' and stay there positive messages in positive results out that s
