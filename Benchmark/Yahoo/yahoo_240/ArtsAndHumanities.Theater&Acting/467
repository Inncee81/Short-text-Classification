major acting problems should i carry on acting i came across an audition for this musical and asked one of the cast whether i can audition or not he said the director does want me to audition and so i did i skipped school just to audition and didnt get the part since i didnt fit the criteria probably since im too young i don't really mind that but the problem is that my mum's favourite celeb also my fave celeb is in the musical also and it's a once in a lifetime experience for me if i work with her too but now since i'm not in it i dont have the guts to tell my mum and what to do with myself just because im this opportunity is let go just like that also my fave celeb has been rejecting all kinds of acting issues etc etc but this is her first and maybe only musical she'll be in i also didnt get a part in another play i auditioned for so how do i tell my mum what should i do should i carry on with this passion for acting or should i find some other passion my mum knows i skipped school btw hold your head high and tell your mum she will understand i myself had to go through the same exact thing over and over before i got an occasional job sometimes the jobs we do not get are the ones we want the most or a loved one wants us to get the most i once drove back to santa barbara after being scolded by the casting director on days of our lives for not being prepared for the audition and it was a contract role that she really wanted me to land she had originally said i have this job on my look alone i had done small roles on the show before but i went in there unprepared and bombed there i was a grown year old man driving down the freeway with tears flowing down my cheeks i ended up quiting acting for over a year before i got a call and landed a decent acting job with extreme perseverance and determination you will get jobs for me they were phenomenal jobs acting alongside of some of the most talented big names in hollywood so don't worry about working with favourite celebs right now that may come for you down the road your mum will be ok with it and she will be extremely proud of you someday ps you can continue and finish school at the same time as you pursue acting just like eric stoltz and anthony edwards did i grew up with them in santa barbara and they were going down to la doing tv commercials and abc after school specials at the same time as going to school and getting awesome grades and they graduated Actor Pornographic actor Child actor Voice actor Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor Character actor Barbara Stanwyck Canada's Walk of Fame Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills) Ram__n Novarro Acting Academy Award for Best Actress Pen__lope Cruz Julia Roberts Canadian pioneers in early Hollywood Don Adams The Mary Tyler Moore Show Christopher Plummer Marlon Brando Guru Dutt Logie Awards of 1985 Mare Winningham Lauren Bacall Elijah Wood Spencer Tracy Drew Barrymore Sting (musician) Bollywood Emmy Award Kensico Cemetery Cockney British Academy of Film and Television Arts Jack Nicholson Martin Scorsese Golden Globe Award Jane Fonda Johnny Weissmuller Logie Awards of 1990 Police Logie Awards of 1991 Logie Awards of 1992 Henry Fonda Don Francks Holy Cross Cemetery Logie Awards of 1993 Harry Carey John Turturro Black Canadian Hollywood Forever Cemetery Mercedes McCambridge University of North Texas Rudolph Valentino Tony Award Lara Flynn Boyle General Hospital William Powell Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale) Cary Grant Mel Blanc Mary Pickford Erasmus Hall High School Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery Ed Wood, Jr. Hollywood blacklist Lee Marvin Mac Davis 1989 Golden Raspberry Awards Juilliard School The West Wing (television) Peter Fleming Notable figures in Western films Jim Davis (actor) Marilyn Monroe Connie Stevens Juliette Binoche Amadeus Angela Lansbury Helen Hunt Columbia High School (Maplewood, New Jersey) Deaths in 2002 Faina Ranevskaya John Holmes (actor) Don Ameche Irish people January 10 Will Friedle Deaths in April 2005 Hollywood High School Deaths in July 2005 Johnny Depp Baby boomer 3rd Genie Awards Alec Su Dolly Parton Shakespeare in Love Filmfare Award Stella Adler Jimmy Wang Yu Goya Awards
