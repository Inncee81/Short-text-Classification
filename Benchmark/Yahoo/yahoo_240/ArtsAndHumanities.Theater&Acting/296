wanna join debate team but really bad stagefright i wanna join debate team when i'm in high school but i have really bad stagefright i get shaky and my voice shakes when i have to do any public speaking any tips or should i just not join p s can't do any public speaking college courses the same thing happens to meee and i start blushing sometimes too haha i guess its best to just practice speaking in front of fairly large audiences whether its at home or with friends even i guess try not to look directly in the audience members eyes or something or think your just on you own but i guess thats easier said than done dont not join though its good to keep trying and doing your best especially if you have really good points and stuff for your debate Laugh track Richard Pryor I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Sound effect Whose Line Is It Anyway?
