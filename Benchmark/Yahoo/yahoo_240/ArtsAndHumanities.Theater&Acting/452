how bad is the play spring awakening i have been wanting to see spring awakening since last february and it has slowly evolved into being my favorite play although i have yet to see it i own the soundtrack listen to it all the time the last time my family and i went to new york i really wanted to see spring awakening and my mother wouldnt let me because there are simulated sex scenes my mom doesnt really care about bad language and like the sex scenes dont bother me its just i'm wondering if you had to give spring awakening a movie rating like r or pg just to rate the sexaulity what would you give it thanks that's tough because although there is a lot of sexuality it's very tasteful poetic and fits the play i'd say it's between r and pg you will see some nudity and the play revolves around sex don't let that deter you go see it because it's beautiful World Wide Web HyperText Transfer Protocol Opera house Croydon Uniform Resource Locator Theatre London Borough of Croydon West End theatre Irish theatre .uk Bristol Old Vic Drama Blue Heelers Bolton Music Hall Phishing Royal Opera House Wole Soyinka Internet Edinburgh Fringe Web server Wget Jabber Bernard Weatherill HTTP cookie Ombudsman Rochester, New York Malta Coal Shirley, London Manchester University of Canterbury Broadway theatre Culture of the United Kingdom Champaign-Urbana Metropolitan Area Piccadilly Circus Franklin (television series) Hair (musical) University of Alabama Elizabethan theatre Solar variation CPAN Proxy server Abdullah __calan Uniform Resource Identifier Session Initiation Protocol London Canadian literature Victoria Junior College Yiddish theatre New Addington Sally Ann Howes Lincoln Center Tisch School of the Arts Royal Court Theatre Warren Haynes Purley, London VJ Jacob's Pillow Fire University College London Radio drama XRI Southeastern Anatolia Project Central School of Speech and Drama Internet censorship in mainland China Ian McKellen Muskegon, Michigan Harrow School Drew University Caulfield Grammar School Restoration spectacular Bob Hope Amsterdam Ancient Greece Hanif Kureishi History of theater Web browser Southend-on-Sea White House Theatre in Canada South London ArXiv.org e-print archive Louise McIntosh Slaughter Old Vic Tulsa, Oklahoma Common Unix Printing System Domain Name System Fargo, North Dakota Theater in the United States Shakespeare's reputation Ice core Croydon Airport School counselor Emerson College Domain name Memphis, Tennessee Wonderful Town High-speed rail
