drama and acting i love acting it is my passion i'm entering into high school and i signed up for drama threathe and acting but i get really nevous when i peform in front of people and also audtion i audtion for a play in th grade and i was so nevrous but in the middle of it i got comfortable and relaxed but i didn't make it how do i over come that just remember that the people you are auditioning for see lots of people all the time they know what to expect good or bad they aren't going to laugh at you or anything they are just going to say yes or no as far as performing in front of others you must have shown the people you auditioned for that you had talent or they wouldn't have chosen you to begin with also the people who are watching are there to be entertained they want to get out of reality for a few hours and just relax they are on your side and they just want to get a little enjoyment out of their day maybe if you think about these sorts of things before going on stage it may ease your tension and nervousness a bit personally i hate public speaking any time i have to read a paper or something in front of a group of people when i get up there i just think to myself look everyone else had to do it nobody laughed and i need to just do my thing it usually helps me to know that other people are in the same boat and that there really is nothing to be nervous about Marilyn Monroe Jennifer Lopez Henry Fonda Hilary Duff Cliff Richard Escape from New York Tyra Banks Spice Girls Lauren Bacall Good Vibrations: Thirty Years of The Beach Boys Robert Palmer (British singer) Jon Secada Avenue Q The Ashlee Simpson Show Hey Jude The Beach Boys Sally Ann Howes Kodocha The Supremes Ontological argument Advertising Atomic Kitten Infidels Courtney Love Julia Stiles Girls Aloud Julia Roberts Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Anne Boleyn Drew Barrymore One Tree Hill (TV series) The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll Steamboat Queen (band) Opie and Anthony Marlon Brando Oasis (band) The Shining (film) We Belong Together Sex and the City Scott Storch Football chant Barbara Hershey Floppy disk Paul Is Dead Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In Hip hop collaborations Veronica Lake Free will Destiny AVN Awards Van Morrison SpongeBob SquarePants YuYu Hakusho Angelina Jolie Social rule Cyndi Lauper The Marriage of Figaro The Fairly OddParents Quarashi Journey (band) Sarah Jessica Parker Jane Fonda Elvis Presley Charter school Ripped Pants Madonna (entertainer) Pretty Woman Another World (TV series) Quantum mechanics History of the British constitution Big Brother UK series 6 Canibus Judy Garland The Mary Tyler Moore Show Pittsburgh Steelers Hall & Oates Pontiac GTO Child pornography Relative clause Actor Roy Orbison The Amazing Race Soap opera Nuclear power Diana Ross Shelley Long William Powell Gilligan's Island Natalie Wood Akuma (Street Fighter) Ichigo 100% Ashlee Simpson Helen Hunt Rip Torn Babylon 5 Mach kernel Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji)
