can i be a actor and then be a director because i though if i can be an actor but still go to collge to major in filmmaking i can have the money to budget my own film can i do that can i act then later be a director but i also want to act because not only i want to make a film i would love to be in one and in commerical and shows too absolutely many actors have turned to directing later on ron howard ring a bell the only things that concerns me is that you seem to be banking that you'll make enough money as an actor to finance a film of your own later on this could be an indie or a major feature but whatever the case may be just be aware that both of these professions require a tremendous amount of training work and dedication if you choose to use one as a means to an end to another you may find that neither one comes out exactly the way you want it if you want to be a director focus on that aspect and instead of working as an actor dabble with producing a little bit you'll find that it's much easier to raise money to finance a film than it will be to work as an actor and raise the money yourself Yul Brynner Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor Shirley Booth Jack Albertson Tony Award for Best Leading Actor in a Musical Jos__ Ferrer Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play Audrey Hepburn Academy Award Fred Ebb Margaret Leighton Rex Harrison The King and I Rodgers and Hammerstein Actor Michael Cacoyannis Henry Fonda Musical theater Liza Minnelli Angela Lansbury The Ed Sullivan Show Academy Award for Best Actress Academy Award for Costume Design Mel Brooks Julie Andrews Patty Duke Bette Davis Tony Award The Magnificent Seven Cyrano de Bergerac Broadway theatre Academy Award for Directing Whoopi Goldberg My Fair Lady Jack Gilford Chita Rivera Spamalot Ralph Fiennes Tony Award for Best Original Score Mary-Louise Parker Anthony Quinn Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Drama William Shatner Laurence Olivier Cabaret (musical) Martin Scorsese Academy Award for Best Picture Orson Welles John Cromwell (director) Jack Nicholson Wicked (musical) Grammy Awards of 2004 Guitarist Marlon Brando Christopher Plummer Academy Award for Film Editing Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay Stage name Academy Award for Best Cinematography Paul Newman The Ten Commandments (1956 film) Tony Award for Best Leading Actress in a Musical Katharine Hepburn G__rard Depardieu Alan Alda Sally Ann Howes Jane Wyman Les Mis__rables (musical) Anita Ekberg Barbra Streisand The Miracle Worker Thelma Ritter Another World (TV series) Claudette Colbert Rita Moreno Jerry Herman Grammy Award for Best Musical Show Album Kander and Ebb Tony Shalhoub Hal Prince Robert Morse Academy Award for Original Music Score Tyrone Power All About Eve Marvin Hamlisch Cyrano de Bergerac (play) Irene Papas Cher (entertainer) Shakespeare on screen Susan Hayward John Lithgow AVN Awards Celebrity appearances in Doctor Who A Man for All Seasons
