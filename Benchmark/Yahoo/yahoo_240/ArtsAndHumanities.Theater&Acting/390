how can i get my baby into modeling or advertising my daughter is almost months old her father and i arent rich by any means but would love to find a way to earn some extra money to put aside for her future she is just so precious i know every parent says that about their kids lol but she is just adorable where can i go to get her some auditions and such in the maryland area send a snapshot or two to these agents and see if you get a response kids international talent agency east swan creek rd suite fort washington md tel taylor royall agency falls road baltimore md tel they are sag franchised agencies in md and if they are interested they'll call you do not call them just send the photos and a cover letter stating your purpose for contacting them btw babies days and older can work in the industry though twins are most desirable they not the only babies that work legit agents take of your pay after they help get you a job sag contract print agents generally take so if she does modeling the agent may take a larger percentage for that read any contract carefully before you sign and make sure you are comfortable with everything first read up on child labor laws in your state as it pertains to the entertainment industry as an infant there are very strict rules as to working hours etc and as her parent you are her best advocate do not be afraid to speak up if a production crosses the line you are doing what's best for your child good luck Milton H.
