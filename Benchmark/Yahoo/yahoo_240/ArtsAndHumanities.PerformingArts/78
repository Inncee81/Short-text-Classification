sax player years of experience year of slouching can i still make a comeback i played in my school's jazz band and concert band for years and was going to be a music major but had some problems with my college and couldn't get into any schools when i came back home so i took one year off i didn't just during that time i only played maybe times for minutes i'm going through depression and other personal problems and don't feel like playing much not to mention that i've gotten really lazy which is something i have to work on i still love music with all my heart and get restless fingers whenever i hear a jazz song critique players when they play and try to find out what they're doing create solos in my head and get nostalgic whenever i see a jazz band i'm going to be a liberal arts major but can't help but long to play again what keeps me from it is that i don't think i'm good enough for one i am pathetic at sight reading could i make a comeback and play again like i used to yes you can come back i was a flute performance major as an undergrad and music ed as a grad student i didn't play for about a year once before and now again this past year and yikes i have some auditions in a few weeks i'm not worried though it was fine before you'll notice that when you start really playing again you won't have the same endurance range tone and intonation it definitely takes time to work back up to where you were but it's not as difficult as you might think a lot of it is like riding a bike it's muscle memory so ingrained in your brain that you will be amazed how quickly it comes back with patience using your life experiences of the past year and some hard work you may even play better than you ever did in not too terribly long a time as for sight reading it is not something that cannot be practiced you can work on sight reading start by trying to read music written for other instruments at an easier difficulty than you are used to always keep in mind meter key signature accidentals notes note patterns rhythms dynamics and there you go good luck Clarinet Double bass Time Out of Mind Big band Saxophone Music Authentic performance Harmonica Western concert flute Violin Brian Jones (musician) Music genre Blues Marching band Herbie Hancock Traumatic brain injury Piano Musical notation Bassoon Trumpet March (music) Transposing instrument RuneScape quests Trombone Bitches Brew Charlie Parker Shaggy dog story John Cage Native American music Milton H.
