if i can play the fife decently will flute come easily how do the instuments differ are the embouchures the same of a little different will one come easily after another is learned does it require more muscle to play the fife vs flute thanks for the people who designated their time for this question whoever has the most detailed and good reponce sincerely gets best answer so besides the fingering i dont have much work to due fingering wont be a problem because i have played several woodwinds for years soprano alto tenor saxophone clarinet recorder etc i have played a flute a long time ago yet didnt develope an embouchure at that time so its hard to tell but the fingering i have down thanks so much for your help my fewllo yahoo answerers p s you all have great answers and it is going to be really hard to choose a best answer one of you gave me good articles about this subject another gave me their personal experience whatever i choose i am sorry if it not your answer well i actually played fife before flute then again i started out on clarinet and had also done sax beforehand so you may be starting out with a little more of a disadvantage where the keys are concerned now the fife i used was metal chrome plated nickel i think and the mouthpiece was a bit of the same metal as the body welded directly onto it i've seen other fifes that have no raised portion on the mouthpiece and none of them have the plateau mouthpiece that concert flutes all use and as others have said the flute has all of those extra keys for the sharps and flats but the basic fingerings are the same those six holes on the fife correspond exactly to the main six finger positions on the flute so first things first if you don't already own a flute get a decent beginner's model if you take a knowledgable flute player along you can probably find an old bundy or artley or similar brand at a pawn shop for under if you bargain well most fifes play best using the old hard embouchere whereas concert flute uses the soft embouchere that louis fleury developed in the early th century if when you play fife your lips are rather firm and the corners of your mouth are drawn slightly out then you're using a hard embouchere get a flute player to teach you the proper lip formation the sooner you learn that the better you will sound and on the flute velocity is nice but they'll love you for your tone learning how to use the sharps and flats keys is not all that difficult a good book of beginner intermediate exercises with a cheap fingering chart is all you'll need i strongly recommend getting a teacher for at least a few lessons maybe four or six spaced every other week just to get the embouchere started right and to correct any pesky problems with finger position you might start out with you can often get lessons cheaply if you go to a local university and ask or advertise at the music school flute majors often are desperate for a few bucks otherwise go to the best band instrument music store in your town Harmonica Tin whistle Marching band Bassoon Big band Transposing instrument Trombone Oboe Baritone saxophone Harmonic series (music) Fife (musical instrument) Brass instrument Mouthpiece Alto horn Authentic performance Woodwind instrument Chess strategy and tactics Drill bit Piano Tenor saxophone Pet Sounds Bass guitar Double bass Guitar Uilleann pipes Music lesson John Coltrane Gramophone record Harp Lute Concert band Strap-on dildo Vibrato Brass band Multiphonic Bass clarinet Louis Andriessen Musical instrument classification Carnatic music King Crimson The Selmer Company Music of Brittany Horn (instrument) Brian Jones (musician) Music of Ireland A Course In Miracles Social rule Bagpipes George Crumb March (music) Concerto Mario Davidovsky Cornett Timpani Sun Ra Aikido Terminal ballistics C.G.
