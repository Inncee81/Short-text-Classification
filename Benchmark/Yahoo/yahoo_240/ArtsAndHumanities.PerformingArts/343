does this piss you off i really hate how all of the celebrities out there aren't very talented most of them are disney stars with mediocre talent look at the stars of high school musical for example ashley tisdale and vanessa hudgens can't sing that well there are a lot of other people out there who are way more talented than they are it is just very frustrating how a lot of famous people aren't even talented like paris hilton and nicole richie they have no talent i know a lot of people who are far more talented than all of these young hollywood stars i don't want to sound conceited but i am talented and i don't know if i will ever make it because it seems like the only way to be famous is to either be on disney or be party girl well entertainment and talent seem to be totally two different things when thinking about the well entertainment business being famous is based on your looks and the stupid stuff you do being talented and a good actor actress is on the movie rolls you do and such you probably won't be as famous as those girls because really they're just there for there couple minutes of fame so we can laugh and watch them screw up their lives or single catchy jingle tunes but you will be respected in the industry if you picked good movie rolls that show off your talent acting singing abilities i don't know if that answers your question i seem to be rambling a lot today d but nah it doesn't piss me off self worth and self respect is waaaaaay better then people laughing and watching you because you can't eat sing like a yr old and decide to show your crotch in public get what i mean Paris Hilton Nicole Kidman Celebrity Game show The Ashlee Simpson Show Ashlee Simpson Hilary Duff Theory of conduct Musical film Actor The Isley Brothers Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen Friends Humphrey Bogart Judy Garland Hollywood, Los Angeles, California Liam Gallagher Shaggy dog story ABBA Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Jennifer Lopez Lucille Ball Quarashi Country music The Jackson 5 Buddy Guy Whose Line Is It Anyway?
