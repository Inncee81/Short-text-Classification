what are some good acoustic acoustic electric guitar brands for a beginner it really depends on how much you want to spend on a guitar i would suggest getting a decent playable guitar if you get one based on looks or low price and not on playability feel and quality it may be physically hard to play and that would discourage your learning please try the guitars out at your local guitar store music shop if you have a friend that plays the type of instrument that you want to play ask him or her for advice off the top of my head a couple of brands with come with semi reasonable prices but they also make higher priced models that come to mind are epiphone and yamaha but there are many others look on this link for different brands selection and prices http www musiciansfriend com if you've picked out a guitar compare what the local store and the internet is offering price wise i would suggest that if the prices are similar or even if the store brand is just a little higher you may want to go with the store brand since you can reach out and touch someone if you need work adjustment done to your instrument or have any questions in general however if you feel comfortable buying directly off of the internet and the store price difference is too high go for it note that a lot of music stores not all can give you a better deal than what is on the current price tag in the store you might want to ask about a discount if the price is really higher than what is shown for the same instrument on line good luck Bass guitar Mattress Inflation Tesco Violin Synthesizer Mutual fund Double bass Electronic organ Piano Acoustic guitar Harmonica Digital photography MP3 Supply and demand Flute Musical Instrument Digital Interface Player piano Bluegrass music Nuclear power Aldi Price discrimination Transformer Audiophile String instrument Binoculars Oscilloscope Wal-Mart ELO rating system Atari ST Clarinet Department store Instrument amplifier Monetary policy Strap-on dildo Bond Dobro Video game music Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Laserdisc Floppy disk Electronic commerce Retailer Transposing instrument Blood on the Tracks Fender Capacitor Tablature Mandolin Sears Holdings Corporation ITunes Music Store Management information system Guitar/synthesizer Hyperinflation Illegal drug trade Saxophone Jerry Garcia Nintendo Bulk vending $ale of the Century C.F.
