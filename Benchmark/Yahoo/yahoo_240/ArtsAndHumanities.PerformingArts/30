what instrument should i play im goin to highschool and i want to take band im thinkin trumpet saxophone not flute dont suggust it but yea i wanna play something like a trumper or a saxophone trumbone you know those type of instruments out of all of them that you can think of which one do you think would be easiest not to sound lazy i just dont want to end up hating it and quitting i really wanted to do saxophone but what do you all think learning to just make a beautiful sound on any brass instrument takes literally years of hard work while saxophone is not necessarily easier to play you can achieve a rich full sound much more quickly with sax you will get to a point where you can make music and make it sound beautiful faster than you can on trumpet that being said i personally think that the sound of brass instruments is far more beautiful and moving than that of woodwinds sax clarinet etc Saxophone Big band Clarinet Adolphe Sax Harmonic series (music) Woodwind instrument Brass instrument Embouchure Musical ensemble Brass band Musical instrument classification Concert band Mouthpiece John Coltrane Flute Trumpet Louis Andriessen Tenor saxophone Bassoon The Waterboys Rahsaan Roland Kirk Jazz Bass clarinet C.G.
