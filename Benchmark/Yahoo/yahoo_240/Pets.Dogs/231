dog training submissive urination okay i love my dog when he does something wrong i tell him 'no ' and take him away from what he's doing i live with my boyfriend and our housemate both are big guys my dog has some anxiety issues possibly due to past neglect and possible abuse he is a pound puppy when i first got him he never had submissive urination problems my housemate is a big 'caesar milan' fan and if the dog tried to chew his hand which i think is his anxiety i say ow and pretend to cry which makes him stop and give kisses then i give him his bone my housemate flips him on his back grabs his neck and stares him in the eye until the dog stops squirming i think this is what is causing the submissive peeing he has done this when my housemate was chasing him trying to pin him down after he growled now he did it when my boyfriend came to the door of his own house he barked the whole time he was walking up then peed a tiny bit how can i fix this we are leaving the house in a week or so will not being around this guy fix the problem or is their something i can do to help i am so mad now i want to pin the lb housemate down and make him stop squirming when i say 'has done this' i mean submissive peeing thanks skye with him it's not about attention he is afraid i think that's why he's barking and his tail is between his legs hey dp but how can i fix it now just don't let him do it anymore and it'll self correct and do you agree i'm not reacting properly to him mouthing my hand either it doesn't hurt he's anxious pretending to cry and saying ow seems to make him stop and he seems to do it less now should i just do nothing and give him his bone instead i give him his bone after the 'ow' anyway the dog does not respect you or your housemate he is scared to death he is not scared of me only the two big men he can't answer to you and your housemate as well i know and now that i have seen the awful circumstances he will not be touching my dog 'in this situation you might consider surrending the animal to the humane society what i love my dog we're moving back to canada in a week and he'll never see the guy again why would i send him back there i love him i want to fix this and he might be euthanized if he goes back they are at capacity what do you need or expect from that animal i expect love i give love care attention to him i am trying i am not perfect but i want to fix this if you are not comfortable with this housemate's treatment of the animal you might have to choose housemate or dog i can't move out i am broke and this is free rent he will not be touching my dog anymore end of story moving in a week thanks dp and everyone else i like you all just don't tell me whatever you think i want to hear and are honest yikes he can't be much of a cesar milan fan cause cesar wouldn't treat a dog like that for growling your housemate is an ss the alpha roll is a form of aggression he is dominating and showing the dog that people are aggressive he is teaching your dog to be aggressive here's the thing never ever allow anyone to do anything to your dog that you don't agree with doesn't matter if it's trainer vet housemate boyfriend etc here's what i would do take the housemate by the arm flip him over on him stomach pull is arm up tight behind his back and hold him there til he starts to cry and pee his pants when he does then you yank up harder on his arm and then you pinch him really really hard when he gives up then you give a good kick in the ribs now he knows what it's like to act agressive what it's like to be treated aggressive and what it feels like to be made to pee cause you are so scared edit it might self correct when ja is gone but you can't really do much other than ignore the submissive peeing you can tell people to ignore him when he is acting that way and don't let people pet him on top of the head rather scratch under the chin instead you can tell people not to stand over him he needs more confidence and that's going to come with age and experience learning that people aren't bad the hand chewing sounds like anxiety like sucking his thumb but i wouldn't allow him to do it if he does it often and i am sure that you said he is over a year old now he really should be stopped you are teaching him like he is a baby it's not working i would get up and walk away and refuse to allow him to do it entirely if you allow behaviours to continue even tho they seem rather benign they can turn into worse problems later don't talk just get up and leave when he chews when he is acting anxious and worried don't talk to him don't say his name don't tell him it's okay or he's fine or anything else right in the center of his chest when he sits right down the very middle take your finger and rub up and down the center of his chest a good or inches this is very calming for a dog it doesn't encourage and it doesn't tell him that he is acting fine but it helps him feel calm so the thing that is making him anxious is less bothersome without encouraging the behaviour honestly it's almost like a drug reassuring without sucking him up makes him feel calm and more at ease without feeding into his behaviour don't let him see you clean up his accident if you have to put him outside or in his crate or whatever never let them see you clean up the mess for some reason it makes them think that you like it or you enjoy cleaning up messes and it encourages them to make more for you Sin City Humphrey Bogart Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Kodocha Equine conformation Professional wrestling throws Gray
