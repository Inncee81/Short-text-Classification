potty training tips for puppies my black lab is months and she still hasn't gotten close to being potty trained please help our carpets are getting ruined and i can't help but let my puppy in the house it just seems every time she comes in she goes help asap omg never rub their nose in it or resort to training pads the idea is for them to not do it in the house and nose rubbing is just disgusting and mean any dog can be house trained but you are the key the only way to look at it is if the dog makes a mistake it's really your fault not theirs because you haven't quite gotten them to understand first off if your dog has gone on the rugs or anywhere you will have to get rid of the smell in a way that they can't smell it enzyme cleaners work well for this second do not allow you dog access to any area when you cannot watch them period and by this i mean you have to pay attention as if they are a toddler in a room with ming vases lol if you are busy and have things to do around the house put her on a lead attach it to your pant loop or whatever and let her just follow you around it's a good way to teach you both you to pay attention to her her to pay attention to you so your dog wakes up you let her out but you go out with her you say 'go potty reward and bring the dog back in feed her and at this age she shouldn't have to go again so soon if there is any time you cannot watch her she should be confined preferrably in a crate but at least in one room where the floor is easy to clean up say the kitchen every time your dog is let out you should be with her the thing with dogs is they can get easily distracted forget they need to go and not even remember it until they come in hence the 'accidents' this is why you are going out with her to make sure she has no reason to do it in the house when you are in the house and if you are watching correctly you will catch her every time she starts to potty at that point you say loudly no screaming no immediatly take her out and say 'potty' reward simple praise is enough bring her back in only after any accident is cleaned up if raising your tone isn't enough to catch her attention make a 'throw' can i made one out of an old metal band aid can that i put old keys into but it could be nickles or anything that makes a lot of noise throw the can down onto the floor near her and say no but whatever way the idea is to startle her into stopping what she's doing so you can lead her outside the truth is you haven't gotten through to her what you want from her there is no such thing as a dog that cannot be house trained but it's all up to you look at it this way it's kind of a pain but thje better you do it the faster she understands and the faster you can move onto other things like a dirty job just do it and get it over with lol gl you can do it Dog training Crate training Toilet humour RuneScape quests Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Theory of conduct Social rule Milton H.
