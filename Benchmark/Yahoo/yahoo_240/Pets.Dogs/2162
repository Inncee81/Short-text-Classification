i can't take my dog on a walk because he is too aggressive towards other dogs and animals if i try to take him on a walk he is fine until he sees another dog when he sees another dog he totally goes phsyco he starts barking and foaming at the mouth and growling and flipping out he is a teacup pom no more than or pounds when he flips out i have to pick him up in my arms so he doesn't attack the other dog i even try to subdue him in my arms and hold him down i'm yelling no and he's still flipping out barking scratching me trying to get away i tried what the dog whisperer did by holding him down on his back in a submissive state but nothing i do will falter him he refuses to stop until i have completely removed him from the situation and he can't see hear or even smell the dog anymore he is the sweetest little dog you will ever meet until you see him near another dog what can i do to stop this behavior i am going to get him fixed asap but i have a funny feeling that this will not be enough is there anything i can do to eradicate this behavior well getting him fixed will certainly help also don't pick him up doing so rewards the behavior in his mind i would suggest socializing him with other dogs have another dog on a leash along with yours when yours goes crazy tighten and then immediately release the leash as you turn away when he calms down again repeat this may take forever but it should help also before doing this walk him around or play with him so he's not full of energy you definitely do not want to avoid other dogs as this will only increase the behavior good luck Dog training Obedience training Aerial (dance move) Gray Wolf Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Piccolo Junior Saga Futurama (TV series - season 5) Shaggy dog story Dog agility Social rule Traumatic incident reduction Cat Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Dog Reservoir Dogs Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist The McGuire Sisters Professional wrestling holds Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Russian joke Housebreaking The Death Gate Cycle Suplex The Contender (television series) Ferret Professional wrestling aerial techniques Milton H.
