a question for the dog owners my jack russel terrier is a real pain she eats anything she can get her paws on we leave the kitchen for one second and she is up on the table eating our food when we realize she is on the table we come in and yell at her to get down but she just stares at us and keeps eating untill we come over and pull her away we have tried yelling at her squirting water at her with a spray bottle but nothing works on easter she ate about pounds of chocolate when she escaped her kennel she has gotten so fat that her tummy bulges i have considered hitting her when she does this but i am afraid that i could really hurt her and i don't want to do that is there any other way also she eats our socks if no food is lying around michael would that work with you i think my question was more along the lines of how to get her to stop eating as much not how to get rid of her anonymous if i wanted to abuse my dog i would just hit her and that would be cheaper i want an alternative to violence texas angle that is a great idea but what if the mousetraps broke a bone in her foot i would never be able to forgive myself nochocolate actually when she first started stealing food and socks we though we were underfeeding her so we actually feed her more then the dog food container suggested there are many ways to train a dog not to do things without expensive training classes rather than just squirting the dog with water try mixing in a mild irritant with the water i find that vinegar usually works best depending on how large your squirt bottle is fill it with about a half inch of a mild vinegar white vinegar perhaps and then fill the rest with water shake well and use this be sure to only use it when the dog is doing something you really don't want them to do don't use this bottle for every single bad thing they do because you'll run the risk of getting them used to the bad taste also be sure to consistently refer to the bottle with a name we called it the no no bottle and our dogs did learn to associate not only the bottle but our tone of voice before using the bottle as a deterrent if used effectively eventually your dog will cease bad behavior at the mere sight of the bottle another method you could try as far as keeping the dog off of tables is to remove all method of getting on the top of the table move chairs far enough away or turn them around so that the dog can't use them as a stepping stone to get to the tabletop if your table is low enough that the dog can jump from floor to tabletop you may want to consider either getting a taller table i would suggest buying gates to block the dog's access to your dining room but if your dog can jump from the floor to the tabletop those won't do you much good hitting your dog is okay when done correctly if you are rearing back and slapping your dog with all your might then you're doing it very wrong the suggested force to use would be about the force you might use when mildly clapping your hands at a concert imagine you were only somewhat impressed with the song you're clapping for rather than if you were wowed by the song and are clapping vigorously any more than moderate force is too much some might disagree but this method again when applied correctly does work if all else fails as far as behavior you may have to consider training classes talk to your veterinarian about any training centers in your area he she recommends as far as keeping your dog away from things you don't want them to touch make sure you're putting these things in cabinets or other areas the dog can't get into as for her weight consider changing her diet do you feed her canned wet dog food do you feed her table scraps if so these things are good to begin eliminating also take your dog out for a walk every day or provide them with some form of exercise even if it requires your participation your veterinarian is the best person to consult for your dog's individual needs hope all this helps Dog Dog training Piccolo Junior Saga Breastfeeding Dog agility Garfield Guinea pig Domestic rabbit Obedience training Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Cat Diving Hamster Shaggy dog story Milton H.
