what about shock collars my girlfreind bought a shock collar for my doberman to stop her from doin things she doesnt like examples are jumping on the couch furniture bed and other things this is all my stuff and it doesnt bother me at all i hated the idea from the start to get that collar so when she got it i was offshore and when i got home i put it on myself to see how bad it hurts i pushed to remote and it hurt like hell it even left two burn marks on my neck this cant just be a slight discomfort for my dog as the people at petco told us she uses that thing on my baby everytime i go offshore do you think i should destoy that thing or do yall think we should use it she only listens to me she says when im gone she says she is bad destroy it meaning bring it back it aint cheap the problem is not with the dog it is with your girlfriend she doesn't know how to properly dicipline or satisfy the dog dogs have different needs than people and chances are she is not exercising the dog or socializing it so the dog takes out it's frustration in other ways if your girlfriend would invest some time with the dog then the dog will most likely behave i'd say ditch the collar and ditch the girlfriend if she doesn't want to be a part of your dogs life then she doesn't fully want to be a part of yours also i've tried a friends shock collar on myself and it does hurt like hell and she had it set on level worse than a light socket Avenue Q Dog training Futurama (TV series - season 5) Milton H.
