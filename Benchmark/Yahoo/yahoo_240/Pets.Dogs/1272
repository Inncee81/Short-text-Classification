information about huskies before i get my husky i want to know how to care for it properly and ive started doing all my research what brushes should i use to brush him how often do i need to wash him do i need to trim his fur if yes when and how often someone said to feed it lots of fish as it need the oils to keep its fur and nails healthy is this true how often should i brush his teeth any other info sorry i no its a lot to ask but i want to know everything so he can have the best life possible x im very active so the need for them to always run is not a problem i see it as a benefit that way iwill always be doing exercise good for you for researching before your dog gets there huskies are bigtime shedders and 'blow' the season coat twice a year so you'll need not only a good brush but a excellent vaccum as well a good slicker brush works well and i've also heard raves about the furminator from other husky owners i recommend dyson vaccums for husky owners the advantages of having a double coated dog means you don't really have to wash the dogs the coats may get wet and muddy in bad weather terrain but they quickly dry off and the dirt sluffs right off i have huskies in my yard right now and have never had to bathe them they are just naturally some of the cleanest dogs out there i'm always having people ask about how i bathe my dogs and they're always shocked they're so clean without maintenance and i have white gray ones who always look pristine if not a little fuzzy you do not need to trim fur the natural shedding and blowing of the coat keeps the dog insulated from the elements shaving a husky exposes his skin to elements its not meant to and can result in nasty sunburns and dried cracked skin subject to infections fish oil is great for everyone and you shouldn't have to brush his teeth just give him some bones every once in a while and that is mother nature's way of keeping the dental tartar at bay search the net and you will find a whole lot of info on siberian huskies if its a puppy you're going to have to have a whole lot of patience time and energy huskies are just hellish the first yrs of their lives with their need for exercise company and stimulation and please remember to spay neuter your pet because we have 's of purebred huskies dying in our shelters for lack of homes every year best of luck Dog Domestic rabbit Cat Siberian Husky Keeshond Alaskan husky American Eskimo Dog Fancy rat Labrador Retriever Pet skunk Mixed-breed dog Iditarod Tooth Shetland Sheepdog Hamster Guinea pig Ferret First aid Plastic Havanese Manicure German Shepherd Dog Basset Hound Horseshoe Chinchilla Welsh Terrier Oral hygiene Alaskan Malamute Social rule Urinary incontinence RuneScape quests Eczema Skin Psoriasis Clothing Horse Knife Swimming Happy Tree Friends Golden Retriever Socialization Menstrual cup Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Certified Nursing Assistant Chinese Crested Dog Inuit Gray Wolf Halitosis Breastfeeding Brush Border Collie Chronic fatigue syndrome Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Collecting fossils Belgian Shepherd Dog Korea Jindo Dog Methamphetamine Dental caries Animal shelter Maltese (dog) Tattoo Dog agility Tick Great Dane Dog training Coat (dog) Ceramics Australian Cattle Dog Equine conformation Car washing techniques Hair Herpes simplex virus Prostate cancer Pottery Tiger Drill bit Manx (cat) Shampoo Microchip implant (animal) Japanese toilet Sphynx (cat) Sento German Shorthaired Pointer Hippeastrum Friction Veganism Yorkshire Terrier Working dog Housebreaking Comanche Tooth enamel Fecal incontinence Platypus Textile manufacturing Poodle
