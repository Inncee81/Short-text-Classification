how can i stop my neighbours dog from jumping into our garden he's only a puppy and he wants to play with our dog but he's got the hang of jumping over our gardens are attached together and i keep having to bring him round to their house they live next door he's done this times today and i don't know what to do about it my mum and our neighbour are best friends so we don't want to put up one of those wood or wire things on the fence he's been doing this yesterday also he knows how to get on the fence and jump in they've tryed to put the chairs by the fence where he jumps over but he's still a puppy so he can get through spaces but he's a bit big because he's mix between a boxer and something else sigh of course we want him and our dog to be friends it's the first time my dog hasn't attacked a male dog were thinking of letting him come over to our house for hour every day but the problem is we can't get him to stop jumping over what can we do to stop him from jumping into our garden he does this when someone is in the garden the thing that stands out to me is the remark about this being the first male dog that has not been attacked by your dog this it not likely to last once the puppy matures so i think you will have to try very hard to put a stop to this behaviour i agree with 'coffee and muffin girl ' that walking them together would be a good idea dogs do not like loud noises so you could try making a very loud noise every time he jumps over a loud clap whistle or even a shriek i really think this could work Shaggy dog story Dog training The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Milton H.
