does rent a pet sound like a good program the new rent a pet available on the west coast allows customers to rent out dogs in a certain period of time these dogs are adopted from shelter is this a lifesaver or something that traumatizes dogs i don't think this is such a good idea animals shouldn't be treated like property like a sofa or tv that you rent for a few weeks then give back they're social creatures and are going to get attached to the people they are with so it's heartbreak for the dog as well as the family when it's time to go back it's definitely going to lead to some traumatized dogs that will likely develop ridiculous behavior problems that will likely lead to abuse from some of their temporary owners not only is it heartbreak but dogs need consistency in a pack with rules constantly changing there is no way to actually train these dogs every owner will expect a different kind of behavior and it's just going to be a big mess and the dogs will suffer Dog training Dog Garfield Housebreaking Animal shelter Ferret German Shepherd Dog Theory of conduct Traumatic incident reduction Cat Property (ownership right) Socialization Domestic rabbit Pet Traumatic brain injury Social rule Estoppel Rescue group Domestication Obedience training Community emergency response team Dog agility Working dog Pet skunk Microchip implant (animal) Zoophilia Fancy rat Pet store Shaggy dog story American Eskimo Dog Ownership Gray Wolf Hamster The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Mixed-breed dog Leasehold estate Puppy mill Animal rights Contract Gender role Tom Petty Rabies Economic rent Border Terrier Schutzhund Altruism The Beach Boys Greyhound racing Extreme Programming The Pet Sounds Sessions Mutts Skunk Azumanga Daioh Labrador Retriever Inuit Animal euthanasia Shetland Sheepdog Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Trademark Property tax Guinea pig Stuttering Happiness Dobermann Herding dog Anxiety Insurance Working animal USS Sea Dog (SS-401) Culture American Pit Bull Terrier Theodicy Clinical depression Atomism Homelessness Narcissism Post-traumatic stress disorder Swimming Coercion Social psychology Anarcho-capitalism Pekingese Kodocha Chair Anarchism and capitalism EastEnders Weimaraner The Apprentice 2 Korea Jindo Dog Golden Retriever Brian Griffin Good Times Pit bull Capitalism Adult attention-deficit disorder People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Alcoholism Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Capital accumulation Public housing
