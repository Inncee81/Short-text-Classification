mince meat hi is it ok to add a little cooked mince meat to a month old puppies complete food i know you're not meant to add stuff but having trouble getting him to eat and want to tempt him no you shouldn't really give him mince at any age but what you could do is buy a sachet of dog meat and add about a third of the sachet to his food just to give it flavour but don't keep changing what you give him because you'll just make him think that he's getting a choice when you should be deciding what he eats and by doing this it makes him think that if he leaves the food that you will give him something else to eat remember if he is hungry he will eat the food you may find this cruel by keep giving him the same food but its teaching him that he has no choice but you can add different flavours to the food but don't change the dried mix do not give him tit bits other wise he'll keep coming back for more but you can give him a treat now and then but only if he's done something worth getting a treat for i e sitting staying but only on command not when he comes and sits at your feeds begging my german shepherd use to do that but we persisted on giving him the same food but eventually he gave in to hunger and he still eats the same food i hope this helps you the person above who has stated that eating grass is not good for the dog has actually made a false statement because at this time of year certain grass and plants create calcium at the very tips of the blade which is actually good for the dog rather than it being bad for the dog Cuisine of the Philippines Tofu Cuisine of Laos Dairy Cantonese cuisine Guinea pig Fecal incontinence Abstraction (computer science) Dumpling Bengali cuisine Healthy eating Dog Shaggy dog story Cuisine of Singapore Buddhist cuisine Hamburger Hamster Fish and chips Curry Food preservation Veganism Citric acid Peruvian cuisine Food Banana Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Chocolate RuneScape skills Livestock Dim sum Pot Noodle Garlic Cuisine of Thailand Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sausage Pork English grammar Stomach cancer Japanese tea ceremony Idli Food processing Fasting Pie Skinny Puppy John the Baptist The Amazing Race Restaurant Kangaroo Domesticated turkey Carnivorous plant Coriander Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Horse meat Hunger Weather lore Cat Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Japanese cuisine Aztec Omega-3 fatty acid Cheese Comanche Apple RuneScape quests Brown Bear Meat analogue Fancy rat Vegetarianism Oregano Hot dog Pysanka Mnemonic Meat Loaf Risotto Kashrut Black pepper Leaf Sugarcane Kodocha Halitosis Ramen Binge eating disorder Canary Sola fide Tea Ron and Fez Soup Social rule Satay Little Shop of Horrors Didache Cuisine of Vietnam
