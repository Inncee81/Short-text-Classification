thinking of getting a puppy next year see below my husband and i would like to get a puppy next year and we were thinking of getting a pug for those of you that have pugs what are the advantages and disadvantages of having a pug we also live out west where it is hot most of the time what is a good type of dog to get if we cant get a pug should we get a pure breed or a mutt what has been your experience pugs aren't very good pets when you live in an area where the weather's always hot their noses are kind of pushed in so it's harder for them to breathe especially in the heat they can get breathing problems in the future as well as heat stroke when they get too hot if your house is cool and you don't take it outside too often then a pug would be fine they're such couch potatoes lol pure breeds are most expensive but if you're looking for a small dog look up toy breeds like chihuahuas shih tzus toy poodles pomeranians yorkies ect Dog Mixed-breed dog Toy dog Pug Companion dog Yorkshire Terrier Housebreaking Dog breed Plastic Griffon Bruxellois Dog hybrids and crossbreeds Havanese Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Dog training Chihuahua (dog) Labrador Retriever Fancy rat Engine cooling Poodle hybrids Shetland Sheepdog Fusion power Pomeranian (dog) Greyhound Lisa the Vegetarian Shih Tzu Docking Dog breeding Pekingese Border Terrier Philosophy of language Puppy mill Equine conformation Hyperthermia Domestic rabbit Maltese (dog) American Eskimo Dog Pet store Belgian Shepherd Dog Chinese Crested Dog Border Collie Dobermann Bulldog Jet engine Stirling engine Internal combustion engine Miniature Fox Terrier Cat Hamster Solar power Japanese Chin German Shepherd Dog Socialization Two-stroke cycle American Kennel Club Pebble bed reactor Fire fighting Guinea pig Sauna Keeshond Kodocha Potato Bicycle brake systems Steam engine Strap-on dildo English Cocker Spaniel Spitz Dog agility Pleonasm Ferret Chinchilla Jack Russell Terrier Terrier The Cure Working animal Guide dog Turbocharger Dog show Lady and the Tramp Lady Bouvier's Lover Spacecraft propulsion The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Scuba set Livestock Swimming Coat (dog) Energy development Welding W.
