my dog is fixed but is he horny my yr old dog was fixed at months but lately his little pecker has been showing through is this because he is horny and if it is then is that possible without his balls i thought that is what took care of that problem or was getting him fixed just so he couldn't get a female pregnant butt he can still have sex the weather is hot out and believe it or not your dog's 'pecker' is hanging out to 'cool it' he's not 'horny' but you need to 'watch him' so he doesn't get 'dirt' on it and can't 'pull it in' once he's cooled off a bit it's just something all male dogs do when it's hot out whether they are 'fixed' or not Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle Dog Futurama (TV series - season 5) Jam (TV series) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Piccolo Junior Saga Lion Hot dog Shaggy dog story Eric Cartman Aquemini Red Hot Chili Peppers Gag (BDSM) Humphrey Bogart Jak II EastEnders Mule Brian Griffin Christina Aguilera StarCraft: Uprising Kodocha Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Neighbours Ed, Edd n Eddy Sauna Garfield Characters of Lost Drill bit Drawn Together Satchel Paige Pug Sento Jet engine Peter Griffin Jackass: The Movie Janet Jackson Toilet humour The Critic Proper Condom Use Dog training My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult Sun Dog show Domestic rabbit Jennifer Lopez Teen Girl Squad Sex and the City The Sims 2 Cool (song) Great Teacher Onizuka Social rule Iditarod Labrador Retriever The Smoking Room Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In Rail tracks Strap-on dildo Another Simpsons Clip Show Professional wrestling match types Abortion debate Lighting Cuckold Weebl and Bob Nine Inch Nails Opie and Anthony Meat Loaf The Ashlee Simpson Show Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Teacher's Pet (Disney) Hippeastrum Pok__mon Ruby and Sapphire The Hits/The B-Sides Charlie Brown Platypus Zoophilia Kangaroo Pit bull The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Joke Chef (South Park character) The Fairly OddParents Electrophysiology Thermostat Characters in the Smurfs Computer and video game genres MTV2 Emu Firefighter Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Vegeta Welding 2005 Iditarod Reservoir Dogs Vampire History of intersex surgery AVN Awards Steven Wright Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Internal ballistics "Weird Al" Yankovic
