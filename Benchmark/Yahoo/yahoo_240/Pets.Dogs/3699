how will my dog react to my new baby girl this is andrew im on my wife's account shes in the hospital with my new daughter heather im so excited anyway i have a maltese puppy who is around one year old i was wondering how will cocoa the puppy react to heather are malteses good with children cocoa has been good to other kids who have been to our house and such but will cocoa be jealous anything any behavior changes i can expect thanks in advance please dont be rude from what you've said you needn't worry too much since your dog is still young it is still learning its habits being introduced to your new baby girl at a younger age is definitely a benefit also since it gets along with other children well it already seems to have good social habits this makes it all the easier to introduce it to another child as stated earlier it would also be smart to bring home something of the baby's prior to bringing the baby home and let the dog sniff it out this way the new smell wont be too much of a surprise but rather somewhat familiar again i wouldn't anticipate too much of a problem make sure the dog isn't too hyper during the introduction so not to scare the baby and be sure to keep an eye on the two of them for the first couple of weeks even if their introduction goes well its best to be safe p s congrats on a new baby girl Humphrey Bogart Dog training AFI 100 Years series Dog Kodocha Breastfeeding Friends Neighbours Crate training Jennifer Lopez Housebreaking One Life to Live Younger versions of cartoon characters Lady and the Tramp Social rule EastEnders Marilyn Monroe Prisoner (TV series) Joke Ron and Fez Baby Blues Cat Melanie Wilkes Ginny Weasley Cocoa Knots Landing Ol' Dirty Bastard Dead Like Me Pitaten Days of our Lives Childbirth Eddie Guerrero Socialization Scooby-Doo Kim Possible Full House Characters in the Smurfs The Fairly OddParents About a Boy Jam (TV series) Infantilism Shaggy dog story Maltese (dog) Salad Fingers Comanche Rugrats All My Children Piccolo Junior Saga One Tree Hill (TV series) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Family from One End Street Sick Puppy Philosophy of language Peter Griffin Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Atomic Kitten Dean Koontz Hikikomori Havanese Situation comedy The Brady Bunch Kimberly-Clark Corporation Jon Secada Mac OS X Stuttering Garfield Psychiatric hospital Spot the Dog Alexander Technique Dog show The Flintstones Supergirl Brewery Chocolate American girl dolls Heathers Mystique (comics) Social Security (United States) Sharon Tate The Bag On Line Adventures Father's Day (Doctor Who) Beethoven (film) Bernard Williams Seven Brides for Seven Brothers Sonic the Hedgehog Feral child Generation Y Christmas Pride and Prejudice Peter Singer The Inside Hollyoaks The Death Gate Cycle Aquemini Dog agility Recurring South Park characters The Den (television) Fred West Animal testing God Emperor of Dune
