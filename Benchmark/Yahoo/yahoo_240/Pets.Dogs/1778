prey drive i have a year old male pit bull mix i've noticed that as he gets older he is developing a strong prey drive he is a gentle guy highly socialized and interacts well with dogs close to his size smaller dogs however send him into a frenzy i know that prey drive is natural in certain breeds but i was wondering if there is any way of breaking this sort of behavior he's not mean he's very social please don't answer the question if you have no idea what you're talking about again he is very well socialized and interacts perfectly with dogs his size children and adults small dogs like yorkies set him off i never let him off of his lead unless he is supervised in my fenced in yard i know the bad reputation of pit bulls and he is definately a fantastic example of all the good qualities of this breed i feel responsible for maintaining this standard of good behavior no there isn't you can mold it shape it guide it give it direction but you cannot break it to make it more convenient for you all dogs are born with prey drive it ensures that they will be able to survive by chasing prey and eating it in some dogs it's more exaggerated then in others try to re direct your dog's prey drive by playing fetch with balls frisbees anything he will chase good luck Gray Wolf Mixed-breed dog Obedience training Theory of conduct German Shepherd Dog Ecology Motivation Puma Lion Equine conformation Social rule Artificial selection Hamster Fox hunting American Pit Bull Terrier Ferret Philosophy of language Cat Ethics Leopard The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Narcissism Poker jargon Scientology beliefs and practices Asperger syndrome Child sexuality Dog training Alaskan Malamute Creatures in Bionicle Compact disc Xenomorph Abortion debate Pit bull Dog show Animal communication Falconry Dog agility Horse Brian Griffin Determinism Orca Species Inception of Darwin's theory Jack Russell Terrier Capercaillie Medieval hunting Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Internet troll Martial art Avenue Q Causality Autism Golden Retriever Hunting Working animal Casting Goodness and value theory Shark Property (ownership right) Ultimate (sport) Alignment (role-playing games) Island Fox Tasmanian Devil Border Terrier Domestication Crime prevention through environmental design Knife Extreme Programming Sociology Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Parachuting Supply and demand Shaggy dog story Beetle in an Anthill God Emperor of Dune Evil The Fairly OddParents Meaning of life Weight training CPU cache Economics Pitaten Cairn Terrier Italian Greyhound Education Microeconomics Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Guns, Germs, and Steel Manx (cat) Rain Man Ant Great White Shark Livestock Logic American Alligator Loudspeaker Sexual selection Stuttering
