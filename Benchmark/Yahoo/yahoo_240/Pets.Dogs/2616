do labradodles have to be groomed like poodles do if so does anyone know how often or how expensive it is i really want a labradoodle but my dad says they are too high maintence i guess i didn't explain correctly do they need to have their fur clipped and for all of you that are just telling me to adopt a dog how do you know i don't want to adopt a labradoodle you should seriously think these things through first i am a groomer and unbeknownst to the poor consumers that buy these hairy dogs they need to be brushed and combed on a daily basis and groomed every weeks breeders are not telling the unsuspecting public this and novice doodle owners are letting their dogs go ungroomed because of lack of education i just did a poor male goldendoodle who was over years old and never groomed because the owners didn't know he was matted beyond comprehension it took hours of working on him off and on in a day to remove the pelted coat it is horrific to see a dog in this condition but he is about the th i have done i now refuse to groom anymore doodle dogs without setting up a private consultation with the owners before booking the appointment i must see the dog and the condition it is in remember this is a combination coat a labrador retriever and a standard poodle coats differ based on the breeding some ldoodles can be wavy some have tight curls in conclusion your dad is absolutely correct these dogs are high maintenance but they have lovely personalities if you will be responsible for paying for grooming note that a groom every weeks with a dog's coat in good condition runs about and up the matted dog above cost over for the time and pain it took to remove the pelting from that poor dog i hope i have provided you with some food for thought Poodle Mixed-breed dog Labrador Retriever Portuguese Water Dog Ferret Havanese Guinea pig Golden Retriever German Shepherd Dog Domestic rabbit Dog training American Eskimo Dog Cat German Shorthaired Pointer Theory of conduct Pekingese Pet skunk Garfield Marriage Dog agility Jack Russell Terrier Extreme Programming Kerry Blue Terrier Airedale Terrier Publicly funded medicine Gray Wolf Laserdisc Dog show Poker jargon Health insurance Skye Terrier Docking Fur Shaggy dog story Guide dog The Apprentice 2 Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Livestock Fancy rat Homer Simpson Bulk vending Economics Hey Jude Obedience training Maltese (dog) "Weird Al" Yankovic Jennifer Lopez Microeconomics Dog hybrids and crossbreeds Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Nintendogs Life insurance Chinese Crested Dog A Course In Miracles Humphrey Bogart Natural monopoly Dobermann Alaskan husky Economic inequality Terri Schiavo Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Joke Wheel of Fortune Pretty Good Privacy GED Philosophy of language Cockapoo English Springer Spaniel Siberian Husky Father's Day (Doctor Who) Rabbit Manx (cat) Gross domestic product Hamster Great Dane Billboard Hot 100 Privatization FairTax Working dog Laika Past teachings of Prem Rawat Toy dog Estoppel America Online Social rule Yorkshire Terrier Rottweiler EastEnders Forrest Gump Komondor Avenue Q Supply and demand Papillon (dog) Bernese Mountain Dog Graduate school
