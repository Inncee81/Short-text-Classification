fighting dogs ahh i have two dogs ones oldish the other is younger they are both females but the younger one is constantly fighting with the older so weve had to keep them seperate any suggestions you being the alpha should in no way tolerate the fighting what you say goes period we had the same issue with our young border collie attempting to establish dominance over our older female eskie following the instructions of our obedience trainer i didn't allow this to occur at all she was addressed each time she tried i scruffed her lifted her off her front feet and shook firm but gently just as momma did to her when she was still with her litter as a means of discipline she soon learned that i was the alpha and didn't approve of her challenging the older female in our home basically you're the boss and your dogs need to understand and respect that for this to be effective Dog Dog training Horse Dog agility Gray Wolf The Smoking Room RISC German Shepherd Dog Second language acquisition Pack (canine) Milton H.
