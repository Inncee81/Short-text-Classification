pit bulls i am a animal lover what is the origin or the pit bull are they inherintly mean or just used and taken advantage of because of thier awsome power no they're not inherently mean some dogs of late have been trained and or bred to be meaner their heritage is as a fighting dog who fought for sport people would put them in a fighting pit of some sort and bet on the results often they fought other dogs but they also often fought a variety of animals including bulls bears badgers etc historically american pit bull terriers have always been excellent pets and companions i remember reading a story about how bulls would sometimes flip the dog flying into the air his owner would rush to catch him the dog never turned on his owner or anything they were always bred to be very loyal and very people centered dogs a bit of a graphic story but i think it does a lot to illustrate the heritage of this breed since animal fighting was outlawed like a century ago i think pit bulls have been bred to be much less dog aggressive certain bad breeders and owners have changed the character of some lines of the breed to not be people centric and people loving but that is the breed's heritage i've never met an unfriendly pit bull and i say hi to any dog wandering the streets i've let my dogs visit with many pit bulls i've never ever had a problem with a apbt i've never met a mean pit bull Pit bull American Pit Bull Terrier German Shepherd Dog Dog Jack Russell Terrier Staffordshire Bull Terrier Dachshund Ferret Working dog Terrier American Bulldog Domestic rabbit Breed-specific legislation Cockfight Mixed-breed dog Dobermann Breed standard Bull Terrier Cat Dog fighting Rat Terrier West Highland White Terrier Border Terrier Dog show Border Collie Boston Terrier Bullfighting Obedience training Labrador Retriever Whippet Docking Fox hunting Shetland Sheepdog Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier Badger American Kennel Club Livestock Companion dog Cattle Pet Keeshond Pekingese Havanese Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 Hybrid Welsh Terrier Bulldog Dog agility Krypto the Superdog Skye Terrier Toy dog Flyball Portuguese Water Dog Dog breed Dog breeding Australian Shepherd Gerald Durrell Irish Wolfhound Mastiff Domestication Weimaraner Puppy mill Pet skunk Toy Fox Terrier Monster Rancher monsters Kerry Blue Terrier Greyhound Poodle Maltese (dog) Breed registry Australian Cattle Dog Tenterfield Terrier Housebreaking Akita Inu Fancy rat Argentine Dogo Trapping Basset Hound English Springer Spaniel German Shorthaired Pointer Nintendogs Airedale Terrier Yorkshire Terrier Pet store Golden Retriever Spitz Selective breeding Indianapolis 500 Fox Terrier Belgian Shepherd Dog Manx (cat) Smooth Collie Alaskan husky Scooby-Doo Korea Jindo Dog Dog training The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex
