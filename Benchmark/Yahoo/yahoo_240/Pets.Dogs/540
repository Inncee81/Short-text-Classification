why do dogs bark dogs bark to say that there is something strange happening and to be alert in the wild the barking tells puppies to hide and calls the adults over for action at home our dog may bark at us or at a burglar the barking signals that something is happening once the new arrival has been identified either a greeting takes place or an attack a fearless dog that is intent on attacking is silent it doesn't waste time barking that is sounding the alarm it just rushes over and bites on the other hand a dog that wants to flee instead will also be silent as it runs away a more common occurrence is when a dog is not quite sure it is feeling a little fear while it thinks about attacking this dog will snarl and retract its lips to reveal its teeth it is the tinge of fear that converts the silent attack into a snarling one the urge to attack is still strong however so this is not a dog to be trifled with if the dog is more fearful it will alternate barking with growling if fear gains the upper hand the growling will stop replaced by loud barking until either the threatening situation goes away or reinforcements arrive apparently barking was improved during the process of domesticating the dog wolves bark but not as loudly as dogs although they can learn to bark more loudly if they live around domestic dogs it seems likely that humans bred the louder puppies to create better guard dogs all dogs bark except the basenji which was bred thousands of years ago as a silent hunting dog Dog Gray Wolf Dog training Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Basenji Skinny Puppy Housebreaking Cat Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Dingo Transformers: Cybertron Bark (dog) The Amber Spyglass Rottweiler Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Fox hunting Garfield Tasmanian Devil Domestication Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Death Gate Cycle Sin City Feral child Bad Wolf Battle of Bassorah Toilet humour Into the West (miniseries) Obedience training Sabretooth (comics) Socialization Futurama (TV series - season 5) Tenshinhan The Dalek Invasion of Earth Schutzhund Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Alaga__sia Equilibrium (2002 film) Carl Barks StarCraft: Uprising Breath of Fire III Paranoia Agent Force (Star Wars) Kim Possible Beethoven (film) Livestock Lion Finnish Spitz Animal communication Brown Bear Working dog Lady and the Tramp K' Kangaroo German Shepherd Dog Muslim ibn Aqeel Kakapo Children of Dune Sonic the Hedgehog Mixed-breed dog Coyote The Star Wars Holiday Special The Daleks' Master Plan Hearing impairment Pok__mon Live!
