can dogs see their own reflections i e mirrors i have tried many times to observe whether my dog would react when put infront of his own reflection and he seems to not even notice or care i am very curious as to whether dogs are able to actually visually absorb their own reflections or understand the concept of a mirror just wanted to say thanks to everyone who took the time to give sensible replies i dont see why they wouldn't be able to i am sure that they see and its all about intelligence one of my dogs is stupid and for a bit she would bark at herslef but my other dog isn't even fased by it so in short yes they see themselves but its how smart is you dog lol Humphrey Bogart Theory of conduct Philip J.
