please and thanx most useful info gets chosen as best answer and a star if so plzzzzz and thanx bye d good for you for getting to know the breed before you buy it you'll have a much happier life with your dog if you know what to look for however first things first if you decide to get a pomeranian understand that there is only one type of pom there is no such thing as a teacup pomeranian a miniature pomeranian a toy pomeranian or any other 'smaller' versions these dogs were given these labels to try and sell them to buyers for more when actually they're no different than normal pomeranians the smaller ones with these labels are because of two reasons the dog was the runt of the litter and could have health problems the dog's lines were very inbred to create such a small dog genetic defects cause the smaller size and obviously this not only gives the pom health problems but a shorter life second thing do not purchase from a pet store their dogs come from puppy mills cruel places where dogs are bred their entire lives and kept in a cage they can never be held or loved and many aren't even fed buying from a puppy store gives money to these very bad places and its a good goal to try and run them out of business if possible please try to adopt from a shelter there are millions of dogs out there who will be euthanized without your help if thats not possible please only adopt from a reputable breeder ask lots of questions and know all the answers you want don't let them talk you into it if you aren't sure anyway here is some information about the beautiful pomeranian

toys newborn pups are very tiny and fragile small females often need cesarean section deliveries pomeranians may be picky eaters but most tend to overeat and become fat some bloodlines are prone to slipped stifle dislocated patella knee cap heart and skin problems and eye infections since pomeranians are prone to early tooth loss feeding dry food is recommended to help keep teeth and gums in good condition be sure the veterinarian also keeps the dog's teeth clean keep the dog quiet in hot weather to avoid overheating the pomeranian is very popular so many inferior animals are bred to

approaching strangers is usually fine with other pets you may want a pomeranian if you don't want to deal with an extremely careful search to avoid all the nasty neurotic pomeranians the fragility of toy breeds very easy to step on them on accident or even crush them in they're hidden beneath a sofa accidents injuries and deaths are very common in toy breeds suspicious yappiness toward strangers when not socialized enough strong willed mind of his own requiring a confident owner who can take charge barking regular brushing and combing heavy shedding housebreaking difficulties a pomeranian may not be right for you in general they are very noisy dogs they're hard to train since they think they're dominant and can be fairly aggressive all the poms i've personally met are very snappy and a bit mean but i don't think all of them are like that with the right training you should have a good dog do not let it around children mostly young kids they aren't tolerant with most childish behaviors and will either bark growl or bite depending on your age the pom may or may not be right for you if you're younger and living with you parents and have younger siblings i wouldn't recommend it however if you're older perhaps its the one for you good luck with your search and let me know how things work out d Marching band English Springer Spaniel German Shorthaired Pointer Fast bowling Alaskan
