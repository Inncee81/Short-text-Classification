how do i get a dog this is my very first time so how do i donate it what do i have to do i ment adopt hehe sorry go to petfinder com there are many great dogs out there looking for a home most shelters require you to fill out an adoption application once you have found a dog met him her and been approved to adopt you will make a donation to the shelter each shelter generally has a specific amount for a donation some donations are as little as others can be as much as the amount of donation usually depends on whether or not the dog is spayed neutered if the dog is not spayed neutered then usually you must pay a deposit and schedule an appointment to have it spayed neutered it sounds like a lot of work but is very rewarding to adopt a dog and give them a home also it is a good idea to ask questions about the dog that you find the people at the shelter do not always have an answer but it never hurts to ask Cat Pet skunk Dog Domestic rabbit Contract Theory of conduct Ferret Vulgar Latin Feral cat Socialization Housebreaking Extreme Programming Pit bull Bulgarian language Kitten Rescue group Peter Singer Salvation Army Professor Sterilization (surgical procedure) The Apprentice 2 United Nations German grammar Flat tax Spanish pronouns Altruism Government of Maryland International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement Great Dane Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs George W.
