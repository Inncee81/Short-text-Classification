staffordshire bull terriers my fellas friend is getting rid of his staffie its due to a dominance issue a new baby and not properly introduced the dog is only two years old my question is can a staffie be a good pet for a family if its an adult dog i have three children and the youngest is three should i rethink getting this particular dog i'm not slating the breed as i realise its how you rear them that influences their behaviour but has the damage already been done with this two year old dog the dog hasnt bitten but has growled at the baby when its toddled near him hence the reason for getting rid olliedog it could be any breed that savages anybody its not a trait thats exclusive to staffies apparently the dog has dominance issues and believes its dominant over the small baby i dont have very small babies it sounds like his owner has been a twat with it and made him aggressive typical stereotype really but i need to know if a dog like this can be trained out of that thanks for all the great answers having the dog over at the weekend to see how he is obviously he wont be left alone with the children ever and the first sign of aggression he'll have to go back it depends on how much time and effort you can put into the dog and how your children react aswell if your looking after the dog for the weekend explain to your children some important rules not to bother the dog when he is sleeping or eating do not play rough boistrous games with him no teasing no mauling pulling of the dogs hair face paws etc you must supervise the dog with your children at all times and as your the responsible adult you will have to be vigilant on listening for the dogs warning growls if things start to get out of hand i would seek the help of a professional behaviourist on his behaviour if it continued generally if properly raised staff's make great family pets who are particulary devoted to children all the best Dog Pit bull Cat Gray Wolf Staffordshire Bull Terrier Garfield Social rule Jack Russell Terrier Mixed-breed dog Border Terrier Domestic rabbit Ferret Labrador Retriever Nintendogs American Pit Bull Terrier 2005 trial of Michael Jackson German Shepherd Dog Guinea pig Infantilism Autism Dog agility Rabies Kakapo Singlish Second language acquisition Chesapeake Bay Retriever God Emperor of Dune Philosophy of language Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Kodocha The Sims Toy dog Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Hearing impairment Feral child Chicken Scientology beliefs and practices Housebreaking Welsh Terrier Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier Species Transsexuality Animal communication West Highland White Terrier Terrier Italian Greyhound Human Shetland Sheepdog Weimaraner Shaggy dog story Xenomorph Ayyavazhi mythology Sin City Working dog Avenue Q National Football League Human sexual behavior Horse Biology and sexual orientation Siberian Husky Serial killer Dog show Abortion debate EastEnders Kender Jennifer Lopez Stuttering Azumanga Daioh Gay slang The Rutles Fancy rat Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Dobermann Rottweiler Motivation The Sims 2 Tasmanian Devil Airedale Terrier Property (ownership right) Our Gang Dilbert Sonic the Hedgehog Skye Terrier Volleyball Amiga Power Krypto the Superdog Baby Blues Mountain Gorilla Contract Salad Fingers Family Guy Prisoner's dilemma Breed-specific legislation Fox hunting Finnish Spitz
