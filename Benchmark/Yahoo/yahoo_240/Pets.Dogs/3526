do i have to put my german shepherd down sally appeared staving and terrified at our ranch about a year ago it took months before we could touch her without her cowering she's a beautiful rin tin tin look alike but like rinny she climbs fences of all kinds no problem really cos she loves us and climbs back in however we have toddlers on the east side of our ranch and she is aggressive towards them today she climbed out on the west side when a neighbor walked our property line with her jack russell and went after the little dog we have other dogs two golden boys and one part pyrenees whom sally adores as she does us it would break my heart to put her down you've brought up two unrelated issues so i'll address them separately i'm not a bleeding heart when it comes to these issues but i would try to line the top of your fence with an invisible fence system most german shepherds need a double fence if you want them to stay in your yard it sounds like your dog has weak nerves and is beat down on top of that because of that your dog should learn the fence boundaries quickly with minor compulsion seek expert advice on leerburg forum for specifics regarding the toddlers you need to determine what kind of aggression your dog displays avoidance is the easiest to deal with because you just always control the environment when the kids are around if you can manage to fix the yard problem then the kid problem is corrected too i highly doubt your dog views the kids as prey prey drive is pretty easy to differentiate from defense and avoidance a defensive dog backs away as it barks a dog that displays aggresive avoidance will put its hair up and pace it sounds like your dog is fearful in general and kids are a lot for some dogs to take loud energetic not always discerning etc there are ways to neutralize your dog to kids walks at the park where you never let anyone pet your dog but you have your dog practice long downs within sight of where kids are playing this will enforce that kids are not a threat and that you are in control which is a good feeling for a fearful dog eventually your dog will begin to ignore kids good luck German Shepherd Dog Baseball Poker jargon Dog training Obedience training RuneScape quests Pop punk Martial art Gray Wolf Marching band Glossary of American football Fencing The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex AFI 100 Years series Crime prevention through environmental design Mixed-breed dog Shaggy dog story Tobacco smoking Horse Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Sin City American football Fast bowling Our Gang Nintendogs Tag Saved by the Bell Yosemite National Park Stomach cancer Housebreaking Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) The Sims 2 New York Giants Chess strategy and tactics Garth Brooks Into the West (miniseries) Chess opening Mnemonic Beatmania IIDX Ed, Edd n Eddy The Death Gate Cycle International law and the Arab-Israeli conflict Vegeta X Window System The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Dobermann Garfield Equine conformation Downing Street memo Trademark Reservoir Dogs 21 July 2005 London bombings Volleyball The Isley Brothers Theory of conduct First Battle of the Atlantic Game show Rin Tin Tin The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Livestock Ty Cobb XML Mixed martial arts Stuttering Chess terminology German grammar Mathematics Schutzhund Hiking Microeconomics Unreal Guadalupe Mountains National Park Characters of Naruto Dualism (philosophy of mind) Social rule Second language acquisition Esperanto as an international language Kodocha Abortion debate The Amber Spyglass Harp C plus plus Batting (cricket) Anger management Plame affair Mattress Password Democracy Dog agility Dragon Booster Narcissism
