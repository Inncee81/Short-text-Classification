i have a rottie mo who always likes to bite my rottie pup has a tendency to always bite he gets all kinds of toys chew bones but he nips if he gets a chance he is always bitting at his leash when i take him for a walk i have tried all kinds of leashes but he is always bitting them as we walk he is only months old when he plays he bites i give him a toy and he pushes it to your arm till he can nip you has any one heard of this guy who can teach a dog not to bite in a hour or your money back he teaches aggressive dogs i don t want to put him down but i am afraid he will bite someone one day he is very strong now i have spent a lot of money on him and i am very close to him as he is with me also i am a senior so it makes it even harder for me to walk him as he walks me i have tried a gentle leader but he fights it till he gets it off he has a mind of his own he goes for training in sept or obedience training so if anyone has a rottie with these problems help thank you shirley i had a rott and they are awesome i didn't see you mention if this biting was in an agressive way by any chance towards your or strangers if it is i can't help you if it is not then like people have been saying here it is just teething my rott used to try to bite on our arms feet and toes if we let him but we would say no say get your toy or bone point to it and if he made no move we would pick it up for him until he got the hang of it eventually he stopped biting and just put his mouth on our arm if he was playing with us once and then even tho he didnt bite we would still always say no and he would stop as far as walking your dog i watch this show the dog whisperer the guy is a great trainer and he reccomends getting the choker collar and when you take him for a walk make sure you always walk in front of him showing you are dominant and hold him really close to your body and make sure his attention is always on you if not pull on the leash towards your body try to take him to a closed field where he can run alot and get tired that way he wont tug on you and wont be too crazy during his walks remember rottweilers need lots and lots of excercise once a day would be the least amount for him not to start digging or destroying things as a sign of stress a great tip for your rotty's coat is to give him boiled egg every week it will look so shiny people will think it's wet my rot always got many compliments on his coat even when he got sent off to a bigger place a farm the neighbor who lived on the other side of the street asked about him saying he was a beautiful dog if you want i can show you some pictures of him just send me and email to toxicangel yahoo com Dog Aerial (dance move) Dog agility Milton H.
