another agility question i have a year old boston terrier who i would love to get started on agility training the only thing is i know nothing about it i have no idea at what age you're supposed to start the training but i know she would have a blast she has a ton of energy is very fast agile lean playful flexible and i've never met a more intelligent dog in my life and that's not just my personal bias people are always amazed with how smart this dog is i talk to her like a human and she responds accordingly i would just love to be able to channel her engery and intelligence into something that would be fun for her and me as well don't get me wrong she gets plenty play time at home and i don't care about money prizes or trophies i'm asking because i really think she would love it so where should i start should i buy a book or is it too late she's old enough to start now rather than a book you're better to find classes in your area first of all it's better to have an experience instructor supervising if it's the first time you've trained agility to make sure you're doing it safely and correctly also the equipment is pretty expensive and heavy and takes up a lot of space so it's generally cheaper and easier to use the stuff at class until you're sure you enjoy it and then build buy some of your own have fun agility is a blast Dog agility Dog Social rule RuneScape quests Theory of conduct Game show Unreal RuneScape locations Diving Cruising (maritime) Alcoholics Anonymous Richard Feynman Extreme Programming Dog training Time Out of Mind W.
