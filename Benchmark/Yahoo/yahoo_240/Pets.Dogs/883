best way to get rid of skunk smell on my puppy two days ago my puppy was sprayed by a skunk early in the morning since we couldn't go up to a pet store to buy some skunk odor shampoo my sister found a website listing ingredients to make your own anti skunk smell for dogs we used it and it partially worked and gave him another bath later that day but it's his face that still smells two days later how can we get rid of it on his face i'm afraid of using skunk odor shampoo that we bought later in the day that close to his eyes because it might hurt him thank you please do not say tomato sauce that actually only covers up the odor it doesn't rid of it i live in the woods and have several labs and trust me they get sprayed often i too have tried using tomato sauce and even tried massingale douches which the douches work great however the best thing i have used that works is soaking them in vinegar water for about minutes i use cups vinegar to a tub of warm water for a pup you probably could use cups to a sink of water this is the safest and if it gets in the eyes its not harmful best of luck Cat Vinegar Ranma __ characters Pet skunk Tofu Hamster Ketchup Guinea pig Shaggy dog story Natt__ Hydrotherapy Dog Shampoo Spotted Skunk Barbecue Shark Cantonese cuisine Pasta Kitchen XML Roman eating and drinking Customs and etiquette of Japan Menstrual cup Fish and chips Perfume Sulfur Idli Acetic acid Characters of Naruto Rabies Douche Hamburger Sonic the Hedgehog Fancy rat Cuisine of the Philippines Cuisine of Denmark Psoriasis Tomato Curry Sauna Sake Hot dog Cheese Bradley Nowell Gaia Online Japanese cuisine Piccolo Junior Saga Ramen Clownfish Japanese toilet Hot sauce Happy Tree Friends Sauce Taikyoku shogi Dairy Mayonnaise Sushi Social rule American Eskimo Dog French fries Dandruff Diving Diseases of the honeybee World War Three (Doctor Who) Coriander Jackass: The Movie Apple Sin City Toilet humour Skunk works 101 Dalmatians: The Series Basil Joke Lutefisk Otitis externa Dog training Solvent Philip J.
