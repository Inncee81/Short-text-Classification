which dog food is better canidae or timberwolf organics hi i have a and a half months old siberian husky i'm feeding her canidae foods i thought of using nature's recipe food but it was not good for her and she was having diarrhea so i went back to canidae actually i was pretty happy with canidae it was just that nature's recipe was easier to find anyway i was looking at other foods and i found timberwolf organics i have never used that brand so i dont know how good is it i read about it and it seems pretty good but i wanted your opinion about which one is better canidae or timberwolf organics i appreciate all your help i think timberwolf is supposed to be a better food than canidae but you'll have to try it for yourself because every dog is different personally i think timberwolf is a lil out of my price range but then again i'm still a college student Canidae Dog food Dog Gray Wolf Raw food diet Theory of conduct Stomach cancer Iditarod Plastic Cat food Carnivora Chocolate Coyote 2005 Iditarod Fox Dog training Alaskan husky Hot dog 2000 Australian Grand Prix Organic food Internet troll Recipe Supply and demand Siberian Husky Diarrhea Salmon Food Sled dog Kodocha Overpopulation Bear Skunk Patent medicine RuneScape quests Nine Inch Nails Cuisine of Denmark Happiness GED Slow Food Organic farming Conditioning Potato Atomic Kitten Guinea pig Paranoia Agent Veganism Inflation Goodness and value theory Honey Hamster Pretty Good Privacy Competition Ramen Atkins Nutritional Approach Mushing Dhole Commodity Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Humphrey Bogart Chuck Jones University of Connecticut Economics Trans fat Brown Bear Domestic rabbit Mayonnaise Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Taboo food and drink Back to the land Potato chips Pasta Acorn Mid-levels John the Baptist Apex predator Domestication Price equation Coeliac disease Alaskan Malamute Fight Club Rocky Mountain spotted fever Bread Kitten Friedrich Schleiermacher Rice pudding Nicomachean Ethics The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening Domesticated turkey Bow Wow Sinfest Dog agility Dog intelligence Terri Schiavo British cuisine Rotavirus Little Britain Chili con carne Blue Whale
