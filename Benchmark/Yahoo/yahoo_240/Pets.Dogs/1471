i think my dog has a cold i have a sharpei and he is almost years old i think he has had a cold for days i first noticed this when i saw that when i took him outside he started sneazing non stop the whole way then i thought maybe this is just allergies i warned my brother who is the owner today in the morning i notice that leon is very down and his nose was really runny where there was drops on the ground they were clear though i came home from work and he had not eaten since the morning now it is and i think he had very little licks to his food because it wasnt as full as before but usually there is a hole in the food from his face or it is all eaten my brother got home and finally noticed that there was something wrong leon's vet is closed right now so is there anything we can do until tomorrow my brother said he is taking him early in the morning dogs do have allergies and they can get viruses just like us my best advice to you would be to make sure you keep him hydrated until morning if he was hungry he'd eat but at least he ate a little bit i think he'll be fine until morning good luck Common cold Piccolo Junior Saga Garfield Cat Coprophagia Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Hay fever Computer virus Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Ferret Dog training Fasting Resident Evil (film) Rocko's Modern Life The Dalek Invasion of Earth Tenshinhan Allergy Weather lore The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Breakfast Iditarod Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Dog Leon White 2000 Australian Grand Prix Lisa the Vegetarian Tasmanian Devil The Amazing Race John the Baptist Fancy rat Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Cuisine of Denmark Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Oh My Goddess!
