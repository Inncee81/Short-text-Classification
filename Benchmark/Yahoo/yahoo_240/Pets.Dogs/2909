my pit bull tears through everything does anyone know what type of toy is good for a powerful chewer i have boughten kongs and nylabones but my baby seems to rip through every toy he has within minutes of having it the kong was the black xxl one he just chewed the lumps right apart you are on the right track i have pitbulls so i have been there done that no toy except the galileo has been completely pitbull proof but these listed below are all safe and small amounts consumed will pass right thru and come out on the other end and my dogs don't always swallow the pieces a lot of the time i have to sweep vacuum them up for kongs the biggest black kong is the toughest but my pitbulls still can break pieces off this rubber passes thru them if they eat it don't even bother with the red or blue kongs for nylabones there are also many different materials types the non edible bones labeled durable are very tough to destroy my pits can eventually naw these down too but it takes forever get the largest size you can find should be atleast long go to target and they should be each there are atleast different shapes of the durable bone so you can get your puppy some variety the knot nylabone is another good choice it is overpriced at petstores around but you can get it at target for under my dogs love this bone the best and the toughest i've found the galileo nylabone virtually indestructible of all the toys this is one that they could not destroy but they don't sell them at target so you have to pay full price at the pet store around but this one will last the large tirebiter is also a good choice after a year or two my dogs have destroyed part of it but it is very tough also expensive around at petstore but it will last a long time they also have balls that are made of very hard plastic if you get one of those big balls w or w o rope going through it they can play with that and never chew through the plastic and a final idea get inexpensive rope toys each at target or albertson's my dogs destroy them eventually but they are good for dental health and my dogs don't consume much of the rope if any i just have to sweep vacuum up the pieces they tore off and for that price you can buy a bunch and replace them as needed the biggest thing to remember get the largest size of these tough toys the larger they are the harder to destroy pitbulls have ridiculously strong jaws but you can keep them busy with all these goodies good luck Bulk vending Mattress Hamster Dog Fancy rat Tooth Gramophone record RuneScape quests Sin City Tooth enamel Strap-on dildo My Little Pony Equine conformation Drill bit Nintendo Land mine American Pit Bull Terrier RuneScape economy Gross domestic product Scale model Naruto jutsu Floppy disk Peanut Dairy Computer Terminal ballistics Lionel Corporation Dog training Textile manufacturing YuYu Hakusho RuneScape locations Items in the Metroid series EastEnders Phonograph cylinder Hard disk Coffee Care Bears Combine (Half-Life 2) Sears Holdings Corporation Livestock Ceramics Casting The Beach Boys O scale Unreal Textile manufacturing terminology Glass Upholstery The Amazing Race Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 Professional wrestling slang Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Campfire Laserdisc Skateboard One Piece minor characters Chewing gum Billboard Hot 100 Leather Rigging Welding Rope Wood Toy Babe Ruth Kodocha Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Poker jargon Deflation (economics) Dog agility Nunchaku Shark Blood (computer game) Diamond Tenshinhan Light-emitting diode Milk Dental brace Katamari Damacy ECW One Night Stand Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Firefighter MapleStory Compact audio cassette Solar cell Domestic AC power plugs and sockets The Adventures of Pete & Pete RuneScape weapons Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
