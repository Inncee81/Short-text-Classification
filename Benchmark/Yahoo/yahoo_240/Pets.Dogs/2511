i went and chose out a german shepherd from an animal shelter only thing is that it had to get neutered tomorrow so i had to leave him for an extra day my question is for anyone who owns a german shepherd how is the relationship between you and your dog what are some problems relating to a german shepherd and was it worth getting it thanks edit oh and the german shepherd is months old male i raise show and breed shepherds and i can't think of a better dog i love my shepherds each and every one of them male shepherds and this is a general statement tend to be very sensitive to voice my males can usually tell at a very early age when i'm getting annoyed and when enough is enough they go out of their way to please i'm not saying they can't be stubborn because they can but very voice sensitive more so than the females again general statement i don't think they are as bright as other people think they are but once trained they are very good at behaving i love the females too but they tend to talk bark more and are slightly more territorial at a younger age and have more issues sharing than the males once a male is an adult he may become territorial but since yours is getting fixed early that shouldn't be an issue i love the carefree devil may care attitude of the females but the sensitivity of the males wins my heart every time i do not feed my puppies puppy food they eat adult food from the start because if they gain weight too quickly it can put too much stress on the bones usually the first months or so i use canidae all life stages and then after months will start switching out their food every couple of bags they will still get the canidae but also timberwolf organics innova red meat and solid gold barking at the moon all high in protein which your boy will need don't be surprised if he remains puppy like for a few years shepherds are slow to mature it's part of what makes them cute also shepherds do suffer a great deal from separation anxiety and sometimes it can be hard on your house they may chew tear things up etc however once he understands it's his job to guard the house will be safe also they are wonderful with other dogs teach your pup at a young age that food can be given and taken away and teach him to allow you to take treats out of his mouth and make him practice it with someone else so there is no food aggression make sure to watch his weight you don't want the dog to be too heavy oh and they love to play ball but get one of those throwers because the amount of slobber is disgusting good luck you have the best dog in the world Dog training Domestic rabbit Guinea pig Gray Wolf Hamster Cat Mixed-breed dog German Shepherd Dog Housebreaking Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Fancy rat Garfield Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Livestock Anorexia nervosa Social rule Pet skunk Belgian Shepherd Dog Kodocha Puberty Infantilism Socialization Golden Retriever Breastfeeding Mountain Gorilla Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Chicken Puppy mill Tooth Singlish Hypoglycemia Nerpa Dog agility Theory of conduct Kitten Animal rights Vegetarianism Havanese Atkins Nutritional Approach Characters in the Smurfs Kangaroo Dog food EastEnders Stomach cancer The Amazing Race Nintendogs Humphrey Bogart Book of Isaiah Androgen insensitivity syndrome Basset Hound Docking Episodes of Lost (Season 1) House Mouse Scooby-Doo Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Polyamory Tasmanian Devil Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Dog show Labrador Retriever Fecal incontinence Shaggy dog story Diabetes mellitus Care Bears Pitaten Coyote Shetland Sheepdog The Smoking Room Schutzhund Weight training Stuttering Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Clinical depression Equine conformation Physical attractiveness Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Tobacco smoking Kakapo Tlingit Norway national football team American Eskimo Dog Milton H.
