my neighbor got arrested and her family left their dog behind its a pure breed cocker spaniel she is registered and everything we decided to keep her so my question is how can we get ahold of the papers saying shes registered without confronting the family and about licensing her she doesnt have a collar or anything so i dont know if she was licensed how do i go about getting that im not even sure what i need to do so basically this dog is registered for being purebreed and i want to make it official that im her owner how do i go about doing this just keep the dog without the papers you actually did this wrong in the legal sense the ac would have come and taken the dog then gone through court to get ownership then sold the dog shelters love to make money from purebreds but you don't know if they would have sold it to you so here is your problem if you go to the vet and he checks for a microchip that says this dog belongs to jane smith then you have to explain why you have jane smith's dog in my opinion i would keep the dog go to the vet and tell tell the truth in a nonconfrontational way i got the dog from my neighbors they didn't want the dog anymore that's the truth and it's all the info they need get the dog her shots and have the tag put in my name if the original owner comes back demanding the dog then you found it running alone i doubt they will though because they don't care about it anyway and if you take the advice to give the dog to the aspca or rspca chances are you will not get it back and if you do it will cost you a small fortune that is just a bad idea in my opinion they are not trustworthy there are some licensing clubs that do it with affidavit and pictures kennel clubs of any kind are really just a human creation just a brand name so in the true sense none of them are more valuable than any other they mean nothing a dog is a dog is a dog i don't know which ones do the picture thing but i heard some kids talking about it at the dog show this summer they sent in pictures and affidavits saying that the dog was a whatever and they got some club certificate with their dogs name and breed on it i mean most kennel clubs are just idiots sitting on computers making up pretty documents for a pop anyway if you can find one of those clubs you might be able to get the dog registered with it it's just a generic brandname but if it makes you happy so be it Dog Golden Retriever Mixed-breed dog Pet skunk Microchip implant (animal) Public domain Dog show American Kennel Club Dog agility Pretty Good Privacy Theory of conduct SCO-Linux controversies 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Breed registry English Cocker Spaniel Obedience training Selective breeding Jennifer Lopez Dog breed Toy dog Docking Dog breeding German Shepherd Dog Notary public Crufts Appeal EastEnders Discordianism Copyleft Trademark Intellectual property GNU General Public License American Cocker Spaniel Alaskan husky Jon Secada Shaggy dog story Avenue Q Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Dog training Jack Russell Terrier Iditarod Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Laura Schlessinger United Kennel Club Goodness and value theory Maltese (dog) Animal rights Game show Neighbours Border Collie 2004 U.S. election voting controversies, Ohio Ferret Plame affair Hey Jude American Pit Bull Terrier Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Keeshond Fahrenheit 9/11 Meaning of life Philosophical skepticism Humphrey Bogart Fox hunting Working dog Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Theodicy Married... with Children Epistemology Logic Cat USA Network Property (ownership right) The Lovely Bones Timeline of the 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities Siberian Husky Common criticisms of Microsoft Billboard Hot 100 English Springer Spaniel Contract Shetland Sheepdog Philosophy of language Rush Limbaugh Microsoft Fair use Belgian Shepherd Dog Punisher AFI 100 Years series Columbine High School massacre Cable television Law of value ISO 9000 Cliff Richard
