can a year old dog still be neutered i have had my dog since i was years old my parents didn't know much about dogs and he was given to us because he had nowhere else to go we have done all the shots and everything but we never knew about neutering i need to know if i can still go to get him neutered and how much it would cost it depends on your dog's breed he might be too old but you should ask a vet what they think you can get him neutered by a vet or there are mobile spay and neuter clinics in a lot of towns sometimes the shelter does it too for a reduced rate the cost depends on where you live in my area it's for a vet to do it and keep him overnight afterwards but the shelter only charges so there's a big range definitely call around to check prices at vets and the shelter etc before you choose where to go Pet skunk Cat Dog Ferret Domestic rabbit The Price Is Right Feral cat Sterilization (surgical procedure) Animal shelter Socialization Shrek 2 Public transport Education in Australia Euro Microchip implant (animal) Housebreaking Pit bull Kitten Guinea pig Castration Dog breed Microeconomics Randomness Garfield Great Dane Punisher Animal euthanasia Manx (cat) European Rabbit Mixed-breed dog Veterinarian Dog breeding Docking UK telephone numbering plan Petroleum Border Collie Credit card Bulgarian language Rhodesian Ridgeback Kakapo Medicare (Canada) Publicly funded medicine CPU cache Telephone numbering plan North American Numbering Plan Solar cell Flat tax Natural monopoly Virgin Mobile Soham murders Free trade Digital photography Wal-Mart Bob Barker United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East Grammatical gender Coffee M16 (rifle) Education in the United States Airport A Star is Torn Labor theory of value Spanish nouns Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Inflation Adoption Value added tax Insulin EastEnders Paintball Equine conformation Article (grammar) Fusion power Battery electric vehicle Danish language Mutual fund Octopus card Insurance Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Snoop Dogg Golden Retriever RuneScape weapons GunBound Upanishad German language Filling station Spanish pronouns Dog agility Life expectancy Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Chernobyl accident University of Minnesota Rescue group Subsidy South Park Food Stamp Program Compiler optimization Overpopulation Selective breeding Breed registry
