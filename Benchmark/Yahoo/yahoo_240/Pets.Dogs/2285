does anyone else have a problem with their little dogs getting into the bathroom trash and eating their used tampons pads it's really gross and it's happened to me a couple times once with a daschuand sp and then a pomerian chihuahua is this a thing with small dogs because i've never had problems with a big medium sized dog before and why in the world do they eat them when i was i had my you know and my friend's dog huge lassie dog went into the trash and got my pad dragged it on the the stairs and proceeded to eat it so yes all dogs of all sizes do this it's mortifying especially at that age because her mom found the dog and screamed for my friend to deal with it the easiest way of dealing with this is simply to put the trash under the sink in the cabinet if you don't have a cabinet many times those little trash cans with lids work wonders if that doesn't work emptying the trash on a very regular basis during those times or simply always keeping hte bathroom door shut works so far i don't know why our dogs only eat go for the trash where there are tissues in there not when t here are ahem other things i am waiting for the day when they discover something i think they would call a treat it's bloody it smells probably fabulous to them and i would say you would be very hard pressed to train them not to find something of this smell caliber Shaggy dog story Menstrual cup Futurama (TV series - season 2) Tampon The Shining (film) Sin City Kitchen The Fairly OddParents Dustbin Garfield Philosophy of language Floppy disk The Star Wars Holiday Special Dutch Schultz Joke Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Dog training Mouse (computing) Rocko's Modern Life Hamster Escape from New York AFI 100 Years series Brian Griffin Japanese toilet Futurama (TV series - season 5) RuneScape quests Richard Chase Invader Zim Piccolo Junior Saga Social rule The Inside Jackass: The Movie Textile manufacturing Homer Simpson The Brady Bunch Toilet Treehouse of Horror V The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Bloody Stupid Johnson Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Ocean's Twelve Trapped in the Closet Macintosh Finder Philip J.
