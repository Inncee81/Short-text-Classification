any tips for letting a pup know he is not the boss of the household hi my week old shiba inu pup is beginning to think he is boss generally it is just a mouthing problem which i am currently dealing with but during his 'mad half hours' he is barking at growling at family members and the more he is told of the more he barks i have had advice frrom the breeder and i had researched the breed before i decided on him but unfortunately i have yet to find a method which has proved to be effective if anyone has any ideas then please do let me know thanks rush out now and buy the jan fennell books or dvd basically you have to not shout as to the pup that is communication the pup can't tell the difference between being shouted at and you being nice to it do not at any time give eye to eye contact as that is communication as well ignore the bad behaviour and praise the good stick and carrot metaphorically jan fennell's method is based on the fact that inside every dog from a chihuahua to a great dane is a wolf she watched the behaviour of wolf packs and came up with her system the alpha wolf ignores his pack until it suits him he eats first let him see you have a biscuit or something before he is fed go through doorways first ignore him for the first minutes when you come in eventually the penny will drop i highly recommend jan fennell's methods though Gray Wolf Dog Guinea pig Dog training Taikyoku shogi Hamster Cat Nintendogs Shark Shaggy dog story Poker jargon Rocko's Modern Life Housebreaking Great Dane Extreme Programming Domestication Futurama (TV series - season 5) Coyote The Parting of the Ways Pack (canine) Scooby-Doo Economics Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Theory of conduct Transactional analysis RuneScape quests The Inside Alaskan Malamute Electrophysiology Rose (Doctor Who) Resident Evil: Apocalypse InuYasha Akita Inu The Star Wars Holiday Special Microeconomics Toilet humour Time travel Mad Money G-Man (Half-Life) Fox Pet skunk Orca Chocolate Sydney Riot of 1879 Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Shiba Inu Alex Ferguson Ron and Fez Garfield Little Britain Earless seal Golden Retriever Tasmanian Devil Escape from New York Chicken EastEnders Bad Wolf Dingo Francis Crick Psychology Drawn Together Monster Rancher monsters Dachshund Kodocha Ethics Windows Vista Inspector Gadget Oplan Bojinka Law of value Charles Darwin's views on religion Social rule Tai shogi Tag Milton H.
