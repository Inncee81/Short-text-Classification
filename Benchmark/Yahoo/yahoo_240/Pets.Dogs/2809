real breeders on here on all these websites you see we cannot take you into our kennels in case you are transmitting disease to me this screams our kennels are in awful shape and if you saw them you would never buy from us am i right to feel this way do you let people buying dogs see inside your kennels what would you do if someone wouldn't buy without seeing inside pictures video would you do it would you respect the person for wanting to be sure the parent dogs are well treated see dp that i understand you have rules people meet the rules they can do it it's the people who never let anyone see the kennels that scare me i'm not looking to buy a dog for years now maybe a welsh terrier down the line i have a shelter mutt and love him to pieces i was just curious as someone online said a friend of their mom's breeds dogs and they always meet at the airport sooo sketch animal artwork i would wear gloves and a mask if a breeder asked me to i completely respect breeders like you i just hate realizing more and more that all these websites are puppymills we don't use a kennel all our dogs live in the house with us but i still won't let you come and play with the puppies til they are at least weeks of age and they have had their first shots and you promise me that you are coming here only and not going kennel hopping if you are going to other kennels first then you can't come here i won't risk my dogs getting something from someone else's kennel just so you can see the puppies once they have had their first shot or even if we have no puppies you don't go anywhere else and you come here first then feel free to come and meet all our dogs you have read about enough people on here bringing home their puppy and he has parvo you think a breeder wants to risk that the puppies are normally sold before they are born so those puppies i am raising while they are mine they also belong to other people as well i don't want to risk the puppies developing parvo and then i have to call each person who has given me a deposit to tell them hey look i was a real idiot and allowed people to come and see the puppies before they were vaccinated they all got sick and well uhmmm sorry your puppy is dead so if you want to think things look bad or whatever think away i would rather someone think someone negative than to risk the litter that i worked so hard to produce just cause you have a need to want to see the puppies before they are protected somewhat or because you are out on a sunday drive and looking for something to do edit oh well people that won't let you ever see the puppies or meet the parents go home fast there is no reason why after a certain point you can't go meet the puppies no reason at all why you can't meet the parents i mean i don't want people dropping in without calling cause i might have finally fallen asleep after being awake for days straight or am eating dinner but call and tell me you are on your way and come on in and meet the dogs if someone won't allow you to see the kennels or meet the dogs then there is definately a huge problem Dog Breed registry Mixed-breed dog Shaggy dog story Dog show Docking Dobermann Labrador Retriever Pet skunk Humphrey Bogart Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dog training Puppy mill Dog agility Dog breed Scooby-Doo Jack Russell Terrier Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show Nintendogs Domestic rabbit American Pit Bull Terrier Breed standard Theory of conduct Livestock Jon Secada Border Collie Sin City Knots Landing Poker jargon United Kennel Club Surveillance Something Awful Shetland Sheepdog Animal Farm Tenterfield Terrier Hamster RuneScape quests One Tree Hill (TV series) Golden Retriever Havanese Garfield Delta Goodrem Jennifer Lopez Obedience training Fox hunting Belgian Shepherd Dog Cat Marilyn Monroe The Emancipation of Mimi Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Amazing Race Guinea pig The Ashlee Simpson Show Lady and the Tramp Billboard Hot 100 Kodocha Sick Puppy The Death Gate Cycle The Catcher in the Rye Selective breeding Australian Silky Terrier Housebreaking Scenes from a Memory Hard disk Pet store Staffordshire Bull Terrier Our Gang Deflation (economics) Jam (TV series) Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Whippet Sharon Tate Socialization The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Rocko's Modern Life The Marshall Mathers LP Monster Rancher monsters Crufts Characters in the Smurfs The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Steven Wright Ren and Stimpy The Best Page in the Universe Great Teacher Onizuka Mutts Blood on the Tracks My Little Pony
