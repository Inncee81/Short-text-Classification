why does my dog examine everything that i give her to eat i have jack russell terriers both fixed the male will gobble up everything that i give him treats food whatever he also wants anything that i'm eating if i eat it he will eat it the female dog on the other hand will take the treat and drop it on the floor and sniff and examine sometimes for up to minutes she's a good eater twice a day after she sniffs and examines her bowl the male inhales the food not the aroma why do you think that she does this it's really not a problem i'm just trying to understand this behavior btw he's and she's and she's always been this way my female dog does a similar thing with treats she loves her food bowl but if you give her a treat or something she takes it carries it to a hiding spot and sniffs it for a while before she eats it i've always thought of it as just her own personal form of food guarding or food aggression she likes to protect her foodstuffs and by smelling and examining them maybe it makes her feel safer i'm no doggy psychologist but i figure it's just kinda like dog ocd either that or she is familiar with her dog food and so she'll eat that normally but treats she doesn't know or that don't have as strong a smell she has to inspect first Dog Obsessive-compulsive disorder Cat Dog training Magical thinking Binge eating disorder Philosophy of language Fecal incontinence Jack Russell Terrier Domestic rabbit American lobster Anorexia nervosa Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Guinea pig RuneScape skills Coconut crab Japanese tea ceremony Hamster Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Hot dog Kakapo Trailer Park Boys Tag Theory of conduct Hazing Physical attractiveness Fancy rat Social rule Shit Goodness and value theory Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Animal testing Elephant Vomiting Time Out of Mind Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) David Hume Kodocha Brian Griffin Debugging Psychotherapy American football Sexual orientation Ayyavazhi religious practices Spider Childbirth Cannabis (drug) Beagle English grammar Mojave people Keeshond Characters of Naruto "Weird Al" Yankovic RuneScape quests Psychoanalysis Bat Bird Fast-food restaurant Poker jargon Common cold Animal communication Garfield Lisa the Vegetarian Folic acid Joke Housebreaking Customs and etiquette of Japan Food Psychology Atomism Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Characters in the Smurfs The nature of God in Western theology Zoophilia Pet skunk Sonic the Hedgehog Traumatic brain injury Tofu Epistemology Dominoes Unconscious mind Monogamy Stomach cancer The Adventures of Pete & Pete Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Polyamory Invader Zim Honeybee Sexual intercourse The Legend of Zelda series enemies Economics Columbine High School massacre Ethics Humphrey Bogart Sexual attraction Hypnosis Brown Bear Idolatry Blonde on Blonde
