are worming tablets a treatment to kill worms or just a preventative measure in the last two days my dog appears to have developed the symptoms of worms his backside is a little red and sore and he is sniffing it there is clearly an irritation there for him apart from this he is on form eating and drinking normally and playing as usual eyes are bright and nose is cold i have today given him his worming tablet which was ironically due to be given end of july but now i am wondering if this will kill any worms present or not i am currently not in the uk with him and have little experience or confidence of the vets here so would really appreciate advice from anyone who has experienced similar problems i have never heard of a preventative worming tablet for intestinal worms usually when a dog has intestinal worms they get a deworming medicine that kills the existing worms and their eggs there is a monthly preventative for heartworms but that is a completely separate thing and would not cause your dog to have rear end problems it is not a good idea to give your dog over the counter medication if you aren't sure what's wrong with him clean his rear and make sure it isn't just irritation from a stuck piece o' poo if it doesn't go away gets worse or he starts really chewing or licking at it a lot and is in obvious discomfort take him to the vet it could be worms or it could be infected anal glands either way you should see the vet obviously if you see live worms in your dog's feces or vomit you should take him and the worms to the vet for a proper deworming medicine Pet skunk Diarrhea Heartworm Ulcerative colitis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Ascariasis Common cold Trichinosis Fancy rat Cat Fecal incontinence Stomach cancer Crohn's disease Allergy Insulin Garfield Malaria Conjunctivitis Cysticercosis Cancer Hypoglycemia Psoriasis Guinea pig Snake Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Medicine Constipation Traumatic brain injury Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Chicken Radiation poisoning Irritable bowel syndrome Coeliac disease Coprophagia Equine conformation Diphyllobothriasis Urinary incontinence Herpes simplex virus Homeopathy Rabies Domestic rabbit Traumatic incident reduction Spyware Asthma Kenny McCormick Computer virus Myxobolus cerebralis Windows XP Chronic fatigue syndrome Breastfeeding Migraine Dog Escherichia coli O157:H7 Traditional Chinese medicine Anus Multiple sclerosis Dracunculiasis AIDS Paracetamol Baylisascaris Ferret Hemorrhoid Prostate cancer Cirrhosis Hookworm Foodborne illness Radiation therapy Hymenolepiasis Gray Wolf Tobacco smoking H5N1 Methamphetamine Colorectal cancer Ebola Babe Ruth Milton H.
