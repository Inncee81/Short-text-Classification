puppies how long do they have to be separated my husband and i just bought month old cocker spaniels litter mates a lot of people advice against buying at the same time other say it shouldn't be a problem so long you know what you are doing we started having them in crates next to each other and having playtime together they are getting way too rough with each other though and are distracted from bonding with us focusing on us to learn we are the alpha's today i separated the crates and they are howling and barking quite excessively we are trying to ignore it my husband thought it might help if he takes one of them to the office during the week is this a good idea we also heard that they have to be raised basically all separate until they are about and a half years old separate walks play time etc does it really take that long anything else we can do that might help they are really having separation anxiety right now big time especially the female she gets all shaky and scared in her crate no they do not have to be raised separately but they do each need alone time with each of you fantastic idea for your husband to take one of them to the office during the week rotate which one take them each to separate puppy kindergarten classes you can do things together with them just be insistant that not all time is puppy playmate time let them play together for a bit and then have some worktime training either alone or together i have littermates and another puppy that is a month older right now yes i am insane pups who are mos old i let them have some runtime in the morning then do a few minutes of group sits and downs then set out to play and work with the third for min and rotate them then they get breakfast so they are darn hungry and willing to pay attention to me to earn cookies innova evo while training Dog training Dog Housebreaking Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Avenue Q English Cocker Spaniel Lady and the Tramp Skinny Puppy Guinea pig Carl Barks Dairy Shaggy dog story Gray Wolf 101 Dalmatians: The Series Crate training American Cocker Spaniel Ron and Fez Socialization English Springer Spaniel Nerpa Education in Germany The Chemical Brothers Plame affair Hamster Mutual fund Nintendogs Scooby-Doo Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Hiberno-English Blood on the Tracks Babe Ruth Social rule Education in Romania Capital accumulation Gerald Durrell Puppy mill The Apprentice 2 Shetland Sheepdog Breastfeeding Boy Scouts of America Spot the Dog Tire Milton H.
