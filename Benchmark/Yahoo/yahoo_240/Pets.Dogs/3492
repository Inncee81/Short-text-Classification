looking for a small or med size dog that does well with young children any suggestions i was thinking of looking at shelters i have been doing lots of research on breeds i know labs are wonderful i grew up with four of them but i know they are so hiper and large anyone that has a family and has some insight to what breed or mix breed is good will be appreciated running a shelter i always suggest these for med to small mixes and pure breeds poodle crosses if you have small kids do not get the toy poodles or there tiny mixes toy dogs or very small dogs and kids dont mix well since kids treat them like toys and not dogs they tend to get nippy beagles and there subsequent mixes though you need to be aware of there hunting instict they are hounds and will follow a scent for miles before the realize they ran away from home spaniel mixes spaniel labs are usually smaller good mixes but very active no dog is hyper i say they are active and need lots of exercise stay mostly away from purebred spaniels in shelters unless you are very familar with dog training and dog behavioral issues then purebred spaniels can have lots of problems examples springers and cockers are prone to rage issues ear issues allergies and eye problems that can be complicated with small children they tend to have droopy ears that are irresitable to little kids and a bite waiting to happen sheltie mixes are good also if you are not an active family that can devote time and energy to a active dog then stay away from herding breeds suchs as australian sheps border collies blue heelers old english sheepdogs or others of this type terriers are not a good pick for a first time dog owner or for someone who doesnt know the characteristics of terriers if you are not ready for a learning experiance then i would stay away from terriers and there mixes they make great dogs but you have to know how to handle dogs well especially if you are going for an older terrier hope that helps some answers i am a poundmaster in recent studies and insurance claim reports more small dogs bite than any other the only issue is they do less damage and are not reported as often as big dog bites smaller dogs are more numerous since they are in higher demand and less attention is paid to behavior and more to making money in my proffesion i much rather go and deal with large dogs over one neurotic little ankle shark i am honest about my animals and the majority of dogs in a shelter have one or more behavioral issues not there faults bad ownership and uneducated people make them this way i am as honest as it gets when trying to match the right dog with the right family Shetland Sheepdog English Springer Spaniel Toy dog Obedience training Jack Russell Terrier Working dog Cat Spaniel Golden Retriever Dog agility Border Terrier Poodle Horse American Pit Bull Terrier Miniature Fox Terrier Ferret Labrador Retriever Australian Shepherd Hamster German Shepherd Dog Alaskan husky Griffon Bruxellois Yorkshire Terrier English Cocker Spaniel Companion dog Rat Terrier Gray Wolf Fox hunting Pit bull Herding dog Spitz Animal Liberation Front Domestic rabbit Beagle Boston Terrier Autism Dog hybrids and crossbreeds Keeshond Controversies in autism Pet skunk Psychoanalysis Airedale Terrier American Cocker Spaniel Breed standard West Highland White Terrier Kerry Blue Terrier Smooth Collie Basset Hound Terrier Dachshund Roan (color) Whippet Havanese Charles Darwin's illness Poodle hybrids Welsh Terrier Housebreaking Scientology beliefs and practices Chronic fatigue syndrome Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier Greyhound Dog show Staffordshire Bull Terrier Psychology Health insurance Equine conformation Shark Bull Terrier Human sexual behavior Skye Terrier Fox Terrier CPU design Species Hunting Cairn Terrier M16 (rifle) Schutzhund CPU cache Domestic violence Prostate cancer Maltese (dog) Illegal drug trade Care Bears Tenterfield Terrier Scent hound
