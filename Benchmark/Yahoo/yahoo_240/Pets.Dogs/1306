can you recommend a good large breed puppy food hey everyone i could really use some good opinions on this i'm looking into getting another german shepherd puppy soon and i started thinking about what food i should use this time with my other gsd i used nutro natural choice because that's what the vet recommended but i wasn't very impressed with it it must have tasted terrible to her because she'd barely eat it and when i switched food she couldn't get enough the same thing happened with my friend's great dane i've asked around and gotten mixed opinions a vet recommended eukanuba and a breeder told me never to use it i don't know who to believe so i was just wondering what you fed your large breed puppies and or which ones you'd recommend and why thanks a lot i guess i wasn't really specific i'm looking for a premium or all natural puppy chow i don't mind having to pay more for better quality and about the canidae is it really good for all stages i've been told that puppies have nutrional needs much different than adults i've heard its a really good brand i'm just curious as to how it works for them i'm not really trying to be rude here but how can you recommend ol' roy of all things its got about as much nutritional value as a big mac does for you yeah it fills you up and covers one or two the food groups but you wouldn't want to eat a big mac for every meal or you wouldn't live more than a few years i use innova evo for my two dogs and it has just worked wonders for them they eat much less since i've switched them yet gained a healthy weight they go to the bathroom less have more energy and better coats canidae that was already recommended is also a great food they both have human grade meats no fillers and no chemical additives as for your question about canidae being appropriate for all ages look at it this way wolves do not feed their pups a specific diet they eat what the adults eat and because it fills all their nutritional needs it works for all members of the pack essentially that's how canidae works it provides everything a dog needs nutritionally whether he's a pup or a senior this site was recommended to me by the breeder i purchased my gsd from and it has some great information about dog foods and their nutritional value and tells you what ingredients to watch out for i strongly urge all of you who have any question about dog food to read it http www asuperiorgsd com dog food html Dog Guinea pig Domestic rabbit Cat food Nutrition Hamster Veganism Mixed-breed dog Dog food German Shepherd Dog Fancy rat Cat Raw food diet Vegetarianism Agriculture Milk Organic food Livestock Chocolate Atkins Nutritional Approach Vegetarianism and religion Healthy eating Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Great Dane Garfield Theory of conduct Food Egg (food) The Ashlee Simpson Show Piccolo Junior Saga Pet skunk Dog training Terri Schiavo Omega-3 fatty acid Hamburger Tofu Stomach cancer Coyote Folic acid Cheese She Loves You Ferret Ramen Shaggy dog story Trans fat Schutzhund Bread Little Britain Kashrut Ron and Fez Super Size Me Dietary fiber Apple Puppy mill Joke Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dieting Taboo food and drink Labrador Retriever Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Obesity Brown Bear Golden Retriever MRE Basset Hound American Kennel Club Meat Loaf Coprophagia Scooby-Doo Homer Simpson Humphrey Bogart Tooth Domestication Food guide pyramid Plame affair Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier McDonald's Potato Socialization Discus (fish) Cuisine of Denmark Pig American Pit Bull Terrier Tocopherol Buddhism Hot dog Organic farming Plame affair timeline Domesticated turkey Dog breed Time Out of Mind
