how long does it take to toliet train a puppy hi can anyone give me an idea on what age a puupy should be fully toilet trained i know all dogs will be different but my puppies a bit hit and miss wandering the best way to tackle it weve had him weeks and he's weeks old he does pee on newspaper when were out but when were in the house he tends to go to the back of our room thanks any help potty training is a long process first you need to make it very clear to the puppy that what he is doing is wrong smack him on the butt or look him in the eye and in a low but loud tone say bad low tones remind dogs of growling after put him outside for a little also its good to get him crate trained if the dog is in his cage he wont go b c dogs dont pee in their sleeping area make sure the cage isnt too big cuz if it is he'll go on one side and sleep on the other to potty train our puppy we kept him in the cage and only took him out to go to the bathroom eat and play with him occasionally we never let him roam around the house when he stopped going in his cage we gave him more freedom and let him out of his cage more and more but every time after he eats or even drinks take him outside and keep him out there until he goes puppies have small bladders and can't hold it that long give him affection or even a treat when he goes potty outside for the first few weeks he'll eventually get used to it promise good luck also when he goes in the house try to get the odor out b c if you dont he'll go again cuz he can smell the pee Housebreaking Toilet humour Dog training Skinny Puppy Ron and Fez Fancy rat Guinea pig Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Hamster Garfield Urinary incontinence Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Toilet Jackass: The Movie Jennifer Lopez Urine Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Cat Eddie Guerrero RuneScape quests Hansel und Gretel Sinfest Dog John Cage User Friendly Shaggy dog story Beethoven (film) Tag Ferret Domestic rabbit Socialization Brian Griffin Pok__mon Abilities Social rule Sick Puppy Urination Basset Hound USS Sea Dog (SS-401) American Eskimo Dog Nintendogs Humphrey Bogart Blood (computer game) Chappelle's Show Hip hop rivalries Piccolo Junior Saga Singlish Menstrual cup Treehouse of Horror XII Fecal incontinence Homer Simpson Poker jargon Rocko's Modern Life Theory of conduct Avenue Q Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Toilet training Breath of Fire III Marathon (sport) Elimination communication Equine conformation Shark Clarinet Vegeta Friends Ranma __ characters Stitch (Lilo & Stitch) Daz Dillinger Jon Secada Champagne (beverage) Havanese The Sims Fox hunting EastEnders Traumatic incident reduction Chicken Big Brother (USA TV series) Euphemism Big Brother (Australian TV series) Billboard Hot 100 Extreme Programming New York Giants Professional wrestling match types Greg Valentine The Shining (film) Characters in the Smurfs Ron Weasley Shetland Sheepdog Pitaten Salad Fingers SpongeBob SquarePants Leon White Kakapo The Fairly OddParents Lady and the Tramp Buttocks Stuttering
