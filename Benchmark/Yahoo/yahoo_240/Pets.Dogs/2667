my jack russell will only go to the bathroom when she is walked how do i teach her to go in the backyard first walk her in the back yard on the leash just as you would otherwise praise her heavily when she goes after a few times repeating this cycle take her off the leash but walk with her around the back yard praise her when she goes next would be to stand at the side of the yard and send her out to do her business praise her when she goes after time you will be able to put her in the yard for a successful bathroom break without having to be present the key is to take the time to train her properly and to praise her to encourage and reinforce the desired behaviour Dog training Obedience training Swimming pool New York Giants Pittsburgh Steelers Volleyball Passchendaele Aerial (dance move) Gordon Banks Nintendogs Der Ring des Nibelungen USS Walke (DD-723) The Shining (film) American football strategy Futurama (TV series - season 5) Archery Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an USS San Francisco (CA-38) USS Waters (DD-115) Super Bowl XV Chaos and Creation in the Backyard Toilet humour Ludwig Wittgenstein Toilet USS Zane (DD-337) USS Allen M.
