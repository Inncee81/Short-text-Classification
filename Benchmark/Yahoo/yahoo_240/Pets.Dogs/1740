my dog won't go to the bathroom unless she's on a leash i've got a new cocker spainel puppy we think she's about a year old that we found about a month ago she's about a year old we have two other older dogs that easily go to the bathroom in the back yard but punkin' the new dog won't do much of anything outside unless i take her for a walk about time a day or else she uses the floor of our house which isn't much fun i have to start going back to school soon and when i do i might not be able to take her for a walk to let her go to the bathroom in the mornings so i have questions the main one i want answered is how do i train her to use the backyard like our other dogs another one is how do i keep her from going to the bathroom on the floor and the last one that i didn't mention is how do i keep her from peeing on herself when she meets some one new she gets very hyper when someone new walks through the door and yeah you get the point sorry cocker spainel golden retreive mix we think someone mentioned that i should enjoy taking her for a walk instead of training her not to go in the back yard the problem is i won't have the time to do that come next month since i have to go to school also my mom and dad don't have time to walk her when if they come home for lunch so i want her to start going in the backyard with the other dogs i enjoy walking her but i don't always have the time and this doesn't slove her going in the house and not in the back yard problem if she is submissive to your other dogs she may hesitate to mark over the areas they have already urinated on in the yard however given time usually they will find their own spot and that becomes the potty crate training is ideal for the indoor problem it isn't cruel at all as long as it is presented in a positive manner and not used as the time out place whenever she gets in trouble try luring her in by placing treats or a favorite toy in the crate when starting training only leave her in the crate for small amounts of time and let her get used to it as she progresses try longer periods of time my norfolk terrier sleeps all night in his at night he is always ready to go to his house for the hyper peeing problem ask your guests to ignore her when they first come in and she is that excited if they pet her and talk excitedly to her that only reinforces the behavior if you have a friend who is willing practice letting him her knock on the door and then enter while you both ignore your dog eventually your cocker will get the picture that she doesn't get attention until she becomes calm submissive it's all about understanding her state of mind not ours oh is she spayed not only is this healthier for your dog it may help with the peeing problem male dogs aren't the only ones that like to mark territory Dog training Dog Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story The Fairly OddParents Crate training Obedience training Social rule Ron and Fez Mixed-breed dog Friends The Shining (film) Futurama (TV series - season 2) RuneScape quests Futurama (TV series - season 5) Kodocha The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Garfield Humphrey Bogart Cat Dog agility Hamster Domestic rabbit Theory of conduct Sin City Socialization Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Grandview, U.S.A.
