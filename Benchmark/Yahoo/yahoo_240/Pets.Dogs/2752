i'm trying to find a dachshund to buy is this a good price i checked the shelters around me and no dachshunds i found a woman on petfinder who says she has a female weeks no shots or anything is a good price i have no idea what these dogs go for i doubt its registered or anything like that but that doesn't really matter to me ask the woman to accompany you to the vet for a puppy checkup if this is a rescue is a fair price if she's paying for some or all of the medical work most people on petfinder are not backyard breeders so her heart is probably in the right place weeks is a bit young though so a vet visit is the first stop thanks for adopting and make sure you have the little darling spayed by months Pet skunk Dog Domestic rabbit Nintendogs Ferret Guinea pig Microchip implant (animal) Dog breeding Golden Retriever Dachshund Housebreaking Dog training Docking Mixed-breed dog Puppy mill Internet fraud American Pit Bull Terrier Health insurance Cat Dog hybrids and crossbreeds Breed registry The Pilgrim's Progress People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Kitten The Price Is Right Contract Animal euthanasia Predatory lending Kommissar Rex Publicly funded medicine Rabies Dog show Unemployment Dobermann United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East The Voyage of the Beagle FairTax Economics Veterinarian Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Rescue group Richard Chase Animal shelter Intellectual property Supply-side economics American Kennel Club Sin City Fair use Havanese Microeconomics UK Singles Chart Education in Australia The Critic The Apprentice 2 First aid SCO v.
