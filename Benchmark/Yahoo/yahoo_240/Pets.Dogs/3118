neighbor's neglecting dog or just careless ok almost every day mostly during sunrise the dog that belongs to my backyard neighbor kept barking constantly i also hear some whining here and there um i think the dog could be characterized as a toddler not large enough for being a full adult dog nor small enough for it to be a puppy i honestly think the dog was barking for food i feel so bad every time it barks i just want to go over there and feed it but i can't i usually don't see the family home i think the parents goes to work in the morning and send their kids to daycare should there be food and maybe water for the dog before they leave for practically the whole day i noticed the dog was eating its ceramic bowl but now broken in pieces this one time i was peaking out and saw the man of the house going out to the backyard with a wrap up magazine and eating or trying to hit the dog what is the purpose for a backyard dog anyway for looks what should i do i am a little too shy to confront them it sounds like neglect to me you don't have to confront them i would call the humane society animal control spca or any animal rescue organization this poor little guy can't speak for himself so someone has to speak for him you can report these people and you can remain anonymous they will never know it was you that reported them the dog needs help and if you don't report him then there is a chance that no one will p ease do it soon before something worse happens to him and it's too late Dog The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Dog training Richard Chase The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Garfield Carl Barks Internet phenomenon Excel Saga Customs and etiquette of Japan Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Fairly OddParents Aztec Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Brian Griffin 101 Dalmatians: The Series Coyote Billboard Hot 100 Burial Trailer Park Boys Socialization Domestic rabbit Scooby-Doo People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an InuYasha Livestock Kangaroo Paranoia Agent American Alligator Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Family Guy Avenue Q Working dog Hamster Bark (dog) Gray Wolf Fox hunting Philip J.
