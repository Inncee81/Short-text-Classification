is it dangerous if a puppy puts a pill in their mouth we have two lb miniature yorkies i take paxil mg a day about days ago i'd dropped one and took the entire house apart trying to find it vacuumed swept dusted over and over again came up short about minutes ago i looked down on the rug near my feet and the pill was there whole but with tiny teeth marks on it my question is is there any chance that she i know which one must have done this she's so sneaky could have harmed herself by taking in any of that pill i am worried thank you so much i'd consider this a close call but in the clear you got lucky and you can breath a little easier phwew guess that perscription has a taste that doggies dont like if thats the only pill and it only has bite marks then your dog should be ok provide her with plenty of water to flush her systems of any trace drugs if she exibits any odd behavior that you feel is not normal for her call up a vet for further advise or to set up an appointment Dog Poker jargon Guinea pig Housebreaking Rebreather CPU cache Alanis Morissette Antidepressant Ork (Warhammer 40,000) Tag Neighbours Gaia Online Cat Theory of conduct Apollo 8 Strap-on dildo Mattress Hyperthermia Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Oral contraceptive Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Breastfeeding Drill bit Ferret Coffee First aid Anxiety Shark Vacuum tube Sleep Mid-Autumn Festival Sick Puppy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Suicide methods Blood (computer game) Dog training Central processing unit Equilibrium (2002 film) 2005 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Rabies Equine conformation Psoriasis Social rule Shaggy dog story Vampire The Great Brain Minesweeper (computer game) Birth control The Inside Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 March Fox hunting American Alligator Japanese toilet The Virgin Suicides Carbon dioxide Caffeine Pikmin Tetrapod Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma CPU design Jumpstart 3rd Grade Thermal power station Sedative Vacuum cleaner Sin City Cocaine Siphon Battle of Kursk Speed of light Iditarod Opportunity rover Montgomery Burns Hamster Hypoglycemia GunBound Fire fighting Diving Yorkshire Terrier StarCraft: Uprising Symbiosis (TNG episode) The Amber Spyglass Fancy rat Emergency contraception Conspiracy (TNG episode) Spirit rover timeline for 2004 February Normal distribution Halitosis Vacuum Brewery Child sexuality A Day in the Life Fishing Diazepam Homestar Runner Past teachings of Prem Rawat Exact solutions in general relativity Clinical depression Salad Fingers
