my dog won't let me brush him he is a year old shih tzu mix that has always been really picky about letting us groom him his hair's really wavy and in some places really curly so when he does not let us brush him he turns into a knotted mess i have no problem brushing his body for the most part but i have a huge struggle trying to brush his face he just starts trying to bite the brush or he starts to cry so whenever he just gets really knotted we just take him to the groomers and they just shave it off cause it's all they can do but that is too expensive to maintain with a dog that's really curly two phases to this project step get your dog over the fear factor step ensure that you have the right kind of brushes mat detangler's etc to get the job done relatively pain free firstly your dog probably has the doggie equivelant of ptsd when it comes to being groomed he's going to hoop and hollar at the slightest tug on his fur he may even show fear agressive behavior such as the mentioned brush biting in fact if you just get the brush and show it to him he'll likely show fear behavior so basics your dog has a fear issue let me be real up front this isn't going to be a one day fix you may need several weeks to several months to have your dog wagging his tail when you get the grooming brush every day the goal is to have your dog have happy associations with the brush the speed at which your dog will improve will be based on his temperment history and the time you devote to this project if you give treats to your dog feel free to use them during these suggested exercices reduce regular food intake accordingly step one place the brush on the floor on the far side of the room from the dog if your dog leaves the room encourage him back with happy playful talk a toy and or treats spend time just being happy with your dog and giving him affection be sure to touch the dog all over move him from side to side hold his paws things you might do when grooming just do them playful and petting all the while do this until the dog at least does not react to the brush or the dog begins to get the idea that the brush means a good time step two move the brush closer to the dog in gradual steps etc repeating the above the goal is to be able to walk to the dog lay the brush on the ground next to the dog and then proceed with happy dog time step three hold the brush under your arm and continue with the happy dog time remeber if your dog balks and refuses to play at this stage you need to go backwards and devote more work to the earlier stages step four play brushing i say play brushing because no serious grooming at all is to happen here i would pick the brush with two sides metal and nylon and use the nylon side to just lightly skim the dog's back or other areas that are not prone to matting use almost no pressure on the brush the nylon shouldn't pull on the hair make sure that you continue with the happy talk and pet your dog and stroke him etc between strokes i would do this for a good week at the least before attempting real grooming work which brings us to the second phase learning how to groom your dog i can't teach that here obviously but i do suggest you have the spray on dematting liquid you can buy at petstores a special metal prong looking tool that is just for dematting and that you see if you can pay a reasonable fee to have a groomer give you the basics knowing how to groom your dog in a relatively pain free way is going to let you get to the end of the journey and be a happy dog owner there are methods to holding a mat teasing it out with the detangler tool after soaking with spray etc etc will there be some tugging now and then sure but painful tugging should be eliminated and your pooch will be rolling over for those blissful belly brushings when you grab the soft brush good luck Professional wrestling holds Professional wrestling throws Cat Aerial (dance move) Keeshond Shaggy dog story Fancy rat Guinea pig Swingout Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Knife Skateboarding trick Japanese tea ceremony Domestic rabbit Suplex Breastfeeding Dog agility Gray Wolf Kodocha Milton H.
