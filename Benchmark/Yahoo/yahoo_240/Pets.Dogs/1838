loss of apetitie my dobie puppy has seemly lost his appetite for a couple of days now i feed him about three times a day serving about to cups per meal he used to gobble everything up whenever i put it out for him as meal time but now he just ignores the food when i put him in the kennel he still atleast two meals but he hesitates for a time before eating it sometimes he skips a meal however altogether might get a few kibbles out of bowl but leave the rest he is a mo old pup haven't seen any abnormal difference in his behavior should i be concerned or is he just bored of his food well currently is at lbs don't know if you know much about the doberman breed but they get quite large usually around the lb mark for males well actually our vet recommended that he eat more because he is more on the lanky side we used to give him about to cups daily and the vet suggested he bump that up to around to so he is very high energy i have a month old westie puppy who eats cup twice a day she wont eat anything more than that i am aware that doberman's grow to be alot larger then wesites so they might need more food i would try reducing the amount you give him to to cups or times a day your puppy is probably just not as hungry as he used to be when he was a younger puppy it is nothing to be concerned about unless he stops eating all together for more than or five days we had to take my wesite puppy to the vet a month back becuase she wouldnt eat but the vet told us to leave her alone and let her eat her food as she wishes if your puppy stops eating all together add a bit of shredded cheese or plain yogurt to her meal and mix it around and that should encourage him to eat best of luck Dog training Breakfast Guinea pig Stomach cancer Dieting Dobermann Meal Milk Fecal incontinence Pet skunk Atkins Nutritional Approach Folic acid Super Size Me Obesity Dairy Fancy rat Labrador Retriever Anorexia nervosa Domestic rabbit Breastfeeding Housebreaking Binge eating disorder Vegetarianism Fasting French cuisine Ramen Rice pudding Tooth 613 mitzvot Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cheese Hamster Dog show Tofu Ron and Fez Hypoglycemia Thermoregulation Ferret Shark Acorn Livestock Cuisine of Malaysia Nutrition Jewish cuisine Bengali cuisine The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Little Britain Tasmanian Devil Lutefisk Domesticated turkey Shetland Sheepdog Japanese cuisine Gastroparesis Breed standard Japanese tea ceremony Adjustable gastric band The Amazing Race Korban Sauerkraut Food guide pyramid Bread Skinny Puppy Internal ballistics German cuisine Hunger Garfield Professional wrestling slang Chinese New Year Ravi Shastri Spider Kitchen Cuisine of Brazil Chicken Mixed martial arts Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Pancake MRE Pizza Tea Korean cuisine Equine conformation Taikyoku shogi Veganism Cuisine of Denmark Cuisine of the Philippines Egg (food) Yoghurt Cuisine of the Southern United States Poker jargon Mixed-breed dog Customs and etiquette of Japan Rule of St Benedict Vegetarian cuisine Tea (meal) Genetically modified food Healthy eating
