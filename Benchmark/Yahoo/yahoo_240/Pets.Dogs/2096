how do i make sure that the dog i'm adopting gets along with the dog i already have i'm going to go to my local humane society tomorrow and adopt a dog and am looking forward to adding him her to the family but i already have a month old lab puppy and i want to make sure that the puppy and the dog i get will like each other what can i do to make sure that i don't bring home a dog that my existing puppy hates i really want her to have a doggie friend she's very social with other dogs and doesn't get to play with them enough right now i'm hoping new dog can maybe be a playmate for her my humane society doesn't have a home visit only a suitable owner application that is all on paper fyi wow i'm really disappointed that your shelter doesn't have at least an evaluator to see if the two dogs have any aggression toward each other if i were you i would bring my dog with and ask the shelter to supply you with a place for the two dogs to meet watch body language and see for yourself if the two are going to get along at the very least they should pretty much ignore each other or at the very most should run up to each other tails wagging and ready to play if you get anything else you should not take the chance it is often too late after the dog is adopted you may end up with vet bills from injuries or have to give the dog back which would traumatize the poor animal even further i think the shelter would coorperate with you after all they don't want the dog to come back Housebreaking Socialization Gray Wolf Dog training Dobermann Docking Rottweiler Mixed-breed dog Animal shelter Korea Jindo Dog Microchip implant (animal) Labrador Retriever American Eskimo Dog Shaggy dog story Snoopy Poker jargon Havanese Domestic rabbit Garfield Puppy mill Spot the Dog Guinea pig The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Pittsburgh Steelers Theory of conduct Tag Social rule Golden Retriever Animal euthanasia Aladdin (1992 film) Zoophilia Cat Pet skunk Characters of Lost Beetle in an Anthill Brian Griffin Neighbours Kodocha Ferret Maison Ikkoku 101 Dalmatians: The Series Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Komondor The Critic Animal Farm German Shepherd Dog Narcissism Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dog show The Star Wars Holiday Special Animal testing Hunting Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Pride and Prejudice Objective-C Nintendogs Equine conformation Vegeta Clifford's Puppy Days Crate training The Ashlee Simpson Show Skinny Puppy The Smoking Room Lisp programming language Kerry Blue Terrier Aphasia Judith Miller (journalist) Breed registry Dean Koontz Password (game) Traumatic incident reduction Teacher's Pet (Disney) Border Terrier Aerial (dance move) Lady and the Tramp Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Francis Bacon (painter) Hard to Be a God Philadelphia Eagles Aquatic ape hypothesis Rescue group International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement United Nations Medicine Babe Ruth Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Alaskan husky Anarcho-capitalism Fox hunting Humphrey Bogart Dog breeding Border Collie Snoop Dogg Kasparov versus The World Major League Baseball television contracts Jon Secada Inuit
