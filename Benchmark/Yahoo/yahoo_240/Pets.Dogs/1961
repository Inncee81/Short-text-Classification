my months old doberman swallowed a rib bone whole help the bone was about inches long and full of meat its only been a few hours but he seems to be fine what do i do i am worried is this ok he is almost pounds it has now been about hours and he seems ok should i call in the morning i took hime to the vet and they said he should be fine but to watch him for a couple of days call the vet on call in your area usually if you call your normal vet and they are not the ones on call there will be a message giving you the number of who to get in touch with they should be able to advise you mostly likely they will tell you to watch your dog for things like vomiting lack of bowel movements or blood in stool or problems breathing it depends on if and where it causes an obstruction or perforation sometimes vets will reccomend using vegetable oil or petroleum jelly to help move things along don't just take my word for it though you really need to talk to a vet or vet tech on call sometimes dogs will pass things with no issue but if it becomes lodged somewhere it will need to be surgically removed and sooner rather than later there is also the possibility of it splintering moreso if it was cooked and causing a perforation Urinary incontinence Fecal incontinence Dobermann Guinea pig Vomiting Colorectal cancer Equine conformation Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Radiation therapy Prostate cancer Fancy rat Ferret Stroke First aid Hypoglycemia Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Dietary fiber Cancer Botulism Stomach cancer Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Coeliac disease Irritable bowel syndrome Traumatic brain injury Crohn's disease Breastfeeding Gastroesophageal reflux disease Androgen insensitivity syndrome Bowel obstruction Adjustable gastric band Penis Shaggy dog story Childbirth Obstetrics Triage Knife 2005 Atlantic hurricane season Housebreaking Pneumonia Escherichia coli O157:H7 Pet skunk Animal rights Acromegaly Ascariasis Blood (computer game) Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Unclean animals Bone fracture Drowning Sleep apnea Garfield Cystic fibrosis Gastroparesis Hirschsprung's disease Ulcerative colitis Hearing impairment Randomness Hernia Jewish cuisine Insomnia Constipation Meat Loaf Hurricane Wilma Korban Diverticulosis Humphrey Bogart Past teachings of Prem Rawat Gelatin Naruto jutsu Esophageal cancer Intussusception Veganism Battles of Lexington and Concord Intracranial pressure Mesothelioma Dry cleaning Coronary heart disease Sperm Whale 613 mitzvot Dog Diabetes mellitus Social rule Leukemia Vitamin C Foodborne illness Cat Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Cantonese cuisine Coffee Medical prescription Futurama (TV series - season 5) Acute pancreatitis Dialysis Electrophysiology Milton H.
