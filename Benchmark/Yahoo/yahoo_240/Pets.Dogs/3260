we have a puggle who just turned a year old and just got a nd puggle puppy they are my roommate a married couple 's dogs but i notice what goes on with them and i dont like it so a year ago they bought puggy very original name right lol and have spoiled her rotten ever since i can remember i usually dont interfere because she is not my dog but this has resulted in puggy being needy dominant and she has seperation anxiety in an attempt to provide puggy with a playmate and also because the wife wanted a new puppy she recently bought ellie a week old puggle puppy both puggle parents ellie is very sleepy and sweet you can tell she is a very affectionate lap dog very different from puggy when she was a puppy i immediately like ellie way more than puggy now puggy is biting ellie on the neck and pushing her around will this frighten ellie i feel bad for her because puggy is such a brat and i dont want to interfere because its not my dog is it ok for puggy to be dominating her at such a young age all ellie wants to do is eat and sleep she is still a baby and babies need sleep as long as puggy isn't injuring ellie with the playing it's probably ok and normal behavior ellie will grow fast and start enjoying playing with ellie they should get along fine but you should continue to watch the interaction between the two closeley while ellie is still very young and small it is possible puggy could injure her unintentionally but as it stands right now their behavior is normal i wouldn't interfere unless you think either dog is in danger or it is negatively affecting your living situation Dog Dog training Housebreaking Episodes of Lost (Season 1) For Better or For Worse Humphrey Bogart About a Boy Knots Landing Friends Characters in the Smurfs Anxiety Shaggy dog story Ranma __ characters Gray Wolf Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Infantilism Child sexuality Urinary incontinence Socialization Second language acquisition Eddie Guerrero Equine conformation Sleeping Murder Neighbours Guinea pig Ferret Narcolepsy Ron and Fez Sonic the Hedgehog Albert Ellis Pok__mon Live!
