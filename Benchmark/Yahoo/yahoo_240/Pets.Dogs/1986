newborn puppies have yellow runny stool the new shelter i volunteer at brought in a majorly pregnant b the other day and i helped her birth puppies now they're letting her nurse them but i think that she might have a case of metritis because not all of the placentas followed the pups she kept exactly three inside her and i know the consequences of that the problem is that the shelter doesn't have a vet that they report to so they have to do the best they can with the money and supplies they're given i've warned them that the pups and the mother need to be checked and that if they don't see the vet they run the risk of killing the puppies from toxic milk and the mother from a uterine infection the puppies are about days old now and the mother shows no signs of the metritis disease but i'm worried because the newborns have yellow watery stool whereas when they were born they had solid brown stool is this normal i know that some toxins are transfered to the newborns through the milk along with the antibodies in the colostrum and that is supposed to make their poop a little runny but this is really scaring me their poo looks like pee it's the color of pee a really bright yellow with maybe a few little chunks in it please pro breeders tell me if it's supposed to be this way the puppies are deffinitely happy and gaining weight rapidly the mother is eating regularly thank you so much yes it sounds normal they have mustard seed yellow type of stool the mother will clean it up she should be fine they sometimes keep a few placentas she should be fine just make sure all the pups are eating well if not you will need to bottle feed them some to help the mom out since she had quite a few good luck Breastfeeding Guinea pig Childbirth Obstetrics Hamster Cat Dog Milk Domestic rabbit Coeliac disease Ron and Fez Premature birth Escherichia coli O157:H7 Feces Cytomegalovirus Hypoglycemia Urinary incontinence Coffee Pneumonia Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pet skunk Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Caesarean section Folic acid Twin Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Mnemonic Dairy cattle Domestic goat Jaundice Common cold Elephant Dairy Foodborne illness Shark Labrador Retriever Tocopherol Breast milk Golden Retriever Computer virus Toxoplasmosis Herpes simplex virus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Docking Sin City Cystic fibrosis Nerpa Peanut Placenta Cheese Sexual reproduction Endometrial cancer Dobermann Mixed-breed dog Cephalic disorder Livestock Antibody Prostate cancer Potato Menstrual cycle Campylobacteriosis The Amazing Race Toilet humour Certified Nursing Assistant Clostridium difficile Dog training HIV test Psoriasis Diseases of the honeybee Propranolol Mutual fund Bone marrow transplant Blood type Chocolate Glycogen storage disease type I Multiple sclerosis Fetus Listeriosis Rotavirus Gonorrhoea Plutonium Kodocha Genetically modified organism Chicken Gastroesophageal reflux disease Harp Seal Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Allergy Omega-3 fatty acid Earless seal Kashrut Group A streptococcal infection Vaccine Placenta praevia
