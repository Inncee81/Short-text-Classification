we are thinking about gettting a bulldog and need help my husband wants a english bulldog and i have been reading about them and i am wondering how bad the drooling snoring and farting really is i also worry that my young children will be to active for the dog so please help with any input english bulldogs are great dogs but they do require alot of tlc i have a year old female english bulldog of my own named maggie who is such a great dog and i have had her since she was weeks old however i will give you some pros and cons you really should know especially if you have never owned one pros bulldogs are great with kids extremely loyal to their owners have a great character they do some of the funniest things and the facial expressions are priceless and they tend to be more active then people think they also usually get along well with other dogs too and no doggie haircuts are needed they will give you lots of love and affection cons bulldogs do drool quite a bit with daily maintenance required under those wrinkles on their eyes and mouth which can get quite a bit of buildup the snoring is the worst dont expect to have your bulldog sleeping in the same room as you they do shed a bit so you will have to clean up those pesky hairs frequently they can overheat if kept out too long in hot weather so if you are in a colder climate area then great but if you are in like fl or tx you need to be aware of the heat these are indoor dogs also they can on occasion have some serious health concerns you need to be aware of eye ulcers heat strokes the farting is not that bad just depends what you may be feeding your dog my suggestion is if you have multiple kids bulldog are great with kids but you may already have your hands full and a bulldog requires alot of needed attention maintenance if you do get one female bulldogs usually weigh less and i have found over my years of experience that they tend to be more active and playful then male bulldogs but that may not always be the case i still think they are the greatest dogs in the world so whatever you do make sure you give your bulldog the love it deserves Dog Bulldog Garfield Cat Breastfeeding Ferret Energy development Social rule Domestic rabbit David Smith (wrestler) Climate of the United Kingdom Milton H.
