happen often but when it does it's crazy he has to be absolutly with someone at all times of this or he gets so scared he jolts his head back and forth like he's hearing stuff and he can never sit still and starts breathing heavy and faster he acts like someone is after him or something can someone tell me what this might be or if anyone else's dog is like this but the dog doesn't seem like it's having a seizure maybe like a mini one i guess nothing is ever wrong with his mouth he does pace alot he usually calms down after i stroke him and talk to him to calm down sounds like seizures to me what is a seizure seizures are one of the most frequently seen neurological problems in dogs a seizure is also known as a convulsion or fit it may have all or any combination of the following loss or derangement of consciousness contractions of all the muscles in the body changes in mental awareness from nonresponsiveness to hallucinations involuntary urination defecation or salivation behavioral changes including non recognition of guardian viciousness pacing and running in circles what are the three phases of a seizure seizures consist of three components the pre ictal phase or aura is a period of altered behavior in which the dog may hide appear nervous or seek out the guardian he may be restless nervous whining shaking or salivating this may last a few seconds to a few hours the ictal phase is the seizure itself and lasts from a few seconds to about five minutes during this period all of the muscles of the body contract strongly the dog usually falls on his side and seems paralyzed while shaking the head will be drawn backward urination defecation and salivation often occur if it is not over within five minutes the dog is said to be in status epilepticus or prolonged seizure during the post ictal phase there is confusion disorientation salivation pacing restlessness and or temporary blindness there is no direct correlation between the severity of the seizure and the duration of the post ictal phase is the dog in trouble during a seizure despite the dramatic signs of a seizure the dog feels no pain only bewilderment dogs do not swallow their tongues if you put your fingers into his mouth you will do no benefit to your pet and will run a high risk of being bitten very badly the important thing is to keep the dog from falling and hurting himself as long as he is on the floor or ground there is little chance of harm occurring if seizures continue for longer than a few minutes the body temperature begins to rise if hyperthermia develops secondary to a seizure another set of problems may have to be addressed what causes seizures there are many many causes of seizures epilepsy is the most common and of least consequence to the dog the other extreme includes severe diseases such as brain tumors fortunately most are due to epilepsy now that the seizure is over can anything be done to understand why it happened when a seizure occurs veterinarians begin by taking a thorough history concentrating on possible exposure to poisonous or hallucinogenic substances or history of head trauma they will also perform a physical examination a basic battery of blood tests and an electrocardiogram ekg these tests rule out disorders of the liver kidneys heart electrolytes and blood sugar level a heartworm test is performed if your dog is not taking heartworm preventative very regularly if these tests are normal and there is no exposure to poison or recent trauma further diagnostics may be performed depending on the severity and frequency of the seizures occasional seizures are of less concern than when the seizures are becoming more severe and frequent in this instance a spinal fluid tap and fluid analysis may be performed depending on availability specialized imaging of the head with a cat scan or mri might be performed fortunately these additional tests are usually not needed what can be done to prevent future seizures veterinarians generally prescribe weeks of anticonvulsant therapy if there are no more seizures during that time the anticonvulsants are gradually discontinued the next treatment is determined by how long it takes for another seizure to occur that may be days months or years at some point many dogs have seizures frequently enough to justify continuous anticonvulsant therapy since that means that medication must be given every to hours for the rest of the dog's life veterinarians do not recommend that until seizures occur about every days or unless they last more than five minutes it is important to avoid sudden discontinuation of any anticonvulsant medication even normal dogs may be induced to seizure if placed on anticonvulsant medication and then abruptly withdrawn from it your veterinarian can outline a schedule for discontinuing the medication you mentioned status epilepticus what does that mean status epilepticus bears special note it is characterized by a seizure that lasts more than five minutes when it occurs the dog's life is endangered unless intravenous medication is given promptly the patient may die if this occurs you should seek treatment by a veterinarian
