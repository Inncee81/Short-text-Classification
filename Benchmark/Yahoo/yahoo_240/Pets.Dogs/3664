how do i get my dog to stop biting my dad has a little boston terrier named marvin pibbs hes very cute trained overall a very good dog but when we're taking him for a walk he feels the need to bite strangers also when me and my little brother are wrestling or my dads tickling one of us or something the dog jumps in and starts nipping at everyone hes broken the skin on us a few times theres going to be a baby in the house in the next year and we're afraid of what will happen with the dog my dad says he will get rid of him if he bites again what can i do to stop the dog from biting ps he just got rescued from an animal shelter less than a month ago we had this same problem i had heard somewhere that this problem develops a lot when the young puppies are separated from their siblings at a young age therefore they never learn what is acceptable nibbling and what is biting in the litter when it is biting then the other siblings will make a noise and this tells the puppy that this was unacceptable well we always wrestle and play rough with our boston and when she would bite or nip a little too hard we would go ow in a high pitched way and back away then she would stop and we would put our hand back in front and she would instantly back away or nudge with a closed mouth she has learned and no longer nibbles too hard of course another way we have curbed other behavior like jumping on people was to spray her with a squirt bottle not looking at her in the eye so she doesn't realize its us and just knows that this bad behavior bring this etc this only took three to four times and she has completely stopped this behavior good luck Dog Piccolo Junior Saga Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story Cat Hansel und Gretel Social rule Housebreaking Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Tenshinhan The Death Gate Cycle Babe Ruth Pitaten Milton H.
