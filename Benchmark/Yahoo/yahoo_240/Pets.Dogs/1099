temperature question hey guys i think i may be getting a little redundant with my questions my dog lady is pregnant as some of you may well know her temperature was a stable from wednesday until about this morning i have been told that although temperature can be used as an indicator for when she will deliver it is not always so my concern is this her body was feeling a little warm this morning and so i took her temperature again and it was back up to i understand that this is a normal temperature for dogs but considering what her temperature has been this is not normal for her when i called my vet they told me that they were not well experienced in temperature and relating it to a dog's pregnancy so if anyone out here has any idea please let me know if you think this is normal or if i should take her into the emergency clinic and have her checked out i can still feel her puppies moving around in her belly also does this stop before labor when theyarelignedup rescue dog you are the one who is being ignorant so maybe you could shut up i adopted my dog from a shelter who failed to tell us that she was pregnant she was about weeks along in her pregnancy at that point and i was highly told to not abort her puppies i am just doing the best i can for my dog so you can screw off dogs temperatures do drop and then raise back up right before dropping again this is normal here are signs of labors for you to review stages of labor your dam may exhibit all or just some of the following signs stage temperature will drop to degrees or so eyes will dilate she will stare at you and want you near refusal to eat hide under your bed or a dark place laying on her side but can't seem to get comfortable mucus discharge stage pre labor digging shivering panting staring at her rear end licking vulva excessively mild uterine contractions stage labor hard uterine contractions extreme shivering water breaking grunting and pushing visible sign of the first pup and delivery whelp note if the dam is pushing and grunting and crying out in pain that lasts for over an hour with no visible pup you maybe in trouble this is when you need to search your gut ask yourself how do you feel do you feel you are safe or in trouble go by your gut instinct read the dams signs her body is talking to you she is probably safe if she is napping between contractions but if is she becoming exhausted from constant pushing and straining if she appears close to collapse you maybe in trouble she is telling you something is wrong and a puppy maybe to large to pass thru her pelvis if you feel you are in trouble call your vet and get ready to seek help Pregnancy Guinea pig Dog Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Breech birth Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle First aid Abortion debate Dog training Premature birth Abortion Obstetrics Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Milton H.
