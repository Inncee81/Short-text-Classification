do dogs feel less pain proportionally than humans they seem to have more resiliance to pain than we do i have owned dogs for four decades and have noticed a significant difference in the way they respond to the same proportion of experience pain wise than a human would do they have fewer nerve endings per square inch do they have less sensitive nerves is it the fur barrier very very curious about this thanks to whomever can answer i love my dog i think that dogs register pain differently than we do even if the sensation is the same the way they think about it is different people differ from each other that way as well two people with the same amount of actual pain like a pin prick can think about it very differently and therefore display very different reactions one person will get hysterical over it while others will just shrug their shoulders and ignore it i have noticed what you have seen as well a dog can barrel into a solid object like another dog and keep moving as if nothing happened i wonder if the dog just shrugs his shoulders and keeps on playing while a person is wondering if he broke something if his insurance will cover it if he needs to take an aspirin for it etc and will stop to nurse the pain he thinks that because he took a pretty big hit he should be hobbling around and maybe crying a bit and so he does if dogs aren't sensitive enough to feel pain as we do they would be a danger to themselves and could not get on in the world they would be like those people who cannot feel pain at all and so burn themselves on the stove or break fingers in doorways i think they must sense the pain as we do but think differently about it and therefore act differently Dog Pain Dualism (philosophy of mind) Milton H.
