when did you first fall in love with your chosen breed when and why did you first decide to own the breed you have the first time i saw a doberman i was about years old and i remember thinking it was one of the most gorgeous animals i have ever seen it was running down the street with it's owner and he had the most beautiful run my sister told me what kind it was and i thought it doesn't look like it pinches it wasn't until years later i realized it was pinscher not pincher anyway from then on i was fascinated and after researching the breed and finding out how intelligent loyal affectionate and protective they are the minute i had a house and a yard i got my first doberman and i have not been disappointed any good stories i saw my first golden at a dog show my aunt took me to i was years old i was so taken by this dogs grace and personality not only in the ring but outside of it too i talked the owners and handlers ears off i had seen them before but never so close up or one that looked like him he was named champion mountain bear my aunt was at the dog show to show her collie and i grew up with toy poodles my parents bred and showed so this was a real treat for me i talked my aunts ear off too all the way home from ny to ct i knew i was completely hooked by the time she dropped me off home i made a point of talking to every golden owner and handler from that day on i knew there was no way my parents would allow me to have a golden so i watited until i could have one of my own when i graduated college my aunt presented me with a golden pup who was a grandson to the golden i had first fallen in love with i was in heaven i raised my golden and showed him and eventually added a female golden to my growing love of this breed the rest is history i never wanted or owned another breed it's been many years since i had my first golden and i can't even imagine owning another breed i have come to love dobies also i think they are a very nobel and beautiful looking dog also very missunderstood i wish i had been exposed to them sooner but really it's only been a few years since i've had the chance to learn more about them Dobermann Obedience training Pitaten Dog EastEnders Dog agility Mixed-breed dog Working dog Shaggy dog story Kodocha German Shepherd Dog Poodle The Lovely Bones Our Gang Gray Wolf God Emperor of Dune Dog show Nintendogs Aphrodite Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban One Tree Hill (TV series) The Brady Bunch Humphrey Bogart Charmed Oliver and Company Schutzhund The Subtle Knife Papillon (dog) Miniature Pinscher Jon Secada Keeshond Tenchi Muyo!
