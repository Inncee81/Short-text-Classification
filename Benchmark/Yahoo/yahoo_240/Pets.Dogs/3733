puppy still pooping in crate i have tried everything that you all suggested and my puppy is still pooping in her crate she is now weeks old her crate has become so small it's getting cruel she is doing great potty training outside of the crate we only crate her at night i think she's pooping delibrately to get attention she has held it all night for weeks straight in the past when school starts we can no longer clean up after her and give her a bath every morning i am going to resort to making the crate larger and letting her poop in it we'll have to clean the crate but at least we won't have to give her a bath everyday has anyone else resorted to this and did your puppy eventually get better the reason why i'm inquiring again is because i have tried all your suggestions even waking up at am which was a waste because she still never went poop her crate is so small now she can't even turn i have nothing to undo because she held it all of weeks when we first got her and for the past weeks she's been pooping in it we stopped feeding her after pm i only give her dried food at night she poops around pm and we take her out until we put her to bed at pm and she won't poop an hour later she'll poop in the crate won't let her roam the house at night that's why we crate her at night also don't want her to get used to pooping in the house if i don't crate her she's done so good during the day just thought that maybe somone else had given up and when the dog got older and was able to hold it you tried again successfully i decided to make the crate larger and she's no longer pooping in the crate she just really hated it small when i let her out in the morning she poops and pees which means she was holding it i think we're home free thanks for your answers i had the same problem and i have raised a lot of puppies she is now about months old she does it less but still does it i think im going toask my vet if there is a physical problem that can cause this good luck oh yea ive tried staying out longer with her the last time i take her out before bed it's helped the most Housebreaking Dog training Crate training Social rule Pitaten Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Toilet humour Dairy Customs and etiquette of Japan Shaggy dog story Fancy rat Ron and Fez Dog Urinary incontinence USS America (CV-66) Socialization Insomnia Futurama (TV series - season 5) New York Giants Hamster Shit Sento Kurt Angle Avenue Q The Ashlee Simpson Show Milton H.
