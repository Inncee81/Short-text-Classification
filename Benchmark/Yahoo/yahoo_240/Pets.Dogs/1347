help on dog poop im tired of my dog pooping on the carpet i want him to poop on the wee wee pads dont flame saying do the kennel training cause it just poops in there is there a spray where it makes the poop just come out i head in another post that its called rose garden spray and i checked petco and other pet stores but i couldnt find it please help you can't expect the dog to train itself you must put a bit of work in here and teach him where to go start now by taking him out in the morning as soon as he wakes up then after every meal play and sleep during the day take him to the place where you want him to go and wait with him until he goes as soon as he has relieved himself give him lots of praise and a small treat you have to be consistent with this training if you want a fully housetrained dog it takes a lot of patience but it is something all dog owners have to do i'm afraid to stop him from returning to the carpet to poop every time you are going to have to either get it steam cleaned or put down new carpet he has decided that this is 'his place' now and his scent is there and he will just go back to that place every time put a bit of time in and you'll soon be rewarded with a clean dog Dog training Toilet humour Housebreaking Obedience training Dog agility USS West Virginia (BB-48) USS America (CV-66) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Shaggy dog story Pet skunk Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Dog Flea German Shepherd Dog Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban USS Ticonderoga (CV-14) RuneScape quests Fancy rat Pitaten The Family from One End Street Cat Hamster Jackass: The Movie Mattress Bedbug Futurama (TV series - season 5) Meal Dog food Korea Jindo Dog First aid USS Yorktown (CV-10) Kimi Finster Social rule Tag Tire Beetle in an Anthill Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Fire fighting USS Hancock (CV-19) Ferret Carpet Poker jargon Pit bull USS Wasp (CV-18) Animal Crossing Apollo 8 USS Wadsworth (DD-516) Urinary incontinence 2000 Australian Grand Prix Beethoven (film) Basset Hound USS Aylwin (DD-355) American Kennel Club Piccolo Junior Saga USS Wichita (CA-45) Operation Market Garden Schutzhund Nintendogs Skunk Fecal incontinence Toyota Prius CPU cache The Hitch-Hiker (The Twilight Zone) USS San Francisco (CA-38) 1957 World Series Aladdin (1992 film) Japanese tea ceremony Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Medieval hunting USS Sea Dog (SS-401) USS Ammen (DD-527) USS Augusta (CA-31) Australian Cattle Dog 2005 Iditarod Rule of St Benedict USS Washington (BB-56) Labrador Retriever Vegeta Blood (computer game) USS Vincennes (CL-64) The Death Gate Cycle C__chulainn Jack Russell Terrier Tick USS Taussig (DD-746) USS Enterprise (CV-6) Ron Weasley Sin City Garfield Insulin Greyhound racing The Contender (television series) Full Metal Panic?
