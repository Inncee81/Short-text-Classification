is it okay to love and treat your dog like a child i do and people have problems with it what do you think i dress him do his hair and paint his nails but i dont walk him without shoes and usually end up carrying him i dont want him to hurt his feet for the most part no i volunteer at a shelter and i see dogs come in with numerous behavioral problems caused by such babying people who baby their dogs usually let them get away with most everything sometimes dogs can do this and still retain a friendly attitude but most often they become spoiled and dominant and the dog will begin to express aggressive tendencies at the food or water bowl towards other dogs towards other pets children strangers ect this aggression may start out small a little growl here and there but it can explode into a huge problem if left unchecked i'm not saying you should never indulge your dog it's nice to baby them once in a while pamper them with treats take them on a road trip let them run around in a dog park swim in a lake just keep it to a controllable level so that things don't get out of hand edit in reply to your additional details i really don't care if you dress them up or paint their nails personally i find that strange but it's your choice but you really should be letting your dog walk and not carrying them around everywhere dogs need to be walked to get adequate exercise and to stay well balanced in mind not letting him walk is bad for him and could lead to problems in behavior down the road i don't really like to equate dog situations with human situations but this is the only good example i can think of imagine if someone carried you everywhere and never let you stretch your legs or burn up a little energy after a while you would get jittery and antsy to move would you not it is similar for dogs dogs that don't get adequate exercise get hyper and develop other ways of letting out their energy mostly by tearing up your house which is obviously unacceptable if you exercise your dog in other ways such as playing fetch in lieu of walking that's fine Dog Cat Dog training Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Theory of conduct Infantilism Hamster Obedience training Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Kodocha Guinea pig Pet skunk Swimming Karen Horney Childbirth Autism Anger management Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Dragon Booster Sonic the Hedgehog Atomic Kitten Mental retardation Clinical depression Domestic rabbit RuneScape quests Goodness and value theory Diving Triathlon Breastfeeding Characters in the Smurfs Milton H.
