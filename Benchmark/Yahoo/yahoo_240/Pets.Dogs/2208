adopting a dog i was on petfinder com looking for a dog to adopt in my area earlier today and i noticed in most of my local shelters the adoption fee is even for older dogs or mixed breed dogs and dogs that were healthy when they came to the shelter i came across an adult yorkie who i was interested in adopting and who is for adoption wasnt a yorkie rescue but just a local shelter he was already neutured from his previous owners vet and is healthy and only been there a couple of days but the adoption fee is still why charge so much i feel some more dogs would be adopted to good homes if the fee wasnt as expensive your oopinions i live in new england area the reason may be that they do not have enough funding i know that our shelter charges a lot more for the healthy dogs because we have dogs who are old and sick that we have been unable to find homes for the vet bill can mount up we use the high fees we get on the healthy dogs to pay these bills and while it is possible that a lot more dogs would be adopted into good homes if the fees were lower it's also possible that a lot more dogs would be adopted into bad homes i'd suggest talking to the shelter and asking what drives this policy chances are it has the best interests of the dogs at heart ask if the fee is negotiable provided that you allow them to do a home visit before approving the adoption also try volunteering as a dog walker socializer our shelter is much more likely to reduce our adoption fee on an animal if we know the person is good with our animals and cares enough to give their time btw what area do you live in Health insurance Rescue group Insurance Domestic rabbit Dog Publicly funded medicine Golden Retriever Pet skunk Working dog Animal euthanasia Mutual fund Microchip implant (animal) Hunting Infantilism Livestock Fox hunting Student loan Credit card Life insurance Food and Drug Administration Wal-Mart Organic farming Docking Mixed-breed dog Gray Wolf Ferret Social work Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Economic inequality Contract Utilitarianism Democratic Party (United States) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Canadian and American health care systems compared Theory of conduct Community emergency response team Animal rights Cat Divorce Open access Education in the People's Republic of China Korea Jindo Dog Taxation in the United States MMORPG London Congestion Charge Fancy rat Tuition Health care in the United States Equine conformation Maison Ikkoku Pitaten Housebreaking Adoption Prostate cancer Microeconomics Social rule First aid Homeschooling Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Supply and demand Quarantine German Shepherd Dog Feral child Labrador Retriever Search and rescue Socialization Copyright National Kidney Foundation Singapore Tariff Canada Health Act Dog agility Abortion debate Education in the United States Pet store Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849) Yorkshire Terrier Blackburn Rovers F.C.
