what does it mean when a dog has white stuff aroun his mouth hi i have a year old husky but today i sat down by him and was feeding him outside and i saw this white liquid type stuff around and in his mouth and it kept coming a little bit im not sure if he was doin any exercise before i came outside you know when dogs run or do something like that they get a little bit of white foam in there mouth but this was differant and i dont think he was doing anything maybe he was barking i am realy worried thank you so much ohhhh good grief he doesn't have rabies if it is hot where he is drool will be a bit thicker especially if he's been panting and he's outside get a water mister spray container like in the make up or garden area brand new and clean fill with cool water or add a ice cube or when you see him looking a little thick hold his head lightly and spray the side or even the front of the inside of his mouth so he is drinking in small swallows if it's cool water a husky will like it this is hot weather and you need to be wary of heat exhaustion which comes before heat stroke which is the shock part of over heating put in enough water in his food so his kibble will float this will help him get extra water when he eats set out a large large horse size bucket of water tie it or anchor it so he can't tip it over very important make sure water s t a y s in the shade all day long put out a inexpensive toddler kiddy pool in the shade and half way fill for him to lie in throw some ice cubes in it and show him does he have a really super good area of shade i'd see if you can't put up a window box fan so it won't tip over if he bumps it or sits on it or better a high velocity fan so he can lie in front of it the fan needs to be protected from rain too fans and water are important in preventing heat problems i think this is what you are seeing Sento Hyperthermia Fire fighting Internal ballistics Drill bit Fire extinguisher Thermal power station Solar power Casting First aid Gas metal arc welding Jet engine Dairy Mattress Coffee Ice Swimming Water Textile manufacturing Tofu Diving Volleyball Dundas Square Japanese tea ceremony Autonomous building Glass Siphon Welding Thermoregulation Stirling engine Wind turbine Glossary of firefighting equipment Glossary of firefighting terms Milk Happy Tree Friends Equine conformation Drowning Jackass: The Movie Shaggy dog story Electrophysiology Nitroglycerin Cat Glossary of wildland fire terms Handloading Piccolo Junior Saga Swimming pool Transformer Cookware and bakeware Soldering Severe weather terminology (United States) Motor oil Ice cream Carburetor Naruto jutsu Invader Zim Water (molecule) Cruising (maritime) Breastfeeding Engine cooling Mosquito Poker jargon Fume hood Dog Toilet humour Professional wrestling throws Upholstery RuneScape quests The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Nuclear power Lightning Hiking Internal combustion engine Campfire Emu Bread Mario series enemies Rabies Samovar Desert Spark plug Car washing techniques Ferret Dog training Heat Korean cuisine Vampire Teen Girl Squad Diving suit Gag (BDSM) Professional wrestling slang Geothermal areas of Yellowstone Passive solar
