would it be ok if i adopt a small house dog even though i have a full time job hi when i was growing up my family always owned a dog well now that i am living on my own i really want a companion by my side especially when i am home i want to adopt a small dog but i was wondering would that make sense since i work am pm on the weekdays i live in a house with a large backyard in a nice suburban neighborhood my neighbors are always walking by with their dogs so its a dog friendly environment i say that to say this i know that dogs need attention and there will be no one home when i am at work could you give me some tips on whether i should get a dog or not and how would this work out of course it would be okay there are so many people out there who work full time and have a happy dog at the same time it's all a matter of balancing out things there is already an overpopulated amount of dogs in this world today if you don't adopt a dog then overall as a whole more dogs will be put down it would be better to belong to a family than no family at all The Lovely Bones New Urbanism Overpopulation Dog training Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Humphrey Bogart Grace Cossington Smith Dog agility Companion dog Reservoir Dogs Milwaukee, Wisconsin Steven Wright Cat White flight The Sims Adoption The Brady Bunch Taikyoku shogi The Inside Hamster Border Collie Avenue Q Dog Working dog Yonkers, New York Beavis and Butt-head Golden Retriever Philip J.
