can you tell when your dog needs a vet maybe its just me but i keep reading questions that it s so obvious the dog needs emergency medical treatment and the person is on the computer asking advice then i read where people are wondering if they should take their dog to the vet for a broken nail is this a world of extremes dont people know when they truely need a vet i see a lot of that too and i admit i sometimes get a little snippy with those people not so much with the people freaking out that their dog broke a nail but moreso with the ones who are logging on here complaining that their dog is vomiting blood or was just run over by a car and they don't know what to do in one situation the dog is in danger the other not so i can partly forgive someone who is overly cautious and is wanting to take their dog into the vet for something minor like a broken nail perhaps they're new to dogs and just don't have enough knowledge or experience to make the call for themselves however those that come here saying their dog has just been run over and they don't know what to do well anyone even an idiot or someone new to dogs can see that they need medical attention anyway i'd say yes i know when my dog needs a vet xd lol The Apprentice 2 Traumatic brain injury Ferret Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Aphasia Randomness Psychiatric hospital Diabetes mellitus Milton H.
