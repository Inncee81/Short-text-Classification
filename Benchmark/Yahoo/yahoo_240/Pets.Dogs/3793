ofa question for breeders do you believe that a dog that has ofa excellent rated hips will have more restricted movement than a dog rated ofa fair in some smaller breeds like mine the hips are not as crucial to the well being of the dog a corgi can have mild hip dysplasia and show no symptoms would you breed a corgi with a ofa borderline rating i am contemplating this now if i do breed her i would check all her puppies hips to see what she throws you may answer to all or any of the questions i talked to a well respected corgi breeder yesterday that said she thought that hips did affect the movement on a corgi she breeds mostly ofa fair and good rated dogs many would disagree with her in this so i was wondering what you all thought about it i will have to look into the penn hip thing i have heared about it but don't know much what do you think about it i raise cardigan welsh corgis and as you stated hips are usually not a factor with corgis even less in cardigans than pembrokes p r a progressive retnial atrophy is the worst culprit in this breed i would worry about that more than hips though i would never breed a dog with fair rated hips its just a possible problem down the road the more you breed dogs with fair rated hips the likely chance the pups can be bad both my pair have excellent rating my male has had excellent ratings down the line his grandfather is ch codewig carbon blue and he has had champions all through his line the female i have was rated good but her father was good her mother was fair i even waited till she was years for her first breeding to be sure they didnt deteriorate borderbethie not trying to make you angry or anyhting but in my years of raising cardigans and knowing pembroke breeders for many years i have yet to see a corgi need a c section bred properly and match correctly they very rarely have whelping issues hd in corgi's is not usually a problem at all i have not seen many hd corgis through out my career not saying there arent some but a bordline hd in a corgi is still a good solid corgi its just bad practice to risk the deterioration of a breeding program by breeding fairs and borderlines together i also agree with someones earlier statement about ofa certification you really need to find a vet that is dedicated to the welfare of the breed rather than the dog as a whole each breed of dog has certian requirements and to rate them all as a whole is detrimental to certifying a dog properly penhip is a very good idea if you want to breed quality show animals and healthy strucuraly sound corgis Hip dysplasia Dog English Springer Spaniel Border Terrier Welsh Corgi Mixed-breed dog Docking Shetland Sheepdog American Cocker Spaniel Dog breeding Labrador Retriever Pembroke Welsh Corgi Equine conformation Cardigan Welsh Corgi Great Dane Domestic rabbit Herding dog Guinea pig Prostate cancer Livestock Cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Ferret Gray Wolf Hip hop culture Dog show Dog breed Fancy rat Extreme Programming Fox hunting Goodness and value theory Species Keeshond Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Nintendogs German Shorthaired Pointer English Cocker Spaniel Puppy mill Bipolar disorder Pretty Good Privacy Jennifer Lopez Golden Retriever Borderline personality disorder Border Collie Hamster Eugenics American Pit Bull Terrier Scientology beliefs and practices Horse American Kennel Club Dobermann Beagle Breed registry Divorce CPU cache The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Intellectual property Alaskan Malamute Cat Theory of conduct Hypoglycemia Scooby-Doo Jack Russell Terrier Traumatic brain injury Pet skunk Dog agility Rabies Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Alzheimer's disease EastEnders Shaggy dog story Greyhound Abortion debate Hey Jude Nuclear power Atkins Nutritional Approach Halting problem Blue Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Liger Public domain Autism Discus (fish) Smooth Collie Basset Hound Microeconomics Epistemology Australian Cattle Dog Plame affair Poker jargon
