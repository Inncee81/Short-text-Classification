dog urinating problem i know about the whole crate training thing that most people say will eliminate dogs' problems with urinating inside but i have some questions about it how will the fact that he won't urinate in the crate solve the fact that he won't urinate in the house outside the crate how long can i keep him in the crate he's a yorkie some people suggest punishing a dog when he urinates in the house some people have suggested not punishing just what is the best way my yorkie is months how long does it usually take for a dog to get houstrained oh and i just got him a week ago sorry if i didn't make myself clear no i haven't had him for months dogs don't like to eliminate where they sleep so a crate trains him to hold it while he is in the crate it also prevents him from peeing anywhere outside of the crate when you take him out of the crate and take him outside he pees he soon learns to make that association if he never has a chance to pee inside the house like on newspaper he will learn to pee outside much faster it takes time to take a young puppy out all the time but it is worth it if he pees put him in the crate and then clean up the mess with a urine neutralizer any yelling can make the situation worse if you put down and take up his food and water on a schedule you can anticipate when he needs to go that will also make it much easier a dog does not have to have water down all the time at months he can be house trained although i have heard that some small dogs can have problems their entire lives Housebreaking Dog training Urinary incontinence Crate training Ben Johnson (athlete) Urine Dog Yorkshire Terrier Shaggy dog story Toilet humour Theory of conduct Hamster Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Prostate cancer Socialization Fox hunting The Death Gate Cycle Social rule Scientology beliefs and practices Equilibrium (2002 film) Ultima Online Ron and Fez Major League Baseball television contracts Simone Weil Dog intelligence American Psycho Kangaroo Urination Blonde on Blonde The Apprentice 2 Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Fancy rat Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Insulin Domestic rabbit Dairy Japanese toilet Compiler optimization Leon White Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Slow Train Coming RuneScape quests Humphrey Bogart Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Assassination Obedience training Toilet Heinkel He 112 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Dog agility Fecal incontinence Daylight saving time Urinal I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Current teachings of Prem Rawat Goodness and value theory Diseases of the honeybee Piccolo Junior Saga Bart chalkboard gags The Inside IBM PC compatible Philosophy of language M16 (rifle) Greyhound racing The Smoking Room Garfield Reinforcement Euphemism The Contender (television series) Water Drug test Capital punishment Scenes from a Memory Time Crisis 3 Milton H.
