my border collie mix does not like other border collies and australian sheperds she is a dominant dog so when she meets another dog she will establish who's the boss quickly but when she meets other border collies and australian sheperds she cannot stand them and gets more agressive the other day she met one who was not submissive and they got into a fight she laid down as i asked her to but the other dog kept going on fighting in a way she got what she asked for and i was not upset at the other dog or owner but it's annoying that she has to be agressive with those dogs because they are quite common now why is it that she can't stand some breeds what can i do to prevent her agressive behavior toward those dogs in the dog park ps the fights don't involve blood or injuries it's a dog fight like you see in dog parks with a lot of growling and snapping ps i also have another dog at home and she gets along with the neighbors' dogs she is neutered of course it could be a breed aggression issue mine gets like that with anything that looks like her but is perfectly polite to anything that doesn't i think instead of having your dog lay to stop the fighting try the leave it command that way instead of forcing her into a submissive stance toward the other dog she can just walk away try teach your dog to ignore other dogs when ever you see a dog coming your way you know your dog would act negatively toward do something like a short back track to distract your dog so she doesn't notice the other animal if she sees the dog and goes for it say in a firm tone leave it and walk your dog away from the situation eventually you can at least have a dog that will no longer start fights but will probably still posture around other dogs like her Dog training Obedience training Dog Mixed martial arts Cat Dog show Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Milton H.
