thinking about getting a pomeranian can anyone tell me some basic facts on what i need to know or do before and when i get the puppy i'm thinking about getting a pomeranian cause my mom and her boyfriend work a lot and my neighbors only come around every here and there i want the dog to show my mom that i'm responsible and can take care of it whenever she's gone i'm a real dog lover and i'd never ever hurt them i just need some tips and some info that i'd need to know first like temper and grooming and all that good stuff i'm an only child and i'm i'm responsible and would allways have extra time to spend with it and take it out and do all that stuff i'm moving into a new house that my mom is going to buy so yes there aloud i know they don't bond to much with other people exept there owner but its mine so i wouldn't have a problem i travel to a different state every year for summer vacation i've been told that as long as your dog is able to fit on your lap then it can ride on the plane for free please help i know you're young caring and dying to have a pom but be warned i had one delightful one for years effie i ended up having to foster her out to a couple of old ladies who were looking for one to give her daughter up in ny so she could have companion so effie is very happy now not that she wasn't and i do miss her at times but when you bring the dog home make sure of who the dog initially bonds with i got her when she was almost a yr old but she ended up bonding with my daughter the x she was about but i ended up doing the maintenance grooming vet etc also grooming takes about an hour i always did it myself if u go out that's about every wks kd grew up moved out got her own dogs you must be calm around these dogs do not treat them as children or they will dominate you because you won't realize it but if u treat them as child you're actually nurturing encouraging their crazy behaviors of running snapping jumping yapping etc you have to be calm and firm teach them to obey follow your desired movements you won't realize this but they will become snappish if u dont' and by that time it cd be too late be better if you actually look for a beagle to lbs much more calmer easier to train more laid back type of doggie it's just a tip hope you get one that you can love and train but remember you must stay calm be their pack leader and don't let them lead you you calmly let them know what to do don't jerk them hit them or scold always praise like a child ignore the bad move them into the good for praise minimal movements best now i have lber beagle walker hound mix very docile gentle well trained goes w me just about anywhere i cn take her yrs old lovely creature sleeps on top of bed with me but in her own spot on her own towel josey truly a pal take your x and think carefully about choice of breed gonna be with you for long time their life up to avg years good luck mrs turner va Dog training Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Housebreaking Pitaten Pok__mon Live!
