my dog has an eye sores from allergies and needs to stop scratching alternative to e collar my dog has allergies and the skin around his eyes is tender and swollen he keeps scratching and rubbing at his eyes and they are now raw the vet recommended an e collar but i am hoping there is an alternative i need something that would cover his eyes so that he won't scratch but will still allow him to eat and play he's only a year old any suggestions would be helpful he is on allergy medicine which helps prevent the problem from growing worse we have isolated the source of the allergies my concern is that while the sores are trying to heal he keeps scratching at them like a child with chicken pox any suggetions on preventing him from scratching his eyes would help ps our vet is very helpful and has suggested an e collar i am just wondering if there is something else out there for situations like this nevermind very few people have actually read the question and the majority of the answers have been silly and things i had already stated in the question i was looking for something to prevent him from pawing at his eyes he takes benadryl the allergies are not from his food they are from a plant that was in the yard our vet gave us eye salve but he is still scratching at the wounds around his eyes so that they cannot heal like i said it is like a child that is recovering from chicken pox the sores are still there and itchy even though the kid isn't sick anymore so sorry to hear he is so miserable i would take the vet's suggestion and use the e collar he probably won't have to use it very long just till the eye problem is better maybe a week or two but you will feel better not having to see him scratching his eyes all the time good luck Allergy Tattoo Hay fever Chickenpox Eczema Cat Guinea pig Breastfeeding Common cold Yarrow Smallpox Mouth ulcer Fancy rat Kodocha Syphilis First aid Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Domestic rabbit Prostate cancer The Contender (television series) Charles Darwin's illness Dog training Group A streptococcal infection Asthma Radiation therapy Tuberculosis Alcoholics Anonymous Medicine Shaggy dog story Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Episodes of Lost (Season 1) M.A.U.R.I.C.E.
