i'm not happy with what my dog has just done he's in the dog house took my dog out for a nice walk this morning he had a nice breakfast cuddles etc he's not allowed on beds so what does he do this morning he goes upstairs jumps on my bed and pees on it why would he do that he's had his op if that means anything so what did i do to deserve that i'm not speaking to him at the moment at least i did my tinkle in own bed and not his dogs still mark their territory even after being doctored the act it performed is actually an act of saying that it likes you a real lot but you need to establish who's the boss once it is established that you're the boss and such acts are not acceptable it should be ok establish your authority in a loving and firm way maybe he was excited at the recent affection by the way if someone else has used the bed also especially a male and he is new to doing this the dog maybe saying this is my friend you what are you the other person sharing the bed think your doing enjoy all the relationships that you have in a loving forgiving and appropriate way kind regards enoch EastEnders Humphrey Bogart Shaggy dog story Avenue Q Theory of conduct Angel (vampire) Happy Tree Friends Rocko's Modern Life Physical intimacy A Milhouse Divided Sin Toilet humour About a Boy A Course In Miracles Maison Ikkoku The Fairly OddParents Grandview, U.S.A.
