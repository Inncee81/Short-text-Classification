my dog will not stop peeing in the house i adopted my dog from the humane society in may about months ago and she was already crate trained and mostly house trained she had a problem chewing things up so we would say no in a firm voice and sometimes if it was very bad we would rub or nose in it or smack her on the butt the problem is she would pee as if she was afraid each time she knew we were angry at her now we can't discipline her any time she does something wrong because she pees everywhere even all over herself so if she pees on the floor and we say no she just keeps peeing and tries to run and hide i'm wondering if she was abused before we got her and what we can do to abate it if anything we are strapped for cash so we can't afford any expensive dog therapy if it exists but i would appreciate any and all suggestions never use your hand to discipline a dog use a newspaper when she sees your hand coming at her she doesn't know if she's gonna get a pet or a slap she is very submissive and insecure it will take a lot of patience on your part when you see her do something wrong don't yell at her just say 'noooooo' in a warning voice but without scaring her send her out to pee more often and take away the water from her after she drank and give it back once she when to the bathroom that will help you while trying to figure it out Dog training Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Shaggy dog story Sin City Toilet humour Fancy rat Housebreaking Avenue Q Ron and Fez Dog Humphrey Bogart The Inside Piccolo Junior Saga Cat The Marshall Mathers LP El Chavo del Ocho Spanking Theory of conduct Traumatic incident reduction EastEnders Lisa the Vegetarian Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Kim Possible Buttocks Milton H.
