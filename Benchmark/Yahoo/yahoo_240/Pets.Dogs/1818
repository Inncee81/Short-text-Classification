quote from cynthia tucker's current editorial says it all if vick is guilty he should go to prison if he has been savage enough and stupid enough to breed dogs to fight and then kill them if they lose he deserves to pay the price from what i can tell vick was allowed to lose football games without fear of being electrocuted the rest of her article concerned the death of year old annaijh rolax who was shot dead a week ago as she sat at her computer in her bedroom in southwest atlanta she was a straight a student and well loved police say she was just collateral damage a tragic consequence of poor marksmanship according to authorities the gunman was aiming at a robbery victim when the bullet went astray why aren't people as outraged by her death as we are about vick's dogs the main point to me is that while the death of the little girl is appalling someone will be punished for it with the abuse and death of the dogs it's not a sure thing that anything will happen to michael vick even if he is found guilty in many states animal abuse is still a misdemeanor i live in one of those states i can hang my dog from a tree and beat him to death but if you try to stop me i can shoot you for trespassing pretty messed up if you ask me i firmly believe in the aspca's motto that we are their voice maybe those of us who believe that are just being more vocal about dog rights Beltway sniper attacks Capital punishment EastEnders Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Provisional Irish Republican Army Columbine High School massacre Sin City Atlanta Falcons Mumia Abu-Jamal Human rights in post-Saddam Hussein Iraq Melbourne gangland killings Glen Jacobs American Psycho Murder Theory of conduct Sharon Tate Punisher Women in Islam Shankill Butchers A Course In Miracles Necrophilia Al-Aqsa Intifada Reservoir Dogs Symbionese Liberation Army Lynching in the United States The X-Files (season 1) Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Domestic violence John F.
