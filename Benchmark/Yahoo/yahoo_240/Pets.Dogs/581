what breed is my puppy i recently adopted a puppy from a local shelter and am interested in finding out what breed he is mixed with all i know for sure is that his mom is a shar pei he is a very big boy growing very fast at months and a little over lbs the people at the shelter said he might be mixed with great dane mainly because of his size but i also think he looks a bit like a shepherd so far he's a great dog he picks up on training very fast and is extremely sociable i need some other opinions on what he might be mixed with i included two pics hope anyone can give me some insight http img imageshack us my php image therockqu jpg http img imageshack us my php image therock gb jpg awww he is gorgeous and good for you for adopting the shelter people are right he does look like he might have some great dane in him i don't see any shar pei at all yeah i think there might be some shepherd in there you can also order kits to get his dna tested so you know exactly what he is but if its not that important to you and people ask say i am the good person that adopted a shelter dog i love him and he has been a great companion i don't really care what type of dog he is as long as he is happy and healthy or something like that or he was a shelter dog all we know is that his mom was a shar pei but if none of this appeals to you just get his dna tested hope i wasn't too harsh on you but the truth is you adopted a shelter dog go you you got him out of his misery go you and what you know is what you know and you cant change that except with an expensive dna test just be happy that you have your dog and he is happy and healthy good luck Dog Mixed-breed dog Shar Pei Dobermann Golden Retriever Socialization Nintendogs Dog breed Schutzhund Belgian Shepherd Dog Pet skunk Theory of conduct Havanese German Shepherd Dog Dog training Labrador Retriever Korea Jindo Dog The Fairly OddParents Jon Secada Social rule Housebreaking Great Dane Working dog Domestic rabbit Skinny Puppy Rescue group Smooth Collie Australian Cattle Dog Pekingese Mastiff Game show Border Terrier Basset Hound Mange The Realm of the Elderlings/Characters Puppy mill Shaggy dog story Animal rights Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier West Highland White Terrier Saint American Pit Bull Terrier PHP Animal shelter Pitaten Billboard Hot 100 Livestock Scooby-Doo Kodocha 2000 Australian Grand Prix Animal testing Laura Schlessinger Canary Terri Schiavo American Kennel Club Episodes of Lost (Season 1) HTML element Akita Inu Finnish Spitz Maltese (dog) Border Collie The Ashlee Simpson Show American Eskimo Dog Health insurance Kit Kat Ren and Stimpy Sheep husbandry Miscarriage of justice Bayesian inference Guide dog English Cocker Spaniel Irish Wolfhound English Setter Fancy rat Keeshond Hamster Doug Rocko's Modern Life Docking Yorkshire Terrier Paranoia Agent Molecular systematics Rugrats Infantilism Fast-food restaurant Breed standard Ieoh Ming Pei HTML Poodle HIV test Italian Greyhound Insulin Ashanti (singer) Gerald Durrell Alaskan Malamute Skye Terrier Dog agility Oasis (band) Stem cell
