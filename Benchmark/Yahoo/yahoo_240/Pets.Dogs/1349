i think my dog could be mental i have a shih tzu who is around two years old or so whenever i touch her tail or uncoil it or mess with her tail in anyway she viciously chases it barking quite loud and whatnot she won't stop until i scold her but occasionally i've noticed that whenever i handle my other dog she'll start doing it can anyone maybe give me an idea of why she could be doing that and also how i can get her to stop it for good my dog did something similar to this do you brush her it is summer time in the us at least and dogs can become very irritated by shed hair just sitting there also instead of scolding her grab her and hold her head to your chest firmly but not tightly and talk to her in a calm quiet toned voice Dog training Dog Keeshond Garfield Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Singlish Basset Hound Housebreaking Obedience training Reservoir Dogs Police dog Rottweiler Professional wrestling aerial techniques Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog Aerial (dance move) Kodocha The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Timpani Late Night with Conan O'Brien The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Great Teacher Onizuka Skateboarding trick Shih Tzu Dragon boat Gray Wolf Hansel und Gretel Manx (cat) Sesshomaru Professional wrestling throws Professional wrestling holds Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Finnish Spitz Cat RuneScape quests Le Malade imaginaire The Price Is Right Dog agility Characters of Lost Tag Conspiracy (TNG episode) Men in Black Azumanga Daioh Beagle Sinfest Tom and Jerry (MGM) Traumatic incident reduction Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Labrador Retriever Pok__mon Colosseum Xenomorph The Death Gate Cycle Carl Barks Human voice Shetland Sheepdog Skye Terrier Static Shock Milton H.
