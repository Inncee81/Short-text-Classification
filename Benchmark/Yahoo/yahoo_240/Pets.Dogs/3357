what does it mean when a dog digs a hole and lies down in it my shepherd mix is about years old and is restricted to a gentle leader outdoors it has been very very hot and whether it is the heat her noise phobia thunder guns planes etc or something else is bothering her she doesn't want to take a long walk she has to be leashed because she has a streak of fear aggression and cannot be relied upon not to run off helter skelter after a squirrel motor cycle etc even though she knows to come when called and does except when carried away on more important matters i know that this is my fault though i will say that she has been difficult to train she needs a fenced in yard with supervision i just wondered if there was any special signifigance to the digging in the dirt she loves to do this for fun and when she is mad and lying in it she also loves to just lie down in a grassy place and become immovable roll and roll one of her nicknames is cinnamon roll she is definitely slowing down please be constructive keeping cool in the cool dirt instinct dog whisper cesar milan national geographic channel to assist to make puppy happier long fur heat age and the inability to sweat i can't blame her i would want to lie down in the dirt and keep cool myself an animal has it right no pressure no cares what is better than lying down and looking at the world and just enjoying life nature no stress we need to follow animal's lead and don't worrry just be happy at the simple pleasures in life Dog training Dog Hiking German Shepherd Dog American Pie (song) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Charles Manson Cat Jet engine Livestock Characters in the Smurfs The Death Gate Cycle Labrador Retriever Nuclear reactor The Amber Spyglass -phobia Internal ballistics Welding Michel Henry Garfield Guinea pig Brewery Heavy metal music Hamster The Beatles Drill bit Dog agility Thermal power station Social rule Ranma __ characters Swimming Paranoia Agent Tag Theory of conduct Volleyball Invader Zim Aerial (dance move) Ferret CatDog The Beatles discography Anchor Leash Combine (Half-Life 2) Lake Socialization Bong Lake District Basset Hound Helter Skelter Tire Paul McCartney Fire fighting Casting Stirling engine Electric motor Night (book) Domestic rabbit Tank Cro Heat Motor oil Humphrey Bogart Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Stress (physics) Crate training The Isley Brothers Golden Retriever Movie projector Kodocha Insomnia TGV USS Tunny (SS-282) Spark plug Camp Lazlo Dean Koontz Swimming pool Diesel engine Carnegie Mellon University Golf Timeline of alternative rock Platypus Fancy rat Skinny Puppy Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Species Azumanga Daioh Trapping Alaskan Malamute Parachute The Beatles (album) Airsoft Zoophilia YuYu Hakusho Sharon Tate Anger management Gerald Durrell
