are bullmatiffs known for being dangerous and aggressive my stepdad wants to get one but after hearing about what happen to the care taker who was mauled to death at actor ving rhames' home i'm kinda nervous now this guy had work for rhames as a care taker of these dogs for years what do you supposed could've happened to make these mastiffs turn on him and kill him any logical explanations out there for this tragedy i certainly hope not and am glad you posted the question and appreciate the links other answers have provided in what i had read about the bull mastiff is they were bred as grounds keepers dogs to guard against poachers by knocking down and holding poachers for the grounds keeper what i had read gave me the impression they were not bred to be vicious in terms of biting or mauling just holding we have a month old bull mastiff we got for protection of out two small dogs a long haired chihuahua and a miniature dachshund we live in the foothills with various predators lost one of our dachshunds to them and decided they needed a big buddy he plays well and gently with the smaller dogs probably weigh in at lbs soaking wet and after a big meal i have a photo of him taking a nap with my year old grandson he stays on the property no fences around here and we have over two and a half acres and so far has been accepting of anyone who comes on the property it's my understanding there were three bull mastiffs taking part in the incident you mentioned my thoughts on it would be he only had to upset one of the dogs for the other two to surrender to the pack instinct and join in three large dogs like that all taking part in an aggressive manner bad things are in the works we got our bull mastiff from a local family who had both parents when we pulled on their property the dogs didn't even bark showed no signs of aggression when we got out of the car and the mother was completely accepting when we went to look at the puppies i got the first pup so he was the pick of the litter and i look for a pup that appears to seek attention from people shows no signs of fear or aggression which dutch did not plus the fact that he followed me around and sat under my feet three times when we were viewing the pups and they shared my birthday it was detiny as with any breed when you go to look at puppies look for personality and demeanor to help find the right pup for you good luck Dog training Gray Wolf Mastiff Guinea pig Dachshund Hamster Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Social rule Cat Pulp Fiction American Pit Bull Terrier Mixed-breed dog Nintendogs Poker jargon Garfield Shaggy dog story Milton H.
