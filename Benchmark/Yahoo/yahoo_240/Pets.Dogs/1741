humane society legal issues we recently adopted a pet from the humane society our dog lady was sick at the time we picked her up and so they asked us to bring her home give her medication and then bring her back to have her spayed as is turns out lady was pregnant about four weeks at the time of adoption we are excited to have the puppies but a little distraught because we did not plan for this in our budget my question is does anyone know of a good way of approaching the humane society to have them take the responsibility of paying our vet bills had they done their job we would have never had to go we did try to contact them but they never returned our phone calls and will no longer take ours we are just young and together and do not know what to do i am just horrified at the lack of responsibility shown by the humane society any suggestions if you know what we can do help please understand we were highly advised by our vet to have her spayed immediately after the puppies are born for any of you who have something negative to say about us letting her have the puppies i do not believe in abortions after a certain point in dogs and neither did our vet i am not adding to the puppy overpopulation problem either because i found homes for each and every puppy to be born there was also no contract signed saying that we had to bring her back the humane society does spaying as a favor to prevent the over population problem so i am not looking to be scolded for being a bad parent to my dog because i have done nothing wrong puppies cost money i know that but we didn't adopt dogs we adopted one i was just looking for some help so if you have nothing to say except to scold save it also the humane society asked us to bring her home without spaying her we didnt steal her from the shelter before it was to be done the appointment was made but the day before it was set up they called us and asked us to bring her home they should help you with these expenses they frequently get animals in there that are already pregnant you need to go in person to figure this out but they should help you so dont worry too much they are almost always understaffed and overwhelmed with phone calls for your own sake of mind you need to do this in person to know that things will be ok you didnt know she was pregnant and neither did they i have in the past looked at puppies for adoption through the humane society and they were staying with the mother's foster mom your situation is slightly different in that you adopted the mom but you didnt count on the babies if i were you i would jump in the car and go in person to sort this out asap i would use some common sense in negotiating though which is to always always expect the best in people in situations like these go in assuming they are going to help you and ask how they would like to proceed assuming they will do what is right when you expect the best in people they will frequently deliver if you go in there upset you might leave even more so they have undoubtedly dealt with this before you want to have a good relationship with someone there because unless you are giving the mother back to them you will need a friendly contact there to help you with the process of having puppies and fostering them until they are ready for new owners make sure you know who that nice contact person is before you
