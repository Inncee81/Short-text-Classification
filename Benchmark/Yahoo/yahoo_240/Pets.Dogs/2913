do you carry water on your walks with your dog apparently the welfare law for pets is going to change so there must be a constant supply of water if anyone can offer me a link to anything to do with this that would be a great help i just wondered how many of you bring water on all your walks with your dog it is something that never occurred to me i only walk to the park with mine she gets all she wants when she gets home may i add i don't live somewhere warm whatsoever there is always surplus water rain heh anyway it depends on how long the walk how hot the day whether there are likely to be puddles or other sources of water en route a half hour to an hour's walk in your local park should not require you to cart along water for your dog unless they are extremely active and it's a very hot day Energy development Solar power Environmental concerns with electricity generation Guadalupe Mountains National Park Water Billboard Hot 100 Hot dog Climate of the United Kingdom Iditarod Rebreather Distributed generation Hiking Bird migration Dog Japanese tea ceremony Microeconomics Supply and demand Furnace Lake District Heat Customs and etiquette of Japan Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Gravity 2003 North America blackout Obedience training Hamster Sauna Severe weather terminology (United States) Drowning Weather lore Taikyoku shogi Shaggy dog story Domestic rabbit Nuclear fallout Hunting Pet skunk Zion National Park Dairy Escalator House Mouse Surplus product Community emergency response team Scuba set Rice Steven Wright Appalachian Trail Water purification Hot Springs, Arkansas Day 1925 serum run to Nome Labor-power Dnipropetrovsk Thermoregulation Rail transport in Ireland Industrial Revolution Solar variation Death Valley National Park USS Trigger (SS-237) Naval mine Golden Retriever 2005 Iditarod Galveston Hurricane of 1900 Tide Nile Fire fighting Climate of Salt Lake City John McDouall Stuart Nuclear power Emergency preparedness USS Walke (DD-723) Steel Water resources Carbon dioxide Eldfell Natural gas RuneScape locations Baseball Twelve leverage points Las Vegas metropolitan area National Weather Service Hybrid vehicle Economic relations of Japan Surplus value Renewable energy The Amazing Race Firefighter Dog training Geography of Africa Social Security (United States) Welding Geothermal areas of Yellowstone Keeshond Transportation of Los Angeles AFI 100 Years series Geography of Bolivia Perth, Western Australia Rosa Parks
