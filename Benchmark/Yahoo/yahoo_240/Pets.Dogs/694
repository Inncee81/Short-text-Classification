do you think todays adoption process is necessary the adoption centers today often require adopters allow a home inspection and pass on everything a z not to mention pre adoption forms normal adoption forms and even post adoption forms i understand they want a good home for the dogs but they offer nothing to help you make sure it will work we want to adopt from a shelter that doesn't offer a in home period where the animals can live with you nor do they offer a backout or return period if it doesn't work out where will this crazy crap end when they get a sample from you not to mention the staff are nasty as hell if you say go to another shelter that would work except i am the picky adopter i don't like too many animals enough to adopt them i searched petfinder over dogs and only i would adopt yep i know picky i am i'd gladly jump through hoops for them if they aren't such assholes i'm so surprised that they are being so rude to you some people are just a holes and will never change the fact is you deal with them a little and then you'll get your dog i'm sorry to hear they are not being encouraging as for the process unfortunately it's necessary lots of people have adopted pets so they can sell them for research sell them for a higher price or even abuse them there are people who hoard animals and ones who just dispose of them when they get tired of them so all the questions and the homecheck are for that they just want to make sure you're a normal person just getting the dog as a pet when they do the home check they don't want to go through your stuff they just want to make sure you don't live in incredible filth hoard animals or some other freak situation the goal is to make sure the dog finds a permanent home with you i am so glad to hear that you are adopting these people are messed up adopting is about rescuing your new dog i hope you will still consider rescue Pet skunk Social rule Working dog Community emergency response team President (game) Lisa the Vegetarian RuneScape quests Shit Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Infantilism Futurama (TV series - season 5) Rescue group Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Supply and demand Sin City Hamster Philosophical skepticism The Death Gate Cycle Microchip implant (animal) Animal shelter American Pit Bull Terrier The Star Wars Holiday Special Teacher's Pet (Disney) Neopets Sampling (music) Kodocha The Hobbit The Smoking Room Domestic rabbit Gold standard Make money fast Emergency preparedness Scientology beliefs and practices EastEnders Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Incarnations of Immortality Blackjack Adoption Obedience training Negima Microeconomics Dog agility Pump It Up Good Times Aphasia Floppy disk Labor theory of value Oxford English Dictionary The Marshall Mathers LP People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals E85 Windows XP Kasparov versus The World Upholstery Friends My Parents are Aliens Game show The Apprentice 2 Dog training Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Russian joke E-mail spam Treehouse of Horror VIII Chess strategy and tactics Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Blood (computer game) One Piece minor characters Hearing impairment Ron and Fez Socialization Housebreaking Baroque chess Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Richard Chase Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Daylight saving time Knots Landing Dilbert Expert system Zoophilia The Ashlee Simpson Show Paige Matthews Laura Schlessinger Unemployment Time Out of Mind I Want to Hold Your Hand Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Domain Name System Past teachings of Prem Rawat Urbanization
