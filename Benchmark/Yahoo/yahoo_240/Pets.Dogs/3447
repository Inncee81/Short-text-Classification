pekingese dog question i have a dog which is pekingese since the last weeks some of her hair are sticking together even though i bath her it still is wat shall i do and does anyone know how can i cut her nails or do i have to take it to the vet ow and she is months old do you mean the hair is just sticky or she actually has matts pekingese need to be groomed daily or at least every days i own a pekingese and i'm trying to keep him in his full coat i've talked to many groomers and they definately recommend daily brushing with a pin brush and a comb behind the ears also use a leave in conditioning spray pekingese's coats are never supposed to be brushed dry thats what the leave in spray does if your dog has matts you'll have to work extra hard to get them out or go to a professional groomer bathing a dog that already has matts will cause the matts to get tighter and tighter its very uncomfortable for a dog b c they get really tight to the skin and start pulling use baby oil or conditioner on the matts and gently use a metal comb to try to pull them apart if you can't get them apart like that try thinning shears to cut through the matts and then comb them out if you still can't get them out you'll need to have her shaved or have a professional groomer try to get them out for you nail trimming is easy i like guillotine style clippers just clip the very tips off you'll see a red vein in the nail called the quick make sure you don't cut into that otherwise your dog will bleed if you're uncomfortable doing that just have a groomer do it Haircut Manicure Pekingese Textile manufacturing Pottery Knife Keeshond Dog Shetland Sheepdog Cat Hair Woodworking Airedale Terrier Professional wrestling match types Breastfeeding Portuguese Water Dog Nail (anatomy) Brush Drill bit Professional wrestling holds Guinea pig Nail (engineering) Diving Shaving Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Screw Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Poodle Weaving Lawn mower Dog training Punt (boat) Road Rovers Violin Nine Inch Nails Garfield Psoriasis My Little Pony Brazing Textile manufacturing terminology Social rule Diving suit Upholstery Pubic hair Tooth Elephant Comanche Beard Fur Basic English Kodocha Depilation Chopsticks Casting Havanese MTV2 Fecal incontinence Razor American Eskimo Dog Domestic rabbit Siberian Husky Fancy rat Christmas tree Seismic retrofit Baldness Ferret Bacon Leaf Callus Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Floppy disk Bulk vending Mixed martial arts Happy Tree Friends Strap-on dildo Pet skunk RuneScape quests Wound New York Giants Handloading 2005 Iditarod Crab louse Menstrual cup Radiation therapy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Skinhead Plastic Plame affair Barber Die (manufacturing) Glossary of American football Hamster Milton H.
