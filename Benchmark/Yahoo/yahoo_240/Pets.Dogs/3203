which one is better a shetland sheepdog or a labrador retriever which one is friendly with strangers friendly with children and easy to train the lab would be a better choice as i have had the shetland sheepdog the sheepdog is extremely smart they are good with kids if they are raised around them but they tend to nip at the heels of running kids its a herding instinct and they are very easy to train the downside is is they arent stranger friendly and are very protective of family especially if there are kids around labs love everybody but also have a high energy span and love to run our sheepdog never had to be put on a leash as he just naturally learned to walk right by our sides anywhere we went also the sheepdog learned a few other things just by observing and we never had to really put much training into him as he learned on his own he was a very good dog but labs are good too just remember they are very energetic Shetland Sheepdog Dog Nintendogs Golden Retriever Labrador Retriever Dog training Herding dog Border Collie Australian Shepherd Sheepdog trial Mixed-breed dog German Shepherd Dog Polish Lowland Sheepdog Australian Cattle Dog Belgian Shepherd Dog Working dog Old English Sheepdog Dog agility Horse gait Tibetan Mastiff Cat Icelandic Sheepdog Collie Humphrey Bogart Parachuting Brown Bear Scooby-Doo Xiaolin Showdown Theodicy Invader Zim Shetland Islands Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Son Goku (Dragon Ball) About a Boy The Fairly OddParents Schutzhund Human Mastiff KaBlam!
