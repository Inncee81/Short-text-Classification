has anyone ever had a pet dog that was diagnosed with an underactive thyroid i took my dog to the vet today for boosters and they noticed she had a little patch of hair missing ftom her tail she asked if lucy chewed on that area and i have never seen her do that so she asked if she could test her thyroid with a blood test and it came back at the lowest end of the normal range she said we would have to retest in months and if it dips below that magic mark on the scale she would have to go on meds twice daily for a month if you have experience with this please tell me what you know we love her dearly but at the same time she is a dog what would an underactive thyroid mean for her just curious please don't judge me about saying she is only a dog she is overly loved in our home i just don't want to throw money at the vet if i don't have to hypothyroidism is a fairly common condition in dogs the good news is that it's also fairly easy and pretty cheap to treat usually dogs go on thyroid medication my vet uses thyrosin often just one pill twice daily dogs that are treated especially if they are caught early before symptoms are advanced live very normal lives usually they just urinate a little more because of the thyrosin dogs that are not treated are more prone to infections obeisity and dramatic and sometimes dangerous changes in temperament Diabetes mellitus Thyroid Chronic fatigue syndrome Guinea pig Shetland Sheepdog Fancy rat Hyperthyroidism Coeliac disease Turner syndrome Autoimmune diseases Cancer HIV test Urinary incontinence Dog Rabies Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Hamster Insulin Multiple sclerosis Tobacco smoking Amiodarone Pneumonia Pet skunk Thyroid cancer Traumatic brain injury Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Dobermann Tocopherol Dyslexia Bipolar disorder Vitamin C Drug test Equine conformation Psoriasis Migraine Labrador Retriever Endocrinology Endometriosis Ferret Cephalic disorder Stroke Acne Heartworm Congenital hypothyroidism Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Ovarian cancer Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Ebola Malaria Narcolepsy Folic acid Growth hormone treatment Lupus erythematosus Menstrual cycle Shaggy dog story Abortion Post-traumatic stress disorder Leptospirosis Asthma Dog training Alternative medicine Traumatic incident reduction Garfield Docking Animal testing German Shepherd Dog Atherosclerosis Cardiac arrhythmia Graves-Basedow disease Chlorpromazine Epilepsy Sleep apnea Diazepam Glaucoma The Fairly OddParents Hypoglycemia Dog agility Prolactinoma Multiple myeloma Medicine Adult attention-deficit disorder Stomach cancer Anxiety Growth hormone deficiency Schizophrenia Terri Schiavo Tuberculosis Atrial septal defect Sickle-cell disease First aid Antipsychotic Cat Hearing impairment Chernobyl accident Hepatitis C Syphilis
