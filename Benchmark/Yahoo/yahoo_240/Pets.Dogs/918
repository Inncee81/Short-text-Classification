is it okay to vaccinate a possibly ill dog she is months overdue for her year booster dog has had chronic diarrhea for last months since eating cat food possibly spoiled negative test results for parasites was controlled but not cured with antibiotics and bland diet but problem returned once rice diet was reduced has now been put back on the antibiotics and rice chicken diet and vet says she can be vaccinated in weeks once the meds have again controlled the diarrhea vet says she may end up on these antibiotics long term he does not know yet what is wrong with her she had her rabies shot months ago but not the year booster yet do you think its okay to go ahead and vaccinate has your dog been put on a different diet to test for possible food allergies to her present dog food many dogs can't tolerate gluten at all wheat barley etc and corn can be bad for dogs because it adds too much bulk and can rob the body of niacin i had gut problems with my dog after i fed him a cheap corn based food so rice is often the best option for many dogs with sensitive stomaches as you've found out soy can also be a problem for some dogs i believe so do some careful label reading in picking a dog food to get her back onto in the future also overfeeding a dog can cause diarrhea other factors could be thyroid disease chronic gut irritation etc because this is really long for a dog to have chronic diarrhea i'm glad you're back on the chicken rice diet hamburger rice also works you might consider adding in a little canned pumpkin it helps with diarrhea and my dog loved the taste are you supplementing with vitamins i think i'd probably postpone the vaccination a bit until she's been able to rest from the diarrhea for at least a week or two and her immune system seem to be ok which is what your vet is suggesting rabies vaccines are quite safe but it's not necessary to vaccinate her so soon after her first shot and could be adverse to her health so if you want to wait months it wouldn't hurt her http www homestead com vonhapsburg haywardstudyonvaccines html Diarrhea Folic acid Food Nutrition Tocopherol Guinea pig Pneumonia Pet skunk Cat Rabies Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cancer Vitamin C Milk Fecal incontinence Dog Allergy Crohn's disease Breastfeeding Common cold Ferret Multiple sclerosis Veganism Genetically modified food AIDS Prostate cancer Clinical depression Diabetes mellitus Atkins Nutritional Approach Alzheimer's disease Vegetarianism Hamster Autoimmune diseases Homeopathy Omega-3 fatty acid Colorectal cancer Ulcerative colitis Raw food diet Antibiotic Domestic rabbit Malaria Domestication Psoriasis Autism Chagas disease Escherichia coli O157:H7 Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Rice Asthma Vitamin Thimerosal Tuberculosis Mouth ulcer Acne Lactose intolerance Animal testing Medicine Lyme disease Multiple chemical sensitivity Alternative medicine Garlic Chocolate Tooth enamel Irritable bowel syndrome Influenza Hypoglycemia Foodborne illness HIV vaccine Botulism Rocky Mountain spotted fever Cirrhosis Vaccine Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Mosquito Hepatitis C Kitten Anthrax Herpes simplex virus Ramen Rotavirus Charles Darwin's illness Fibromyalgia Anemia Poliomyelitis Autism epidemic Cuisine of Denmark First aid Chicken Cyanocobalamin
