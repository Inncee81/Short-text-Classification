new ish to owning a dog chihuahua puppy i received a chihuahua puppy from my mother's friend a week ago mother's friend has her litter mate i believe she is about months old she has become quite attached myself and my mother barks at my brother who rarely comes around her my problem is that the dog sleeps with my mother in her crate during the night gets up when my mother does runs around for a while and is transfered into my area of the house if i don't have my door open she'll whine and whine there or whine if i don't have a way for her to get up to my bed to sleep with me if i do let her up onto the bed she greets me excitedly and calms down for sleep i'd like to know how to get her to stop whining for me in the morning so much she gets the whole living room area to play in but won't wait for me to wake up on my own time hope that make sense also if you have any tips for general chihuahua care or getting her to not bark at my brother are liked too she wants to be with her pack that's you make or buy some stairs so she can get into the bed with you on her own she'll hop up and snuggle and go right to sleep when she barks at your brother verbally reprimand her and ask your brother to pet or hold her a treat wouldn't go amiss either she'll soon see him as friend and part of her pack and stop barking at him chihuahuas are great dogs and can be cared for like any other dog except that because of their size they are more delicate you'll also notice that your chi will scurry away when you go to pick her up not to worry that's instinctive start training her to a word like lift when you're going to pick her up she'll soon make the connection and will prepare to be lifted on command Housebreaking Dog Dog training Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Contender (television series) Sin City Nintendogs Guinea pig Hamster Cat Insomnia Crate training The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Shetland Sheepdog RuneScape quests Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Border Terrier Piccolo Junior Saga Humphrey Bogart Eddie Guerrero Brian Griffin Mixed-breed dog Fancy rat Negima Combine (Half-Life 2) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Lady and the Tramp Futurama (TV series - season 5) Marie Antoinette Gerald Durrell Domestic rabbit Miss Saigon Skinny Puppy Social rule The Big Sleep Manos: The Hands of Fate USS Sea Dog (SS-401) Dog breed Basset Hound Garfield Mattress 101 Dalmatians: The Series Socialization The Birds (film) Jayne Mansfield The Shining (film) Knots Landing The Death Gate Cycle Friends Obedience training Ocean's Twelve The Fairly OddParents Manual transmission Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Catcher in the Rye Pet skunk The Star Wars Holiday Special Urinary incontinence Night (book) Rose (Doctor Who) Ferret Ren and Stimpy Carl Barks One Tree Hill (TV series) Labrador Retriever Artificial selection AFI 100 Years series Ben Johnson (athlete) Whippet 2005 trial of Michael Jackson The Family from One End Street Snoopy USS William B.
