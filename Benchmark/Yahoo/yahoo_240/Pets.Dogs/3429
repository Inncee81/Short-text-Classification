any hints to give dogs their medicine i just brought my dog to the vet and it turns out she might be really sick while waiting for the blood work results they gave me an antibiotic and some liquid medicine if she vomits but she has to take her antibiotic twice a day until it's gone well it's a little tablet and she does not like it well who does like to take pills really but if i put it in food she would eat around it i tried crushing it up and spreading it on bread but she was not having that eventually i had to crush it up and spread it on her tongue if this is what i have to do i will do it as i want her to be alright but i was wondering if anyone else might have had this same problem i was thinking maybe i could crush it and put it in a doggie ice cream any ideas would be great thanks in advance cheese make multiple small balls of cheese with your fingers offer her a few to let her know it's good and she wants more then mold a small ball of cheese around her pill and down it goes the trick is the size of the cheese balls they need to be small enough that she will take them down whole if shes tries to chew them she'll find the pill and all hope is lost Dairy Cheese Cuisine of Denmark Hamster Livestock Breakfast Street food Tag Folic acid Bread Fancy rat Chocolate Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Cuisine of the Philippines Tocopherol Oral contraceptive Veganism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Naruto jutsu Psoriasis Tofu Gastroparesis 1957 World Series Vomiting Group A streptococcal infection Food Characters of Naruto Sonic Advance 3 Fecal incontinence Prostate cancer Blood Spidey Super Stories Caffeine Power Rangers: SPD Acne Antibiotic Common cold Piccolo Junior Saga Mid-Autumn Festival German cuisine Garfield Hamburger Atkins Nutritional Approach Jewish cuisine Dog training Gaia Online Book of Isaiah Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Medical cannabis Butter MRE Adjustable gastric band Dairy product YuYu Hakusho Eczema Happy Tree Friends Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Guinea pig First aid Roman eating and drinking Kashrut Kosher foods Rocky Mountain spotted fever Diarrhea Antibiotic resistance Patrick Star Tea Neighbours Fondue Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Aztec Vegetarianism Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dog Milk Methamphetamine Tooth enamel The Inside Traditional Chinese medicine Penicillin Tom Waits Natt__ Salad Fingers Fast-food restaurant Poker jargon Dumpling Sulfasalazine Kasparov versus The World Bagel Pizza Electrophysiology Migraine Potato chips Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Carbon dioxide Shaggy dog story Futurama (TV series - season 5)
