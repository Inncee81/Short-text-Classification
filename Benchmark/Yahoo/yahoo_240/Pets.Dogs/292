torn about what to do about adopted dog when you adopt a dog from a shelter it is hard to know what kind of personality they will have or how they will fit into your lifestyle i recently adopted a pomeranian cross who was taken to me immediatley so i had to have her unfortunalty there are two other adults in the house that are supposed to care for her but she does not like them one of them actually stays home all day and does the feeding etc so the theory of the others doing more doesnt work my dog is also like dr jeckal mr hyde as one time she will be nice to them while another time she will growl this was supposed to be a family dog and the shelter told us she was well behaved now i dont know what to do i dont think i can afford a behaviourist but have already read and tried some teqniques without success we've had her for about a month but since day one it seems like she has made up her mind about who she wants to interact with i must look like one of her previous owners because im the only one she will interact with i got her from a no kill shelter and the whole family did go to see her but it is still hard to tell in that atmosphere how they are going to be once home the shelter also can mislead you wow kiki b must have shelter phobia no reputable shelter would knowingly deceive a person about an adopted animal what would be the purpose a shelter's main goal is to find good homes for animals you are absolutely correct about not always knowing the dog's personality when you meet them in a shelter environment if you can imagine how animals end up in shelters living on their own on the streets having a loving owner die on them being left there by a family who doesn't want them anymore then there is the fact that they are now living in cages forget potty training because most shelters do not have enough volunteers to take the dogs for walks so they poop and pee in their cages as there is nothing else they can do and then there is the barking and the crying and the whining it goes on all the time so rest is out of the question and the stress level is immense alot of dogs in an environment like this actually shut down and go into survival mode once they do this it is difficult to judge what kind of personalities they have it is possible that the dog you adopted has some baggage that will make it impossible for you to keep her but in that case most shelters will take the dog back and armed with that new knowledge of her personality will attempt to find a better fit for her in a home in the future don't be discouraged about this it does happen and most shelters and rescue groups are used to it they are all doing the best they can with the info they have Dog training Shaggy dog story Theory of conduct Transactional analysis Housebreaking Pitaten Altruism Social rule Lie RuneScape quests The Sims Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Animal shelter Kodocha Scenes from a Memory Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Obedience training Jon Secada Golden Retriever Scientology beliefs and practices Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Alignment (role-playing games) Cyberspace Autism Overpopulation Domestic rabbit Cat Dog agility Socrates Social psychology Contract Crate training Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Epistemology Milton H.
