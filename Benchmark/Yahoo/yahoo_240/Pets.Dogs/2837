bullmastiff vs mastibull i have recently come across an up and coming breed called the mastibull american bulldog english mastiff i thought that's what a bullmastiff was but pictures of the two dogs look different and from what i have read the mastibull does not drool nearly as much as bullmastiffs there are slight differences between the two breeds and i can't understand how this is possible if the same two dogs are used to create two different breeds i am very interested in getting a mastibull and would really appreciate a website or contact information for mastibull breeders does anybody have information on the mastibull breed itself the breed is recognized on the achc american canine hybrid club one of the few websites i found on the breed is www simplymastiffs freeservers com and they seem like a ligit breeder go to the akc site and see if this mastibull is even a recognized breed and not just a mutt crossbreed cooked up by some cagy breeder to get people to buy her mutts seriously if the dog is a known breed the akc lists it if not it is a made up cross breed in short a mutt Mixed-breed dog American Kennel Club Dog American Pit Bull Terrier German Shepherd Dog Boston Terrier Labrador Retriever Selective breeding Dog breed Breed registry Mastiff Jack Russell Terrier Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show Pit bull Dog agility Chinook (dog) Obedience training Havanese Docking Border Collie Australian Silky Terrier Toy dog Tibetan Mastiff Golden Retriever Breed club Hybrid Australian Shepherd Catahoula Leopard Dog German Shorthaired Pointer Basset Hound French Bulldog Bull Terrier Species Whippet Dobermann Domestication Chihuahua (dog) Staffordshire Bull Terrier Appaloosa Bulldog Dog breeding Toy Fox Terrier Belgian Shepherd Dog Rat Terrier Australian Kelpie Pomeranian (dog) Akita Inu Australian Cattle Dog Newfoundland (dog) Working dog Terrier Dogue de Bordeaux American Cocker Spaniel Gray Wolf American Bulldog Smooth Collie Tenterfield Terrier English Springer Spaniel Breed standard Alaskan husky Cat Schutzhund Weimaraner Alaskan Malamute Great Dane Plant breeding Poodle Icelandic Sheepdog Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Dachshund English Cocker Spaniel Keeshond Tosa (dog) Redbone Coonhound Domestic rabbit Ferret Pug The Canine Mutiny Puppy mill Agriculture Beefalo The Origin of Species Basenji Black hole Portuguese Water Dog Beagle Flyball Greyhound Canary Fox Terrier Shetland Sheepdog Greater Swiss Mountain Dog Ibizan Hound Border Terrier Rottweiler Manx (cat) Dingo Siberian Husky
