what is with this dog's anxiety i found my border collie when he was about years old he came up to our house shaking in the pouring rain he is scared of thunder to the point where he has panic attacks and must be medicated with acepromazine he is very friendly and we have had him for months with no problems of aggression he seems so glad to be with us the problem is he wont play he would much rather lay around or just lick you to death he will not chase a ball and never has been taught a command in his life obviously does anyone know how to get my dog to play with me and do not say tie a steak around my neck please thanks dogs learn to play from each other a dog that hasn't had much socialization or attention may have to be taught how it won't be hard to teach your dog to play if you won't mind acting a little silly dogs invite each other to play using body language they bow wiggle and bark try this with your dog get down on your hands and knees or as close to his level as you can bend your elbows and lower your head then bark he'll probably tip his head and look at you as though you're nuts bounce up and down on your elbows a little and bark some more make it a happy bark not a gruff one after a minute or two he might start to bark back this is your cue to run away run a few steps turn back toward your dog get down bark and invite him to play again then run a few steps more and repeat the whole process even the most socially deprived dog will respond eventually he may be a little clumsy at first and unsure about what to do but he'll catch on i don't know if this will help but i sure gave it a shot Fast bowling Dog Dog training Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling aerial techniques Professional wrestling attacks Snooker Shaggy dog story Volleyball Glossary of climbing terms Mixed martial arts Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Carl Barks Cricket Cat Obedience training Glossary of partner dance terms Rugby union Tai Chi Chuan 1957 World Series Housebreaking USS Trigger (SS-237) Professional wrestling throws Tag Cleveland Browns Batting (cricket) New York Giants Swingout Softball Traumatic brain injury Equine conformation Columbine High School massacre Boxing Milton H.
