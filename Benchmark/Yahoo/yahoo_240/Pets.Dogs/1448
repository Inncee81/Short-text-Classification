what do i do about a dog that does nervous peeing she is a dog that belongs to a family member with a mental disability and we are taking care of her for the next year while he is in a rehab location not sure what has made her do this but even when you are just talking nicely to her she lays her ears back squints her eyes squats down and pees as she is running away i have tried everything possible to gain her trust even so far as babying her way more than i do my own dog but nothing seems to help any suggestions btw it is really starting to get annoying as my carpet is getting absolutely ruined it sounds like the dog has never been socialized don't reprimand her as this is an instinctive behavior frightening her will make it worse start taking her to obedience classes working with her and make sure she has a secure bed or crate where she can be she's obviously been through emoi tional trauma herself by learning obedience getting praised for doing what you want she'll build confidence will ultimately 'grow out of' this submissive behavior Dog training Dog Housebreaking Obedience training German Shepherd Dog Milton H.
