what is wrong with having an outside dog ok after seeing and answering a question about keeping a dog outside i have to wonder why most people in this forum have such a problem with it i have two dogs both are outside i live on acres of land and have a small country home my dogs get regular vet check ups they are not neglected or ignored in any way and i work with them for the majority of the day doing tasks on the ranch they have proper housing for winter and summer months and i take them inside should the weather be hazardous storms weather exceeding degrees or falling below degrees fahrenheit please tell me what is wrong with my situation i'm sure many people who keep their dogs outside live in similar situations my dogs are large and i think stuffing them in my bedroom home is more cruel than letting them have free range to roam on my land i understand that many people chain their dogs and neglect them and i agree that those situations are unacceptable however i think we need to give the people who post questions like this on y a the benefit of the doubt the people who post questions about keeping their dogs outside ask because they care about their animals and want to know what it best for them it is the people who do not ask these questions that we need to be concerned about because these people are the real culprits who abuse their animals and have no conscience to the environment their dog lives in i suppose my point is we need to stop attacking people who are asking these things like this if we have an opinion on the matter we should express it maturely and not grind out the ever popular omg yur a aminal abuzer roni i've already stated that i spend the majority of the day doing ranch work with them one is a shepherd and works cattle for me the other is a lab who sometimes retrieves but mostly walks the rounds with me checking fences or follows near my horse when we go riding debby j you make a very strong arguement and kudos to you for making your strong counter arguement while still maintaining a mature and logical approach to give a little more information to your points as far as breeds one dog is a yellow lab the other a black and tan shepherd mix the lab has a relatively thin coat the shepherd moreso so i really don't have a big fear of them overheating as i said if the weather get exceedingly hot i'll bring them in many times i'll give them a bath to cool them off or wet the porchboards to cool them down i had a kiddie pool once but they didn't take to it we have lakes on the property as well for the good point of leaving the property i am surrounded on three sides by ranchers' adjacent lands i'm friendly with all of them and they've met my dogs frequently and can recognize them the other side is connected to a dirt road which runs for a few miles in either direction sorry ran out of room you're right about the rabies situation my dogs have encountered one too many skunks for my liking they're always out on the prowl for wild animals and once they even caught and killed a fox very good point the small town that i live nearby has a population of about so it's very small and people are usually low income research labs are not common here the citizens had to fight just to keep a doctor's office alive and standing my dogs are working animals one herds my cows to the pens for the night and the other sometimes but not very often collects quail and dove from hunts i'm glad i asked this question i see a lot of interesting opinions i personally don't see anything wrong with an outside working dog i grew up on a acre farm and all the dogs were outside fixed up to date with shots and given food and given better shelter when the weather called for it otherwise they had a small strudy insulated leanto built onto the house where they slept and they were never chained they always knew to come when called i'm playing devils advocate here i think the issue a lot of people have can boil down to a city mouse vs country mouse situation a lot of city people just don't understand me when i try to explain that dogs function perfectly well outside and that pack order is actually strengthened by it pack leader gets best sleeping spot but will share when it's in the best interest of the pack makes sense to me but as a country person i am confused to no end by people who dress up their dogs for fun or carry them around like rag dolls to me they're living creatures that should be treated like living creatures not toys granted i have a snowsuit for my dog but it's to keep her from freezing when the snow flies i think the thought of keep a dog outside instead of coddling them is just a confusing concept to city people they see it as torture and as a country person i see all this dog mania as close to cruelty with the clothes and rediculous coddling and designer breeds again playing devil's advocate here people Horse Animal rights Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Cat
