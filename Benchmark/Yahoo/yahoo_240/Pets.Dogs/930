my dog acting weird today my dog started walking weird he's a lab and is years old at times it would be hard for him to sit eventually he did but he went very slowly and carefully another time was when he tried to lay down he was sitting but couldn't lay down he finally did but it took quite a few times also he's been backing up like walking backwards and leaning on the side of my bed while sitting lastly he's been slowly going up the stairs he's never did these things before he's had surgery on one of his legs years ago if that helps what do you think it could be suggestions and advice please this sounds like your lab is developing arthritis but a vet needs to examine him to be sure this is pretty easy to treat i have a year old beagle who has had it for years on her bad days when it's cold and rainy i give her either a baby aspirin or an enteric coated aspirin daily we give her a glucosimin supplement we have had good results with excel tr which we purchase a petsmart this is her second year taking it and she has far less pain we also purchased a dog bed that supports her arthritic bones and no longer encourage her to join us on the bed or couch Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dog training Aerial (dance move) Dog Prostate cancer Paget's disease of bone Osteoarthritis Arthritis Breastfeeding Hormone replacement therapy (trans) The Shining (film) Fancy rat Professional wrestling holds Mattress COX-2 inhibitor Stroke Guinea pig Folic acid Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Aspirin Malaria Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Sandy Koufax Diving Philip J.
