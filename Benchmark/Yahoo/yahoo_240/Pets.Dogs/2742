what would you do or say i have dogs but today i only took two of my dogs to the dog park as dogs by myself in a dog park is too much anyway i am with my border collie and my pitbull and my pitbull who is mellow growls at two french poodles and that woman says get your dangerous dog away from my dogs i was like what she just growled because your dog tried to dominate her and she did not want to she is being a dog no big deal it was just a tiny growl i mean did my dog do something wrong here does my dog have the right to not like a dog or not to be dominated by other dogs she gets along with of the dogs and never got involved in any fights of any sorts in my pack she is the most submissive one and at dog parks she never ever tried to dominate other dogs but won't let other dogs she does not know mount her usually she growls and this is it is growling at a dog just once that bad or is it because my dog is a pit all my dogs are spayed and neutered and obedient she is years old i mean my border collie snaps and barks at other dogs and people react much nicely than this woman did with just a growl my pit is a tiny bit overweight not much though and she is the biggest couch potatoe she does play with my other dogs especially my border collie they are the first dogs i got once she is done playing she just rolls on grass and that's pretty much it i shoudl have said more like my pit is the nicest dog but her look of disgust not fear actually just took me aback and i just chose to call my dogs and went away afterwards i felt like i should have said more hey mango cool name i carry dog bite stats that i printed and i carry it with my dog bag and show it to people who make comments on pitbulls as i foster dogs i have some pitbulls that i walk along with my dogs and i get comments all the time also it helps to have a friend with you i walk with my neighbor and she has a pit and we do educate the neighborhood no matter what your pitbull does people think it's wrong i am sure that lady would have yelled at you if your pit had farted i mean you did not do anything wrong she is the nut case here and yes i am sure your border collie is more trouble than your pit i have one and i know they can be nippy with other dogs dogs are dogs just that border collie look cuter and safer for the majority of people don't worry about that lady Dog Dog training Futurama (TV series - season 5) Social rule Cat Shaggy dog story Gray Wolf Ferret Obedience training AFI 100 Years series Doug Peter Griffin 2000 Australian Grand Prix Humphrey Bogart Garfield The Adventures of Pete & Pete The Apprentice 2 Housebreaking Mixed-breed dog Extreme Championship Wrestling Hip hop collaborations Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Spidey Super Stories American Idol Toilet humour Reservoir Dogs EastEnders Theory of conduct The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius Lady Bouvier's Lover Professional wrestling match types Trailer Park Boys Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Sin City Democratic Party (United States) The Smoking Room Jam (TV series) Married... with Children Beavis and Butt-head Prisoner's dilemma The Star Wars Holiday Special Shetland Sheepdog Ron and Fez The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Trish Stratus Blood (computer game) The Contender (television series) The Fairly OddParents Jumping the shark Professional wrestling slang Kim Possible Music in professional wrestling Hey Arnold!
