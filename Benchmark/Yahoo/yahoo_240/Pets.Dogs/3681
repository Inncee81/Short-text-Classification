my puppy is a half dachshund half i know that my puppy is part dachshund but we know there's something else in her but we have no clue http s photobucket com albums b cottnktcandy action view current friends jpg she has longer legs than a normal dachshund so there's one clue any ideas thanks cute pup it's difficult to tell from the picture if you have another picture taken from the side with her standing that might give us a better idea of how she's built she does look very much like a dachshund to me dachshunds can come in all colors and varieties so while that color isn't common it also isn't unheard of in a dachshund working dachshunds like for agility or earthdog are sometimes bred taller too it's a fairly common color in the basset but i don't see her as having any basset her head shape foot shape ear shape tail shape and even the her front legs bowleggedness are all fairly common to dachshunds i'd be more likely to guess she is purebred otherwise my best guess would be a jack russell or miniature or german pinscher but that doesn't account for the unusual color several people suggested beagle but i don't see it beagles don't come in that color they come in tri color but not with that much black they would make her nose shorter and stubbier and her nose is if anything longer and sharper than a lot of dachshunds her feet would be bigger but her feet seem petite like a dachshund's her tail would also be bigger and bushier i suspect that she carries it straight out and not up in the air this is another thing that distinguishes dachshunds from beagles good question it's fun figuring out your dachshund's other half and seeing other people's theories Dog Nintendogs Mixed-breed dog Dachshund Labrador Retriever Equine conformation Dobermann Horse Guinea pig Clarinet Skateboarding trick I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Theory of conduct Beagle Basset Hound Diving Jack Russell Terrier Scent hound Miniature Pinscher Dog agility Aerial (dance move) The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Xenomorph Cheetah Dragon Booster Species My Little Pony The Amazing Race The Ashlee Simpson Show Drill bit Social rule Crossword Opportunity rover Fast bowling Volleyball Cat Paul Is Dead Professional wrestling holds Dog training Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dog hybrids and crossbreeds Shen Gong Wu Extreme Programming Mouse (computing) P-61 Black Widow Keeshond House Mouse Scooby-Doo The nature of God in Western theology Color Border Collie Monster Rancher monsters Breaststroke Stereoscopy Sonic boom Unicorn Housebreaking Glossary of ballet terms You Don't Know Jack Pekingese Goodness and value theory Fancy rat Charades Docking Rei Ayanami Dog show American Pie (song) The Voyage of the Beagle Obedience training Wheel of Fortune Korea Jindo Dog Baldrick Red Fox Horse gait Pikmin Arabian horse Color blindness Golden Retriever Late Night with Conan O'Brien Knife Strap-on dildo Miniature Schnauzer German Shepherd Dog Calvin and Hobbes FoxTrot Negima Causality Stairway Helicopter Tag Backstroke Les Barker Pitaten B-47 Stratojet Kylie Minogue Hair Headcrab
