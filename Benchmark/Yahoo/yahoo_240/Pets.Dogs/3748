do labrador retrievers get along with cats it depends if you buy your retriever while it is still a pup it will get along much better with any other animal living in the house whether it's an old pet or another new pet however if the dog is older how it gets along with other animals is very dependent on the dog's personality and previous habits it obtained through its childhood this goes with any pet and also includes young children which is good to keep in mind i am uncertain of retrievers natural habits but some dogs like welsh corgis have natural habits bred into them such as herding therefor they tend to nip at things it feels are inferior however as stated earlier if you introduce the other pet while the dog is still young it has a much greater chance of getting along with the other pet i wont pretend to be a professional however i've always know labrador retrievers to be incredibly friendly toward any companion just be sure to make sure both animals are calm before and during the introduction which goes especially toward the cat cats also tend to do better with other animals if introduced to them at a younger age when introducing them be sure to have control of both animals especially the dog because of its size if the dog begins to become hyper or lunge stop and try again at another time the first few trials may not go well at first but over time they will become more used to each other so there is no need to get rid of either pet if they do not get along they will most times avoid each other anyways i've known labs to be hyper but never aggressive or dangerous so keep trying sorry for such a lengthy message and i wish you the best of luck scott Dog Cat German Shepherd Dog Hamster Labrador Retriever Herding dog Golden Retriever Domestication Mixed-breed dog Working dog Nintendogs Dog training Dog agility Domestic rabbit Greyhound Companion dog Housebreaking Guinea pig Welsh Corgi Taboo food and drink Pet Ferret Pet skunk Fancy rat Gray Wolf Galaxy Angel Tobacco smoking Neopets Animal testing Care Bears Canary Pembroke Welsh Corgi Feral cat The Fairly OddParents Australian Cattle Dog Hunting Pit bull Rottweiler Human Dilbert Garfield Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Kodocha Our Gang Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Tuberculosis Luck Cardigan Welsh Corgi Ranma __ characters Border Collie English Springer Spaniel Chaos Emerald Mickey Mouse Rabbit Obedience training West Highland White Terrier Krypto the Superdog Havanese Final Fantasy XI Unclean animals Sonic the Hedgehog Bugs Bunny Philosophy of language Friends Pitaten Introduced species Weimaraner Infantilism Hedgehog Animal Liberation Front Maison Ikkoku Get Fuzzy Bill Clinton The Adventures of Pete & Pete Motivation Docking RuneScape quests Kim Possible Socialization Same-sex marriage in Canada Tex Avery Social psychology KaBlam!
