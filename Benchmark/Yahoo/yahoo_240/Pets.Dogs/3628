how do i stop my month old dog from randomly peeing in the house after a walk i have a month old chocolate lab that we adopted a month ago he had been outside on a run and in a crate to sleep with the previous owners we live in an apt we take him running at least once usually x a day and is brought out to pee abot x hr to relieve himself the problem is that after a long walk he'll come in lay down and get up maybe hours later and randomly pee anywhere he doesn't seem to mark territory and will go days with no problem just when we feel like we've had a breakthrough he does it again already we've been through alot with this pup and he has come a real long way but somehow we are stuck with this one and my kids and husband are freaking out frankly so am i any advise thanks oh yea i do gesture and scream no and a few times i get him outside to pee or finish his business he doesn't signal that anything is up the first few months are usually a learning process for your puppy they are in a relatively new place and they have to learn all over again where to go you basically have to act like you are house training them all over again that's what we have had to do with our month old that we got about a month ago she still has accidents but it's getting better here is the best way to go about this first of all set up one area of the house that is his area just a room or two that you wouldn't mind cleaning up if he has an accident whenever you can't be watching him contantly keep him in those rooms they will not go in their safe area so they quickly learn not to go in there unless they just absolutely cannot hold it anymore take him out every three to four hours if possible always take him to the same area and praise him when he goes there this will teach him that when you bring him there that's what you want him to do do not let him play until he goes try teaching him to go on command by saying something like go potty or hurry up while he is going and then praise excessively when he does they always have to go within thirty minutes of sleeping eating and vigorous exercise so make sure you don't just leave food out put it down and pick it up within thirty minutes and then take him out shortly after that when you take him out for a run make sure he potties right before coming in the house and if not take him out again in an hour if he does still take him out in hours vigorous exercise makes them have to go more and they don't always go right before coming in so usually within an hour they have to go again especially if they take a nap afterward once he has been good about not going in the house for about a month then expand his area and see how he does if he has an accident then shrink his area again for awhile eventually he'll be able to go anywhere in the house without a problem but the bigger the area the more likely they will go in the house good luck with this i am going through this myself but my girl is starting to ask to go out not everytime but it's a lot better Housebreaking Dog training Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Humphrey Bogart Time Out of Mind Toilet humour The Catcher in the Rye Guinea pig Social rule Crate training Mnemonic Ron and Fez Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Blonde on Blonde The Inside Urinary incontinence Cat The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Oh My Goddess!
