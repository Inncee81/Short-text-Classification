im very scared right now i just got a chihuahua and it got along with everyone in my family the bad thing is that it follows us where ever we go here's the part im scared of my sister and i were called to go downstairs to pick up groceries when we went down our dog followed us but instead of walking down it fell down we have no carpet only hardwood floor i practically got a heart attack i freaked out so badley now im scared that my chihuahua is in pain or broke something i examined her she seems pretty fine no limping but then im still scared cuz someone told me sometimes wen a dog is in pain it doesnt show it o o please help im really scared it is true that dogs try to mask pain but that generally doesn't apply when something external causes them sudden pain generally they will yelp if that happens it also usually doesn't apply to hiding a limp from an injury and so likely your dog is ok and you will just want to keep a close on her however since you are so worried bless your heart if a trip to the vet will make you feel better it is often worth it it is true there could be damage that may not be apparent yet and no one can really know that without a vet exam even then not everything is found and while i thik that unlikely it surely is possible eta angel the reason dogs try to mask pain is it is an instinct in the wild the species survived because dogs culled their packs which mean they killed the sick and the weak it sounds brutal but it ensured the survival of the species this is still a strong instinct today stronger for some dogs than others it is also the reason you can't always assume a dog is not in pain because it doesn't seem like it professionals know how to move and tug in the right places and what reactions to look for when trying to determine if a dogs is in pain your dog obviously has a good home with you best to both of you Dog training Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Dog Limp Bizkit Sin City Glen Jacobs Jon Secada Theory of conduct The Inside Professional wrestling slang Cat Pitaten Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Wood Guinea pig Fox hunting Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Tenshinhan Gray Wolf Maison Ikkoku Surveillance Diving Equine conformation Blood (computer game) Dead Like Me EastEnders Characters of Naruto Randomness The Fairly OddParents Myocardial infarction Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Wraith (Stargate) Smallville (Season 4) Spider StarCraft: Uprising Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Professional wrestling holds Gundam W G-Unit: Last Outpost Social rule The Legend of Zelda series enemies Prostate cancer Professional wrestling match types Philosophy of language Hip hop rivalries Shaggy dog story Upholstery Avenue Q Milton H.
