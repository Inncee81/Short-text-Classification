great dane potty training i am having a little trouble with thor he is an weeks old great dane and i have had him weeks we take him outside quite a bit at least every two hours when we are home when we are not home and at night he stays in his crate we praise him like crazy and give him a treat every time he does his business outside and he never messes in his crate he does pretty well with number but it is number that is a problem for some reason he will not poop outside no matter how often we take him out he will pee outside and then minutes later poop inside when i see him i will say no sharply and take him outside right away and he will still not poop outside he will hold it until he is inside and i am not looking i am out of ideas i know he is a baby and it is not his fault and i know i need to be patient but i need to see some sort of movement in the right direction so i can use positive reinforcement start potty training over don't lose sight of the the puppy whenever the dog is in the house and not crated put a body harness and leash on the dog tie end of leash to your belt wherever you go the dog goes when you see the dog start to signal sniff circle scratch that it's got to go than run the dog out to where you want it to go praise reward immediately and use a command word consistently when the dog shows it's learned to go outside consistently by dragging you to the outside than you can undo the leash from your belt keep the leash on the dog still and keep an eye on it whenever it is in the house and not crated so if it starts to make an accident you can grab the leash and run it outside once it is going outside with no attempted accidents for at least a week than you can take the leash off the most common mistake in potty training is giving the dog freedom to roam the house without supervision where the human doesn't see the dog signal it needs to go also if he won't poop and you know he should be when outside than walk him back inside and to his crate keep him in ther for five minutes than back outside keep doing this until he does poop Dog training Housebreaking Crate training Obedience training Aerial (dance move) Toilet humour Professional wrestling match types Kitesurfing Dog Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Ferret Dog agility Pitaten Swingout 24 Hours of Le Mans Social rule Shaggy dog story Futurama (TV series - season 5) Scooby-Doo The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Sailing Piccolo Junior Saga Snooker The Ashlee Simpson Show Ben Johnson (athlete) Alan Arnett McLeod Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) German Shepherd Dog Characters in the Smurfs 1957 World Series Drowning Great Dane Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an RuneScape quests Humphrey Bogart The Contender (television series) Theory of conduct Urinary incontinence The Death Gate Cycle Strap-on dildo Lady and the Tramp Parachuting Diving USS Sea Dog (SS-401) Reservoir Dogs Jennifer Lopez Aikido Cerberus Dog collar First Battle of the Atlantic Blonde on Blonde Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Amber Spyglass Luminiferous aether Paranoia Agent Heinkel He 112 Traumatic brain injury Glossary of American football Thor (Marvel Comics) Spot the Dog Eddie Guerrero Leash Combine (Half-Life 2) Ron and Fez Dobermann The Apprentice 2 Billboard Hot 100 New Morning Jon Secada Milton H.
