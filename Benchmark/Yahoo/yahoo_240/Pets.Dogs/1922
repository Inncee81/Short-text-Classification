question about philippine dog i went to the philippines and i must say it is a nice place but then i saw this peculiar dog they call it askal they are basically mongrels they are treated like crap sometimes though you know chained up if not loose or being thrown about and sometimes eaten but the best thing about them is they do not shed well at least thats what my cousin's yaya or nanny said so i am planning to have one to be delivered here in america do you guys think it will survive what quarantined could i just get a vet clearance from that country then per wikipedia askal refers to an asong kalye which means street dog in english it is the most common breed of dog in the philippines askals are easily spotted on every street in its native country because thousands of them are free roaming or left by their owners who cannot afford to take care of their pets unfortunately they are viewed by many as a dangerous disease carrying filthy animal they often survive by rummaging through piles of garbage for food or by exploring a nearby market for leftovers of fresh raw meat that came from the vendors they are obviously scavengers and are forced to live in a hard unfriendly environment these pitiful innocent animals are also hunted for food in some parts of the country the askal dog has an unclear history there's no such thing as a pure breed for this kind of dogs it is nearly impossible to trace where they came from but they've been in the country for a very long period of time they are loyal intelligent but stubborn dogs they can be very fond of their master if properly raised disciplined and cared for at a young age they tend to be independent during the later years of their lives like any other dog an askal should not be left alone with children without the supervision of an adult they are very sociable animals but easily angered by strangers or a non member of the family askals vary from different shapes and sizes most are medium sized some are small while few are large they are perfect for the hot tropical climate of the philippines because of its short non shedding coat retrieved from http en wikipedia org wiki askal so do you live in a hot tropical climate and if not this dog will most likely adapt by developing an undercoat to survive winters therefore shedding in large clumps come springtime no different than dingos which in the us are carolina dogs how do you plan on compensating for the lack of intervention early enough in it's life to properly socialize otherwise this is going to be a very unstable unpredicatable dog stubborn independant those are things listed in the description do you have plans on puppy classes obedience training trust me if you don't then you are going to have major authority struggles with this dog i have raised a carolina dog and given that i have raised beagles aussie shepards a few coon hounds a german shepard and a stratfordshire terrier i thought repeat i thought that i had a firm graps on the definitions high energy independant minded and i am here to tell you that with carolina dog growing up he re defined those words don't get me wrong i admire your interest in saving a dog's life i can't even imagine the shipping costs one way to australia for a friend of mine's dog was over quarantine is sometimes governed by the state for example even from california to hawaii has day mandatory quarantine period http www aphis usda gov vs ncie pet info html http www cdc gov ncidod dq animal htm http www cdc gov ncidod dq pdf animal dog quarantine notice cdc pdf in addition coming in from certain countries including the phillipines requires a containment quarantine period there at a vet's office prior to shipping it is also entirely possible that it is illegal to have this dog brought into this country what are you going to do when it gets here you have paid for quarentine there vetting there shipping here quarantine here only to be told you will go to jail if you don't contact the seller pay to ship the dog back to them this would be true of australian dingos as an example in addition the federal government would still have the legal right to arrest you simply for bringing the dog into this country Pet skunk Rabies Ferret Mixed-breed dog Fancy rat Biodiesel Cat Livestock Animal rights Guinea pig Domestic rabbit Constitution of the Turkish Republic of
