dog question okay my fiance and i live toghther and he brought home an american bulldog we think we think she is about yrs old very smart and well behaved at first i didn't like her b c she is kinda scary looking now i love her we've had her about wks well wks ago my mom came over w her dog and the dogs didn't get along so she left now my moms been over x w out her dog and our dog growls at her i tell the dog it's okay etc i give my mom treats to give her and the dog takes them and licks her hands but when my mom tries to be friendly and try and pet her she shows her teeth and growls why shes not like this w all strangers when i say its okay im telling her theyre good people she understands dogs do not have long memory they forget after seconds of a behavior although dogs have whats called a jacobsen sac these sacs are inside their olfactory system and carry around scents for a long period of time when the dog smells something familiar these sacs open up and that's how the dog recognizes that person i personally think that its the energy that's coming off of your mom your mom is already nervous because of what happened before your bulldog senses that and is feeding off of it so what happens is that mom goes to pet dog dog snarls and growls mom gets frightened and backs away dog wins bad move dog becomes the dominate one then you go to dog and pet him trying to settle him down rewarding him for his bad behavior never ever give a dog affection when hes in an anxious or nervous state your preventing him from moving forward and learning that its not ok to be like that good luck Dog Cat Shaggy dog story Animal communication Pet skunk Pok__mon Live!
