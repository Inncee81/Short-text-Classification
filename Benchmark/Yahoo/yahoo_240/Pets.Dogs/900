i cannot get rid of my two golden retrievers flees i have tried otc treatments from wal mart petsmart and most recently frontline the vet also gave me a pill that was supposed to get rid of the flees for instant relief my dogs are still itching like crazy and i still see active flees it has been days since i used the frontline and still no relief at this point i have spent 's of dollars i have diligently treated my home and yard and am beginning to think that the chemicals aren't going to work any suggestions are greatly appreciated okay i've gotten great advice let me just add a few details i'm using frontline and capstar on the dogs i have tried flea baths flea sprays and flea collars i wash my bedding at least every other day i vacuum everywhere twice a day including my hard floors dog beds couches and chairs my yard and house have been treated it is like i have turbo fleas i just checked my dog and there are even active fleas right by where i applied the frontline between the shoulder blades the vet told me to use the capstar every days maybe i just need to keep doing what i'm doing to end the reproduction cycle any ideas on how to keep the fleas from biting my kids first let me tell you that i own a pest control company and what i will recommend is the complete treatment that should help you completely get rid of the fleas first treat the pet with capstar this is a pill that you get from the vet that will kill all of the fleas that get on the animal for the first hours second use either frontline or advantage these can also be purchased from the vet frontline can be used on pets weeks old or older advantage can be used on animals as young as weeks if the pet is old enough for either product switch back and forth between the two one month use one the next use the other the reason i recommend this is that there are two main types of fleas that infest pets one product works better on the first type and the other product works better on the second type by using both you make sure you have covered all your bases once the pet has been treated you must treat your home and yard the best products to do this would include not only a killing agent but also a sterilization agent inside i would use ultracide if you can get it many on line sites sell it follow the instructions on the label wash all animal s bedding and vacuum frequently i would not put any chemical in the vacuum bag or catch container other than a flea collar it is too dangerous to risk the vacuum accidentally spreading that chemical through the air throw out the vacuum bag or dump the catch container after every vacuuming you can never vacuum too much do not steam clean your rugs this can hatch flea eggs and make your problem worse outside i would use demon wp mixed with gentrol or nylar carefully following label instructions treat the entire yard paying special attention to under bushes and low hanging branches most of these products can be bought at any do it yourself pest control company either on line or in a store treating your house and yard is just as important as treating the pet it is also very important to stay away from the grocery store or box store products like zodiac or hartz many of these products can cause severe allergic reactions in animals Flea Hamster Wal-Mart Pet skunk Fancy rat Diseases of the honeybee Dog training Psoriasis Thermal power station Coffee Dairy Mattress Dog Tattoo Urinary incontinence Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Asthma Malaria Animal Crossing Red Hot Chili Peppers Heartworm Eczema Cat Acne Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Alanis Morissette Guinea pig Theory of conduct Prostate cancer Gypsy moth Bulk vending Hydrogen peroxide Sin City Central processing unit Fire fighting Professional wrestling match types Ferret Fecal incontinence Chronic fatigue syndrome Solar power Weed control Oral contraceptive Migraine Hard disk Nuclear power Plastic Sewage treatment Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Illegal drug trade Glossary of American football Hay fever Garfield Menstrual cycle Menstrual cup Poker jargon Gaia Online Stomach cancer Vacuum tube Upholstery Birth control Computer Japanese tea ceremony Brewery CPU cache Tick Dialysis CPU design Sento Rabies Sears Holdings Corporation Shaggy dog story Richard Chase Betting (poker) Strap-on dildo Plame affair Tarantula Tesco Dilbert Milk Biological pest control Cannabis cultivation Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder John Frusciante Neighbours Marine aquarium Ultraviolet Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Internet fraud The Inside Insulin
