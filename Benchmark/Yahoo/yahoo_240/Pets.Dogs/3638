shock collars do not hurt well i was looking in to getting a shock collar because my dogs bark alot but i wanted to try it on before i put it on my dog so i did and barked and it just tickled after seeing so many questions on here why do people think they are mean cause there not yes i have tried spray collars but they dont seem to bother my dogs though the reason they think they are mean is because most have never bother to try them out themselves it is the same with a prong collar because of what it looks like people believe it is so cruel but it is actually a better training tool for the novice dog owner than a choker but try telling this to the majority i would not put much thought into what a bunch of people who have no idea what they are talking about bother you do what works for your dog not all problems can be solved with beg and bribe training eta to the person below me the first part of your name is very accurate because i will tell you my boys try to play with the ecollar like a toy they take turns trying it out on themselves and think the shock is funny not painful so i wonder how much pain it could have caused an adult or a dog for that matter a bark collar is much more humane than having to get rid of the dog and dumping it in a shelter or city pound because your neighbors are constantly complaining and calling the police because your dog is a nuisance Dog training Garfield Dog Carl Barks The Inside Philip J.
