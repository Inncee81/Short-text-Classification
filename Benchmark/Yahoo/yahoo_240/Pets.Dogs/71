read this please and how it makes me feel as a pet owner i have two dogs and a cat that lives outside and stays in the garage but when it is cold they come inside well i have other family members that live in this bedroom bath house so i can not have dogs live inside we have the money to take care of my pets but not the space for them to live inside and my sis is allergic to cats so the cat lives outside our pets have had to stay outside ever since we got them they are healthy and happy and loved and when i ask questions like how to stop this stray cat some people who answer my quetions make me feel horrible like i am a bad pet owner and i would adopt i tried but the shelter raised the price you have to have all pets neutered spayed and they have to live inside and a fenced yard i live on far from the road have no neighbors and have acre for a yard so my home is perfect for my dogs cat you make me seem like the bad guy cause i do not take care of my pets the way you think i should i do my part i volunteer at my local shelter and and spoil my dogs with treats colars leashes bones and toys so that is all i meant you make me and plenty other people feel like crap and it hurts to be criticize like that just cause my one dog is not neutered or inside just see where i am coming from please what someone said you are a horrible pet owner it would hurt bad you don't even know i could only be for all you know which i am and if it were my decision my pets would live inside when i ask q's i want real answers and help and i'm sure other people feel this way i am but i only offer stud service i offer stud service with my akc reg black lab and my other dog is neutered and i'll call anybody anything i want if they are going to be so mean to me like that if you are then legally your parents own the dogs but you love them and take care of them and that's fine it sounds like you take good care of them one thing you need to understand is that when people complain to you about something you do like allowing your dog to breed it is almost always because they also breed dogs consider themselves professional and get upset if somebody else cuts into their profits by allowing their own pets to breed you just have to learn to ignore criticism if you take good care of your pets then you are doing fine i actually only buy pets from families not professional breeders i prefer it when people have pets not livestock that they sell it is kinder to the pets and my final thought is to never allow anyone to make you feel badly let it go you do the best you can love your dog and that's fine just be sure to take good care of your pets and give them lots of love feed them well provide well for them and let everyone else say whatever they want to say it is usually motivated by greed Dog Domestic rabbit Cat Pet skunk Hamster Ferret Dog training Guinea pig Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Animal shelter Theory of conduct Poker jargon Livestock Golden Retriever Pet Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Obedience training Border Collie The Fairly OddParents Fancy rat Labrador Retriever The Apprentice 2 Feral cat Canary Friends Docking Pitaten Garfield Shaggy dog story Keeshond Housebreaking Animal euthanasia Care Bears Goodness and value theory Neopets Microchip implant (animal) Mixed-breed dog Puppy mill Rent (musical) Social rule Socialization Avenue Q American Kennel Club Utilitarianism Pit bull Dog breed German grammar Havanese Kodocha Shit Pekingese EastEnders Ranma __ characters Dog agility Animal rights Alaskan Malamute Alaskan husky English grammar Rescue group Current teachings of Prem Rawat Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Microeconomics Jon Secada Dobermann Health insurance Korea Jindo Dog German Shepherd Dog Sant Thakar Singh Badly Drawn Kitties Evil Hunting Pet store Rabbit The Smoking Room Code: Lyoko Spanish pronouns Zoophilia Maison Ikkoku Scientology beliefs and practices Phoebe Buffay's songs Manx (cat) Neighbours Welsh Terrier Pet Sounds Game show Kim Possible Australian Shepherd Pok__mon Live!
