lab chow skinny i have a lab chow and i love her very much and i a little concerned shes about months and only weighs pounds i was just wondering if she is underweight i mean her build looks good and you cant see her bones but you can feel them and when she curls up to sleep her back bone pokes out and really easy to feel if you need pictures to tell email me and ill be glad to send you some she hasnt been sick so she hasnt been to her vet except for her shots and that was a while back but she has been to her groomer recently and they never say anbything also i was feeding her iams puppy food and then we switched to beniful puppy food and we always leave food in her bowl because for some reason she has to be in the same room as you and she wont eat unless she can see or hear you so sometimes its hard to get her to eat but she generally eats about or cups of food a day and she was the same build when she ate iams as beniful she actually likes the beniful better also next month im moving her to dog chow because thats what the label on the dog food says to do also she gets a good amount of exercise we have of an acre and i runn her around it a couple times a day and throughout the day i play with her she really likes to play games like pulling on the rope and she likes to chase and be chased but all the playing is only about of her day she like to lay by you and be loved on a lot too adolescents are often lanky so it could just be that we are so used to seeing overweight dogs that it seems like the norm at the ideal weight your dog should have ribs palpable but not visible slight waist observed behind ribs when viewed from above abdomen tucked up flank fold present start feeding better quality food and at least you know she will be able to digest all of the nutrients that she is getting Dog Equine conformation Guinea pig Fancy rat Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Garfield Breastfeeding Gray Wolf Aerial (dance move) Cat Dog training Anorexia nervosa Professional wrestling holds Fast bowling Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Coeliac disease Hip hop rivalries Abdomen Professional wrestling attacks Skinny Puppy Ramen Piccolo Junior Saga Milk Kodocha Domestic rabbit Humphrey Bogart Nutrition Sin City The Ashlee Simpson Show Binge eating disorder Kakapo Insulin Atkins Nutritional Approach Super Size Me Livestock Vitamin C RuneScape quests Elephant Liver Dieting Raw food diet Tasmanian Devil Housebreaking Taboo food and drink Genetically modified food Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Boxing Spider Days of our Lives Bruce Lee Diarrhea Adjustable gastric band John the Baptist The Time Machine Anchor Tetrapod Iditarod Human height Folic acid Dairy Body mass index Cockroach FoxTrot Acorn Customs and etiquette of Japan Reservoir Dogs Captain Thunderbolt The Star Wars Holiday Special Love The Shining (film) Swimming Dog food Combine (Half-Life 2) Snake Shar Pei Hamster Toilet humour Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Urinary incontinence Pet skunk Chocolate Oral sex Time Out of Mind Ranma __ characters Chronic fatigue syndrome Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Vomiting Coprophagia Hikikomori Digital photography Tuatara Weight training Irish Wolfhound Mixed-breed dog Little Britain
