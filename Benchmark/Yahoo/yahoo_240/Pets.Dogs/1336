is this breeding possible ok i have a bull terrier male who is two years old and have just bought a female bull terrier who is four months old now the boys parents are the same as the girls grandparents so they are not brother and sister she is a quarter sister to him i was told that as the father of the girl is completly new blood that makes the girl once removed from the boy so i can breed them as dogs are different to humans in terms of inbreeding does this sound right to any dog breeders out there enough with the insults about breeding my dogs firstly they are bull terriers not pit bull terriers second of all i would be doing this in conjuction with my breeder who has a lot of experience i just wanted some actual dog breeders advice about the genetics so if you arent a dog breeder dont post your bulls t answers about desexing my dogs also i realise that the girl cant be bred until at least two and yes i would get all health checks done i am a responsible owner who would never jump into this sort of thing with considering all aspects of it before hand hence why i am asking questions months before the girl would be remotely ready if there are no bad health or temperament issues that can be brought forward the breeding you are considering would be fine it is called line breeding not inbreeding line breeding can strengthen the lines and bring forth the good traits but it can also bring forth the bad so in order to do this and do it correctly you really need to very carefully research the lines American Pit Bull Terrier Pit bull Staffordshire Bull Terrier Bull Terrier Inbreeding Dog breeding Jack Russell Terrier Plant breeding German Shepherd Dog Breed registry Manx (cat) Dobermann Terrier Boston Terrier Incest Selective breeding Arabian horse English Springer Spaniel Dog show Domestic rabbit Yorkshire Terrier Toy dog Hybrid One Tree Hill (TV series) Portuguese Water Dog Pet skunk Shaggy dog story Dachshund Skye Terrier Fox Terrier Miniature Fox Terrier Kakapo Twin Rottweiler Docking West Highland White Terrier Whippet Horse Artificial selection Welsh Terrier Tenterfield Terrier Species Canary Dog hybrids and crossbreeds Breed-specific legislation Breed standard Rat Terrier Dog breed Eusociality Domestication Tibetan Terrier Bernese Mountain Dog Great Dane Guinea pig Dairy cattle Puppy mill American Bulldog Equine conformation Eugenics Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Family Australian Silky Terrier House Mouse German Shorthaired Pointer Mastiff God Emperor of Dune Havanese Female genital cutting Golden Retriever Androgen insensitivity syndrome Mad Money Ethics Jennifer Lopez EastEnders Theory of conduct Science Fox hunting Griffon Bruxellois Fox Terrier (Smooth) Scientology beliefs and practices Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Irish Wolfhound Cairn Terrier Tibetan Mastiff Breastfeeding Neville Chamberlain Inception of Darwin's theory Abortion debate Miniature Pinscher Extinction History of evolutionary thought
