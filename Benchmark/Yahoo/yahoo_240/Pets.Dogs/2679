is it time to say goodbye to my baby i have a almost year old border collie german shepherd rotweiler me and her were born the same year so i have grown up with her she has cataracts but can see pretty well she is sort of deaf she has arthritis in her hips and has a hard time getting up but she still runs around a lot and plays with our maltese and chihuahua and she tries to pounce on them she acts like a puppy for a little while last months she has been pooping inside the house like she cannot hold it in like her bowels are messed up or something tonight her two back legs were so bad she could not walk she had to sit on her dog carpet and just sleep if she did get it she was stiff legged and she only took like steps and she had diarrhea in the house and a lot of it so the problems are arthritis cataracts deafness diarrhea but she still jumps and plays around do you think it is time for our dearly beloved pet to be put to sleep please no rude answers when she sometimes tries to play with the dogs she can't get up and walk so she will just stand where she is and bark at them and wag her tail and perk her ears up also i would never think of her as a burden or strain on me never i love her too much to ever think that alot of these problems that you are describing can be treated it sounds like she still has some spunk in her if she's still jumping and playing around i would talk to your vet and see what he can do to help with the cataracts arthritis and diarrhea ask him if he thinks she can be treated or if she should be put down he would be able to offer you the most accurate option good luck i hope she's able to stay with you for a while longer Dog Dog training Equine conformation Housebreaking Pitaten Social rule Shaggy dog story Mixed-breed dog Guinea pig Friends 2000 Australian Grand Prix Havanese Toilet humour Dobermann Fecal incontinence Hearing impairment Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Cat Nintendogs German Shepherd Dog Obedience training Fancy rat Professional wrestling attacks 101 Dalmatians: The Series Skateboarding trick Tocopherol Shetland Sheepdog Dog agility Futurama (TV series - season 5) Swingout Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Horse Juliana of the Netherlands Reservoir Dogs Professional wrestling aerial techniques AFI 100 Years series Border Terrier Border Collie Hip hop collaborations Docking The Amber Spyglass EastEnders 1957 World Series Coeliac disease Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Care Bears The Death Gate Cycle Skinny Puppy Diving Stomach cancer Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Horse gait Kodocha Manx (cat) Luck Domestic rabbit Aquemini The Pet Sounds Sessions The Time Machine Piccolo Junior Saga Billboard Hot 100 Professional wrestling holds The Shining (film) Aphasia Late Night with Conan O'Brien Professional wrestling throws Book of Isaiah Genesis (band) Characters in the Smurfs The Pilgrim's Progress Basset Hound The Ashlee Simpson Show Labrador Retriever Rocko's Modern Life Time Out of Mind Spot the Dog Kevin and Kell Garfield Timon and Pumbaa Romulus and Remus Glossary of climbing terms The Big Goodbye (TNG episode) Poker jargon Glossary of partner dance terms Avenue Q Keeshond Lucille Ball Boxer (dog) Volleyball Singlish Tag The Wiggles Smooth Collie Korea Jindo Dog Theory of conduct
