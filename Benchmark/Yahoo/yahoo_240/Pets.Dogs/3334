where can you get cheap or free puppies from please give me some sources i think fostering a dog is free a really good place to purchase or and adopt a dog is from a breeder or an animal shelter the average price essential for purchasing a dog ranges from and those bargains that are less than that aren't worth it because it is highly probable that the dog mill bred and raised dog is deathly sick with various and numerous ailments and poorly house trained and or people trained optional it's well known that dogs from pet mills due to the dirty conditions and uncompassion in regards to the dogs wellbeing that it is very sick with ailments which are often incurable but treatable with expensive heavy medication which can tear a gap on your pocket don't be fooled by those pet shops because about of all managers who maintain their pet shops purchase those apparently healthy cute and happy puppies from pet mills because they're so cheap disregarding animal rescue your local dog shelter and breeder are the ones that truly care about where it is best suitable for their dogs to find that tlc usually they are very hesitant to allow you to adopt purchase a dog right away because you're a stranger to them when you notice that fact and that they like to ask questions about your financial stability job security and other basic questions such as why do you want to get this particular breed and why dogs in general is your personality and lifestyle best suitable for your dogs needs that's substantial evidence that they truly care about their dog they ask those questions to make sure that although you promise to provide a loving home to the pet you don't send it to the overpopulated animal shelter around the corner weeks later some of them go to even extreme measures to force you to sign a contract mandating that you must provide your dog with a loving home until so and so and if you are facing finanical instability you should resort to returning the pet to the breeder rather than negotiating to have it settle in an animal shelter not all breeders do that but look for other obtruse signs that confirm their compassion for dogs of course this is the ideal breeder not every breeder may fit this criteria check to see if the breeder is a member of pet owner organizations such as the american kennel club or something similar and make sure it is valid but if you can't seem to resist that bargain make certain that retrieve documents about the dog's medical history and if they have received all of their vaccinations up to date prove that they are valid by a veterinarian if the bargain benefactor refuses to present those papers that's a sign that the dog potentially is sickly with numerous and various ailments learn more information that i possibly may have overlooked from an animal shelter veterinarian and staff and the dog owner community and via the internet i heard that http www petfinder com is very resourceful in finding healthy dogs of all types of breeds one more thing the biggest scam that imminent dog owners encounter is when they purchase a dog across the shore although those papers may be valid on numerous occasions you may never retrieve the dog or if you do they manipulate you by deliberately granting you custody to the wrong dog a mixed breed or a look alike and don't be fooled even breeders are money hungry self centered tricksters i would trust animal shelters more for more information get advice from animal rescue a veterinarian and staff dog owners and animal shelters Pet skunk Contract Domestic rabbit Golden Retriever Mixed-breed dog Guinea pig Cat Health insurance Hamster Labrador Retriever German Shepherd Dog Puppy mill Cancer Rescue group Microchip implant (animal) Border Terrier Animal shelter Havanese Docking Pet store Working dog Dog training Medical prescription Dobermann Infantilism American Pit Bull Terrier Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Insurance Appeal Neopets Dog breeding Advance fee fraud American Eskimo Dog Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Garfield Publicly funded medicine Wal-Mart Rabies Life insurance Breed registry Animal rights Animal testing Dog agility American Kennel Club Confidence trick Discus (fish) Ferret Trademark Free trade Neighbours Surveillance Animal euthanasia Australian Cattle Dog Dog breed Keeshond Electronic commerce Hearing impairment National Health Service Border Collie Jack Russell Terrier Involuntary commitment Probation officer Medicine FairTax Working animal MapleStory Computer virus Gold standard Shetland Sheepdog Hunting Manx (cat) Password Pekingese Adoption Schutzhund Capitalism Dead Like Me Homeopathy Economic inequality Gramophone record Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Freenet Dog show Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Autism Basset Hound Article One of the United States Constitution Scientific method Iditarod
