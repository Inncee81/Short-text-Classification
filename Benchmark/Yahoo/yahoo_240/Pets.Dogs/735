new puppy keeps biting the other dog in the house so i have a yr old boxer my roomate bought a choc lab about months ago so he's about months old now ever since we brought the puppy home when he plays with my boxer he likes to bite at his jowels and neck basically any lose skin that he can get his teeth on which i must add are sharp cause they're still puppy teeth my boxer is now missing a bunch of fur all over his lips neck he has scabs on his face it's to the point that i cant let them play anymore cause im affraid it'll get infected boxers tend to have skin issues with there faces it's weird too cause my boxer will put up with it and will not bite him back there have been times when the puppy is just hanging off my boxers lips is this normal that he's still doing this whenever i see him doing this i tell him no in a firm voice and take him off of my boxer and put a chew toy in his moulth i feel bad having to seperate them when they want to play any advise or common storys from anyone else it's normal puppy behavior which is why your boxer is tolerating it it will soon improve as the puppy gets older honestly if the boxer is annoyed or in pain he will let the puppy know if you are worried about injuries then just correct the puppy and give him a chew toy like you have been doing but you don't need to protect the boxer like i said he will correct the puppy if he feel he is pushing it too far my older dogs always seem to get scabs around their face and neck when a new puppy is around and it always clears up but if you are worried then take the boxer to the vet to have it checked out Dog training Dog Housebreaking Guinea pig Boxing Hamster Kim Possible Cat Drill bit Characters in the Smurfs First aid Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Skinny Puppy Labrador Retriever Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Socialization Crash test dummy Zoophilia Nintendogs Basset Hound Poker jargon German Shepherd Dog The Contender (television series) Wheel of Fortune Breastfeeding Animal testing Stuttering Tattoo Milton H.
