are boxer dogs good with kids read for details below well my sister birthday is coming up and she wants a boxer i wanted to know are they good dogs and playful are they loud please give me alot information about boxer's best answer will receive extra points please help yea we were getting the boxer before my sister was gonna have a birthday but it got delayed cause of my dad's trip so yea my dog is a boxer mix it's not to body of a boxer and pretty much the same behavior i remember looking boxers up when we first got him at the library they're really friendly dogs for the most part just like people there's always an odd one out but they're jumpers they need plenty of space to run around so they're not good for small backyards and if you plan on keeping the dog fenced but not tied it needs to be a high fence because they'll clear it they can sometimes be overly friendly jumping up on people but overall they're generally good natured dogs i suggest doing an internet search for specifics if you're really concerned but basically just be careful when you attain the puppy make sure it's not already mean but good spirited and not overly shy because they can come off as violent towards loud noises and aggressive to active children Dog Barbara Boxer Dog agility Poker jargon Social rule Boxing Pinball Animal Farm Theory of conduct Cognitive science Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Surveillance Housebreaking The Brady Bunch The Fairly OddParents Anger management Gameplay of StarCraft Havanese Asperger syndrome Socialization Blackjack Hearing impairment The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Dog training Martial art Kodocha Parachuting Taikyoku shogi Charmed 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities The Ashlee Simpson Show Alaskan husky Boxer (dog) Labrador Retriever Paranoia Agent Gray Wolf Pit bull Characters of Naruto Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Joke CPU cache Fox hunting Shaggy dog story Internal ballistics Kasparov versus The World Kim Possible Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Baseball Mixed-breed dog Contract bridge Friends Peanuts Humphrey Bogart Rocko's Modern Life Sport The Haunted Mansion The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Librarian Kender E85 The Critic Seventh Sea (collectible card game) A Course In Miracles RuneScape quests U.S. presidential election, 2008 Obedience training Sydney Riot of 1879 Our Gang Garfield Volleyball Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma The Apprentice 2 The Marshall Mathers LP German Shepherd Dog Fred Phelps Spot the Dog Chromosome Dead Like Me Dean Koontz Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels Microeconomics Mixed martial arts Autism Controversies in autism Beethoven (film) The Lovely Bones Internet phenomenon Tai shogi Scientology beliefs and practices Schutzhund Rugby union positions USS Sea Dog (SS-401) Crime prevention through environmental design Equine conformation Women's boxing Undergarment Kakapo Guinea pig Compact disc
