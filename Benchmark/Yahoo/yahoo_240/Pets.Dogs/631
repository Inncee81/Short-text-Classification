what is wrong with my lab chewing problems our year old lab was crate trained up until she was year old we weened her from the crate no problem we give her plenty of exercise daily including walks one for an hour frisbee in the backyard and playtime with the lab next door we also give her a big rawhide bone maybe times week we typically only leave her home alone for about hours all has been fine and dandy for almost a year but suddenly she is chewing we only left for one hour yesterday and she chewed the rug by the front door we slept in a half hour late today because she didn't come wake us as she usually does well when we came down stairs we found the new rug chewed even after spraying it with that bitter taste stuff she has also been chewing her pillow that she lays on which doesn't bother us that much bcs it's hers and at least it's not furniture but when she completely shreds the pillow and we don't replace it what will she move on to next what can we do we stopped putting her in the crate bcs she should be old enough right she was fine out of the crate of a whoooole year i am just wondering if something could be wrong with her that would cause her to chew stuff just in the past weeks my adivice is to put her in her crate when you leave the house and at night when you guys go to sleep put her in her crate isnt that what crate trainings for trust me if you do this there will be no more chewing as long as you keep an eye on her when shes not in her crate Dog training Housebreaking Crate training Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Fancy rat Time Out of Mind Shaggy dog story The Time Machine RuneScape quests Steven Wright Hamster Social rule Tobacco Aerial (dance move) The Jeffersons (South Park) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe The Lovely Bones The Fairly OddParents Frankie Laine Trapped in the Closet Hey Jude Blood on the Tracks Space opera in Scientology doctrine The Shining (film) Ocean's Twelve Urinary incontinence Blood (computer game) The Amber Spyglass Mattress Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Inside Chewing gum Saturday Night Live Avenue Q AFI 100 Years series Strap-on dildo Bedbug Eastern Illinois University FoxTrot Oasis (band) Jefferson Airplane Wood carving Big Brother (USA TV series) Piccolo Junior Saga Monday Night Football Halitosis Rodney McKay Cindy Sheehan Heinkel He 112 Russian joke Equine conformation Futurama (TV series - season 2) Yesterday (song) Insomnia James T.
