if you had to pick what dog would you take a saint bernard a boxer a dachshund a husky or a yorkie i would take them all but if i had to pick i would take the saint the saint bernard and the husky are best suited to cold climates and require daily brushing the saint bernard doesn't require much exercise but the husky will need a lot a boxer is a very gentle dog and good with children it requires moderate exercise but has a shorter life span than some other breeds the dachshund is a reserved personality that usually bonds with one person in the family it is a little wary about being stepped on so isn't the one to choose if you have small kids the yorkie is a lively barky dog which also requires lots of grooming the smaller it is the more likely it is to be snappy but is a great companion and a good watch dog just be sure you are ready to invest the time in taking care of the saint's coat but they are great dogs with kids and other pets too Dog Yorkshire Terrier Dachshund Alaskan husky Siberian Husky Nintendogs American Eskimo Dog Havanese Mixed-breed dog Cat Domestic rabbit Keeshond Toy dog German Shorthaired Pointer Labrador Retriever Shetland Sheepdog Border Collie Companion dog Korea Jindo Dog Dog agility Obedience training Jack Russell Terrier West Highland White Terrier Working dog St. Bernard (dog) German Shepherd Dog Whippet Golden Retriever Humphrey Bogart Kerry Blue Terrier Teacher's Pet (Disney) Pekingese Guinea pig Pet Medieval hunting Poodle Nova Scotia Duck-Tolling Retriever Alaskan Malamute The Contender (television series) Pit bull Dog show Miniature Pinscher Old English Sheepdog Iditarod Hamster Equine conformation Skye Terrier Rich Mullins Maltese (dog) Bernese Mountain Dog Japanese Chin English Springer Spaniel Fancy rat Housebreaking Dog hybrids and crossbreeds Basset Hound Pug Dog training Spitz Airedale Terrier Monster Rancher monsters Greyhound Poker jargon Newfoundland (dog) Sled dog Australian Cattle Dog Priesthood (Mormonism) Pluto (Disney) The Price Is Right Chihuahua (dog) Belgian Shepherd Dog Saint Sheepshead Weimaraner Burning Man Coat (dog) The Fairly OddParents Tom Waits Artificial selection Smooth Collie Bird Escape from New York Eastern Orthodox Church Alcoholics Anonymous Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Gray Wolf Extreme Programming Portuguese Water Dog Welsh Terrier Animal Farm Chinook (dog) Pyrenean Mountain Dog Marriage Care Bears Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Insulin Rule of St Benedict Theory of conduct Dog breeding
