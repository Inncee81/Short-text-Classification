what can i do to help this dog there is a dog that lives on my street her name is nella nella is not abused i dont think but the owners let her loose around the neighborhood i dont know if she gets fed because she is skinny she is filthy since she is never in the house i want to give her a shower with my hose but i dont know if she would like it i give her food and water every day all the stupid animal control center will do is put her sleep and she is a very happy dog she has no problems with her whatsever my parents will let me take care of her but we cant adopt her she comes over my house almost everyday does have any ideas how to entertain her i was thinking ill play with the sprinkler and hopfully she will join and get wet and get a little cleaner if not i may spray her with the hose anyways i just need ideas how to help this dog's life better when she comes to visit does anybody have any ideas i have asked there is no way of getting the dog from them the animal control goes up them and they say that they love her so much and blah blah blah wow what a nice person you are i thought i was the only one who was like that entertainment my dogs love to chase a tennis ball you can usually get a package of three at the local dollar store for a buck don't get them at the pet store they charge too much make sure if she is playing in this heat that she gets plenty to drink i'm glad to hear that you are feeding her too another thing you can get at the dollar store is a rope toy my dogs love to chew on those for hours since you are taking care of her already it would make sense to just ask the neighbor if you could have her you couldn't just take her even though the neighbors are neglectful as dogs are actually considered property and nothing else that makes me sick i wish your parents would let you ask your neighbor but it sounds like you are doing the best you can thanks for caring for her Dog Little Britain Garfield Humphrey Bogart Cat Shaggy dog story Fancy rat Kodocha Irrigation Domestic rabbit Toilet humour Plastic Avenue Q Dead Like Me Dog training The Critic Time Out of Mind Urinary incontinence Laura Schlessinger Social rule Our Gang Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Star Wars Holiday Special The Catcher in the Rye Le Malade imaginaire Firefighter Dollar store Housebreaking Theory of conduct W.I.T.C.H.
