i am interested in becoming a dog breeder where should i start i've been around dogs all my life and being a breeder would be perfect for me where should i start and what else should i know i knew i should have said more i do love dogs and one reason i am interested in becoming a breeder is because then i can own over dogs i don't mean hundreds or anything but i know i can care better for them than a shelter but as for the breeding part i mean more like breeding for people that want show dogs and such or for the government fat chance but that was my idea not to put more dog population problems on the earth just to clear some things up when you breed your dog you put her at risk breeding your dog is a costly event and you will most probably have more expenses than you will have income from puppies regardless of how much experience you have you can still have disasters expect to have a number of sleepless nights death of just one pup even in a large litter can be heartbreaking expect to take some time to get over that too no vet is perfect it is almost impossible to get a fading puppy to survive and you can lose a whole litter to fading puppy syndrome it is impossible to predict how successful the breeding will be wow i think there is enough people breeding dogs reading that page that is posted from a contributor there are millions of people breeding and over breeding dogs why would you want to put your pets through this animals at shelters fall because someone wants to sell there puppies for astronomical prices when there are millions waiting for homes daily so for what you can put a ad in the paper and hope it goes to a good home and doesn't end up being that shelter animal Dog Dobermann Golden Retriever Labrador Retriever Docking Puppy mill Domestic rabbit Hamster Mixed-breed dog Pet skunk Dog breed Ferret Pet store Dog breeding Breed registry Livestock Cat Havanese Scooby-Doo Animal euthanasia Border Terrier Housebreaking American Kennel Club Fancy rat English Springer Spaniel German Shepherd Dog Dog training Nuclear power Gray Wolf Socialization Whippet Working dog Gerald Durrell American Pit Bull Terrier Dog show Brian Griffin Shetland Sheepdog Selective breeding Manx (cat) Christian eschatology Fox hunting Kylie Minogue Microchip implant (animal) Dachshund Garfield The Origin of Species Great Dane Greyhound Animal Farm Capitalism Hip dysplasia Border Collie Zoophilia Breed standard Basset Hound Domestication Theory of conduct Monster Rancher monsters Best of Breed Belgian Shepherd Dog Jon Secada Irish Wolfhound Microeconomics Freeters Alaskan husky SETI Rottweiler Nintendogs Dog hybrids and crossbreeds Randomness Extinction Maltese (dog) Social rule Software patent debate Feral cat Smooth Collie Animal shelter Inflation 101 Dalmatians: The Series Hunting Mathematics Shaggy dog story Dog agility Socrates 2005 Kashmir earthquake Pet Refugee Supply and demand Crufts Keynesian economics Bird migration Pekingese Australian Cattle Dog Skinny Puppy Korea Jindo Dog American Cocker Spaniel Rabies B-side
