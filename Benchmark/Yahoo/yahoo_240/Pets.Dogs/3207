new puppy very nervous i went and picked up my new puppy last night to go as a companion dog to my older german shepard she is a border collie and will be weeks old tomorrow i only got her back late last night about pm so she hasn't been here long we got home i put her on the floor with my dog that i know wouldnt cause any problems and sure enough they got on together like a house on fire lying together playing tails wagging etc thats not my problem the problem is that she is terrafied of me and my father if we so much as look at her and try calling her even though she doesnt know her name yet she runs to the furthermost corner of the room away from us she isn't scared to the sense of snapping at us but i don't want it getting to that extent i cant decide now which would be best keeping her seperate from the other dog for a bit so that she has to bond with us or just leave them together and let her come to us in her own time what would you suggest any tips i have had puppies before so know that they are always shy to some extent but i have never had one that was this bad myself she have a very good night she slept in the kitchen corner refused to use the bed and didnt cry ones she got up twice to go the toilet then was settles back down when i came down this morning i know is only less than hours since we got her and she has has her breakfast this morning although we couldn't look at her whilst she was eating otherwise she would stop so then ayone got any ideas just looking for ideas that i yet havn't found this is gyp http s photobucket com albums a lymau gyp action view current pict jpg http s photobucket com albums a lymau gyp action view current pict jpg i love her two different coloured eyes yes give her some space and allow her to bond with the other dog those are good suggestions but it is very important that you start a bonding process with her yourself otherwise you may have behaviour problems with her later on for now it's time for some submissive behaviour from you find a big comfortable blanket with a few soft toys and a few tasty treats go down to her level lay on your side on the blanket with both dogs in the room and be very still talk in a very quiet soothing way to the dogs you older dog will probably love this and come over to you probably settling on the blanket pup will eventually follow allow her to approach you allow her to sniff you don't reach out to her just talk to her and sooth her if she settles down beside you allow her to remain untouched in your company do this for an hour a day for a week or so gradually beginning to stroke her when you feel she is confident enough it will pay divideds later on good luck Dog training Shaggy dog story Social rule Housebreaking Milton H.
