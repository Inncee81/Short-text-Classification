would you adopt a dog from the spca when it hasn't been tested for heart worm i wonder what the chances of any given dog having heart worm are if not on preventive my children love this dog already and i would hate to have her tested and find out she has it am i worrying to much or is this a legitimate concern they have not and do not test them i would have to adopt her and have her tested myself it depends on the location heartworm is not common at all in the pacific northwest we don't have the temperatures to sustain the right conditions for development in squitoes typical heartworm areas have constant temperatures i believe no more than o change between day and nighttime we go from o in the day to o at night so if they aren't testing although you don't mention where you are it doesn't seem like you are in a high risk area like texas for example heartworm is treatable cureable with a bout of some nasty arsenic containing meds if the disease is not in advanced stages the dog can be given medicine so i guess the point is call some local vets in your area or call your vet if you have one talk with them about the risk in your area ask them about testing and treatment options and talk open and honestly with your children let them know about your concerns talk with them about what you would do as a family if you got her and she tested positive if you aren't willing to go through treatment then don't adopt the dog if you are then you should adopt her many areas of the country do not have heartworm problems my dog is not on preventative meds because we just don't see heartworm here the highest infection rates up to in dogs not maintained on heartworm preventive are observed within miles of the atlantic and gulf coasts from the gulf of mexico to new jersey and along the mississippi river and its major tributaries most dogs infected with heartworm can be successfully treated the goal of treatment is to kill all adult worms with an adulticide and all microfilariae with a microfilaricide it is important to try to accomplish this goal with a minimum of harmful effects from drugs and a tolerable degree of complications created by the dying heartworms heartworm infected dogs showing no signs or mild signs have a high success rate with treatment patients with evidence of more severe heartworm disease can be successfully treated but the possibility of complications and mortality is greater link is a map of high risk low risk areas for canine heartworm Cancer Folic acid Asthma Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Prostate cancer Pneumonia Urinary incontinence Malaria Medicine Stroke Cytomegalovirus Traumatic brain injury Hypoglycemia Acute respiratory distress syndrome Common cold Duesberg hypothesis Rocky Mountain spotted fever Coronary heart disease Multiple sclerosis AIDS Chronic fatigue syndrome Medical analysis of circumcision Tropical cyclone Antiretroviral drug Dog Hearing impairment Diarrhea Bone marrow transplant Stomach cancer Atherosclerosis Herpes simplex virus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Myocardial infarction Lupus erythematosus Decompression sickness Bipolar disorder Cervical cancer Tobacco smoking Childbirth Cephalic disorder Anorexia nervosa Acne Alzheimer's disease Onchocerciasis Phimosis Radiation therapy Colorectal cancer Psoriasis Pharmaceutical company Diabetic neuropathy Pelvic inflammatory disease Hepatitis C Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Vitamin C Ulcerative colitis HIV test Bayesian inference Theory of conduct Crohn's disease First aid Lung cancer Homeopathy Migraine Autism Avian influenza Myxobolus cerebralis Allergy Coeliac disease Hepatitis B Insulin Ascariasis Publicly funded medicine Glycogen storage disease type I Intelligence quotient Alternative medicine Leukemia Hepatitis AIDS in Africa Sleep apnea Paracetamol Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Hip fracture Narcolepsy Omega-3 fatty acid Androgen insensitivity syndrome Clinical depression Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Fibromyalgia Drug abuse Atrial septal defect
