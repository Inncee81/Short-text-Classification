what type of dog should i get i'm having problems you see we have a toddler boy who is everywhere and a little rumble tumble my thing is we need a dog where we live to chase away all the geese around our lot what type of dog would be safe around our little boy and chase away the geese i think the best type of dog would be a terrier they come in all sizes so you can choose a breed that is best for you herding breeds may work but some of them have a stronger herding instinct that might cause them to bunch the geese together without getting rid of the geese i have no doubt that a well trained herding dog could get rid of the geese in fact they do that at certain airports but it might need to be trained to take commands from you to get rid of the geese it really depends on the individual dog some herding dogs will rid your yard of geese and some will bunch them i considered a sporting breed as well however i know my dog with a strong hunting instinct would not do the job well he has too strong of a pointing instinct although he does stalk birds and squirrels he moves so slowly that they can just meander away i think terriers are best because they have a strong prey drive most are eager to go after something with little or no encouragement they're feisty and don't back down from tough prey this is a generalization of course about your little boy a lot of dogs can get along well with children but i think you should get an older dog from a rescue or shelter so you already know that it gets along well with children then you don't need to be taking care of two babies Dog Working dog Border Collie German Shepherd Dog Mixed-breed dog Cat American Pit Bull Terrier Hunting Terrier Companion dog Fox Terrier Border Terrier Welsh Terrier Fox hunting Rat Terrier Gun dog Gray Wolf West Highland White Terrier American Kennel Club Cairn Terrier Livestock Shetland Sheepdog Herd Fox Terrier (Wire) Golden Retriever Medieval hunting Comanche Dog agility Obedience training Falconry Wraith (Stargate) Skye Terrier Morphology (linguistics) Dog show Fox Terrier (Smooth) Australian Shepherd Domestic rabbit The Death Gate Cycle Ferret Basset Hound Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Kerry Blue Terrier Pit bull RuneScape quests Tibetan Terrier Shen Gong Wu Bird migration Crate training Dachshund Labrador Retriever Sin City Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier Belgian Shepherd Dog Domestication Puma Cowboy Kevin and Kell Breed standard Mastiff Infantilism The Brady Bunch Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Keeshond Australian Cattle Dog Yorkshire Terrier Dog training Herding dog American Bulldog Abortion debate The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Smooth Collie Korea Jindo Dog Nintendo 64 Australian Terrier Poodle Artificial selection Horse Garfield Schutzhund Shaggy dog story Bird The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Brent Goose Boards of Canada Arabian horse Spitz The Sims 2 Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Monster Rancher monsters Red Squirrel Tyrannosaurus rex Bull Terrier Toy dog Pet skunk Care Bears Iditarod
