real estate offer would you sign we are in an area that is going through rezoning from rural to industrial we have been approached with an offer that is what we are happy with money wise the catch is that the potential buyer wants to wait until offical rezoning has been granted before exchanging contracts and then normal day settlement the issue at the moment is that rezoning could take up to years maybe more maybe less if we agree to this we are effectively tying up our place to this buyer for this period if someone comes along in the meantime no guarantees of this happening we can't sell to them but when rezoning comes through we have sold immediately if we sign the offer on the table at the moment would you agree to this we are agonising over which way to go sign and have a firm buyer or hope someone else comes along and buys without the rezoning such a dilemma and huge decision other option is to do nothing and just wait for rezoning if it doesn't happen then they don't buy anyway we love where we live and are not desparate to sell the potential buyer has agreed to a of the purchase price as an option fee non refundable but this will also come off the purchase price at the end it is not in addition to the purchase price that is a tricky situation as far as i see it is the contract you are asked to sign contigent on the rezoning if the rezoning is not happening for some stupid reason you don't have a contract now the contract says that the day settlement are going to start after the official rezoning is done if that is the case and rezoning will take years then plus the days for settlement that is a long time and nobody knows what the market is doing you grant the seller a price which seems to be a good price in today's market but after rezoning and real estate market recovering this today good price might not be to good for you anymore you could try to a counter the offer and put a clause in there that you can keep the house on the market should you get another offer in inform your first buyer and grant him the right to close on your property in days to the original agreed price b counter the offer and leave the price open as soon as the rezoning is done get an appraisal for the new value of your property the purchase price will be either the original price he offered you today or the appraised value whatever is higher Supply and demand Real estate broker Microeconomics Option Contract Mortgage Call option Futures contract Put option Islamic banking Short selling Life insurance Security (finance) Price discrimination Tax Warranty Insurance Economics Stock Annuity Auction Standard form contract Stock market Mutual fund Arbitrage Commodity markets Rational pricing Topps MMORPG Privatization Poker jargon Option style Intellectual property Conveyancing Unconscionability Margin (finance) Zoning Monetary policy Royal Assent Technical analysis Gold as an investment Deflation (economics) GNU General Public License UK Singles Chart Gross domestic product Mergers and acquisitions Real estate Enron Corporation Derivative (finance) Commodity Wal-Mart Gold standard Housing cooperative First-sale doctrine Predatory lending IBM PC compatible Trading Places Day trading Estoppel Bretton Woods system Williamsburg, Brooklyn Real estate appraisal Hyperinflation Externality Insider trading Babylonian law Bond Inflation Credit derivative Advertising Toyota Prius Article One of the United States Constitution American Broadcasting Company Free market Real estate economics Labour economics Oakland Athletics Free trade Monopsony Plame affair Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Inventory Trade Surplus value Law of value Equal Protection Clause Asian financial crisis Hire purchase Divorce B__rgerliches Gesetzbuch
