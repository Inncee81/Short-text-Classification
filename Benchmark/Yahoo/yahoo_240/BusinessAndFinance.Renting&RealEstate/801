no lease landlord wants money ok i was living in a sublet for a month and a week no lease but i paid full months rent i called the landlord when i was leaving so i gave him days notice he didn't say anything he told me he was going to call me back but he didn't and i tried to call him again i just forgot about it and then today he calls says that he couldn't find anyone to rent for august so he wants me to send him a check first of all he did not tell me he was looking for someone or else i would have made sure i found a new person and then he calls me out of the blue demanding money it was a short term agreement i even asked him if he wanted me to sign a lease and he said no what to do i feel horrible about it but again he didn't want me to sign a lease and he did not call me for over a month telling me his intentions so i had no idea this was on my shoulders please help don't give in he probably thinks you are weak and if he threatens you enough that you will give in you may also want to keep your phone records just in case you have to go to court then you can show when you called for day notice and that he didn't call you until it was too late Leasehold estate Leasing Rent (musical) Estoppel Knots Landing EastEnders Schabir Shaik Trial Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Satchel Paige Plame affair Ocean's Twelve James Hanratty Eviction Poker jargon Fancy Crane 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Babylonian law One Tree Hill (TV series) Miss Saigon The Inside The Shining (film) Rental agreement Meat Loaf Social rule Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Chatham Square Oakland Athletics Vista Way Eric Bischoff Monopoly (game) Asterix and the Laurel Wreath Le Malade imaginaire Evel Knievel The Ashlee Simpson Show Shaggy dog story Fred Phelps Blood on the Tracks Renting Rosa Parks Tenshinhan Red Ribbon Army Janet Jackson She Loves You NorthBridge Apartment Complex StarCraft: Uprising Street-Legal Contract New York Jets A Simple Plan Brian Lenihan StarCraft Episode VI Overkill (band) The Emancipation of Mimi Neighbours Denis Law The Catcher in the Rye Kodocha Schapelle Corby Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Good Times The Amber Spyglass Ben Johnson (athlete) Major League Baseball television contracts Piccolo Junior Saga The Commons Yom Kippur War Oplan Bojinka Michael Garibaldi Irna Phillips Paula Jones Oasis (band) History of the Beatles Live 8 Blonde on Blonde Slow Train Coming Sandy Koufax Quarashi Time Out of Mind Timeline of the Enron scandal Continuation War Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Venezuelan recall referendum, 2004 Friends Delta Goodrem Big Brother (USA TV series) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Mary Jane Kelly Avenue Q I Want to Hold Your Hand The Jazz Singer Spice Girls Iggy Pop Muslim ibn Aqeel Therion (band) Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Montreal Screwjob Little Britain Bill White (neo-Nazi)
