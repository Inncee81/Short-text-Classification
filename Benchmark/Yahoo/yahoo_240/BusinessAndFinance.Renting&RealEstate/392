i wish i knew a realtor that wouldn't seem put out by me asking questions what's more important in your professional opinion for selling a home realtor incentives buyer cash back buyer closing costs paid or a percentage of cc paid sorry to keep asking questions on this same subject but i'm looking for suggestions and alternatives for selling my home my realtor is not much help she rushes me off the phone when i try to talk to her yes i'm calling her broker i'm not put out by your questions sounds like you're having a rough time with your realtor if you aren't dealing with any received offers then if i were you i would search around for a good by word of mouth realtor referral only possible problem would be if a buyer for your home was initiated by your current realtor then you would have to pay your old realtor a commission and not the new one if when you cancel your contract with your realtor be sure to read the cancellation carefully and check mark only the appropriate boxes removing him her from receiving any compensation from any sale if he has a list of potential buyers' names then he would write these names on the cancellation for your acknowledgement to choose from among the numbers you posted i would say number buyer closing costs unless the cash back is more than closing but in this market which is very soft buyers are having a field day they have so much inventory to choose from they can pretty much dictate the terms to desperate sellers remember it is the buyers who determine a home's value not the sellers if buyers aren't interested the main motivator to get their attention is a price reduction if a house is priced right then not only will the house get more showings but offers will come in a good realtor will provide you with comps for your home and be willing and able to answer all your real estate concerns i tell my seller clients who don't have to sell their home and are unwilling to reduce their price that it would be better to take the home off the market and try again next year rather than let it sit at an unappealing price i hope this helps and you can ask me questions anytime Microeconomics Insurance Mutual fund Economics Stock Futures contract Short selling Internet fraud Option Life insurance Illegal drug trade Surplus value Mergers and acquisitions Capitalism Tax Inventory Contract Stock market Wal-Mart Mortgage Islamic banking ITunes Music Store Advertising FairTax Margin (finance) Privatization Security (finance) Annuity Intellectual property Monopoly Inflation MMORPG Auction Real estate bubble Corporate finance Gold standard Economy of Russia Price discrimination Commodity $ale of the Century Gross domestic product Discounts and allowances The Wealth of Nations Hire purchase Monopoly (game) Bond Mediation Call option Taxation in the United States Spam (electronic) Arguments for and against drug prohibition Ford Motor Company Euro Oakland Athletics Oil-for-Food Programme Day trading Google Financial markets Subscription business model American Broadcasting Company Enron Corporation Price gouging Nuclear power Real estate economics Labor theory of value Betting (poker) Arbitrage Babylonian law Live 8 Put option Deflation (economics) Predatory lending B__rgerliches Gesetzbuch Atari ST Warren Buffett Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Investment bank Berkshire Hathaway Dot-com Economic relations of Japan Corporate governance Principal-agent problem Keynesian economics Theory of conduct Atari 8-bit family Surveillance Conveyancing Trademark Title insurance Fair market value Hyperinflation United Kingdom corporation tax
