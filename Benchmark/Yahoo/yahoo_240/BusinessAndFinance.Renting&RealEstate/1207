can someone seal off a fire door i need legal advice i have a retail store that has an apartment above it the entrance to this apartment is from a stairway that is a storefront down the owners of that building have apartments the stairs lead too plus my apartment somewhere in the history of the building an entrance was made to my apartment through a fire door between the buildings the previous owner of my building had lifetime rights to live rent free in my apartment he since died i am renting this apartment to my son now the owners of the store with the stairway say they don't want me to use their stairs i told them that there is no other entrance possilbe for this apartment but i would really try to think of a solution they agreed my son told me that they knocked on his door this morning and asked if we were making a new entrance it really is impossilbe because they were going to seal the fired door up i doubt that sealing a fire door and the only entrance and escape to our apartment is legal is it this is the only access to this apartment it was written into the abstract itself for the gentleman to have lifelong rights to live in our apartment rent free there may have been another entrance at one time but it has been this way for as long as any of the owners renters remember one person said that about years ago it was a two story furniture store then the owner made an apartment above and the only access was throught this fire door it even has the apartment number on the door and a hallway right to it so it has been this way for at least years we purchased the building with knowledge and being told this was the access it is nothing new to the stairway owners quick like a bunny pick up the phone and call the fire dept not the admin tell them what is happening i can guarantee you if these people seal that door they will recieve a large fine as well as probably get taken to court and they will have to incur the cost of putting it back to the way it was the fire dept and the building depts have determined that there must be a fire door there if there was not there would be a loss of life get on this quick good luck Sin City Columbine High School massacre Lawrence v.
