new home construction i was looking up property online and was curious what the cost would be to hook up the utilities the lot i was interested in is in town and the description states that the elec water is at the street also is it more expensive to have a home with a large footprint or one with a small one thats multiple stories thanks utility hookups are usually provided by the builder if you are building a home of your own your costs will vary with the distance the wiring and plumbing have to extend from the street a larger footprint means more land and therefore more expense this is also going to tranlate into an easier sale and greater profits at the end of your possesion if you are looking for inexpensive solutions your idea of a smaller lot with multi stories is a good one sorry i can't be more specific on your hook up costs but there are just to many variables Autonomous building Microeconomics McMansion Digital circuit Welding CPU design Capitalism Supply and demand Mach kernel Sport utility vehicle Manitoba Hydro Gas metal arc welding Construction Wind turbine Mutual fund Wardenclyffe Tower Solar cell Renewable energy Radio controlled airplane Knife Transformer Solar power RISC Rapid transit Hard disk Hydrogen economy Loudspeaker Pebble bed reactor Marginalism Antenna (radio) Electric motor Biodiesel Wind power Naval mine Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Computer Solar power satellite Sailing Water supply Telephone numbering plan Boeing 747 Sears Catalog Home Ford Motor Company Insurance Wayne Corporation Sewage treatment Light rail Plastic Software patent debate High-definition television Telephone exchange Energy development Bicycle frame Surreal number Trip distribution Electrophysiology Contra Costa County, California Privatization Xbox Aircraft carrier Space habitat Economics Drill bit Welfare economics Grid energy storage Quicksort Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Open source culture Tax Bungalow G__del's incompleteness theorem Shopping mall Shader Tesla coil Economic anthropology Labor theory of value Compiler optimization Action potential Public transport High-speed rail Real estate economics Dialysis SimCity 4 Hash table Earthing system Public good Passenger car Handloading Straw-bale construction Electrical wiring Floppy disk Real estate developer Eyepiece Robert Hooke Illegal drug trade Commodity Capital accumulation Hamster
