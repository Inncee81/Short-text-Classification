rental applications with boyfriend who makes less money hi i feel very badly after we were turned down for a great apt for a great price when i asked why the landlord told me that he accepted an application who had a higher income even though we were the first to turn in the paperwork and he told us that it was a first come first serve basis i make k a year and the rent is per month my take home pay each month after taxes and benefits is more than enough to cover rent i have very few bills and no car payment my credit is amazing so he told me this and is was very harsh to hear that since i feel qualified to rent the apt my question is is the landlord just snobby or does it hurt for my live in boyfriend to also be on the lease and fill out an app since he make times less than i do he's younger has less credit but it's not bad he works fulltime but makes minimum wage is this hurting my chances of getting apts we are rented to now under these same conditions so i am confused maybe the landlord is lame help your income alone in plenty for the apartment maybe the landlord just picked someone else when i pick tenants sometimes i just pick who i like best you're not going to be selected first all the time just get another place and don't take it personally Leasehold estate Leasing Estoppel Renting Rental agreement Taxation in the United States Monopoly (game) Housing cooperative Apartment Rent control United Kingdom corporation tax Harlem Health insurance Deflation (economics) Anarchism and capitalism Rent (musical) Mortgage Life insurance Geolibertarianism Insurance Warren Buffett Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Public housing Eviction Surplus value Prostitution in Germany Apartment building Mutual fund Minimum wage Stuyvesant Town Value added Centrelink Irish Land Act Babylonian law Avenue Q Auto insurance Article One of the United States Constitution Social rule Progressive tax Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Real estate bubble Unemployment benefit Credit card Tax Gold standard National Insurance Capitalism The Inside Great Depression Babe Ruth Judiciary of Hong Kong New Deal Economy of Russia Unreformed House of Commons Absentee landlord Student loan Keynesian economics Inflation Barrister Economic inequality First-sale doctrine Microeconomics Operating surplus Gross domestic product Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849) One Tree Hill (TV series) Filling station Schabir Shaik Trial The Apprentice 2 Annuity St. Elmo's Fire (film) 401(k) Social Security debate (United States) Capital accumulation Islamic banking U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 The Amazing Race Social Security (United States) Labor theory of value Tax credit Supply-side economics EastEnders Manorialism Wal-Mart Waste (law) History of the United States (1918-1945) Publicly funded medicine Knots Landing Welfare trap Wheel of Fortune Efficiency wages Intermediate consumption Corporate finance Free trade Satchel Paige Money Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
