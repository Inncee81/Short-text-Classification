if a landlord fails to collect rent or even make contact with a tenant for year do they then have the right a relative of mine has been renting a house and two years ago he attempted to pay rent one month and discovered that the landlord had up and dissapeared he would continually seek out this person to pay them their rent but none of the phone numbers worked and the landlady never came by to collect rent for two whole years does this lady now have the right to demand back rent in full for two years this happened in california by the way i suspect they probably do have the right to collect the rent statue of limitations is still not running ie they can still legally get a judgement for this money the debt is not old enough to be uncollectable still i can't believe they would actually expect to get the money after so much time if i were the tenant i would try to make a deal with them to pay maybe the last months worth of rent if they will forego the rest if the tenant flat out refused to pay anything they'd have to evict them and still probably not get the rent then take them to court and all sorts of other stuff long story short i'm not sure what they could collect from the tenant when all was said and done but probably less than months worth of rent if the tenant simpy wouldn't pay so since they are likely to get less tahn months rent if they do an eviction its probably in the landlords best interest to take months rent and move on problem is this doesn't sound like a very smart landlord so maybe they won't take any deal anyhow i'd say offer a few months back rent to forget the whole thing and see if they can make a deal for some of the back rent also although i do think the landlord can try to collect all back rent its hard to do this and they may end up getting only part of the rent Leasehold estate Estoppel Eviction Monopoly (game) Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849) Leasing Rent control Irish Land Act Microeconomics Rent (musical) Squatting Art Modell Housing cooperative Harlem Mortgage Public housing Property (ownership right) Annuity Economic rent Rental agreement Michael Davitt Renting Money Scottish clan Poker jargon Land reform Concurrent estate Insurance Apartment American individualist anarchism Waste (law) Stuyvesant Town Property tax Contract Serfdom Unreformed House of Commons Absentee landlord Therion (band) Judiciary of Hong Kong Sin City Capitalism Tithe Knots Landing Interest New Deal Deflation (economics) Debt Schabir Shaik Trial Surveillance Credit card History of Ireland (1801-1922) ABC No Rio Neoclassical economics Barrister Thomas de Littleton Anarcho-capitalism Satchel Paige 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Land use forecasting George Moore (novelist) Economics Real estate bubble The Super Milk-chan Show Manorialism Craps Enron Corporation Toyota Prius Jack Lang (Australian politician) Plame affair Irish Land League FairTax Assignment (law) EastEnders Warren Buffett Yield curve Capital accumulation Public policy Security (finance) Economy of Russia Motion picture rating system Blackjack Economy of Africa Rovers Return Slippery slope French nobility Great Depression Divorce Neville Chamberlain Section 8 (housing) IBM PC compatible Black Books Life insurance 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, vote suppression
