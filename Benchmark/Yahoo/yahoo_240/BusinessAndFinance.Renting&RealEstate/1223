i have three questions about the housing market ok so due to the recent and i mean within hours of american mortgage filing bankruptcy due to the market crashing in the housing industry because of arm loans have some questions that i need some help understanding how many people in the united states are still paying on houses what percentage of those people have adjustable arm loans from their mortgage company and if the housing market fails and are economy is screwed up as it is now who is going to help out i mean back in the eighities they took dollars from everyones taxes and used it to supplement the failing savings and bonds now we are trillion dollars in debt who is going to pay for the now billion dollar housing failure ok i understand that it looks bad answering your questions probably won't do anyone that much good other than to re inforce what you already know so let's get real here and try to give you some help instead the truth of the matter is we are looking at loans that were sub prime loans that are going sour not the normal a loans so while there are a lot of them there are people both in and out of the industry working dilligently to solve these issues if you are one of the ones who find themselves in a bad spot and perhaps facing bankruptcy or foreclosure or both the best advice i can offer is this call the bank as soon as you see a problem ask for the loss mitigation department and explain your situation calmly if it is a long term problem realize sooner rather than later that you may have to sell the house to save your credit the credit is critical for the well being of yourself and your family in the future if you sell it even in a shortsale you may be able to actually buy another one in about a year the lenders want a year of no lates before they will lend today so if you can sell and get started on that year you are moving forward with your future and a wiser buyer you will be the next time sometimes the lessons we learn in life are learned the hard way but those are the ones that teach us the best it's ok you wouldn't be alone in this find a realtor who is experienced in short sales and foreclosure prevention and work with them they will ask you to sign a form that let's them speak to your lender on your behalf you may still have to move but you will have someone on your side in the process it's good to have a friend when you are up against that wall Deflation (economics) Bond Debt Predatory lending Bank Government debt Economy of the United States Economy of Russia Student loan Insurance Financial markets Hyperinflation Microeconomics U.S. public debt Money supply Interest Donald Trump Money Government National Mortgage Association Citigroup Mergers and acquisitions Real estate Federal National Mortgage Association Supply and demand Capitalism Asian financial crisis Mutual fund FairTax Finance Inflation Foreclosure Security (finance) Microcredit Taxation in the United States Social Security (United States) Privatization Credit card Temasek Holdings Short selling Annuity Mortgage-backed security Economy of Pakistan Yield curve Personal finance Primerica Financial Services Economy of Argentina Real estate bubble Capital accumulation Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Title insurance United States dollar History of the United States (1918-1945) Unemployment Derivative (finance) Debt consolidation Economy of India Dot-com Corporation Marshall Plan Usury Subsidy Economy of Chile Keynesian economics Wal-Mart Say's law Treasury security Central bank Social Security debate (United States) Economics Debt levels and flows Supply-side economics Bank fraud Theory of conduct Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Economy of Cuba Economy of El Salvador Education in the United States Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Public policy Famine Stock market MMORPG Kyoto Protocol Arbitrage Economic relations of Japan Financial services Stock Developing countries' debt
