real estate question lease to own option and adding a person to the title of the home person a owns the home and offered person b a lease to own option the lease to own option states person a wants person b to pay of the property taxes during the lease period person a will add person b to the title of the home so that person b can claim the mortage payments property taxes as a credit at the end of the tax year however person b is not on the loan when person b excersices the purchase option at the end of the lease term the purchase price will be the balance on the mortages any outstanding taxes owed on the property such that person a can leave the transaction without owing anything if person a defaults on the mortage loan and forecloses what does that mean for person b will person b also be liable for the loan several issues with this agreement be very careful putting you on the title is done through a quit claim transfer of interest a relatively simple form that gets filed with the county recorder however the lender that initially gave the note to person a has an acceleration clause that they can invoke an acceleration clause is basically they are loaning person a the money and person a is the sole owner of the home they don't know person b and didn't approve them for the loan therefore if person a transfers their ownership of the home or a part thereof they can make the entire loan balance come due for person a because of the acceleration clause owning the home does not give you a right to deduct mortgage payments in any way shape or form if you are not liable for the loan you are not paying interest against money you are borrowing even if you are writing the lender a check you will not receive a at the end of the year that gives you an interest write off as an owner of the home you will be able to write off a portion of the property taxes and a portion of the depreciation if you are living in the home only if person a defaults the lender will foreclose and sell the home person b will be out of luck they will not be personally liable for the loan but the collateral the home will be taken and sold in order to satisfy the loan person b would be out of the house this ties in with exactly why the acceleration clause is there otherwise a person could be a dozen houses for people who can't get loans and merely transfer them over to those people that wouldn't normally approve strongly strongly strongly recommend an attorney to prepare the lease to own option to cover the terms of the agreement i've seen too many people get burned on these types of things Leasing Student loan Security (finance) Credit card Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus United Kingdom corporation tax Islamic banking Debt Life insurance Interest Bond Allodial title Bank Stock Government National Mortgage Association Concurrent estate Real estate broker Predatory lending Title insurance Contract Annuity Tax Economy of India Monetary policy Mortgage-backed security Tennessee State Constitution Article One of the United States Constitution Real estate Surplus value Microeconomics Donald Trump Finance Short selling Derivative (finance) Economy of the United States Leasehold estate Money Corporation Government debt Annual percentage rate 401(k) Bank fraud Capital accumulation FairTax Deflation (economics) Bretton Woods system Oakland Athletics Stamp duty Federal National Mortgage Association Intellectual property Babylonian law Gross domestic product Free trade Mutual fund Liability Subsidy Foreclosure Capitalism Interest rate Credit derivative Flat tax Usury Mobile home Assignment (law) Warren Buffett Property (ownership right) Collateralized mortgage obligation Air America-Gloria Wise loan controversy SCO-Linux controversies Financial markets First-sale doctrine Measures of national income and output Futures contract Trust (Law) USA Privatization Repurchase agreement Citigroup Economy of Russia Housing cooperative Education in the United States Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Savings and loan association Primerica Financial Services Debt consolidation Municipal bond Real estate bubble Microcredit Anarchism and capitalism Estoppel Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act United States Postal Service
