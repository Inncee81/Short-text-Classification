im signing a oneyear rent contract in rocherste ny i have to break it in month will it affect my credit i am signing a one year rent contract in rochester ny i am moving out in months and cannot commit to it i might have to break it does it affect my credit score or will they just take the security deposit and that is it is there any solutions other than paying the whole month rent it could depending on what your lease says check it very closely some leases have an early termination clause and if it does not then you are responsible for the rent until the end of your lease or until the apt is re rented once someone else rents it then you are out of the lease they cannot collect double rent but if you just leave and the apt is not rented out and you do not pay what is left owed on your lease yes you could be sued or turned over to a collection agency also remember to give a day written notice that you are moving out whether your lease it up or you are leaving early the security deposit is for damages beyond normal wear and tear and any cleaning the may have to be done so you could get it back as long as the lease if full filled or the apt is re rented and you give proper notice and leave it clean and undamaged but if you do not give notice then you will forfeit the security deposit even if you full fill the lease agreement Leasehold estate Rental agreement Renting Estoppel Oakland Athletics Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Housing cooperative Rent (musical) Contract Babylonian law Bond Credit card Annuity Insurance Hire purchase Motion picture rating system Blackburn Rovers F.C.
