forfeiting a contract on a condo we purchased a condominium at pre construction a few years ago recently we had our walk through and were very disappointed in the execution of the construction therefore we forfeited our deposit what i want to know is can i claim this as a loss in my taxes and if so how should i claim it if the contract was terminated for the breach of the builder you would be entitled to the deposit back this is because the deposit is a bond for your performance not the builder's it is also possible to seek what is called relief against forfeiture especially in cases where the builder has effectively delivered nothing no title as to deductibility it is less certain depends on your jurisdiction but it is unlikely as most require that the expense be incurred in the course of gaining income or something similar United Kingdom corporation tax Leasing Insurance Annuity Flat tax Security (finance) FairTax Contract Capital gains tax Estoppel Mutual fund Microeconomics Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus 401(k) Divorce Babylonian law Income statement Mortgage Life insurance Article One of the United States Constitution Construction Apprenticeship Donald Trump Monetary policy Bond Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 Credit card Tax cut McMansion Food Stamp Program Duty of care Status of religious freedom in Malaysia Lloyd's of London Health savings account Social Security (United States) Tax protester Income trust Judicial functions of the House of Lords Condominium Income tax Tesla coil Gross domestic product Surety bond Government debt Form 1040 Unemployment benefit Bail bondsman Mergers and acquisitions Baseball Radio controlled airplane Conveyancing Adoption Treaty Trust (Law) USA Money Tort Corporation Spyware Iran's nuclear program Health insurance Domestic partnerships in California Assignment (law) Welding Bank fraud Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Rental agreement Salary cap Scots law Court system of Canada Hyperinflation Scientific method PaX Home insurance Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Overclocking Housing cooperative Hire purchase Trade union Leasehold estate Compiler optimization SS Andrea Doria Tax deduction Hurricane preparedness for New Orleans Commodity markets Margin (finance) Charitable trust 2004-05 NHL lockout Money creation Alkane Optical fiber Short selling Hereditary peer Article Three of the United States Constitution Legal rights of women Juris Doctor Model aircraft
