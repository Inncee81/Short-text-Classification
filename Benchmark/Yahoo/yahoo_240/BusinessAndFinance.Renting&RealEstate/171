exiting a commercial lease early will affect my real property how my ex general partners want to close the business and exit the lease early i am still on the lease with them i have tried to get off of the lease but the landlord won't allow it because my partners have no assets therefore they are a greater risk i listed all of my assets on the lease agreement which us partners personally signed my main question is can i lose my condos over this if yes how what happens can i claim bankruptcy if i do will i lose my condos or will i be able to keep them will i need to hire a lawyer how will i pay my lawyer with what money the business is not making any money the partners do not have money for next month's rent your main question is can you lose your condo's over this no the worst that'll happen with the condo's is that a lien may be placed on one of them only after a judgment against you which would have to be paid at the point of selling the condo if you file bankruptcy will you lose them no bankruptcy destroys your credit but it protects your property at this time of a record number of foreclosures there is also a record number of bankruptcies from people stopping the mortgage companies from taking their homes away from them i will tell you that the landlord has a responsibility to mitigate the damages meaning he must make every reasonable effort to re lease the property he must run ads post signs show the property to perspective tenants and not turn away qualified tenants once the land lord does re lease the property you are only on the hook for the amount of time that the property sat vacant not for the duration of your lease if he can not find a new tenant you are on the hook for the balance of your lease the previous answer was sound that the company should consult an attorney but only regarding the dissolution of a corporation not even a good lawyer will get you out of a lease unless you can demonstrate that the property became inhabitable causing you to move your partners should be jointly liable but the landlord can sue who they wish and it's you that have the assets so if you're the only one sued and you lose you would then have to sue your partners to recover their fair share of the damages Mortgage Leasehold estate Leasing Insurance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus SCO-Linux controversies Capitalism Concurrent estate Divorce Intellectual property Islamic banking Corporation Housing cooperative United Kingdom corporation tax Waste (law) Taxation in the United States Software patent debate Bond Eviction Deflation (economics) Appeal Trademark Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Capital accumulation Wal-Mart Lawyer Babylonian law Donald Trump Debt Timeline of the Enron scandal Trust (Law) USA Schabir Shaik Trial Property (ownership right) Allodial title Bankruptcy Oakland Athletics Article One of the United States Constitution Rental agreement Domestic partnerships in California Irish Land Act Liability Medical malpractice Slander and libel Security (finance) Contract 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Condominium United Airlines Derivative (finance) Surplus value Microeconomics Interest Stamp duty Anarchism and capitalism Asbestos Mutual fund Citigroup Property law Airline Commodore International Delta Air Lines Sears Holdings Corporation Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code Los Angeles Clippers Asian financial crisis Great Depression Law firm Mikhail Khodorkovsky Wealth American individualist anarchism Renting Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Mortgage-backed security Title insurance Bankruptcy in the United States Real property Tort reform Fixtures Lawsuit Foreclosure Pacific, Missouri Warren Buffett BAE Systems Incorporation (business) Free trade Labor theory of value Personal finance Bruce Johnson Video game crash of 1983
