advice to get ex off mortgage please years ago in april last my partner of years abandoned me for someone else for years i d supported him financially he hasn t paid a single penny to anything since he left and i have no idea where he has gone to before he left he ran up debts and emptied my bank account i am in serious debt now as a result of this and need to either sell my home or re finance neither of which i can do without my ex s signature he has made it quite clear he d be pleased if my home was re possessed it was bought with monies left by late husband but i foolishly put my ex s name on the house as he didn t feel part of our home my mortgage company will not move they will not take his name off and are threatening to repossess my home as i have fallen into arrears they are insisting on the arrears being paid off in full plus months payments before they will even consider taking his name off i have my hands tied can anyone tell me how i can get his name off please by the way i am based in the united kingdom and we weren t married unfortunately the only way to get his name off the mortgage is to refinance it in your own name if his name in on the deed as well you'll have to get him to abandon his claim to the property as part of the refinance in your situation i'd highly urge a consultation with a solicitor you have other issues here aside from the name on the mortgage Bond Federal National Mortgage Association Student loan Credit card Government National Mortgage Association Concurrent estate Estoppel Knots Landing Security (finance) Life insurance Primerica Financial Services Debt Donald Trump Insurance Deflation (economics) Islamic banking Derivative (finance) Allodial title Mutual fund Taxation in the United States Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Money American individualist anarchism Real estate bubble Financial markets Mortgage-backed security Great Depression Gold standard Monopoly (game) Economy of the United States Predatory lending Privatization Marriage Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Irish Property Bubble Monetary policy Finance U.S. public debt Babylonian law FairTax Pound sterling Housing cooperative History of the United States Constitution Bank fraud United Kingdom corporation tax Annuity Economy of Nigeria Internet fraud King Ranch Wells Fargo Schabir Shaik Trial Tesco Government debt Stock Legal tender Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Investment bank Campaign finance reform Bank 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Economy of C__te d'Ivoire Securitization Oakland Athletics History of the United States (1918-1945) Economy of Haiti Foreclosure Mensal__o scandal SCO-Linux controversies Real estate developer Annual percentage rate Warren Buffett High-yield debt Real estate broker Enron Corporation Charles Ponzi Credit score Leasing Divorce Thirteen Years' War Temasek Holdings Microeconomics Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Child support History of Schleswig-Holstein Economy of Africa Hong Kong Monetary Authority Joseph Smith, Jr. Asian financial crisis Interest Municipal bond Cyprus dispute Anarchism and capitalism Stock market
