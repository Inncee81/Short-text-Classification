buying property in europe hi i was just wondering if anyone has bought property in europe i am thinking of buying an apartment in eastern europe slovakia to rent out to ski couples families in winter and hikers outdoor people in the summer months by the way its only an idea its not like happening tomorrow i was just wondering if anyone has any advice on what to look out for and any tips on how to make things run smoothly also gosh i know this sounds lame but can anyone explain to me how the whole process happens when you buy abroad please if anyone can give some advice to help my plans come together a bit better i would be really grateful thanks x the process to buy in slovakia is relatively simple once you've found the right property and buyer seller agreed a price you place a deposit with the agent this secures the price and the formal process begins also at this stage you should be aware the agent withdraws his expenses but only if you decide not to proceed if the seller withdraws he's responsible for paying the agents costs and repaying your deposit assuming nothing changes from your original selection of home a pre contract to purchase is raised via the selling agent thereafter a survey views the property and sends his report direct to the solicitor appointed for the sale given all is satisfactory a final contract is prepared signed by all parties and sent to the kataster land registry and circa weeks later the property becomes yours in legal title and you are then the proud owner incidentally the contract is usually formally translated by a certified translator in advance of your sginature etc mortgage not so easy in solvakia and probably not the best way to raise finance to purchase there numerous specialist brokererages are available but if you want help and one of the lowest rates for most european locations i've personally found is a guy called alex boston offered the best rates through their affiliate can't remember name off hand he also has good knowledge of the process when i bought my place he also turned me on to the fact austrian's like renting there since it's very close to vienna good luck Mortgage Microeconomics Supply and demand Conveyancing Leasing Capitalism Tax Economics Islamic banking Insurance Intellectual property Internet fraud Futures contract Stock Life insurance Option Annuity Bond Derivative (finance) Monetary policy Value added tax Estoppel Housing cooperative Gold standard Illegal drug trade Gross domestic product Babylonian law Surplus value Appeal Privatization Hire purchase Mutual fund Plame affair Diamond Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus FairTax Property (ownership right) Predatory lending Hyperinflation American individualist anarchism Slovakia Labor theory of value Unconscionability Lawyer Marriage Price discrimination Financial markets Investment bank Rational pricing Inflation Real estate bubble Capital accumulation Monopoly (game) Construction Commodity Call option Oakland Athletics Inventory Transformation problem Debt Great Depression Anarchism and capitalism Royal Assent Copyright Euro Arbitrage Divorce Title insurance Warren Buffett Money Austrian School Temasek Holdings Law of value Warranty Flat tax Wealth First-sale doctrine Taxation in the United States Deflation (economics) Wal-Mart The Apprentice 2 Social rule ITunes Music Store Scots law Trademark Rental agreement Allodial title Free market Paul Martin Polish September Campaign Technical analysis B__rgerliches Gesetzbuch Credit card
