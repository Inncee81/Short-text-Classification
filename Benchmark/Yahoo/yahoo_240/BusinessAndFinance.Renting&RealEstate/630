how much of a notice should we give our landlord when moving out my boyfriend and i along with his brother's and his brother's gf who don't live with us are in the proces of buying a house the closing deadline is my boyfriend told our landlord yesterday that we were in the process of buying a house and that we will be we'll be moving out while we may or may not be moving in right after closing i was curious as to whether we should have told him sooner rather than later our landlord never had us sign a new lease after the first one expired we've been here for close to years so legally he couldn't take us to court if he decided to be a pain in the but right since we had asked him about signing a new lease but he never brought a new one for us to sign basically i'm just curiious if we went about things the right way in our situation and if we could possibly have some trouble coming our way we live in massachusetts if that info is necessary i have checked the lease from when we first moved in and i cannot find any information about leaving notification or that the lease would continue if no other leases were signed the lease states that it expires correction i have found the paragraph stating that the lease would continue if no other lease was signed while i'm at it i have found a paragraph stating that the tenant is entitled to interest on the last month's rent from the first and last that being pursuant to applicable law i'm curious to know whether or not this contiion law is met it really depends on what was in your original contract even though you didn't re sign a lease you are still held liable it depends on the state as to what the landlord is entitled in some it's days some and some as many as common courtesy would be at least weeks so i think you're fine as you have given him at least days but you should be prepared for him to make you pay the full months rent even if you do move out on the th Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Eviction Babylonian law Rental agreement Royal Assent Waste (law) Plame affair Knots Landing Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 16 Public domain Boston and Lowell Railroad Appeal 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Real property Judiciary of Hong Kong Oakland Athletics Social rule Domain Name System Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Property (ownership right) Neighbours Enron Corporation One Tree Hill (TV series) Property law Notary public Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Civil rights Information Services Procurement Library Satchel Paige Housing cooperative Monopoly (game) Controlled Substances Act Mortgage United Kingdom corporation tax Irish Land Act Judicial functions of the House of Lords Unreformed House of Commons Rent (musical) Bush v.
