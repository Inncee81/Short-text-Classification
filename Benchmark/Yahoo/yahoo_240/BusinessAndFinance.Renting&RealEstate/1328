what are the chances a bank will try and actually collect from a deficiency judgement i know i will have a deficiency judgement once house sell at auction going to foreclosure soon since prices have dropped in market this house is at i was wondering what are the chances that they will go for my assets i spoke to them only once and asked them if they would try and actaully take my money if the house sells for less was asking about shortsale and they said no that they would only note on my credit score that i have a deficiency judgement and will be there for years which i dont care as long as they dont take my money so im thinking and hoping no also the house i live in is under wifes name will it affect her it say on the papers the sue is against me and unknown spouse but i was unmarried at the time can they put a lean againts where i currently live its under her name only do the banks actually take money out of your account or paychecks how does it work and is it common them trying to collect the deficiency most lenders will not go after a person once the property is foreclosed on this is the collateral they lent on and this it the collateral they collect to pay off any loans owed them the foreclosure will appear on your credit report for a certain length of time as time goes on this becomes less and less important it appears as if you live in a community property state where as what is owned by you and your spouse is half owned by the other since you were not married at the time and you were the only one that signed the loan docs they will only go after you they normally can not take a property that they did not finance or cross collateralized against the property they are foreclosing on so it appears as if your wife and her property is ok and will not be bothered since they have told you they will not go for a deficiency judgment your pay check will not be garnished or your bank account will not be bothered i hope this has been of some use to you good luck fight on Mortgage Bond Foreclosure Divorce Bank Security (finance) Finance Credit card Concurrent estate Predatory lending Great Depression Money supply Marriage Citigroup Short selling Temasek Holdings Monetary policy Government National Mortgage Association Economy of Russia Donald Trump Gold standard Derivative (finance) Central bank Corporation Bank fraud Debt consolidation Money Interest Financial markets Debt Contract Annuity Usury Privatization Schabir Shaik Trial Real estate Universal Studios Government debt Taxation in the United States Hyperinflation Capitalism Warren Buffett Economy of India Tax Collateralized debt obligation Financial services Mikhail Khodorkovsky Islamic banking Real estate broker Insurance Student loan Social Security (United States) Mortgage-backed security Credit score Microcredit Wal-Mart Internet fraud Asian financial crisis Capital accumulation Auction Federal National Mortgage Association Babylonian law Fractional-reserve banking Economy of Pakistan Microeconomics ACORN Probate SCO-Linux controversies Margin (finance) Mutual fund Bretton Woods system Banknote Education in the United States Islamic economics FairTax Cheque Estoppel Stock market Repurchase agreement Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Lender of last resort Savings and loan association Anarchism and capitalism 401(k) Mensal__o scandal Economy of Chile American individualist anarchism Allodial title
