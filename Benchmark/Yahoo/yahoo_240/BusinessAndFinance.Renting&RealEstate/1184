would you have done the same if it was your apartment after renting my apartment here for one month the landlords are selling it my apartment is connected to other businesses the relator just showed up with no warning and wanted to show the place in minutes as i was walking my puppy my place was a complete mess a lot of things we need to put into storage and there was no way i could get it done in that time so i told him that he couldn't show the place since it was a wreck and i need to have hours notice which is the law and stated in my lease i feel bad now cuz he told me he traveled some distance away but i also have dogs that would probably scare the crap out of them if i weren't home and they decided to come he also knew that i lived in the apartment above because he asked if i was the tenant living in the apartment yep i totally agree the realtor knows the law as does your landlord if you don't know your rights you will definitely be trampled but it sounds like you do i would send a certified letter to the landlord letting him know you need the hours notice like it says in your lease you don't need to have any emotion about it at all it's matter of fact your lease says blank and you want blank period don't feel bad at all the realtor probably just said he traveled to make you feel guilty and let him in they are sneaky after all good luck Leasehold estate Leasing Friends Social rule Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Avenue Q EastEnders Sin City Rental agreement Dog training Maison Ikkoku The Inside American Psycho Jon Secada Apartment Time Out of Mind The Contender (television series) Theory of conduct One Tree Hill (TV series) Hey Jude Sydney Riot of 1879 Eviction Airport (film) Real estate broker Blonde on Blonde Miss Saigon Sharon Tate Modding The Subtle Knife Meat Loaf Satchel Paige Boston and Lowell Railroad Craps The Ashlee Simpson Show Estoppel Steven Wright K' Shit Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Philip J.
