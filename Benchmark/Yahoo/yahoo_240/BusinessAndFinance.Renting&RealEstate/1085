can the government help ease the interest rate rises on home loans if so what when will this happen its hard enough to afford the simple life e g food bills car registration but with the constant rises in interest rates on home loans it makes it even harder for the average home loan and even harder on someone wanting to get a home loan the over riding governance on interest rates is the federal reserve system however the sharp increase in real estate values over the past years makes no sense to me your average home was once an affordable expense when it was worth only a hundred thousand dollars in this market we see ridiculously priced homes everything from studio apartments to small mansions all priced way above the means of ordinary people who comprise the bulk of the population what is taking effect now is that as the people keep losing good paying jobs to downsizing they in turn move in to cramped living quarters this in turn results in a glut of real estate sitting with for sale signs that could stay for sale for a long time unless prices get reduced to where people can actually afford them the shaky condition of the real estate market could lead to further economic trouble the stimulus that the federal reserve can provide by lowering interest rates will ease the burden but never enough to give the general population the needed relief for these astoundingly high real estate costs in effect we have a shaky economy hinging upon what real estate will do some prosper by buying and selling never considering that people's income should dictate what real estate should sell for no slight decrease in interest rates will solve this growing problem only drastic reductions in the costs for real estate can revive the interest in buying real estate again those willing to sell property should consider lowering them to where a greater pool of potential buyers will buy without having future problems as interest rates change the greed factor will ultimately turn the american dream into a nightmare don't depend on what the government can do their hands are tied now that they have a run away national debt and bad fiscal policy Capital accumulation Monetary policy Keynesian economics Supply and demand Economy of Russia History of the United States (1918-1945) Tax Gold standard Mortgage Hyperinflation Bretton Woods system Tariff Surplus value FairTax Insurance Economy of the United States Life insurance Supply-side economics Great Depression Taxation in the United States Reaganomics Economy of Africa Economy of Pakistan Unemployment Economy of Sri Lanka Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) U.S. public debt Money Bond Privatization Euro Law of value Progressive tax Asian financial crisis 1973 oil crisis Government debt Tax cut Marshall Plan Mutual fund Arbitrage Debt Economy of Nigeria Arthur Laffer United States dollar Monetarism Gross domestic product History of post-Soviet Russia Real estate bubble Deficit spending Predatory lending Labor theory of value Free trade Trickle down effect Famine Donald Trump Economy of Chile Social Security debate (United States) Minimum wage Short selling Kyoto Protocol Canadian and American economies compared Oil depletion Publicly funded medicine Biodiesel Health insurance Canadian and American health care systems compared Federal Reserve Implications of peak oil Digital photography Annuity Property tax Economics Globalization Subsidy Economy of El Salvador Economy of Haiti Oil price increases of 2004 and 2005 Intellectual property Wal-Mart Economic history of the United States Illegal drug trade MMORPG Argentine Currency Board Mergers and acquisitions
