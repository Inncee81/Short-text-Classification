if i form an llc to buy property will a bank lend me money to accomplish this goal i just want to make sure that the property is not directly purchased under my name but rather the llc's name that is a good question to ask upfront most lenders will not lend to llc's but as the previous poster mentioned some do it really depends on whether or not they intend to sell the paper on the secondary market be sure to ask a potential lender before application if they allow it so you don't get close to closing and then find out you have to close in your name however if you do close in your name you can always quit claim the property over to the llc after closing best of luck to you Mortgage Finance Financial markets Corporation Monetary policy Predatory lending Ethernet Central bank Temasek Holdings Title insurance Real estate broker Privatization Short selling Inflation Student loan Citigroup Money Insurance Debt Bond Deflation (economics) Security (finance) Monopoly (game) Mutual fund Explosive material Gold standard Money supply DBS Bank Oracle Corporation Federal National Mortgage Association Annual percentage rate Islamic banking SCO-Linux controversies Housing cooperative Trademark Free trade Labor theory of value First-sale doctrine Government National Mortgage Association American individualist anarchism Commodity Economy of Pakistan Leasing Donald Trump Chaos theory Wells Fargo Trade Interest Credit card Developing countries' debt Annuity Real estate Government debt Surveillance Surplus value Islamic economics Tax Great Depression Anarchism and capitalism Market system Economy of Russia Prediction market Microeconomics Bretton Woods system Mutual-fund scandal (2003) Hughes Aircraft Gold as an investment Austrian School Public policy Money creation New York Central Railroad Repurchase agreement Lionel Corporation Segway HT AMD Copyleft Hyperinflation Lionel, LLC Irish Life and Permanent Subsidy United Overseas Bank Publishing Foreclosure Marshall Plan Fiat money Mergers and acquisitions Microcredit Estoppel Octopus card American Airlines United Artists Public good Primerica Financial Services Craps Mikhail Khodorkovsky Conveyancing MMORPG Bulk vending
