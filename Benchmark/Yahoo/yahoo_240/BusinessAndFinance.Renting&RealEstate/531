considering the current market trend is this the best time to sell buy or stay put in real estate i'm not sure what to do with my property real estate is a local animal some areas are doing poorly some not so bad and some are still hot i don't know where your property is but i would suggest doing a little old fashioned planning with pen to paper are houses in you area that are similar to yours in age size upgrades view etc selling for what price would you be willing and are you able to sell at a similar or lesser price will that sales price cover your current mortgage home equity line sales taxes moving costs and so on oddly enough it's a great time to be a buyer so if you are looking to get a super value in a new home that's very possible right now but you have to understand what you can sell your own home for first check with a local realtor for information on what your house may be worth on today's market and what you would net from that sale if it still makes sense go for it like i said it's a great time to be a buyer good luck and best wishes c Mortgage Real estate broker Microeconomics Tax Mutual fund Monopoly (game) Supply and demand Advertising Capitalism Security (finance) FairTax Life insurance Real estate Technical analysis Gross domestic product Property tax Islamic banking Surplus value Insurance Price discrimination Option Capital accumulation Deflation (economics) Bond Real estate appraisal Intellectual property Diamond Day trading Atari 8-bit family Taxation in the United States Privatization Airline Free market Stock Predatory lending Federal National Mortgage Association Ming Pao Housing cooperative Mortgage-backed security Derivative (finance) White flight Law of value Futures contract Warren Buffett British residential property market Economics Pacific, Missouri Ford Motor Company Wal-Mart Commodity Productive and unproductive labour Personal finance Internet fraud Mobile home Marketing Monetary policy Concurrent estate Toyota Camry Newstead Abbey UK Singles Chart Berkshire Hathaway Illegal drug trade Fair market value Mergers and acquisitions Income trust Urban sprawl Insider trading Gold standard Sears Holdings Corporation Mercury Cougar Economy of India Computer and video games Stock market Prediction market Nintendo Economy of Russia Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis __lectricit__ de France Personal property Auction Annuity Investment bank Arbitrage Real estate developer British property bubble Social Security debate (United States) Monopsony Marketing research Inflation Free trade MMORPG The Market for Lemons Conveyancing Closed-end fund Black market Margin (finance) Exchange value
