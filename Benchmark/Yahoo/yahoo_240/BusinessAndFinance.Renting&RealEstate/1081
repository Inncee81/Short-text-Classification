is this a good ad would you buy this house realtors did nothing for me so i am trying to sell comps are selling for k and both smaller houses i am very motivated to sell hr commute to work daily double yuck but i am not desperate i can pay the mortgage and commute if i have to this is the ad i placed in owners com owner financed or buy outright in move in condition recently painted centrally located cape cod with and bathrooms sq feet finished space level fenced x lot vinyl siding laundry room on st floor hardwood berber and vinyl tile floors large walk in closets coats closet attached garage with electricity and water additional off street parking drive shed landscaped patio covered porch ceiling fans window treatments satellite dish stove refrigerator washer dryer and newer furnace vestal hills elementary area financing details in ad are below not enough room here is this a good ad would you buy this house these are the financing details owner will finance purchase if it is easier to borrow a deposit than a full mortgage during credit repairs but owner financing entails risks not taken with an outright sale therefore owner financing will require the following asking price a one or two year lease buyer's choice an option to buy contract a non refundable deposit to be credited towards total at closing mth lease payments with of that held in escrow towards total at closing three references and income verification only leasing to offer buyers a finance option not renting without option to buy contract call or e mail for directions and appointment to see the house house would be a good starter home or a sweet deal for an investor if i had the cash i'd put a pool in the yard or ad a rd room and sell for an extra k so house is in mint condition sarah sorry to dissappoint you but i have hired and fired realtors the first one advised me to replace the furnace and tack that to the price which i did and now i am going to have to eat since the house will not sell for that much more she also brought me zero buyers in months no open houses no anything except a sign in my yard and an mls listing the second brought me buyers that were not pre approved because they were not listed with another realtor and she could be a dual agent to earn the full commission instead of the measly and when that did not work she tried getting me to lower the price to the maximum one of her buyers could qualify for which would have left me a k debt on the mortgage i now owe what a sweet deal don't help me anymore please i didn't see your list price in your ad but asking for rent even if it is a part of a lease option seems excessive for a k house the deposit money is a little high too but i think you could get away with requiring k and still be competitive you might want to compare your rental rate to others in your neighborhood too i think the description in the ad sounds good still you need to remember that an ad is not meant to close the sale but merely to get people in the door to take it in consideration for purchase so to answer your question no i wouldn't buy the house but if it was in my price range and i was pre approved i would come and take a look at it if i wasn't pre approved i wouldn't even bother because the lease option rent is too much Insurance Islamic banking Futures contract Security (finance) Derivative (finance) Bond Microeconomics Kitchen Oakland Athletics Credit card Life insurance Debt McMansion Stock Capitalism Poker jargon Leasing Tax Annuity Monetary policy Option Taxation in the United States Arbitrage Babylonian law Price discrimination Bank Hire purchase Housing cooperative Mutual fund FairTax United Kingdom corporation tax Margin (finance) Economics Los Angeles Clippers Ford Motor Company Rental agreement Economy of Russia Privatization Short selling Mortgage-backed security Mergers and acquisitions Finance Citigroup American Broadcasting Company Capital accumulation Money Government National Mortgage Association Internet fraud Financial markets Hybrid vehicle Contract Hyperinflation Supply and demand Toyota Prius Deflation (economics) U.S. public debt Great Depression Boston and Lowell Railroad PE ratio Interest Property tax Prostitution in Germany Inventory Wal-Mart Investment bank Beverly Hills, California Bretton Woods system UK Singles Chart Corporate finance Gold standard Basement Airline Sento Chatsworth House Monopoly (game) Stairway Inflation Fire fighting De Lorean DMC-12 Intellectual property Wayne Corporation Betting (poker) Warranty Rational pricing Bus models used in New York City Transit Dodge Charger Surplus value Atari 8-bit family Advance fee fraud Surveillance Sport utility vehicle
