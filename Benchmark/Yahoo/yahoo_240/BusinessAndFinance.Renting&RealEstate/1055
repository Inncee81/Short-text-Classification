i have been pre approved for a mortgage now what help hello all my fiance i currently rent in long island ny we plan to buy our first home by thanksgiving ' in queens by home i mean a co op or condo b c we can afford no m ore than k we have been pre approved by eloans i plan to try and get another pre approval from a local broker i hear there are big differences what should i be aware of this point should i be weary of eloans i have been speaking w a re agent that has sent me a few listings she has recommended a mortgage broker should i use that mort broker wouldnt that be a bad move since the mort broker could then tell the re agent what i can afford have been approved for and isnt the re agent working for the buyer in order to sell the property so wouldnt that be a conflict of interest should i stick to a local broker that doesnt personaly know the agent i guess i just hear so many horror stories abt people trying to screw ppl over i just want to be as careful as possible my credit is very good so i dont think that will be an issue also we only plan to be in this house for years so shouldnt we aim to keep closing costs and fees down don't put the cart before the horse and you will be fine i'm glad that you have thought about being pre approved first before going to actually look at homes because that is the smart thing to do what i would do is speak with another lender like you plan and see if you can be pre approved by that lender as well next if you like this agent you are receiving the listings from tell her you would be interested in speaking with the mortgage broker she recommends and try and get a pre approval from that lender as well that way you have the opportunity to sit down with your fiance and take a look at what was offered and decide which one is best for you the mortgage broker can not disclose anything to anybody all they can say is that you didn't qualify its not a conflict of interest either also the buyer has a buyers agent and the seller has a listing agent thats two agents working together on a transaction there can also be just one agent that represents the buyer and the seller which is not a conflict interest either as long as both parties know i hope that helps you understand the process better you can always email me Insurance Short selling Predatory lending Stock Financial markets Mutual fund Title insurance Citigroup Supply and demand Conveyancing Government National Mortgage Association Economics Option Microeconomics Student loan Capitalism Primerica Financial Services Futures contract Real estate bubble Mergers and acquisitions Donald Trump Day trading Internet fraud Agency (law) Bond Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Business-to-consumer electronic commerce Finance Surplus value Derivative (finance) Bank Advertising Commodity Security (finance) Plame affair Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Debt Annual percentage rate Islamic banking Housing cooperative Babylonian law Intellectual property Arbitrage Federal National Mortgage Association Stock broker Surveillance Wal-Mart Temasek Holdings Contract Plame affair timeline Oakland Athletics Credit card Theory of conduct Inventory Home insurance Patent Mail-order bride Privatization Tennessee State Constitution Jennifer Lopez Rational pricing Monopoly (game) Blue Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Money Call option Call centre ETrading Debt consolidation Canadian Senate Warren Buffett Subsidy Leasing Social rule MMORPG Interest Real estate Cable television Habitat for Humanity International Financial services Speaker of the British House of Commons Insider trading Marketing Oil-for-Food Programme Margin (finance) Berkshire Hathaway Octopus card Personal finance Taxation in the United States
