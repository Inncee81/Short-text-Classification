is it okay for a ga landlord to demand month rent and expect us to be out by the th we told our landlady that we'll be moving within the next few weeks before our next rent is due she says since it is a month to month lease that's fine but we have to pay our rent due on the th of the month and be out by the th with the house in presentable conditions by the th so she can start showing it again we signed a years lease in and it ran out so she said we could do a month to month with no problems we've never missed a month of rent all is current except this month she says that if we do not pay our rent by this friday she'll file for eviction but we have weeks till our new house is done and i think it's unfair to pay a full month's rent and be expected out after half the month can she do this legally or does she have to file the day eviction notice we told her that we'd pay for days worth of rent and she said the full amount or we have to leave by friday days we never signed another lease with her she has just been coming to get the money from us and has stated that it is a month to month no she cant do that if you on a month to month lease you have at least days to move out if she does like my landlord and writes out an eviction notice on the comuter and gives it to you then that isn't the eviction notice you have to worry about once you recieve a written one by the landlady if she does that what she will have to do is then go to the courts and says my tenents are months weeks days late if its less then days late they aren't going to do too much so no she cant do that just get out of there what we're going through now good luck Leasehold estate Eviction Estoppel Big Brother (Australian TV series) Rental agreement Rent (musical) Monopoly (game) Leasing Babylonian law ABC No Rio Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849) Big Brother UK series 6 Squatting Mortgage Interplay Entertainment Renting Unemployment $ale of the Century EastEnders Irish Land Act Big Brother UK series 5 CPU cache Anarchism and capitalism Scottish clan Oakland Athletics National Football League Enron Corporation Public housing Social rule Therion (band) Harlem Wheel of Fortune Taxation in the United States Moe Berg Rovers Return United Kingdom corporation tax Housing cooperative George W.
