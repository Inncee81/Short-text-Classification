can anyone share information on reverse mortgages my in laws have one i think it varies by state but the basic concept is pretty simple a lender is lending them a little bit more each month direct deposited to their account so as time goes by they owe more and more money on their house it's reverse because a regular mortgage gets paid off month by month and eventually you have it all paid for the amount of money they can receive each month is determined by law using an actuarial calculation so it is the same for any person of same age gender etc you do not ever have to pay the money back until either the property is sold or they die so if they live a long time they can receive quite a bit of money month after month in general these can be a good solution for the elderly person who wants to stay in their house but cannot afford it on a fixed income especially if the area where they live has increasing property values so they still have equity in the house even though they owe on the mortgage any lender can provide info i think they all offer the same monthly amount though interest rates can vary as usual lower is better the older the person is the more money they receive per month becauase their life expectancy is less Mortgage Bond Life insurance Insurance Annuity Tax Finance Personal finance Taxation in the United States Annual percentage rate Predatory lending Student loan Debt Bank Government National Mortgage Association FairTax Credit card Microeconomics Federal National Mortgage Association Money Property tax Deflation (economics) Derivative (finance) Financial markets Inflation Monetary policy Concurrent estate Short selling Allodial title Economy of Russia PE ratio Actuarial notation Labor theory of value Yield curve Pension Interest rate Capitalism Title insurance Social Security (United States) Government debt Supply and demand Temasek Holdings Mutual fund Capital accumulation Central bank Leasing United Kingdom corporation tax Housing cooperative Corporation Primerica Financial Services Trust (Law) USA Gross domestic product Intellectual property Law of value Savings and loan association Estoppel Progressive tax Flat tax Money supply Surplus value Fixed income MMORPG Real estate broker Foreclosure Islamic economics Public policy Construction 401(k) Price discrimination Unemployment benefit Bankruptcy in the United States Supply-side economics Debt levels and flows Unconscionability Usury Rational pricing U.S. public debt Economic inequality Contract Central processing unit Monopoly (game) Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Keynesian economics Economics Investment bank Corporate finance
