poll should we move we are military we just moved on the military base in april and are settled in but realized that the military base housing is higher than if we rented an apartment townhouse off post we could save between per month my husband also got news that he is being deployed to iraq in late november or early december he is saying that now is a perfect time for me to decide if i want to stay on base we have two babies a month old toddler girl and a month old son they are still young to play in the back yard by themselves not to mention i don't want to maintain a yard alone and i usually just take them to the park anyhow so i was thinking that maybe renting a smaller apartment would be just as well the townhouse we currently have on base is three bedroom but the square footage is wasted on the basement we never use also we have split levels and the stairs are not very safe for toddlers i am just so unsure of what to do it would be easy to stay but we could save more hey i live on base too my husband and i could be saving around the same amount if we moved out in town unfortunately we don't have enough time to move before he deploys for me personally i suck at turning off lights and using little water so we would be saving money by staying on base plus we don't have to pay garbage just our phone bill which isn't that bad i'm pregnant and our housing is close to the hospital on base so i've opted to stay on base when he deploys plus we just moved here and i don't really know anybody yet and i feel safer on base what can i say i'm a sissy have you looked at any apartments yet go to apartments com or rent com if you find one you really like i say do it but if not stay on base best of luck Friends Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Days of our Lives Monopoly (game) EastEnders Avenue Q Poker jargon Rosa Parks Sin City Rent (musical) Paragliding Pitaten Abigail Folger Knots Landing Chatsworth House Humphrey Bogart Phoebe Halliwell Plame affair Harlem Futurama (TV series - season 5) Collyer brothers The Shining (film) Post-invasion Iraq, 2003___2005 The Inside Mohamed Atta al-Sayed Breastfeeding Milwaukee, Wisconsin Boston Public Phoebe Buffay's songs Daylight saving time Mary Astor Cliff Richard Apartment The O.C.
