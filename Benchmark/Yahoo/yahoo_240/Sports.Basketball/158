would someone with espn insider send me the article the c's should win the east if someone could do that and email it to me i'd greatly appreciate it i was in hilton head s c at a family reunion last week when the kg trade went down so pardon me for being late to weigh in on this on a separate note two of my first cousins who were at the reunion work on tyler perry's house of payne '' and they promise me it's going to get better all i can say is they better be right anyway here goes my rant on the c's i don't care that puny inexperienced rajon rondo may be their starting point guard i don't care that kendrick perkins whose career scoring average is points may be their starting center i don't care that the celtics' bench is currently as deep as a baby pool the boston celtics of kevin garnett paul pierce and ray allen should reach the nba finals period no excuses if garnett's truly the player we think he is the player talent evaluators around the league rave about the player who should one day enter the hall of fame shouldn't pierce and allen be enough help to win the east i mean lebron james took cleveland to the finals without anything close to a second star allen iverson won the east back in with dikembe mutombo and aaron mckie as his second and third scoring options jason kidd kenyon martin and richard jefferson won the east with jason collins playing center i like garnett love the way he competes and carries himself but i'm sorry there's no reason he should not finally get to the finals okay if shaq turns back the clock and becomes something close to a dominant and force again and d wade is healthy i'll perhaps cut him some slack but how likely is that being a clevelander in my heart of hearts i hope the cavaliers get back to the finals but on paper boston's head and shoulders ahead of them and don't tell me about chemistry i understand how important chemistry is i've watched our star studded team usa crew get ripped internationally the past several years just like you have but there are several reasons why chemistry shouldn't be a problem in boston for one the celtics' new big three'' all play different positions this is not vince carter and richard jefferson or latrell sprewell and allan houston garnett's the best big man in the east dwight howard and chris bosh are still chasing pierce is a terrific scorer slasher and allen is arguably the best outside shooter in the league garnett clearly is not a ball hog and will have no problem sharing the rock pierce enjoyed playing next to chucker supreme antoine walker and allen excelled alongside glenn big dog'' robinson and sam cassell so squabbles over shots should be nonexistent in the fourth quarter there'll be no dispute about who to go to pierce and allen are the first two scoring options and kg's the third kg who's never felt like he had to take the last shot won't have a problem with that furthermore all three players are still in their prime this is not hakeem olajuwon charles barkley and scottie pippen uniting in old age or over the hill karl malone and gary payton joining shaq and kobe am i guaranteeing the celtics will win the east no i'm just saying they should and i'm saying that if they don't for any reason other than injury of course it will tell us a lot about boston's three stars particularly kg to me this will be the defining season of garnett's career this will tell us if he was really a superstar with no help in minnesota or merely an overrated stat filler who lacks that winning'' intangible pierce and allen are destined to be remembered simply as great players garnett has a chance to go higher to be remembered as more than merely great but to seal that kind of legacy he's got to get out of the east Los Angeles Lakers Hakeem Olajuwon Los Angeles Clippers December 2004 in sports Phoenix Suns Minnesota Timberwolves Kobe Bryant Cleveland Browns New York Giants January 2005 in sports LeBron James Pittsburgh Steelers Utah Jazz Los Angeles Kings Charles Barkley New England Patriots United States at the 2004 Summer Olympics Gary Payton (basketball) Shaquille O'Neal Indiana Pacers Orlando Magic Boston Red Sox Larry Bird Boston Bruins Allen Iverson San Francisco 49ers 1986 NBA Draft 2004 NBA Finals Scottie Pippen Basketball Major League Baseball television contracts Newcastle United F.C.
