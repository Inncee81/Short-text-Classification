who wants to criticise my trade lol http games espn go com nba features traderesult players teams te cash i am just doing this for fun really its no big deal when i first saw it i thought it was the most random trade ive ever saw but then i thought about these teams and it is actually almost perfect you have to be an a i fan because you linked these two teams i am a huge allen iverson fan and a er fan so i love both these teams okay the ers hugest problem is that their rebounding is terrible and k mart is an amazing rebounder and nene proved to be a really good player from the last games of season till end of the spurs series and that dalembert has never played the way they wanted him to play denver needs a true point guard steve blake left and iverson fits better at the guard use the sixers for example when ai was guard they did terrible in his last season worst team in the nba but when andre miller came in they went on a huge run and were not too far from making the playoffs denver would take a hit for losing nene because of how he shocked the world in actually losing weight and playing like people thought he would when he was first drafted but if dalembert can play like he is supposed to it will be a far better substitute the con's of this trade are ers also dont have a point guard so louis williams or willie green would have to play times as good as previous seasons to actually be good this season for the sixers to give up almost two footers in hunter who might be ' and sammy dalembert should be hard for a kenyon martin who hasnt played in two seasons and has a monster contract and a really bad knee sixers need to plan for the future and taking nene's year million contract and kenyons year million a year contract is not going to help that goal i actually love the trade more for the nuggets than the ers but i still think it is a great trade i dont think it would work because of business issues though New York Knicks Shaquille O'Neal Los Angeles Lakers Kobe Bryant NBA Finals National Basketball Association Steve Nash Indiana Pacers Los Angeles Clippers New York Giants Michael Jordan Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Toronto Raptors Larry Bird Continental Basketball Association 1986 NBA Draft Chicago Bulls Phil Jackson Pittsburgh Steelers Minor league baseball National Football League New Jersey Nets Houston Rockets Basketball Los Angeles Kings Boston Red Sox Utah Jazz San Antonio Spurs St. Louis Rams New England Patriots Baseball Orlando Magic Julius Erving Emanuel Gin__bili Philadelphia 76ers Microeconomics Dream Team Golden State Warriors 2005 World Series Volleyball 2004 NBA Finals Theory of conduct Poker jargon 2005 NBA Finals New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Detroit Pistons Amare Stoudemire Cincinnati Bengals Baltimore Ravens Rasheed Wallace Glossary of American football Mario Lemieux Toronto Blue Jays Katelyn Faber Major League Baseball television contracts Pat Riley Minnesota Timberwolves Boston Bruins Super Bowl XXI Moses Malone Carolina Panthers San Francisco 49ers January 2005 in sports American football Atlanta Flames Ra (board game) Kansas City Chiefs Buffalo Bills Boston Celtics Rugby union Equine conformation Arizona State University Wrigley Field Dikembe Mutombo World Series Wayne Gretzky Rugby union positions Philadelphia Phillies Miami Dolphins Three-point field goal Chicago White Sox The NBA on ABC Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Chicago Blackhawks Super Bowl XXV The Jackson 5 New York Jets Playoff The Malice at The Palace Jerry Krause English cricket team Slam Dunk Contest
