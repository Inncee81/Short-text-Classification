if you were the celtics would you trade ray allen and paul pierce to la for kobe would you if you were the lakers what would you say to this offer if i were the celtics i would definitely go for this trade straight up i'm not a big kobe fan i don't like him but i respect his game there is no one better in clutch situations and no one can carry a team by himself like kobe can yes he is a crybaby and a ball hog but he is also a winner a great defender an unstoppable scorer and has many more years ahead of him pierce is past his prime and allen is coming off surgery making them question marks i would go for the sure thing if i were the lakers the only reason i would take this trade is if kobe demands it and is unhappy in la i wouldn't want my top gun grumbling all season long Free throw Baseball Basketball Tim Duncan Toronto Raptors Sandy Koufax Technical foul Continental Basketball Association 1957 World Series Football (soccer) Pittsburgh Steelers Florida Marlins New England Patriots Diego Maradona Indianapolis Colts Softball Breath of Fire III Michael Jordan Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1946 2004 World Series Yao Ming Cincinnati Bengals American football Steve Nash Oscar Gutierrez Alan Shearer Chicago Bulls Personal foul Miami Dolphins New York Jets Rasheed Wallace Atlanta Flames Characters in Neon Genesis Evangelion John Calipari Boston Red Sox St. Louis Rams Iraq War Terrell Owens Dean Smith Bowl Championship Series Paul Ince Detroit Pistons Cleveland Browns Vin Scully Norway national football team Ultimate (sport) Babe Ruth Indiana Pacers Water polo Shichinintai Chris Jericho Beyblade Emmy Award New York Giants RuneScape Mini-Games Relative clause 2005 NFL season Kevin Keegan Menachem Begin 2005 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand Paul Westphal Bobby Knight Chris Webber Baseball statistics Snooker Rugby union No-hitter Bill Laimbeer Three-point field goal Joe Paterno History of Test cricket (to 1883) Gothic metal New York Knicks Alexander Cartwright Crystal Palace F.C.
