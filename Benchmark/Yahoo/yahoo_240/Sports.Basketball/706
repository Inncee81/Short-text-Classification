nba rulings please help me i have a few nba ruling questions please answer thats all i want and only nba and don't ask why not streetball explain a turnover if you put the ball between your legs and mess up and run to go get the ball and pick it up before anyone is that a turnover if you are done your dribble and through the ball straight ahead of you and run to get it and get it before anyone else is that a turnover player a catches the ball with player b behind him player a spins around him than dribbles and goes for a lay up can you do this in the theme song of the fresh prince of bel air when will is talking about shooting hoops in his home town and he starts doing all his fancing moves just standing there can you do that after you are done your dribble can you spin the ball on your finger throw the ball up and down without letting it land on the floor and all that stuff is that legal look again at this topic for more questions please go for best answer ok well you seem pretty unsure of nba rulings in general so ill try my best to explain them all a turnover is when you commit a violation or an error and it results in the other team getting the ball for example you throw a pass and the other team catches it thats a turnover another example would be if you dribbling and then stopped and then started dribbling again the ref blows the whistle and gives the ball to the other team turnover if you are dribbling and you lose control it's ruled as a loose ball so its up for grabs if the other team picks it up its a turnover but you you pick it up it is not if you pick it up you play it from there as if you just caught a pass yes that is considered a pass to yourself and you cannot do that the other team would recieve possesion you cannot throw a pass to yourself also if you shoot a shot and it doesnt hit the rim or backboard you cannot get that either but if any other player on the court touches it then it is a live ball and you can grab it yes if you are dribbling while you spin you can only take steps without dribbling or else it is a travel which is a turnover if you keep foot planted and step in a spinnig motion turn your body like around then dribble to your side and finish the spin by continuing the rotation and stepping with the previously planted foot that is a generic spin move and that is legal you cannot move your feet unless you're dribbling and once you start dribbling and you pick it up you cannot start dribbling again so as long as you do neither of the above you are aloud to play around with the ball all you want same as as long as you dont take steps or dribble again you can do whatever your heart desires with the ball i mean that is unless the defender steals it hope i answered these fairly well Chicago Bulls New York Knicks Indiana Pacers Houston Rockets NBA Finals Scottie Pippen Dream Team Orlando Magic Los Angeles Clippers New Jersey Nets Phoenix Suns Pittsburgh Steelers Boston Celtics Boston Bruins Reggie Jackson Dennis Rodman Michael Jordan Robert Horry World Series Cleveland Browns Los Angeles Kings Bulls-Knicks Rivalry New England Patriots Reggie Miller Portland Trail Blazers Major League Baseball television contracts Detroit Red Wings 2005 NBA Finals Pittsburgh Penguins Carolina Panthers New York Rangers Super Bowl XXVII Philadelphia Flyers Penny Hardaway October 16 in baseball 2004-05 NHL lockout Golden State Warriors 2004 World Series New York Yankees Steve Nash Chuck Cooper Miami Dolphins Montreal Canadiens Minnesota Vikings Minnesota Timberwolves Point forward Boston Red Sox Reggie White Buffalo Bills Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.
