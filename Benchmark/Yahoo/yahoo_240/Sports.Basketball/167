what would you have offered t wolves for kg if you were phoenix i'm sure they could have made a better offer than celtics and this would be the final piece of the jigsaw i made this a poss trade marion diaw way overpaid and two first rounders for kg no way would i take banks contract not even for kg marion for kg is not enough maybe marion and atl's lotto pick i don't think it has anything to do with how much other teams could have offered for kg when the gm kevin mchale has already made up his mind that if he was going to send his best player anywhere it would be his former team he played for think about it how else would boston be able to not include the pick in the draft before they traded it for ray allen and still be able to put together a collection of unproven players to obtain the big ticket's service the warriors have offered monte ellis jason richardson and al harrington for kg which imo is a far more proven deal than the one minnesota got i'm pretty sure if minney was persistent with it they could have squeezed or maybe more first round draft choices out of golden state they've done it before when they traded the pick and first rounders for a rookie in chris webber so i don't see why they won't do it again for an established star in kg the truth of the matter is mchale played a vital role in convincing the owner that boston offered the best value for kg mchale also probably convinced kg that boston was his only ticket out of a few more losing seasons to end his career i truly hope that boston's conspiracy ways will eventually come back to bite them in the rear end some day Minnesota Timberwolves Steve Nash Indiana Pacers Houston Rockets New York Knicks Boston Celtics Los Angeles Clippers Golden State Warriors Phoenix Suns New England Patriots New York Giants Orlando Magic 1986 NBA Draft NBA Finals Larry Bird Los Angeles Kings Pittsburgh Steelers Chicago Bulls Boston Red Sox Toronto Raptors Dream Team Philadelphia 76ers Detroit Red Wings Carolina Panthers Mario Lemieux Philadelphia Flyers San Francisco Giants Utah Jazz Portland Trail Blazers Atlanta Hawks Pittsburgh Pirates Toronto Blue Jays Wilt Chamberlain National Football League 2004-05 NHL lockout Chicago Blackhawks Minor league baseball Minnesota Vikings Kevin McHale Chris Webber World Series Cork City F.C.
