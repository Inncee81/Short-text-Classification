have you heard the mexico vs usa game has been canceled i read in the newspaper today that the game for sept was cancelled because there was conflict between univision and telemundo both wanting to air the game is this true i think that you will always have dissent when it comes on to television rights for games of this magnitude there is always a lot of stake holders with a huge chunk of cash involved and at stake but in the end i think that good business sense will prevail and the match will go on and mexico will win so i say to you fear not mi amigo go mexico Univision Press Your Luck Tic-Tac-Dough 2005 CONCACAF Gold Cup Summer Olympic Games Betting (poker) Wheel of Fortune Hollywood Squares Wal-Mart Rupert Murdoch Battle City (Yu-Gi-Oh!) 1731 English cricket season Norway national football team Telenovela $ale of the Century Gambling August 2005 in sports Game show WCIU-TV Family Feud Computer and video games Poker jargon Stanley Cup Big Brother (TV series) Legacy of Kain Super League (Australia) Double Dare NFL on television Big Brother (USA TV series) Television syndication Sports timeline Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Concentration (game show) Consensus decision-making Corporate governance Twenty One (game show) Monopoly (game) Jim Thorpe McAllen, Texas Louisiana Purchase Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.
