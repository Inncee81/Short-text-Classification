this question is for people who have had braided in hair extentions i'm thinking about getting hair extentions but i want them braided in so that they last longer and i dont have to deal with them falling out or anything but i dont know anyone who's had them before what do you think about them do you like having them in was it painful and how much did it cost i live in oregon and i have no idea where a good place is to get them done at if you could give me any other information about it for me that would be amazing once again this question is for people who have had them before thank you i love them because i don't have to do my hair with them in they are not suppose to be painful if they are you should tell your stylist that they are too tight too much tension could cause breakage which is the main reason people say braided extensions are bad it did not cost me anything except for the cost of the hair which was only a pack because i braid my own hair but it ranges between and up depending on the type of braid you want and lenght of your hair and the extensions Violin Economics Haircut Dreadlocks Theory of conduct Scientology beliefs and practices Hypnosis Shampoo Jennifer Lopez Baldness Goodness and value theory Milton H.
