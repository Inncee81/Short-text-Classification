how much do i tip a hairdresser for a weave i have chin length hair if that is relevant yikes so was over tipping lol thanks starstreaked i dont regret the tip she did an awesome job i just wanted to make sure that was enough for such a big job it took about hours isn't over tipping if you beleive in paying for a job well done i got a blowdry and style for dollars and gave her a fifty she asked if i wanted change of course but i knew that i'd be back to see her for my highlights and i wanted to ensure she'd be glad to see me and do a good job even if i don't tip as much next time it felt good to do you know same thing with this restaurant by my house i eat their sushi so much i tip rediculously so they don't mind seeing me so much the only downfall to overtipping is that some people in service positions think you are doing to so that you have a free pass to be high maintenace or that you expect top of the line service from herafter anyway though the dollar tip was good because it made it an even amount a girl i work with gets the platinum blond look for dollars and gives him so go figure you can't get it back now anyway so you might as well feel good about it right Tip Jennifer Lopez Pitaten Haircut The Emancipation of Mimi Social rule Poker jargon Shaggy dog story Marilyn Monroe RuneScape quests Humphrey Bogart Sushi Theory of conduct Knots Landing National Kidney Foundation Singapore Craps Jon Secada Wheel of Fortune Minimum wage Milton H.
