self conscious i am cutting ma hair for school this year i am cutting it kinda short like halley berry used to have her hair at first the idea of cutting ma hair that short was nerve recking i didn't want to do it but after seeing a couple of people on america's next top model with that hair style i figured it would look cute but as school time reaches near i am not sure i want to cut it anymore i feel i will be made fun of or people won't like it or i will look funny how can i get over being self conscious by the way i have no choice but to cut my hair my perm is taking it out i totally sympathise with you about months again i had really long hair like down to the middle of my back id been growing it really long especially for my prom however my hair wasnt in that great condition and was kinda frizzy also as i realise now it made me look about what with being thats not so great i went to the hairdressers and on a whim asked hr to cut it really short in the 'pob' style as she wa doing it i suddenyl realised what id asked her to do and really started dreading it would i look like an idiot what would people at college say but after it was done i absolutly loved it t makes me look older and people come up and ask me where i got my hair done i would totally go for it im sure it would look great and if it doesnt then it will grow back quickly because when you cut your hair really short it grows back quicker good luck Haircut Kodocha Pitaten Hair The Amber Spyglass Shaggy dog story Rastafari movement Blood on the Tracks Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The Contender (television series) Dreadlocks Johnny 5 The Emancipation of Mimi Green Day Ranma __ characters W.I.T.C.H.
