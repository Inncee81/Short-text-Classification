i just highlighted my hair and i pulled way to much through the cap and now my whole head looks like i just bleached it on purpose in stead o highlights i think it will calm down a little when i wash it again and again if it doesn't what can i do it is bleached after all i may end up dying it to a similar color of my own and re hightlighting it anyone have any homemade remedies thanks i've done that my advice is if you can find an exact match to your natural color die your hair and leave it alone you can highlight it later when your hair grows back don't highlight it right after you die it also have a professional do it or at least a friend who knows what he she is doing because obviously you don't have much experience with it trust someone who does do it for you Baldness Hair coloring Skinhead Sub-Zero Textile manufacturing Characters in Neon Genesis Evangelion Menstrual cup Hair color Brush Haircut Blond Pubic hair The Amber Spyglass Link (Legend of Zelda) Autopsy Depilation Hair (musical) Horse The Red Green Show Pitaten Condom Rei Ayanami Badminton at the 1996 Summer Olympics History of Test cricket (to 1883) Hair Baseball cap Drawing Characters in Bleach series Electrophysiology Laundry detergent Kender Digital photography Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Leather Dreadlocks Puberty Headgear Kodocha Professional wrestling holds Diamond simulant Fruits Basket Trish Stratus Dandruff W.I.T.C.H.
