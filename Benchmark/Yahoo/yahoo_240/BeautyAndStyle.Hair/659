what damage would a blow dryer do to my hair if i use it to often when i go to school i only have an hr to get ready in the morning so when i leave my home i want to have my hair dry but if i use the blow dryer everyday will it really leave my hair all brittle bc its so dried out and if that's the case would using the cold air from the hair drier be better to use or does it not matter and another thing what shampoo and conditioner could i use to make my hair have volume and be bouncy thanks alot i really appreciate it in my opinion nexus is the best shampoo and conditioner line made today they are found at salons blow drying your hair on a daily basis would damage it but daily shampooing is not necessary unless you are working in a very dirty industry say construction once or twice a week is all that is necessary especially while you are still in school to lessen the damage the blower does to your hair use it on the hottest setting for no more than minutes next begin cooling down the dryer a step at a time about minutes is all you need on each setting this may vary a bit but just estimate the time when your style is mostly done and you only have just a little moisture left in your hair switch to the coolest setting for finishing your style the coolest setting on the blower seals the cuticle layer of your hair which is similar to the shingle on a roof shut so if you use it to begin with it will lock in too much moisture and make styling difficult and damaging you may email me with questions if you have any others Shampoo Drill bit Fan (implement) Air conditioning Tofu Leaf Psoriasis Dandruff Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Electrical wiring Radiation therapy Casting Dry cleaning Thermoregulation Novelty (locomotive) Explosive material Sento Severe weather terminology (United States) Diving suit Hair Weather lore Polyethylene terephthalate Roof Hair conditioner Ranma __ characters Shaving Thermostat Instant coffee Thermal power station Leather Acne Wood Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Carnivorous plant Fog Straw-bale construction Hair color Moisturizer Textile manufacturing Plastic Steel Bouncy techno Brewery Coffee Wildfire Internal ballistics Dreadlocks Fire fighting Drowning Massage Bonsai Lumber Haloalkane Thunderstorm Overclocking Climate of the United Kingdom Solar power Seismic retrofit Handloading Upholstery USS Tunny (SS-282) Wind Urticaria Campfire Vacuum Baldness Giant Sequoia Mummy Trichome Carbon dioxide Armored Core Professional wrestling match types Humidity Skin Woodworking Bong Ice core Welding SpongeBob SquarePants Manicure Pottery Haircut Hot air balloon Ozone depletion Chernobyl accident Knife Cereal Breathing gas Vacuum tube Ice Galveston Hurricane of 1900 Fossil fuel power plant Drag racing Comet Paleoclimatology Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March
