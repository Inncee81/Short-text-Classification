shampoos that make a difference do any shampoos actually work better than others or is this just an advertising trick if so i've been looking for a shampoo that would make my hair silky and shiny my hair is extremely thick slightly wavy not to frizzy though light brown w natural blonde streaks also i wash my hair at night so a shampoo that has a lasting scent would be excellent thanks omg hun i am so glad that you asked this question aveda smooth infusion shampoo now i know that everyone is going to respond to your question and probably suggest things like pantene sunsilk tresemme aussie herbal essences even maybe tigi products like bedhead or sebastian products but let me just ask you one thing out of all the shampoo bottles you have already and of all the shampoos that others are going to recommend do any of them list sodium in their ingredients on the back label if so this is why you are experiencing the dryness shampoos generally contain sodium because it is a good cleansing agent however while salt strips the hair from oils build up etc it is also stripping your hair from proteins and moisture therefore requiring you to use the conditioner for best results it basically is undoing what their shampoo does with dryness my hair naturally is very thick curly frizzy poofy all of the above i call it the wildebeast mane attached to my head anything familiar probably worse than what most people have in addition to that i get my hair colored so it's extra dry this aveda shampoo is completely plant based meaning no sodium and is unlike any shampoo i have ever tried seriously i have tried everything i am like a hair product junkie i have spent tons of money on all kinds of random products this shampoo is the best you don't even need a conditioner with it it makes your hair feel like silk and it smells amazing you can also choose which scents you want too for them to mix into your shampoo they make all kinds of beautiful fragrances that last all day you don't even need to wear a perfume seriously if you really want something that works try aveda it's a little bit more pricey but definitely worth it i highly recommend it Soap Perfume Leaf Dandruff Psoriasis Tofu Leather Dog Hair conditioner Hydrochloric acid Fire extinguisher Hair coloring Pottery Hair Urinary incontinence Patent medicine Baldness treatments Fancy rat Upholstery Textile manufacturing Guinea pig Rose Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Afro textured hair Theory of conduct Dragon Booster Brewery Cannabis cultivation Polyethylene terephthalate Clothing Mattress Sulfur Social rule Physical attractiveness Japanese tea ceremony Wood Sushi Coffee Textile manufacturing terminology Menstrual cup Horse Microeconomics Orchidaceae Cosmetics Massage Laundry detergent Moisturizer Milton H.
