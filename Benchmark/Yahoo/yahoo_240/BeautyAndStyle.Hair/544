has anyone ever purchased a lace wig from exceptionalhair com i really want a lace wig but of course they are kinda expensive so i was thinking of going the cheaper synthetic yaki route the prices on this web site are super low so of course there's a question of the quality has anyone had any experiance with this website or know of a site with cheap but decent quality lace wigs i've never purchased a lace wig from them but did get a few of the drawstring pieces that you put your hair in a bun then attach it to it i was going to a formal occasion wanted my hair to be curly even though it doesn't curl well my gripe with this company is the following because i wasn't sure which shade i should get i first purchased the color swatches once i figuered out which color matched my hair the best i went ahead ordered the one's i wanted well when i recieved them even though the color said it was the same the shade wasn't the same as the swatch it was about shades different than what it was supposed to be like my hair was a strawberry blond at the time i ordered the swatch that matched it but the items that i recieved were told were the strawberry blond like the swatch were way too red now i guess that since the swatches don't come from the same dye lot as every piece they make that there's bound to be a difference but had i worn them it would have been way to obvious that i was sporting fake hair i guess if you are getting a wig that you won't see your real hair at all with then i'd say go for it but if you are going to see any bit of your hair be careful for the quality they seem nice but i never got a chance to wear mine to see how they hold up after repeated wear due to the color discrepancy i was actually thinking about attampting to order some again now that i have returned my hair to it's natural med dark brown color but am just a bit hesitant still due to worrying about the color Wig (hair) Hair color The Ashlee Simpson Show Theory of conduct Hair Plastic Leather Irish dance Textile manufacturing terminology Humphrey Bogart Diamond The Inside Baldness Haircut Little Britain Link (Legend of Zelda) Dreadlocks Blood on the Tracks Headgear Professional wrestling match types Strap-on dildo Guinea pig The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Cuisine of Denmark Swatch Springfield Elementary School Highway 61 Revisited Skinhead Human skin color Hair coloring Orders of magnitude (numbers) Dog Dilbert Textile manufacturing Turquoise The Rasmus Totally Spies!
