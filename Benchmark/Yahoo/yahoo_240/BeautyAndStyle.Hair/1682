would brown hair work i have a round or square face i can't really tell pretty fair skinned but not too fair skinned and currently a blonde with blue eyes i am thinking about dying my hair brown but i don't know if it would look fine it all depends on the type of brown you choose there are warm browns or cool brows and depending on your skin tone one will look better then the other i have similar features to you and i find a nice rich brown makes my blue eyes pop i suggest you have this done at a professional salon they should first fill your hair with a reddish color because if youve been dying it blonde its sure to be porous after they fill the hair the brown will go on and it should turn out nice and even good luck Hair color Blond Melanin Race of Jesus Dragon Booster Physical attractiveness Hair The Ashlee Simpson Show Gwen Stefani Paul Is Dead Skin Red hair Human skin color Material properties of diamond Double Dragon Dog Wood carving The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Reservoir Dogs Totally Spies!
