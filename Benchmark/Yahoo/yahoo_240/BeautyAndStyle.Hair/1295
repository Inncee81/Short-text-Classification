has anyone tried propecia i ve done my research on the internet so you don t need to do that for me i just wanted to know if anyone here has tried propecia or knows about it beyond internet research to tell the truth i am concerned about the of men who experience sexual side effects i have heard even scarier things from sources that say the side effects can be permanent or come on gradually so you won t notice over time then again i ve heard some good news that the side effects can wear off over time i ve also heard one source say that you can get tolerant to the drug which is a bad thing then i think again to be part of that is pretty unlucky i ve heard from a source that about of a doctors patients experience an increased sex drive which makes more sense to me seeing it inhibits testosterone itself from being converted into another hormone which has only negative purposes rogaine is just as expensive in australia and much more of a hassle to apply thoughts i have been taking a generic propecia for over years now and have not experienced any side effects i still have all my hair and i would recommend the drug to anyone Baldness treatments Prostate cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Baldness Puberty Androgen insensitivity syndrome Testosterone Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Acne Prolactinoma Orgasm Drug addiction Antidepressant Dihydrotestosterone Paroxetine Cancer Infantilism Bipolar disorder Diazepam Antiandrogen Insulin Transsexuality Anabolic steroid Antiretroviral drug Anorexia nervosa Child sexuality Oral contraceptive Cannabis (drug) Inhibited sexual desire Chlorpromazine Sigmund Freud Hypoglycemia Sexual differentiation Psychosis Folic acid Urinary incontinence History of intersex surgery Autism Sexual dysfunction Psoriasis Biology and sexual orientation Schizophrenia Intersexuality Growth hormone treatment Motivation Hormone replacement therapy Fertility awareness Epilepsy Chemotherapy Breast cancer Lamotrigine Stomach cancer LSD Condom Crystal methamphetamine and sex Summa Theologiae Estradiol Glucocorticoid Polycystic ovary syndrome Menstrual cycle Bupropion Ethics Emergency contraception Meme Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Bicycle lighting Drug abuse Diabetes mellitus Radiation therapy Progesterone Medicine Psychopharmacology Tobacco smoking COX-2 inhibitor Psychoanalysis Narcissism Gender role Dopamine Clinical depression Hypnosis Maprotiline Logic Asexuality Paracetamol Human sexual behavior Scientology beliefs and practices Left-handed Migraine AIDS Evil Methamphetamine Theory of conduct Haloperidol Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Adverse effect (medicine) Social rule Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Sex Ex-gay
