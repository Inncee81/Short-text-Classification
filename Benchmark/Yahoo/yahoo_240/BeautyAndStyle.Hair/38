red hair fading can i stop it i've heard that to preserve the natural colour you should wash your hair in cold water is that true what are the best shampoos for redheads that like to stay as red as possible without a dye are there any herbs or maybe some diet could help maybe a good uv shampoo to stop the sun affecting it thank you the molecular structure of red dye is not as strong as other colours and fades quicker as a result this seems to be true of reds in other forms have you ever seen an older car that is red and the colour seems to be faded and slightly pinkish there's not much you can do to preserve red hair colours other than to use a less stringent shampoo try a shampoo that is designed specifically for colour treated hair i gave up on my red hair after so much disappointment and expense of maintaining it if you are a natural redhead rather than a dyed redhead and want to maintain your colour it's a good idea to tie your hair back and cover your head if spending time in the sun same in winter with cold winds Dandruff Shampoo Kimono Leather Hair color Melanin Upholstery Ranma __ characters Horse Textile manufacturing terminology Food coloring Human skin color Flag of India Staining (biology) Ketoconazole Camouflage Dye Sento Leaf Redhead (duck) Psoriasis Color Textile manufacturing Blond Mummy Hair conditioner Water (molecule) Explosive material Rail terminology Christina Aguilera Guinea pig Clothing Turquoise Capercaillie The Ashlee Simpson Show Hydrogen Pigment Time Out of Mind Carnivorous plant Aurora (astronomy) Hair Hair coloring E85 Iris (anatomy) Western blot Tattoo Pysanka Technicolor Soap bubble Mammal Baldness treatments Cosmetics My Little Pony Alizarin Headgear Palmdale, California Las Vegas metropolitan area Honey Tofu Aloe Cochineal Dragon Booster Paul Is Dead Benzene Griffon Bruxellois Flag of Hong Kong Red Arrows Kryptonite 2004 Atlantic hurricane season Madder The Amber Spyglass Sesshomaru Color temperature Physical attractiveness Indigo dye Acne Light-emitting diode Color blindness Molecular biology Lighting Flag Energy development Compact disc Traffic light Experiment Egyptian pyramids 2005 Belgian Grand Prix Super Saiyan Laserdisc Pottery Chinese White Dolphin Sage Rainbow Customs and etiquette of Japan Wine Inflation Gramophone record Weather lore
