everyone says trim your hair often or it wont grow but doesnt hair grow from the scalp hmm confused i know it gets rid of split ends but how does trimming the bottom make it grow faster if it grows out from the scalp ah i see cuz everyone says trimming it will make it grow faster i was told by my beautician that the sole reason for cutting the ends is that if you have dead ends they continually break off making the hair appear shorter therefore all that has grown from the scalp will not be noticed because it is constantly breaking from the ends as long as it is clipped or trimmed occasionally the growth will be healthy and noticeable Pubic hair Haircut Beard Dandruff Baldness Depilation Hair Burdock Equine conformation Baldness treatments Comanche Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Puberty Atomic Kitten Super Saiyan Poker jargon Lawn mower Battles of Lexington and Concord The Ashlee Simpson Show Deflation (economics) Hypertrichosis Androgen insensitivity syndrome Havanese Link (Legend of Zelda) Glossary of American football Heinkel He 100 Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Phaedo Portuguese Water Dog Rosemary Drill bit Fur Head louse Springfield 1903 rifle Alopecia areata Autopsy Horseshoe Tonsure Show hunter March (music) Human height Jon Secada Imperial (automobile) Minoxidil Guns N' Roses Stairway The Prisoner Mohawk hairstyle Kryptonite Sea-Monkey Piccolo Junior Saga And Maggie Makes Three Global Gillette Five Ks Hair (musical) Wildcat cartridge Rail tracks Biotin Motorcycle helmet RuneScape economy String trimmer Late Night with Conan O'Brien Cello Vlad III Dracula Wood Electroconvulsive therapy Nail (anatomy) Windsurfing Toyota Camry Colours, standards and guidons Soil life Urban sprawl Head Pavement (band) Comfrey Sideburns Kodocha Dreadlocks Code: Lyoko Chlorophyta Day trading Claw BMW M5 Cobra Commander Olive RuneScape cheats Maltese (dog) Knife The Dalek Invasion of Earth Plane (tool) Social role of hair Certified Nursing Assistant Stem cell Erogenous zone Akuma (Street Fighter) Logging The Amber Spyglass Radiation therapy
