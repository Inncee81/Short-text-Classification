i have really short hair and i want to get it layered or something but im not sure wat should i do its kinda poofy around the sides and bottom but im not sure it would look good layered plus my hair is short enough already its not poofy poofy it just bobs at the bottom and i dont like it ask your mom to go to the hair salon and get hair extencions or just wait for your hair to grow out to get them if you want layers i'd get layers if i were you because it seem that your hair is very dull and you need some layers and volume Hair Haircut Leaf Amy Lee Diving suit Beavis and Butt-head Wolfrider 1980s Beard 1969: The Velvet Underground Live Claw Pubic hair Lord of the Flies Dreadlocks Sea ice Emo fashion Singlish Sesshomaru Baldness Vestibular system Kodocha Timmy Turner Bringing It All Back Home Double layer Depilation Tarantula Atomic Kitten Pachypodium bicolor Knife Brush Fur MP3 Skin KaBlam!
