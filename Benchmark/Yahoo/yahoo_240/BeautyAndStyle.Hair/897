hair questions help please my hair is medium brown and two inches past my shoulders i have layers and side swept bangs also wavy but i often straighten it should i cut or grow wavy or straight highlights or die darker if highlights what color help please well i think you should keep it long because long hair looks really pretty and i think that if you want brown medium brown is the perfect colour if you want lighter highlights is a better option and the thing is that if you want highlights your going to have to dye your hair whenever your get roots and people with brown hair get a lot of roots so your hair may get damaged from dying it so much and it may look really really bad so i would suggest keeping it medium brown or darker depends on what you want i think a really cool colour is blue black or red brown if you want it dark ask your hairdresser you want blue black which is a black that looks like a tint of blue in the light it looks really nice but on the other hand i personally really like the look of red brown what i bought was this washout thing in shoppers drug mart and it said plum colour on the label but when i put it in it ended up being like a really nice burgundy brown colour and i loved it but it washed out in about months so if you want to try something out do a washout in case you dont like it if you do on the other hand considering permanently dyeing it that colour Color theory Haircut Wood Kimono Hair color Hair Human skin color Color Textile manufacturing Iris (anatomy) Blond White (people) Black (people) Red hair Eye color Horse Snooker Textile manufacturing terminology Floppy disk Race of Jesus Sunglasses Diamond Music of the United Kingdom (1950s and 60s) Skinhead Acne Double Dragon Food coloring Upholstery Lighting Roan (color) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Dog Red Color blindness Paul Is Dead Physical attractiveness Characters in the Smurfs Melanin Diamond enhancement Christmas tree Guinea pig Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water Dobermann Kodocha Depilation Pysanka Skin Gramophone record Tattoo Labrador Retriever Kender Tincture (heraldry) Beret The Rasmus Traffic sign Technicolor Laser hair removal Green Day Billiards Totally Spies!
