hair coloring i have naturally jet black hair and want to try to color it at home i've tried different brands and different colors but my hair is so dark it hardly shows up does anyone else have this problem and if so what hair color brand do you use that works well you can start by gradually dying it a light color start with a light brown or maybe even a blonde just do this every few weeks each time pick a lighter shade until you have the color you want that's if you want to do it fhe cheap way but if you go to the hair dresser they can easily do it fast and make it look perfect plus less damage from the constant dye since professional dye is different and doesn't damage as much i use loreal brand Hair color Hair coloring Color theory Human skin color Horse Color Hair Cigar Kimono Leather Blond Dye John Layfield Guinea pig Melanin The Ashlee Simpson Show Meriones unguiculatus Technicolor The Rasmus Inkjet printer Billiards Laser hair removal Dragon Booster Gramophone record Punk fashion Photographic film New York Jets Red Light-emitting diode Red hair Cat coat genetics Sunglasses Logo Kender Color blindness Link (Legend of Zelda) Eye color L'Or__al M&M's RGB color model Black (people) Pigment Double bass Black hole Shetland Sheepdog Queen of Wands Tattoo Bock Black Hair (musical) Cincinnati Bengals Emo fashion W.I.T.C.H.
