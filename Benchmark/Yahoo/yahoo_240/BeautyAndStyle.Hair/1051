mixing manic panic dye right now i have fl oz ml of tish spooky's manic panic cotton candy pink right on the jar it says not to mix it with peroxide my hair is already bleached and had been professionally dyed pink before but it left quite a dent in my bank and my butt sore from sitting in the hair dressers chair for hours and a half so my questions to you guys are is there anything i can mix with the manic panic dye to make it more permanent in my hair perhaps something from another box dye so i don't have to keep buying jars upon jars of these since the place where i get my manic panic dye is almost a hour drive away and i don't want to go through the whole ordeal with the hair salon again also why does the company not want peroxide to be mixed with their ready to use dye many thanks in advance for all the people who answer this don't mix it with anything but to get it more permanent leave it in way longer like overnight it's all natural so it won't really mess with your hair much use heat processing a hair dryer to help the hair color set wash out with cold water don't shampoo it out and don't shampoo hair for about two days to a week when you do shampoo put some of the remaining dye in your shampoo condtioner or buy the special shampoo they have for all the colors they probably have it with the dye but stupid me didn't look for it when i went to sally today anyway always wash your hair with cold water or even better don't wash it at all and use a dry shampoo or go as long between washes as possible i condition my hair once a week under cold water my color has been in about two months and only just started fading and by the way peroxide damages your hair horribly and they don't want it mixed because it could have disastrous effects those are chemicals you're messing with sweetie there could be a horrible reaction Hair coloring Textile manufacturing Upholstery Shampoo Organic peroxide Tattoo Dandruff Hydrogen peroxide Sento Hair Leather Acne Technicolor Psoriasis Acetone peroxide Paint Photography Urticaria Sterilization (microbiology) Kimono Baldness treatments Tooth enamel Hair color Manic Street Preachers The Ashlee Simpson Show Menstrual cup 2005 World Series Drowning Dry cleaning Tanning Wood pulp Washing machine Dye Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Ammonia Stomach cancer Radiation therapy Photographic film Time Out of Mind Milton H.
