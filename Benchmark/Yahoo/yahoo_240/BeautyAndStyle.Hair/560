hair situation well i have long naturally blonde slightly thin hair i like my hair but in the part few years its been getting very greasy like i would take a shower one night then by the end of the next day my hair would start getting greasy and the annoying part is my mom won't let me wash my hair everyday my questions are why is it like this are there any hair products out there that help it and i dont want any homemade recipes cuz i dont feel like experimenting your mom is right washing your hair more often will cause damage and won't help your problem your scalp produces more oils if you wash more often if you sprinkle cornstarch or talc into your hair it can soak up the grease a bit then brush it out this sounds like a homemade recipe but it does work a clarifying shampoo might help keep your hair cleaner don't use a really harsh shampoo as this will just cause your scalp to produce oils if you use conditioner only apply it to the ends of your hair not near the scalp as this can cause greasy spots and make sure you rinse it out thouroughly Shampoo Psoriasis Dandruff Baldness treatments Dry cleaning Soap Drug test Phoebe Buffay's songs Burdock Baldness Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Wool Certified Nursing Assistant Hair Brush Textile manufacturing Massage Rice Sento Leather Social rule Laundry detergent Paint Jon Secada Carding Drill bit Erogenous zone Comanche Cheese Milton H.
