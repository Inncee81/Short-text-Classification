coloring help i actually have questions first does anyone know of a website where i can upload my picture and see different hairstyles on myself for free also my hair is blond bleach blond and i was thinking i want to go dark but i'm not sure would my hair even take the color it's pretty damaged and also if it did and i hated it would i ever be able to go back to my color now hiya im not sure of an exact website but type it in google sure it will bring up something with going dark on blond you have to be careful as it might go green its all to do with the color wheel i believe that if you want to go dark you have to use a natural colour or something with a tint of red in it to prevent it form going green dont use anything with ash undertones otherwise it will go green the best way to test it is use a semi perm dye first and then if u dont like it it washes out if you do then try a permanent dye good luck Hair coloring Color theory Blond Color blindness Hair color Hair Tattoo Food coloring Technicolor Death rock fashion The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Red hair Joker (comics) Kimono Color The Ashlee Simpson Show Characters in the Smurfs Link (Legend of Zelda) Haircut Staining (biology) Red The Rasmus Skinhead Miniature (illuminated manuscript) Veronica Lake Totally Spies!
