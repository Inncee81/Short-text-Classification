i want to get blonde highlights help i'm and i want to get blonde highlights but if it goes wrong then people will take the mic i would def go get it highlighted at a salon and if you haven't started back school yet do it now so it will have time to fade a little since sometimes the blonde can be bright and more obvious the first few days giving the color more time to relax before you start back school but the salon is the best way to go since they are professionals i would also bring in a picture of other highlights and shades to give the hairdresser something to go on good luck Blonde on Blonde Blood on the Tracks Hair coloring Hair color Cosmetology Highway 61 Revisited Blond Hip hop collaborations Reservoir Dogs Gimmick (professional wrestling) The Ashlee Simpson Show Sunlight New York Giants Digital photography Gouraud shading Press Your Luck Legally Blonde The Pet Sounds Sessions Archery at the 1996 Summer Olympics Archery at the 1992 Summer Olympics Phong shading Professional wrestling slang Kender __douard Manet 20th Century Fox Dallas Cowboys Cincinnati Bengals Beavis and Butt-head Blonde Redhead Atari 8-bit family Academic art Totally Spies!
