tell me what are hair pills and wat do they do for u where do u grow hair fast at many hair pills exist there are those containing vitamins for hair and those who should regrow hair like propecia propecia pills and minoxidil are the only two medications approved by the fda to be effective against hair loss so i guess when you said hair pills you were referring to propecia propecia in most cases only stops hair loss and won't help at regrowing hair minoxidil on the other hand is proved to regrow hair as long as you apply it but it comes in form of liquid or a foam i've used minoxidil myself and i found it to be amazing at what it does i won't use propecia because many complain about different side effects such as low libido impotence or so you won't grow hair anywhere fast with minoxidil you can grow hair but the process is slow usually months while applying it times a day and the hair regrow will be mostly on your scalp if used by the prescriptoion also some users have reported that using minoxidil grows more hair on the whole body but only at the usual places where hair already grows Baldness treatments Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Minoxidil Baldness Psoriasis Prostate cancer Oral contraceptive Acne Sildenafil Aspartame Alopecia areata Hypertrichosis Medical cannabis Folic acid Puberty Shampoo Hair Stomach cancer Antidepressant Drug test Menstrual cycle Black hole Tocopherol Bupropion Radiation therapy Atherosclerosis Androgen insensitivity syndrome Nail (anatomy) Alzheimer's disease Food and Drug Administration Non-medical use of dextromethorphan CPU cache Anorexia nervosa Simpson and Delilah Fertility awareness Hair color Emergency contraception Cochlear implant Antipsychotic Pharmaceutical company Chlorpromazine Professional wrestling match types Amiodarone Guinea pig Herpes simplex virus Decompression sickness Dandruff Coffee Antiretroviral drug Isotretinoin Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Testosterone Vitamin C Veganism Professional wrestling throws Growth hormone treatment Vitamin D Merck & Co.
