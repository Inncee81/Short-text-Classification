is there a way to download an old record album to your computer a record as in what plays on a turn table i was just wondering if there was a way to transfer them to a computer don't think so but you never know sure you'll need a turntable first of all the voltage level at its output cable will have to be compatible with the line inputs of your computer's sound card and this is not difficult to do mechancially you need the appropriate plug adapters or electrically the old ceramic cartridges put out line level signal inherently and it's easy to find a pre amplifier to boost the signal of a turntable that uses a magnetic cartridge if you've got an old time stereo receiver with turntable attached and it has 'line out' jacks on it use those as for the computer itself you'll need a recording program to turn your sound card input into say an mp one program that will do this is free and it's called freecorder you can get a higher fidelity version of it for maybe twenty bucks too do a google search i think that both windows xp and the apple machines come with some sort of recorder as well after you get your record into a computer file there is free software available that'll allow you to clean off the clicks and pops and hiss from the record have fun Phonograph Gramophone record Commodore 64 Magnetic cartridge Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Digital circuit IPod Sound recording Audiophile Disc jockey Multitrack recording Jack plug IBM PC compatible Computer Vacuum tube Atari 8-bit family Personal computer Universal Serial Bus Apple Macintosh Loudspeaker Oscilloscope Atari ST Java programming language Synthesizer MP3 Microphone Apple IIGS Nintendo Entertainment System Radio Electric guitar Xbox Apple II family Analog-to-digital converter Amstrad CPC Computer bus RS-232 Digital audio workstation Bluetooth Sound card Nominal impedance Floppy disk Impedance matching Central processing unit Operational amplifier Electronic amplifier AmigaOS Amiga Compact audio cassette Transistor Vorbis Game Boy HyperCard Read-only memory Mac OS X Perl ZX Spectrum CPU design Electrophysiology Beatmania IIDX Sound Blaster Kazaa Modem Copy protection Headphones Macromedia Flash Atari 2600 Hello world program PlayStation Portable Super Nintendo Entertainment System History of the graphical user interface ITunes Computer virus Digital rights management Nintendo DS D-subminiature Domestic AC power plugs and sockets 8-track cartridge Acorn Electron TRS connector Interactive fiction Game programmer Mixing console TRS-80 Color Computer Programmable logic controller Macintosh Finder Windows XP Microprocessor Unicode Port (computing) Sega Saturn Electric motor Windows 2000
