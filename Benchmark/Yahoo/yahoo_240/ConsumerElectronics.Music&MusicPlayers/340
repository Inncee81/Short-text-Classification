itunes help i havent used itunes before so i was just wondering about a few things when i go to put my cds on my ipod can i plug in my ipod and download each cd individually or do i have to download all my cds to itunes and then plug in my ipod to transfer my songs when i went to put my cds on my itunes they all said track track and so on how can i put them on there so they automatically say the artist and song name without going in and manually typing the info in for each song thanks you have to import the cds then put them in playlists or however you want them on then transfer you have to individually rename the songs if you're connected to hte internet and the cd is a store bought one and not a burned one it should recognize the song names ITunes ITunes Music Store IPod Online music store IPod shuffle Podcasting Digital rights management FairPlay Digital audio player SonicStage Mixtape Rhapsody (online music service) Walkman Napster (pay service) RealNetworks Billboard Hot 100 ILife IPod nano IPod photo Winamp Copy protection IPod mini MP3 We Belong Together Rhythmbox QuickTime IPhoto Disc jockey Billboard magazine Gramophone record U2 (band) Warez Video game music Tori Amos Copyleft Last.fm Floppy disk Advanced Audio Coding Shake It Off Playlist Black Eyed Peas Enterprise content management Compact disc Napster Karaoke Jack FM Compact audio cassette File sharing MiniDisc Japanese copyright law Spark plug Telephone exchange Apple Newton CDBaby Steve Jobs Apple typography Windows XP File system CD Baby This Week in Tech Rufus Wainwright Don't Believe the Truth Madonna (entertainer) EMusic Vorbis Digital download CDDB Pearl Jam Jon Lech Johansen Propellerheads Classic rock Java programming language Marillion Commodore 64 Boards of Canada Modem Carburetor Hung Up (song) Warp Records Band Aid (band) Record label Grateful Dead Compilation album Apple Macintosh Moby Jack plug Speed of Sound (single) Jamie Stevens PlayStation Portable Single (music) Adam Ant America Online The Emancipation of Mimi Comparison of media players BitTorrent TLC Fort Minor Delta Goodrem Game Boy Advance
