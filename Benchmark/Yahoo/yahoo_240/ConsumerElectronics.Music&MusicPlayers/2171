need help with dead ipod nano o k this happened before but i tried doing the thing where u hold the center and menu but now it doesn't work nothing happened to it its in great condition and it has full charge it was a gift from my uncle overseas and i don't have time getting a new one with the warranty do not say it's because it's another over priced product of apple please does it show up when you plug it into your computer if it does then you can try restoring it back to factory settings from itunes this deletes everything on the ipod so i hope you have it all on your computer still or you have it backed up somehwere if you can't get it to show up in itunes and reseting it doesn't work then i'm afraid it may be a short somewhere in the ipod if this is the case you will have to get it replaced or repaired by apple you may have even more difficulty with this if your uncle purchased it overseas because if i remember correctly apple usa only repairs products sold by apple usa apple japan repairs products sold by apple japan etc if you have an apple store near you you might try taking it in there it's possible they may have replacements available on site otherwise you'll need to set it up for mail service with apple i know the u s site for ipod repair is http depot info apple com ipod IPod ITunes Music Store Apple Computer ITunes IPod shuffle IPod nano Podcasting IPod mini Online music store Steve Jobs IMac FairPlay Loss leader IPod photo Walkman Apple Newton ILife NeXT Digital rights management FireWire Apple typography Napster (pay service) IBM PC compatible Mac OS X v10.4 QuickTime Apple Store Common Unix Printing System Vorbis Laptop Digital audio player Commodore 64 Apple II family Atari 8-bit family Gmail Embedded system MP3 Copyleft Minor Discworld concepts WebObjects Advanced Audio Coding Warranty Weebl and Bob USB flash drive Pinball Spyware Creative Zen Toyota Prius PowerBook The End of the World (Doctor Who) America Online Madonna (entertainer) Nintendo Entertainment System Wi-Fi Filling station Danger Hiptop RealNetworks Jon Lech Johansen Windows 2000 Trademark SonicStage Atari ST Mac rumors community HTTP cookie The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Mac mini Monopoly (game) Apple IIGS Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Nike, Inc.
