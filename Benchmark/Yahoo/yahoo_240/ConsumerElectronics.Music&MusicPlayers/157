vac power supply question i lost the oem power supply for my alesis midiverb digital reverb guitar effects unit the manual says the power supply needs to be volts ac at voltamps most power supplies are rated by milliamps how do i find the right one so it won't toast my reverb thx yeah what del says just to be clear you won't toast anything with extra amps that's what he means when he says your pedal will only take what it needs you just have to match the voltage personally i would go for a much higher amp rated power supply having plenty of power on tap can improve sound quality the same thing can be said for voltage i run my amps which are rated volt at about for example but i wouldn't risk it with an expensive bit of kit get a volt supply ok but you can go mad on the amperage and it will be perfectly safe Three-phase electric power Instrument amplifier Loudspeaker Fuse (electrical) Electronic amplifier Circuit design Operational amplifier Switched-mode power supply Decibel Transformer Resistor Welding power supply Electric guitar Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Transistor Solar cell Analog-to-digital converter Incandescent light bulb Digital circuit Super Nintendo Entertainment System Electricity meter Circuit breaker Sound Blaster Current (electricity) Synthesizer Electric motor Relay Split phase Microphone Alternating current Audiophile Welding High-voltage hazards Effects unit Volt High-voltage direct current Hard disk Diode Eddie Van Halen Electric power transmission X10 (industry standard) Password Gas metal arc welding Wind power Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Electrical resistance Timpani Electrical generator Electricity distribution Impedance matching Dimmer CMOS Central processing unit Capacitor Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets ATI Technologies BS 1363 Bicycle lighting Tony Banks (musician) Variable Frequency Drive War of Currents Robert Moog Thermostat __lectricit__ de France Voltage regulator Negligible Power (physics) Hybrid Synergy Drive Trey Anastasio RS-232 Digital-to-analog converter Arc welding Effects pedal Uninterruptible power supply Bass guitar IBM PC compatible Power supply Guitar Airsoft Spark gap Wind turbine Nickel metal hydride Floppy disk Logic families Overclocking Cheating in Counter-Strike Inflation Internal ballistics Commodore 64 Universal Serial Bus Phantom power Van de Graaff generator Analog computer Sampling (music) CPU design
