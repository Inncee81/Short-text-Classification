i hooked up my ipod to another persons computer how does he get the songs on my ipod ok so my friend wants my music so i hooked up my ipod to his computer but it wont let him get my music because its from my ipod on my library pleease help you can't because ipod does not store mp files as actual mp files on the device instead it stores them as random index files with arbitrary file names this is specifically designed to prevent you from doing this and if you try it will completely erase your library sorry next time do some shopping before buying an mp player perhaps one that isn't so castrated you can burn a cd at his house and transfer at yrou house ITunes IPod FairPlay Digital rights management ITunes Music Store Digital audio player IPod shuffle Apple Computer IPod nano H.264/MPEG-4 AVC File system Walkman Flash memory Podcasting Redundant array of independent disks USB flash drive Apple typography IPod mini Virtual memory Online music store IPod photo ILife RealNetworks C programming language QuickTime Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Computer MP3 MiniDisc File format Floppy disk Creative Zen Advanced Audio Coding Computer virus Musical Instrument Digital Interface Apple Macintosh Library (computer science) Karaoke Rhythmbox File sharing Rhapsody (online music service) Windows XP Cheating in Counter-Strike AmigaOS Napster (pay service) Macromedia Flash USB mass storage device class Hewlett-Packard Vorbis MAME Metadata Linked list Common Lisp SonicStage Gramophone record PNG Computer file Handheld video game Password Computer forensics Dance Dance Revolution Trademark PaX HFS Plus Unix IMac Mach kernel Computer and video games OpenDocument Digital circuit Best Buy Surveillance System/34 Compact disc Windows 2000 Newline Audio data compression Secure Shell Von Neumann architecture Freenet Pointer File Allocation Table Warez Atari 8-bit family File Transfer Protocol Java programming language Computer storage MUMPS Hard disk Steve Jobs Reference (computer science) Jack FM Windows Vista Universal Serial Bus Peer-to-peer Saved game Master Control Program DVD
