help brother broke ipod nano my stupid brother took my ipod nano from my bag without my permission and when he brought it back he claimed he never used it but the screen is stuck on the same thing on top it says disk mode and shows the battery bar but won't show the little lock when you put it on hold the main part of the screen has a big check with the words ok to disconnect underneath the back light is non responsive no matter what i hit the screen neither lights up nor changes please help or else i might have to kill my brother grrr little brothers can be soo annoying some times anyways since its frozen i suggest you just reset your ipod to it's original state all you have to do is using your usb cable plug the i pod to the computer then toggle the hold switch on and off a few times and then restart it by holding the menu and select middle at the same time until the screen goes black and the apple logo is up IPod IPod nano Apple Computer USB flash drive PlayStation Portable IPod shuffle Universal Serial Bus IPod mini Mouse (computing) Embedded system FireWire Creative Zen Windows XP Podcasting Atari 8-bit family IPod photo Apple Macintosh Danger Hiptop Windows 2000 Nintendo DS Pump It Up IMac Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Disc jockey Oscilloscope Digital audio player Booting ITunes Game Boy Game Boy Advance Floppy disk Flash memory Dance Dance Revolution DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Secure Digital card Walkman Redundant array of independent disks History of Microsoft Windows System/36 Gradius Apple typography Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Mach kernel IBM PC keyboard Super Mario Bros.
