urgent ipod nano question is there any other things you can do with an ipod nano other than play music and photos aare there any cool downloads or hacks that can make my nano play videos and stuff yes it is possible if you hack ur ipod nano u can do it w rockbox or linux i recommend rockbox because linux may damage ur ipod nano and it is very tricky w rockbox u can switch between the orinal firmware and the rockbox firmware here is the link http www rockbox org here is the step by step instruction installing rockbox introduction there are three separate components of rockbox two of which need to be installed in order to run rockbox the ipod boot loader the ipod boot loader is the program that tells your player how to boot and load the remaining firmware from disk it is also responsible for the disk mode on your player this boot loader is stored in special flash memory in your ipod it is already installed on your player so it is never necessary to modify this in order to install rockbox the rockbox boot loader the rockbox boot loader is loaded from disk by the ipod boot loader it is responsible for loading the rockbox firmware and for providing the dual boot function it directly replaces the ipod firmware on the player s disk the rockbox firmware similar to the ipod firmware most of the rockbox code is contained in a build that resides on your player s drive this makes it easy to update rockbox the build consists of a directory called rockbox containing all of rockbox files which is located in the root of your player s drive choosing a rockbox version there are three different types of firmware binaries from rockbox website release version current build and daily build you need to decide which one you want to install and get the version for your player release there has not yet been a stable release for the ipod nano st generation until there is a stable release for ipod nano st generation use a current build current build the current build is built at each source code change to the rockbox svn repository and represent the current state of rockbox development this means that the build could contain bugs but is most of the time safe to use you can download the current build from http build rockbox org archived build in addition to the release version and the current build there is also an archive of daily builds available for download these are built once a day from the latest source code in the svn repository you can download archived builds from http www rockbox org daily shtml note rockbox has a fonts package that is available at http www rockbox org daily shtml or from the extras link in the menu on the rockbox website while the current builds and daily builds change frequently the fonts package rarely changes thus the fonts package is not included in these builds the release version on the other hand does not change so fonts are included when you download a release when installing rockbox for the first time you should install the fonts package because current builds and daily builds are development versions which change frequently they may behave differently than described in this manual or they may introduce new and maybe annoying bugs if you do not want to get undefined behaviour from your player you should really stick to the current stable release if there is one for your player if you want to help the project development you can try development builds and help by reporting bugs just be aware that these are development builds that are highly functional but not perfect installing the firmware download your chosen version of rockbox from the links in the previous section connect your player to the computer via usb as described in the manual that came with your player take the file that you downloaded above and use the extract all command of your unzip program to extract the files in the zip file onto your player note that the entire contents of the zip file should be extracted directly to the root of your player s drive do not try to create a separate directory or folder on your player for the rockbox files the zip file already contains the internal directory structure that rockbox needs note if the contents of the zip file are extracted correctly you will have a folder called rockbox which contains all the files needed by rockbox in the main folder of your player s drive if you receive a error when you start rockbox you have not extracted the contents of the zip file to the proper location installing the boot loader warning if your nano has a stainless steel back and plastic front it is a st generation and is compatible with rockbox if on the other hand your nano has a one piece aluminum body it is a nd generation nano and there is currently no rockbox port available do not attempt to install the bootloader on a nd generation nano in order to make your ipod load and execute the rockbox firmware you have just installed you will need to install the rockbox bootloader unless bugs are found in the bootloader code or significant new feature are added you will only have to perform this step once bootloader installation from windows make sure you are logged into your computer as administrator or a user with administrator privileges and connect your player download ipodpatcher exe from http download rockbox org bootloader i and run it if all has gone well you should see some information displayed about your ipod and a message asking you if you wish to install the rockbox bootloader press i followed by enter and ipodpatcher will now install the bootloader after a short time you should see the message info bootloader installed successfully press enter again to exit ipodpatcher make sure that you have correctly extracted a build of rockbox so that you have a rockbox which contains all the files needed by rockbox in the root of your player s drive and that you have also installed the fonts package see section for more information disconnect your player in the usual way the bootloader is now installed after that to use rockbox u need to reboot ur ipod hold down the menu select button for a couple of seconds until it reboots u can also uninstall rockbox just if you would like to go back to using the original ipod software connect the player to your computer and follow the instructions to install the bootloader but when prompted by ipodpatcher enter u for uninstall instead of i for install if you wish to clean up your disk you may also wish to delete the rockbox folder and its contents turn the ipod off turn the player back on and the original ipod software will load hope this helps
