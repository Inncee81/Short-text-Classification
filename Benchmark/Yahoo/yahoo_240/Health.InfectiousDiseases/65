how long can hiv live in laboratory temperature because hiv is a virus it is technically not living but i know what you mean along with the previous answerer i do not know what you mean by lab temperature a virus cannot live on its own without a host you could keep it alive in a laboratory setting as long as it still has a host to infect for example you could run experiments with the hiv by infecting other cells however once those cells are dead and there is not a suitable environment the hiv will no longer live you could keep the virus in a dormant stage by freezing it with liquid nitrogen the virus will remain viable for many decades after the initial freezing i read an experiment once where they successfully inactivated hiv by heating it to degrees c and i am sure as long as the virus has a host any reasonable temperature will be suitable HIV Cytomegalovirus Antiretroviral drug HIV test AIDS reappraisal HIV Disease Progression Rates Cryonics Computer virus AIDS Antiviral drug T-Virus Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Diseases of the honeybee HIV structure and genome Myxobolus cerebralis Apoptosis Timeline of AIDS Polymerase chain reaction Herpes simplex virus Human papillomavirus Brewery Ebola Spanish flu AIDS in Africa Prostate cancer Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus Multiple sclerosis Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Stem cell Virulence Immune system Tyrant (Resident Evil) Breastfeeding James D.
