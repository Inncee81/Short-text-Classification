ive order a container of mixed goods from china for personal use how long clear customs hi all ive just ordered a mixed container with household goods ie my kitchen bath etc etc from china and a bit worried about how lon it takes to clear uk customs southampton and how much i will get taxed i done it at a massive risk got a agent yeah well unorganized didnt find out about tax etc but thats me all over again its all for myself not to resell thanks for answering you mean you arranged shipment from china without using a shipping agent so nobody has confirmed that the goods are actually on board how did you pay by t t or loc who confirmed the goods were on board before you released or authorised payment if you used an agent they would take care of the customs clearance for you you are not only liable to import duties they will vary depending the type of goods you are importing but you will also have to pay vat at of the total cost of the goods duties will probably be somewhere between and as a rough guess if you used a shipper they would clear the goods for you in a matter of a few hours after landing they would also undertake transfer to your premises hope that helps think is you haven't given enough info apart from which i do not believe that anybody would undertake such a thing as to bring goods from china privately into the country let alone without first looking into duties vat and customs clearance first someone smart enough to do it in the first place would have looked into those things so what game are you playing Tax Insurance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Microeconomics Charles Ives Credit card Brewery Classified information Theory of conduct Taxation in the United Kingdom Health insurance Capitalism Less-Than-Truckload (LTL) Shipping Contract Economy of India Gross domestic product Property (ownership right) Economy of Russia Productive and unproductive labour Notary public Corporate governance Sauna Yohoho!
