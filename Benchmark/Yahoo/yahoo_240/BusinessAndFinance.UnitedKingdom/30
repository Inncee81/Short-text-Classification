dhl parcel form germany to the u k please help hi i'm expecting a parcel from germany via dhl delivery service will i be charged customs duty or any other kind of charges parcel is marked as gift and is coming from an eu country hi yes you will almost certainly pay customs charges i have dealt with an on line retailer recently they offered two shipping options shipping from abroad to the u k one was postal service days to weeks delivery time the other was dhl two or three days delivery i have ordered many times using both shipping options more than once here is what i found i was never charged duty on the orders that were shipped by postal service i was charged duty each and every time on the orders handled by dhl i think dhl might declare everything it handles whereas postal and other shippers might only leave it to the sender's self declaration of value etc i believe that dhl makes money by doing it this way too they in effect charge the customer for the service of clearing customs yet clearing customs seems to mean that the consumer has paid for the honour of being taxed even more than they would have if the dellivery had been made by alternate couriers also dhl each and every time in my experience has been too lazy to walk up the stair of my tenement flat and knock on the door to see if i am home they have just left 'missed delivery' notes at the main door even though i was home and the could have made delivery easily if they hd been arsed to to their job walk up the stairs and knock on the door in my experience dhl is expensive and they deliver a poor service i now avoid dealing with them full stop bit of a rant but there you go good luck i hope they treat you better s United States Postal Service United Parcel Service Post office Postage stamp Less-Than-Truckload (LTL) Shipping Internet fraud Mail Contract ZIP Code Value added tax Canada Post Royal Mail Tax Heinkel He 112 Bank Mail fraud Tesco Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Credit card Inflation Advance fee fraud Broadband Internet access Microeconomics ITunes Music Store Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Insurance Outsourcing DHL Direct marketing Illegal drug trade Social rule United Kingdom corporation tax Health insurance FairTax Publicly funded medicine Saint Nicholas Tariff Baseball Electronic commerce Gross domestic product Transmission Control Protocol Delivery (commerce) CPU cache New England Patriots E-mail spam The Star Wars Holiday Special Naval mine USS Terry (DD-513) Delta Air Lines Flat tax Toyota Prius Ryanair Stairway Customs and etiquette of Japan Toll-free telephone number Enterprise content management Online shop Airborne Express Mutual fund Fast bowling Douglas DC-8 Aldi Life insurance New York Jets Netflix Spring operating system Private Express Statutes Security (finance) New York Giants Price discrimination Canadian and American health care systems compared Sears Holdings Corporation Telegraphy Betting (poker) Denis Law Short selling Commodity markets Verizon Wireless Cricket Information Services Procurement Library Privatization Boeing 777 Data retention High-speed rail Information Technology Infrastructure Library Something Awful Taxation in the United States NVIDIA Conscription Estoppel Filling station USS Trigger (SS-237) Donald Neilson Service Second Battle of the Atlantic Mail order EFTPOS Escape from New York
