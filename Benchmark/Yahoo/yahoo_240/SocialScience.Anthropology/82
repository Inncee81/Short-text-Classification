is carbon dating always accurate when making dates on historic finds such as dinosaur bones artifacts etc tjb is correct the result of any test is dependent upon the person s conducting the tests contamination is the problem when conducting any test therefore several different teams often do the testing to ensure accuracy eliminate errors different dating methods that show slightly different results based upon different parameters are often used to rule out contamination that would show in one test but not the other when large disparities are found then contamination is suspected the tests are rerun yes carbon dating is always accurate within certain parameters if conducted properly Radiometric dating Normal distribution Chernobyl accident Welding Radioactive contamination Expert system Software testing Drug test Nuclear power Hypoglycemia Radiocarbon dating Scientific method Polymerase chain reaction Aquifer test PID controller Flood geology E85 Shroud of Turin Explosive material Circuit design CIE 1931 color space Dinosaur Nuclear weapon design Unit test Fusion power Quantitative marketing research Synthetic diamond Reliability engineering Debugging Global climate model Sewage treatment Slide rule Weighing scale Gas metal arc welding Gmail Numerical integration Intelligence quotient Business continuity planning Hipparchus (astronomer) C plus plus Prostate cancer Age of the universe Gas tungsten arc welding Hubble Space Telescope Air safety HIV test 2001 anthrax attacks Handloading Name mangling Condom Item response theory Model (economics) Bush v.
