should i just go ahead and get my b a in anthropology or not so here's the deal i majored in anthropology with a minor in criminology hoping to go into forensics or something along those lines apparently i didn't do enough research and after talking to someone i found out that maybe if i wanted to go into forensics i probably should have majored in biology instead of anthropology but the problem is that i am only a couple semesters away from graduation and i really don't have the money or the time to start over and major in biology so should i just get my degree in anthropology and specialize when i go to graduate school or what i know that anthropology is a broad field and there is a lot i can do i know that i probably need to talk with my advisors but i am curious if anyone has been in this situation and might have any advice and to be honest i am not so sure anymore if i want to go into forensics i am still thinking about that sorry if this question is confusing i just got my degree in anthropology and i am in graduate school studying forensics yes you do need a biology background however you can obtain that in grad school like i am doing since you are so close to getting your degree i would go for it it is such an amazing experience to graduate with your b a or b s also don't let people tell you that you can't find jobs in anthropology i had jobs lined up in anthropology before i graduated good luck to you in whatever you choose Graduate school Psychology Ethics Medicine Science Anthropology Sexual orientation Forensics Massachusetts Institute of Technology Criminology Dentistry Education in the United States Margaret Mead Education in Portugal Lawyer Georgetown University Education in Germany Psychiatry Economics American University Education in Romania Gary Snyder Education in the People's Republic of China Physician Simon Fraser University Chinese University of Hong Kong Milton H.
