heart skipped two beats pvc's last night while laying in bed my heart suddenly felt very large and full of pressure and it gave a strong beat then skipped almost three beats i had enough time to think oh it's doing it again and then oh my god it hasn't started again i hit my chest hard on the left side panic and it then started to beat again but it was slower than usual for a while i have had this happen before the last time was similar except after it resumed beating it was very fast and erratic for about seconds before becoming normal my doc said possible pvc's without doing an exam anyone know anything about these symptoms btw i had no caffiene no alcohol and i am not stressed sorry i forgot to state that i am years old and i do not have much confidence in my doc's diagnoses because she is a nurse practitioner who specializes in women's health the dear women was checking me for mono when i had pleurisy and kidney stones which were both diagnosed in the er pvc's or premature ventricular contractions are actually quite common and harmless to most people pvc's occurring in the presence of heart disease can cause a harmful dysrythmia the message i get from your physician is that he is not too worried about a few random irregular heartbeats heart disease is diagnosed with a series of tests in most cases symptoms drive the pursuit of these tests in the past some symptoms in women have been overlooked as they do not always present with classic cardiac symptoms radiating chest pain etc if you have chest pain or have had pain in your neck or jaw which does or does not radiate to a shoulder or arm that is not explained otherwise you may be having symptoms of heart disease you didn't state your age in your question although heart disease can exist in a person of any age there is clearly greater cause for concern for anyone over the age of your symptoms should be your guide in pursuing your medical care if you are uneasy about your health status you should see a physician at once if you lack confidence in your physician's diagnosis you should consult another physician Myocardial infarction Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Prostate cancer Angina Cancer Pneumonia Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Stomach cancer Turner syndrome Aortic dissection Traumatic brain injury Asthma Hypoglycemia Stroke Urinary incontinence Cephalic disorder First aid Chronic fatigue syndrome Atrial fibrillation Bipolar disorder Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Childbirth Cardiac stress test Anxiety Physical examination Malignant melanoma Transsexuality Clinical depression Heart Atherosclerosis Electrocardiogram Lupus erythematosus Tobacco smoking Multiple sclerosis Obstetrics Atrial septal defect Hypertension Paget's disease of bone Diabetes mellitus Tocopherol Folic acid Panic attack Chest pain Medical analysis of circumcision Duchenne muscular dystrophy Psychiatry Schizophrenia Premature birth Cardiac arrest Lung cancer Mesothelioma Equine conformation Migraine Premature ventricular contraction Breast cancer Diagnosis Alcoholism Mitral regurgitation Fibromyalgia Alzheimer's disease Homeopathy Androgen insensitivity syndrome Syringomyelia Clomipramine Narcolepsy Anemia Alternative medicine Ventricular fibrillation Traditional Chinese medicine Aspartame Cirrhosis Decompression sickness Propranolol Crohn's disease Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia Heart sounds Physician Pulmonary embolism Hodgkin's lymphoma Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder HIV test Autism Endometriosis Charles Darwin's illness Nostalgia Psoriasis Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Group A streptococcal infection Heartburn Growth hormone treatment Balance disorder Cancer of the larynx AIDS reappraisal
