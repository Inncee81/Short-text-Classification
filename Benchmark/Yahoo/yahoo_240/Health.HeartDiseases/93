question about coughing after heart surgery my grandpa had a triple bypass around months ago he was on a ventilator after the surgery for several days longer than usual patients as he only has one kidney since the surgery he has been having lots of coughing fits the dr has stated that it ios possibly the ventilator which has caused some scarring on his throat all they have recommended is cough medicine to try and stop the coughing a few days this week he has been coughing so hard he is sick was just wondering if anyone knows if these coughing fits are normal and if they have any other remedies they could recommend to help stop the coughing i am a respiratory therapist and i often worked with post op bypass patients it's not uncommon for older patients to develop pulmonary infections due to reduced lung function that normally follows any kind of surgery especially thoracic surgery while the tube down the throat causes irritation for awhile i'd think nine months is a long time for that i would ask his doctor if he would order a chest xray at least to give him more information about whats going on in your grandpa's chest Pneumonia Medicine Acute respiratory distress syndrome Asthma Common cold Tuberculosis Lung cancer Urinary incontinence Pulmonary alveolus Atrial septal defect Gastroesophageal reflux disease Physical therapy Cancer Lung Prostate cancer Chronic fatigue syndrome Group A streptococcal infection Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Mechanical ventilation Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Cystic fibrosis Psoriasis Pulmonology Organ transplant Cough medicine First aid Pulmonary embolism Radiation therapy Bronchitis Aspergillosis Drowning Myocardial infarction Emphysema Traumatic brain injury Stomach cancer Angioplasty Coronary artery bypass surgery Heartworm Shock Stroke Acupuncture Pulmonary edema Scar Breastfeeding Goodpasture's syndrome Infectious mononucleosis Liquid breathing Replacement joint Nasal congestion Turner syndrome Cephalic disorder Intravenous therapy Hip fracture Duchenne muscular dystrophy Amiodarone Dialysis Acne Ulcerative colitis Adverse effect (medicine) Tobacco smoking Pulmonary aspiration Thoracotomy Tourette syndrome AIDS Intensive care medicine Glycogen storage disease type I Respiratory system Medical cannabis Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Surgery Intubation Insulin Medical ventilator Obesity Myasthenia gravis Spirometry Orthopedic surgery Traditional Chinese medicine Androgen insensitivity syndrome Cardiopulmonary resuscitation Aortic dissection Bubonic plague Equine conformation X-ray Emergency Medical Services Medieval medicine Angina
