i have panic attacks appts with high bp normal home how do they get any accurate numbers with panic pl i only take meds for appts which helps some but i really panic with appts i understand alot of people have panic attacks and then bp goes high then back down i have to take my bp at home how do they get any accurate numbers at appts for panic people this disorder is very misunderstood by many karen the phenomenon you describe is well known it even has a name white coat hypertension after the white coats that doctors traditionally wear unfortunately it is very difficult to get a good idea of usual blood pressures for these patients at their appointments alone i hesitate to say accurate because the measurements are accurate but they only reflect what the blood pressure is in the doctor's office and not what it is on a day to day basis one solution is to check the blood pressure after letting the patient relax for a bit once they are in a room obviously that doesn't always work the best option is for the doctor to order an ambulatory blood pressure monitor that the patient wears around this checks and records the blood pressure periodically throughout the day by reviewing the information from an ambulatory blood pressure monitor a doctor can tell what your blood pressure more typically runs having said that there is good research that shows that people with white coat hypertension are still at higher risk of heart disease than people without white coat hypertension their risk tends to fall somewhere between that of people with persistently high blood pressure and people with normal blood pressure readings hope that helps good luck to you Hypertension Blood pressure Prostate cancer Obstetrics Sleep apnea Myocardial infarction Aortic dissection Turner syndrome Dialysis Cardiac stress test Pulmonary hypertension Coronary heart disease Traumatic brain injury Physical examination Anxiety Hypoglycemia Chronic fatigue syndrome Diazepam Asthma Angina Diabetes mellitus Malaria Glaucoma Bipolar disorder Anorexia nervosa Aortic insufficiency Psoriasis Medicine Migraine HIV test Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Growth hormone treatment Coeliac disease Propranolol Diabetic retinopathy Sildenafil Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Urinary incontinence Medical prescription Hemorrhagic stroke Folic acid Panic attack Drowning Atrial fibrillation Maprotiline First aid Lumbar puncture Atherosclerosis Cirrhosis Ventricular fibrillation Dieting Aneurysm Decompression sickness Vampire Surveillance Colorectal cancer Tobacco smoking IgA nephropathy Fast bowling Post-traumatic stress disorder Tocopherol Androgen insensitivity syndrome Insulin resistance Out-of-body experience Coronary catheterization Narcolepsy Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Cancer Loudspeaker Polycystic ovary syndrome Homeopathy Penis Exercise Doxepin Clomipramine Clinical depression Gout Autism Stress (medicine) C-reactive protein ACE inhibitor Erectile dysfunction Schizophrenia Intravenous therapy National Institutes of Health Metabolic syndrome Publicly funded medicine
