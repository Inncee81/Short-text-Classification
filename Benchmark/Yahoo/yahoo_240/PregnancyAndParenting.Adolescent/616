why are teens in such a hurry to get old i'm and i'm just fine with being that age for now i have a roof over my head most of my bills paid for the ability to drive and see my friends often some responsibility but not an overwhelming amount and i still have a lot of freedom everyone else my age is eager to get out of their house and be on their own b c then they'll have freedom i dont understand why they want this we have the rest of our lives to be adults why do they want to stop being kids too soon i understand that some teens have a rough homelife and that could be a reason but many of the people i know that want to grow up faster have great lives at home they may not get along with their parents too often but when they're older they'll just have kids to fight with most teens mistake age for maturity so they want to be older and therefore more 'mature' they've learned or think that people respect others who are mature and so thats what they want to be others have a very tough home life and would actually be better off to get out of their homes as quickly as they can but they dont want to deal with cps or anything like that so they just want to get older so they can leave Adolescence Puberty Pitaten Polyamory Grief Simone Weil Open Directory Project Homeschooling Infantilism One Tree Hill (TV series) Second language acquisition Saved by the Bell Abortion debate The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Vegeta Transactional analysis Mennonite Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Billy the Kid Fast bowling Piccolo (Dragon Ball) M.A.U.R.I.C.E.
