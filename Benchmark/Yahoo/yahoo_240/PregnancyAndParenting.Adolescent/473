how do i help my mom my dad's really sick and just about given up on life he's depressed and angry and takes it out on everyone mostly me and my mom cause we're here the most but at the same time he's also worried about my me and my sisters particularly my older sister because she's currently pregnant with twins and is financially struggling enough with her two kids as it is well how can i help my mom get through this she's trying really hard to lift my dad's spirits but he seems to just be slipping deeper and deeper and if he dies then i don't know what i'l be able to do for her we've already lost family members close friends within the last years what are ways i can be there for her besides praying my other older sister is a bum who's still living with us but going to college goes out alot with her friends and drinks and never contributes anything around the house leaving me to do everything possibly the only good thing i could say about her is she has a job the best thing you can do is tell her how much you love her and that you're there for her no matter what she needs kids need their parents but sometimes parents need their kids too try to get her to talk about what she's going through it might be just what she needs some parents don't like talking to their kids about personal problems though so if she won't open up don't push just make sure she knows you're there when i was younger my parents were going through a very hard time it seems similar to your parents they ended up divorcing when i was and the difficult times actually ended up making me closer with both of my parents my dad also had given up and was an alcoholic for years your story really hit me because i know how hard it is to deal with a parent going through depression if you feel comfortable maybe try talking to your dad too i know that people going through such difficult times are often not even the person you used to know so i totally understand if you feel that it wont help just be sure your parents know you're there for them if they're at all willing family marriage counseling may help i really hope things get better for you and your family please feel free to message me if you need to talk anymore Friends Kodocha Fathers' rights Social rule The Fairly OddParents One Tree Hill (TV series) The Adventures of Pete & Pete Humphrey Bogart Rent (musical) The Marshall Mathers LP Polyamory Hollyoaks EastEnders The Catcher in the Rye About a Boy Knots Landing The O.C.
