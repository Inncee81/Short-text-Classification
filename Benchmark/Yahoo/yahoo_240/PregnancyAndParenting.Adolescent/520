does birth control really stop you does birth control really stop you from having your period im but i cant take having my period anymore its not because of cramps or anything its just that its too stressful and emotional for me to deal with and i when i have my period i cant even sleep last night with my period i only slept for a total of hours and i just cant handle it anymore so will it stop you from getting your period and will i be allowed to have it even though im only if that doesn't stop you from getting your period then wat else will umm it's not healthy to stop having your period you're you should be able to handle having your period i've had mine since i was believe me you get over it birth control gives the option of skipping your period but it isn't a healthy thing to be doing periods are your body's way of naturally purging itself of stores that would otherwise feed a baby besides unhealthily stopping your period with birth control pills the only real way to stop it is to either a get pregnant b go through menopause or c die i don't think any of those options are good for you considering you're only and menopause is also a natural process your best bet is to try to deal with it emotionally maybe talk to a counselor all women have to go through this you're not the only one and i don't think a doctor will give you birth control without legitimate reason and since i'm assuming you're not sexually active and you said you don't have cramps or any other issues like that your chances are pretty slim Urinary incontinence Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness In vitro fertilisation Childbirth EastEnders Breastfeeding Abortion debate Theory of conduct Friends Birth control Endometriosis Humphrey Bogart Menopause Kodocha Prostate cancer Sleep Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Pregnancy Oral contraceptive Poker jargon Traumatic incident reduction The Amber Spyglass Insomnia Soul Psoriasis Miscarriage Social rule Floppy disk Folic acid Premature birth Infantilism The Inside Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Dead Like Me Prenatal diagnosis Midwifery Sex and the City Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Amazing Race Domestic violence Negima Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Emergency contraception Sadism and masochism Reincarnation Narcissism Doomsday argument Religion and sexuality Earth Girl Arjuna Boston Public Taxi Driver Apollo 8 Singlish Abortion in the United States Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Transsexuality Decompression sickness Incarnations of Immortality Stomach cancer Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Niddah Cliff Richard LSD Atkins Nutritional Approach Insurance Dysmenorrhea Blackjack Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man Piper Halliwell The Ashlee Simpson Show Freddy Fender AFI 100 Years series Internet fraud Acne Sexual abstinence Human Sex education Left-handed Human sexual behavior Betting (poker) The Lovely Bones Fight Club Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Chronic fatigue syndrome House of M The nature of God in Western theology Eric Cartman Homophobia Eminem Long-term memory Cancer Undergrads Days of our Lives The Death Gate Cycle Brave New World Education in the United States Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act
