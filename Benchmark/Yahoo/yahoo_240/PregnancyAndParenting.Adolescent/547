is it illigal i am about to be yrs old next month i havea yr old boyfriend i've been with him for about if i became pregnant can my parents still put him in jail i would check with the laws in your state some states have a younger age law for rape charges which is what it could be called if you are still a minor in your state the usual age is but some states i think are and years old if you are not considered under age for sex with an older person then he cannot be charged for anything as long as you have given your personal consent however i would not have sex with anyone that didn't plan on a perminent relationship with me where a ring was involved with that age difference there is a good possibility that all they want is the infatuation of the relationship and they do not plan a perminent commitment that is no way to bring up a baby because the child will not be loved and the majoriety of relationships break up once the child comes between the now mother and father i would do whatever i could not to get pregnant so that a 'have to marriage' wasn't the reality some guys won't go through the marriage even if they claim they would it's a whole different ball game for them once they are confronted with the reality of a baby rather than a possibility that hasn't happened yet example my nephew got a girl he claimed he was madly in live with pregnant then he ditched her while she was pregnant her parents also ditched her so my sister took her in since it would be her grandchild and it was her son's baby she finally convinced him to at least support her while she was pregnant financially baby came and he helped with the care of the child and then told the girlfriend he would try to make the relationship work so he moved in with her in the house my sister was letting her stay in and got her pregnant a second time as soon as she was pregnant he told her it was her fault and he never loved her and he moved out of course my sister was so mad at him that she wouldn't let him move in with her either he is giving the girl child support for kids now and so far she can't even find a good decent guy that wants to date her let alone marry her with two of someone elses kids on the tow that she got from playing around before marriage i suggest you refrain from having a child even if he says he wants one until he is really committed in a marriage bond that is so much better for the child anyway EastEnders Friends Neighbours Knots Landing One Tree Hill (TV series) Age of consent Days of our Lives Kodocha Charmed The O.C.
