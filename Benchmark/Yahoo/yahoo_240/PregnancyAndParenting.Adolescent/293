teenager advise please i have a year old girl she is a person that my wife and i marvel at most of the time she is smart and studies hard she is good to her sister willingly babysitting when asked she has a big heart and is willing to help people we go to church and she volunteers and plays volleyball here comes the problem she is very pretty and mature looking for like most teenagers she is interested in sex and curious about alcohol we have caught her having sex and know she has been dipping into our liquor cabinet marked bottles her mother and i are at our wits end and don't know what else to do we have caught her having sex before and thought that we had said and done the right things to get her to think about the consequences of her actions but we have caught her again the alcohol is a new development any advise for a father that doesn't need to pull his own hair out mother nature is taking care of that naturally thanks yes we are punishing her she is grounded until the second coming of christ no computer no phone extra chores etc we are also obviously taking extra precautions with the liquor cabinet we had already marked the bottles but now it has a new lock and we have hidden the key when this happened to me my father sat me down and got me drunk to the point i was throwing up that cured the problem for me for a few years isn't this age fabulous no one gets raising teenagers until they have one first you don't mention your religious or cultural beliefs on safe sex well the issue is now here and no punishment you can effect will put the genie back in the bottle while education shouldn't be a punishment this is a fantastic time to make the punishment effective in at least one regard it is time for you to have sex talk with your daughter we learned that there are many versions of the sex talk it seems sex talk is when you explain to your little child that babies do not come from any of the other species or methods they hear about at television and that they're called privates for a reason sex talk is when you tell your child later on that sex is a very serious deal and that now that cable television has shown then it may not be as gross as they thought it's still not the recreational choice you would prefer sex talk is the big one in which you need to make sure that if they have it or have it again you don't need to get ready to have sex talk redux with a grandchild or check your medical insurance to see what stds are covered and if you will have to mortage your house for aids treatment your daughter will not find this talk entertaining or recreational she does not want to hear this from her father which is why you must reach deep down into yourself and find that mischievous evil part of yourself you hid when you became a parent and bring it back out feel glee at the fact that she's going to be deeply uncomfortable and get your supplies first get a copy of the guide to getting it on and see if you can also find a copy of a medical manual that has great pictures of warts hepatitis c symptoms aids symptoms childbirth and domestic violence make sure those pictures are as grisly as possible and include patients near her age then find a few nice pictures of people who are clearly grownups with solid lives make a little are you ready for sex quiz no one really is at her age but this is a great object lesson here are some good questions can you recite the middle names of everyone you've had sex with if not that also means you wouldn't know your baby's father's full name did you use a condom and if so did you check the expiration date did you worry about getting caught and getting in trouble adults only worry about being caught and getting embarrassed have the talk in a comfortable place for you large dining room tables are great living rooms aren't she can get comfortable enough to zone out what you're saying and you can get comfortable enough to ease up on her things you need to cover she now needs to see a gynecologist she engaged in grown up behavior and grown ups need to see to their own health she could have contracted something schools are rife with hpv and chlamydia and she wouldn't even know she had either let alone something more serious her mother should cover what to expect at the gynecologist you can cover circumcision vs non issues with her to prepare her for encountering them and add to her misery at having her father say these things together you should cover every single option for birth control in extreme detail this is for her health and to reinforce that adults actually face their decisions before they make them methods to cover are in the book i mentioned she can't hang out with boys at all until she's sufficiently mastered the information you've given her take the steps you've demanded and earned back your trust how does she earn back your trust by completing her punishment maturely no arguments tantrums or misbehavior a trustworthy person doesn't whine about what they've brought upon themselves you might want to add volunteering at a hospital's maternity ward or a local homeless shelter for teens to the list if she's as bright as you say information is everything she will experiment and the best you can do is give her information and demonstrate consequences addition drinking is unfortunately something you can't innoculate her against the best thing you can do is to give her the information she'll turn to when she's made mistakes and show her as much as you can drink responsibly in front of her if one of her parents has one drink away from home let her watch you hand over the car keys to the other as a matter of fact mature decision let her get used to seeing that now so she does it later as habitually as she buckles up drink responsibly with friends but also drink non alcoholic drinks when you feel like it and voice the choice in other words actually say the wine here looks good but i think i'm in the mood for a soda coffee water tea this is how she learns how a responsible adult with the opportunity to drink behaves in the presence of beverages she can't read your mind when you make these decisions every day and it's necessary to show her also don't shield her entirely from behavior you don't want her to see while i don't think using friends as examples of poor behavior to your children is the right thing to do by your friends strangers are fair game if she sees how idiotic people can get when intoxicated she won't associate intoxication with coolness or fun teenagers are more sensitive to noise and light ask a doctor and dislike bars that's where much of the alcohol is so going to one especially a sports bar for one good sports game even if only for one drink and some appetizer is a good way to see the animals in the zoo don't announce it's a lesson that way she will observe without feeling schooled Sexual abstinence Pitaten The Shining (film) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern
