wednesday was one year for my boyfriend and i i cried not from happiness my boyfriend wasn't really talking to me so i wasn't talking either because i could tell by looking at him that something was bothering him he's quiet as am i and it's easier for us sometimes especially since i tend to break down and cry easily to write things down so i asked him what was wrong and he said he couldn't explain it i didn't know if i did something or if he didn't want be around me he said that wasn't it it's just that sometimes he would rather be nowhere like somewhere not on this planet i cried anyway and he gave me a hug but he was still feeling down about something he left soon after that and that night i couldn't sleep because i was feeling nervous and worried i have told him to be more open with me and i realized that i don't always open up to him i wrote him a note explaining some deeper things about me do you think this might help him realize that he can open up to me since i was comfortable and open to him sorry for the typos my mind is all over the place and i was trying to hurry i think the note might help but while he is feeling down respect his wishes just imply or tell him that you will be there if and when he's ready to talk if he said you didn't do anything wrong then you should just believe him just show him all the love you can give him and respect his decision of not telling you hope that helped good luck Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Smoking Room One Tree Hill (TV series) EastEnders Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Piccolo Junior Saga The Ashlee Simpson Show Pitaten Blood on the Tracks Avenue Q Social rule The Emancipation of Mimi W.I.T.C.H.
