teenager going nowhere with her life help my year old sister has absolutely nothing going for her right now she's been successful in being kicked out of nearly every alternative high school program our town has to offer why because she simply refuses to attend she was even too lazy to show up once a week to meet with her instructor while she was doing independent studies my parents and i try to help her with job opportunities but she refuses to follow through and even fill out an application it's always i'll do it tomorrow she wakes up every day between pm and basically hangs out with friends sometimes she comes home at night other times she will stay out without contacting home she has been an on again off again regular pot smoker and drinker since she was i am currently working full time while living at home after graduating college two months ago and i hate to see how helpless my parents are in this situation it's hard on our whole family any advice she turns in a few weeks and my parents know that at that point they no longer have to be responsible for putting a roof over her head however they are heartbroken at the thought of putting her out without job education car or a dime to her name they've tried stripping her room of everything except a mattress pillow and blanket but she always seems to improve for a few days and gets all the items back they have taken away her house key locking the door if she's not home by curfew but this just ended up encouraging more nights away from home they are fresh out of ideas and i know they would never turn to the internet so i am here to gather ideas thanks all to answer someone's question my parents do not give her any spending money yes they provide her with a home food water etc but she mooches off friends for things like pot booze junk food and movies my parents even offer to take her to the mall for new clothes she has none but she would rather wear the same ragged sweat pants and hooded sweatshirts each day it's really hard to find something that will entice her to change because she really isn't passionate about anything sigh tough love you work or go to school help around the house and abide by the rules here our go somewhere else the thing is she has no reason to stop doing what shes doing sure your parents get upset yell a little but obviously nothing really happens and shes back to do whatever she wants she may leave for a few days weeks even a cpl months but she'll figure out there's no free ride friends and there parents may let her stay a few nights but how long would you let some live your house and do nothing she'll be back good luck and shes jus her lifes not over yet she'll grow up and more then likely become a productive member of society she obviously has a family that loves her very much EastEnders Mattress One Tree Hill (TV series) Knots Landing Sin City Poker jargon Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Social rule Kodocha Neighbours Married... with Children Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Ocean's Twelve Education in the People's Republic of China Alcoholics Anonymous Fancy Crane Pitaten The Dalek Invasion of Earth Characters in the Smurfs Garfield The Critic Piccolo Junior Saga The Amazing Race About a Boy Columbine High School massacre GED Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) George Costanza Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses The Apprentice 2 Shaggy dog story The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe The Catcher in the Rye Past teachings of Prem Rawat Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Customs and etiquette of Japan W.I.T.C.H.
