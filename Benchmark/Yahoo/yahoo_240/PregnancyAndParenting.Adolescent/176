does every teen do drugs get tattoed and party today i was looking at myspace and i found out my year old cousin does drugs and his girlfriend and all her friends have matching tattoos on their backs i'm only about years older than them but i've never done drugs or tried to get a tattoo is it even worth it to tell his mom he's buying and giving drugs to his friends or do you think she would even care these days or that it's even a big deal my own sister did marijuana then moved to meth and finally committed suicide at age no not every teen does these things and yes absolutely tell his mom either your cousin will deny it and nothing will happen after that or his mom will confront him and possibly save his life how would you feel if your cousin's life goes down the tragic road your sister's life followed you would feel guilty for knowing and not saying anything until the day you die i do think kids these days run amuk more than in past generations but it doesn't have to be that way parents need to be vigilant and sometimes they need others' to help them see what's going on it takes a village to raise a child because parents can't be everywhere at once i hope your cousin straightens out for his own well being best of luck Pitaten The Adventures of Pete & Pete About a Boy Friends Vernon Schillinger Kodocha Kurt Cobain Kyle Broflovski Too Short a Season (TNG episode) One Tree Hill (TV series) Incarnations of Immortality Infantilism EastEnders Angel Sanctuary Days of our Lives The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Ben Johnson (athlete) Suicide The Fairly OddParents My Life as a Teenage Robot Great Teacher Onizuka Chester Bennington Daredevil Oz (TV series) Charmed The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air The O.C.
