why would the law consider sex amongst teenages rape laila is pregnant years of age her boyfriend just recently turned yesterday we just found out that if either parents had been against this whole situation they could sue since both teens are were under age they have no right to consent towards a sexual relationship i don't understand with teens now a days being more sexually active and no one doing anything about it statutory rape is a crime because the law considers your ability to consent to what you are doing it doesn't matter if the people thought they were consenting the law says you are too young to have the ability to consent check out the wikipedia for more info there are lots of conditions and lesser crimes and lots depends on what state you live in if you're asking why the law hasn't changed even though it seems teenagers are more sexually active than they used to be i can't imagine any state legislature changing the law becuase it would look like they were endorsing teenage sex Age of consent Statutory rape Human sexual behavior Child sexuality Teenage pregnancy Pedophilia Abortion debate Adolescence Ephebophilia Child sexual abuse Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Rape Marriage Consensual crime Same-sex marriage Homophobia Theory of conduct North American Man/Boy Love Association Lawrence v.
