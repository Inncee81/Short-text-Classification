teens and parents what age for contacts instead of glasses i hear a lot about eye infections and i don't want to risk what eyesight my daughter actually has but her prescription is so severe that even the featherlight lenses for her glasses are really thick her eye doctor has recommended getting her contacts but i'm on the fence she is a very responsible year old she sets her alarm clock in the summer so she can get up in the morning to do her chores before everyone else gets up and gets in her way i'm pretty sure she could handle the responsibility but i would like to know if anyone out there has contacts or has a child with contacts and will tell me a little bit about their experiences with them my sister was and she did fine when she first began wearing contacts no infections no problems also responsible she is now an algebra professor with my kids i would allow my yr old and my yr old to have contacts my yr old isn't quite there yet if she needed them i wouldn't allow it i still have to remind her to brush her teeth however her yr old brother would do great as young as he is this boy gets up early to do his chores without being asked as well each child is different yours sounds like she'll be fine just remind her and have the eye dr tell her too wash your hands wash your hands wash your hands Milton H.
