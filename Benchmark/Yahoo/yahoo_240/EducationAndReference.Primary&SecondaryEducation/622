should i go to usc or stay close to home i finished high school my junior year but i will be taking colleges classes through the high school for my senior year i was planning on going to pitt state and then to dental school umkc but then i found out that usc has a dental program that combines the pre dental and dental courses into a year program its for accelerated students and i think i would qualify since i graduated with a gpa i know its my choice but my parents dont like the idea of me going to usc what do u think i should do i can understand that you want to respect your parent's wishes but in the end this is going to be your life and you have to start making decisions that affect you it's not to say you can't hear them out and take their opinions into consideration but if usc is the best dental program for you overall then go for it los angeles is a very expensive city and usc is a very expensive school so you just have to look at all of that before deciding is usc something that you can afford how much will your student loans be after you graduate how far away from your family do you want to be etc etc just educate yourself about your options and find out what's best for you in the end you will be the only one who has to live with the decision University of Southern California Education in Germany Education in the People's Republic of China High school Education in the United States Student loan College admissions Bowl Championship Series Dentistry Community college University of California, Los Angeles University of Michigan The College of New Jersey Middle Tennessee State University Laura Schlessinger Education in Taiwan Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Architect Cheryl Miller Tuition Juris Doctor No Child Left Behind Act Affirmative action Columbia University University of Connecticut GED SAT Belmont Abbey College Tulane University Kwantlen University College Education Education in Canada Student Associate's degree USC Trojans Football Mack Brown University of Pittsburgh Secondary education in France Regents of the University of California v.
