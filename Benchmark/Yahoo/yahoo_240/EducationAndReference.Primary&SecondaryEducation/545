any advice to my son going into middle school just make sure he knows what is going on and what he is responsible for he must also be highly organized and keep track of assignments and deadlines in an agenda be sure that you check it every night elementary schools tend to hand hold kids but once in middle school they are expected to be more independent just remember in elementary school he had a few teachers and was in a class with maybe kids he will now have classes teachers a day who will each see about students a day if he is absent it is his responsibility to ask for the missed work no one will hand it to him or remind him like when he was in elementary school if he is late to class without an excusable reason this is cause for detention or a referral to the office they don't play around in middle school also school lunches will be a little different in elementary school he maybe had a choice of meals from the school menu he will now have the option of eating french fries pizza and other junk food everyday if he chooses most middle school cafeterias are like a mall food court and people wonder why we have an obesity epidemic in this country sorry to get on my soap box if your son is worried about being stuffed into a locker as is depicted on nearly every 'tween sitcom there is no way that is possible the lockers are so small you can barely hang up a winter coat don't buy a backpack with wheels either it will never fit have him practice using a combination lock at home so by the time school starts he will be an old pro he will also have to get used to changing for gym class which he did not have to do previously i think it is highly outdated but i don't make the rules finally enjoy him for the next years once he hits th grade if he is like many boys that age he will become possessed by hormones and do anything to get girls' attention he will probably be highly annoying to you but just know that it is a phase that will soon pass even though it sometimes seems like an eternity he will do fine and within the first weeks or so he will really enjoy the freedoms and opportunities that he has French fries Poker jargon Education in Germany McDonald's Breakfast Primary education Hunter College High School Treehouse of Horror V Code: Lyoko Education in Romania Lynbrook High School Education in the People's Republic of China Taipei American School Obesity The Amazing Race Columbine High School massacre Azumanga Daioh Education in the United States Shaggy dog story FoxTrot Burger King Bristol Grammar School Springfield Elementary School Androgen insensitivity syndrome Generation Y Customs and etiquette of Japan Hamburger E.L.E.C.T.I.O.N.S.
