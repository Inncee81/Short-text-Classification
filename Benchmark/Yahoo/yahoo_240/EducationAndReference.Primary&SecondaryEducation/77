why am i uncomfortable around men i don't live with my dad i do not think they are cute it just feels weird when i talk or see a full grown man besides my dad don't make fun of me serious questions only please like one of my teachers was a man i was having a problem with what we were studying but i didn't tell him if he was a woman i would have told what's wrong with me i'm not uncomfortable around kids or boys my age just grown up men i have a crush on this boy my age down the street he is sooo cute if you don't worry about it or focus on it maybe you'll become more comfortable as you get older there is nothing wrong with you at all some youngsters as well as adults just get along better with the same sex i imagine if you asked a bunch of guys your age you would get similar answers and maybe you wouldn't feel so insecure about the matter Social rule Friends Avenue Q Shaggy dog story Kyle Broflovski Joke W.I.T.C.H.
