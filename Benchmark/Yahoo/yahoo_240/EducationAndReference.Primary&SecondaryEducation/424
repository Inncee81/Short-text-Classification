i'm in trouble i want to be in the academy of finance for an internship but it will lower my gpa confused i'm entering th grade ok so there is this special program at my high school called teh academy of finance i am thinking of joining it the requirement is that i think maybe an interview but the problem is that i also have to take a bunch of business related required courses in order to get in the academy and therefore get a cool internship as well as taking a more prestigious co op course in my senior year problem the electives are and will lower my gpa a bit then i have this other guy who is my competitor who is taking both pap algebra and geometry pap at the same year and since pap courses are they will really raise his average and mine will lower as i have to take a bcis course this year in order to get into the academy my question is is the academy good and actually worth sacrificing a high gpa or should i forget about the academy and go all out gpa and give that guy a run for his money if i'm in the academy there is no way i can become valedictorian with all the business courses that are required my gpa will significantly lower but if don't do the academy i can still take some business courses miss the internship but i have a way better chance to become valedictorian salutarian higher gpa overall what should i do should i copy the ohter guy and take pap geometry and algebra or do you think i am biting off more than i can chew and suffocate last year in th grade i had all pap classes and band and my lowest ever report card grade was a and my final yearly lowest grade was a and two of my classes i got averages in for the whole year do you think i should double up on math courses or do the academy of finance and just let the other guy become valedictorian as i heard he is extremley smart as well grrrr i'm having such a dilema and the counselor didn't help much either first off you got to go with what will make you happy if grades are your goal go for that if this business is fun for you and a passion go for that if you are wondering about college i would think the internship will be far better than being valedictorian once you are in college your high school gpa will not mean a thing but the experience from an internship will get you alot farther plus if you get a gpa on the regular scale it will look better than a weighted scale gpa when i was in high school i had the opportunity to do college courses they lowered my gpa and i was not valedictorian i am in the honors program in my college and doing great grades are not the end all beat all in life it will be your experience that makes the difference go for what makes you happy oh just make sure that this program will still give you all the prep you need for a college education sometimes these programs are meant for people that are not meant to go to college and prepares them for a job right out of highschool Education in Germany Education in Romania High school Law school Education in the People's Republic of China College admissions Affirmative action Phillips Exeter Academy Advanced Placement Program Secondary education in the United States Education in Taiwan SAT National Certificate of Educational Achievement United States Academic Decathlon College Master's degree __cole Polytechnique Education in Hong Kong Dr. Michael M.
