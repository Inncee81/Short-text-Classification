private school help well next tuesday will be my first day ever at private school i'm in the th grade and this will be my rd school i don't know if i'll adjust perfectly i have to go to church every friday i have to wear uniforms and if you want to be on a sports team you don't need to try out please if you've been at private school explain what it will be like for a public schooler like me private school will undoubtedly seem a little stricter and i do mean seem when i made the switch i was going from a montessori very loose private to a parochial very much like what you describe school montessori schools are very loose in that you don't have specific class times and you don't need to ask to use the bathrooms and you often call your teachers by their first names not so in private school and it sounds like you also have that parochial label too just expect a bit more rules the uniforms really aren't that bad i don't think they really solve the problem of kids wearing label and or gang clothes but i do think they serve a purpose to identify the school you attend everyone knew which school had the red navy and white in my neighborhood it's something to get used to as for the other it's not all that different you learn the same things you do the same things as with all new things it will take time to adjust and no one honestly adjusts perfectly i think that you might end up liking it to your surprise Montessori method Homeschooling Education in the United States Education in Japan Theory of conduct Private school Culture of the United States Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Aesthetic Realism Social rule Harrow School Education in Germany Marching band French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Jesuit College Preparatory School 2000 Australian Grand Prix Miami-Dade County Public Schools Fecal incontinence Doug School choice Code: Lyoko College Lynbrook High School New York City Subway nomenclature Brown v.
