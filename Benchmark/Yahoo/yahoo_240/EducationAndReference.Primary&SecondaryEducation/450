does anyone have tips for high school im going into a very catty all girl school any tips for getting through the first year also there is this guy going to my brother school he is very clingy to me and i dont like him at all how should i deal with that as for high school make sure that you get into a good group of friends right away you want to be able to focus on your education and you want to find friends who have the same level of dedication if there are any extra curricular clubs at your school i suggest participating they are a great way to meet people with similar interests and look great on college applications one important thing is to be confident in yourself find friends who build up your confidence and don't get caught up in what anybody else says be proud to be different as you go through your high school career you will find that you need a strong support team to help you through the rough times and to celebrate with you during your proudest moments if your friends don't support you then they aren't your friends if your friends influence you to do bad things then they aren't your friends friends end up being one of the most important things in high school because they are your support staff you should be able to call any of your friends at am in the morning because something terrible has happened as long as you don't do it too often if your friends lie to you or hide things form you or if they don't make the effort to spend time with you then forget about them they aren't your friends also this is a time when you're going to want to stop talking to your parents don't do it your parents most likely have a lot of wisdom and they'll be happy to share it you don't have to tell them everything but if you tell them about the major and some minor things going on in your life they'll appreciate it a lot and i've found from experience moms are almost always right as for the boy ask yourself why he is clingy to you are you just friends does he want to be more than friends try to lessen the amount of time you spend with him without being obvious that you're trying to get rid of him if he asks to hang out say that you were looking forward to watching a movie with your parents tonight or some other rare family activity you can also plan to go out with only your female friends and if he asks to come along you can say sorry girls only another solution bury yourself in your studies and say that you need to focus on your education first i wish you luck on entering high school it is a difficult and rewarding period of your life Theory of conduct Social rule Humphrey Bogart Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Good Morning, Vietnam Shaggy dog story One Tree Hill (TV series) RuneScape quests About a Boy Milton H.
