was i right in my freshman year in high school i had a teacher who was known as a pervert and to be very creepy during the first quarter i realized he had taken a special interest in me giving me extra credit on everything starting to talk to me about personal stuff at my locker he stared at me during lectures and he always sat me in the front of the room next to his desk well during the end of the quarter he had the class spilt up into partners and he had me and my partner work in the front of the classroom when my partner wasn't looking he started massaging my shoulder but made it so no one else could see i leaned forward and he stopped but it really freaked me out was i right to tell my parents who later talked to the principle about it and the teacher got in big trouble by the way i was only don't worry you did the right thing no one has the right to touch you without permission you have nothing to worry about so relax Shaggy dog story One Tree Hill (TV series) Swingout Richard Feynman Milton H.
