how do i study since school is about to start i am going to be studying and doing homework how do i study but keep on studying without finding an excuse or getting distracted yes i already have a study are it's a desk right next to my bed please just answer my question a desk right by your bed is the first temptation to distracting your study habits make sure that you are not tired when you study there i agree with some of the other answers go to the library that is the best place to study because that is what that enviornment is for aside from checking out books or using them for reference there are people that can help you answer questions if you need help too the school that i attend has small private rooms that you can study without any distractions it only has a light desk and chair sometimes people passing by you is enough to make you lose your train of thought especially a hottie take a break every minutes if you do not the information will start to run together and do not study like subjects back to back otherwise it will run together too stretch your feet use the bathroom etc if you use more than minutes then your mind will wonder to something else and you will get tempted to do something else where the mind leads the body will follow if you need some background noise get a cd player or ipod with a headset and get some music that does not have a lot of lyrics on it personally i listen to either classical chamber music or smooth jazz you may like something else but it helps me to stay awake and focused lyrics will have me focusing on the lyrics instead of the work and i'll end up distracting myself and someone else use an empty classroom or a break area with very little noise and or students and traffic if you are not expecting an important call turn off your cell phone sometimes your friends will call you and before you know it you will have burned an hour of study time let them know what your study times are and let them know that your cell will be off check your calls during your breaks but do not call back until after study time just in case there was an emergency keep the same designated study spot and time if you can this will prepare you mentally and physically for studying get a study buddy or join a study group who is just as dedicated to getting his her work done as you are not only will you get your work done but you will gain a different perspective on what you are learning and you could possibly retain the information better the bonus is you will be less likely to stand a study buddy up if you know they are counting on you to be there thus keeping you on track try to start studying right after your classes if you can the information you learned will be fresher in your mind and it will be easier to carry on the thread on to your study time if your schedule is full remember to include and set aside a block of time specifically for studying and treat it like one of your classes this was the one idea that kept me on track and helped me retain good grades once you train yourself to study it will be like second nature don't let parties and hanging out be your priority because all through out college you will have plenty of time for that the person who dumps on you for studying is usually the same one who will be struggling the most during finals do not forget to remind yourself why you are in college in the first place good luck Social rule Columbine High School massacre Theory of conduct Milton H.
