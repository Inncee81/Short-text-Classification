im going into my first year of middle school any tips th grade was pretty cool for me you get to do a whole lot of new stuff like you get lockers and different teachers depending on your school you don't get recess which wasn't a big deal to anybody in my school here are a couple tips that i could think of dont run to your classes there is no need for you to run at all unless you are extremely late running everywhere will just make you seem more like a franticky little th grader don't act like your all that just because you're in middle school now you really aren't any of that don't smart off to the older kids or try to say something to make you look smart or funny you may be smart in your grade but most of the older kids are smarter than you and don't remind them of the rules or tell them not to be mean or anything then they really get annoyed mostly if you stay quiet around the older kids occasionally talking about how you didn't like this teacher or something then they will like you and take you under their wing don't try to stand up to any of the older kids there really aren't any bullies that take your lunch money or whatever but some kids do like to use words to get to you if someone is bothering you don't try to act tough and stand up to them go tell a teacher or write a statement in the dean's office have fun and try not to get involved in a lot of drama trust me theres a whole ton of drama in middle school and if you steer clear of the drama queens you'll be happy you're only like years old you dont need to start dating yet you may think you're mature enough but you're really not you have plenty of time in high school middle school dating is really just some kids who say they are going out but really all they do is walk around occasionally holding hands but they never actually go on dates well there you go that's all the stuff i could think of that annoyed me about th graders last year but that was just that particular th grade class they usually aren't that terribly annoying th graders will be ok with you cuz they were you last year but th graders seem to get more agitated about th graders so just stay out of their hair have fun Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Saved by the Bell Recurring South Park characters Social rule Humphrey Bogart The Fairly OddParents 2000 Australian Grand Prix EastEnders Doug Shaggy dog story Azumanga Daioh Kodocha Codename: Kids Next Door Recess (TV series) The Adventures of Pete & Pete Theory of conduct Murdock-Portal Elementary School Poker jargon Columbine High School massacre Education in the United States The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Garfield Great Teacher Onizuka Teachers (film) The Ashlee Simpson Show Russian joke Trailer Park Boys Bully Milton H.
