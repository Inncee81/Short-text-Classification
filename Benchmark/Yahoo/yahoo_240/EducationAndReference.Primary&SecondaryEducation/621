high school first day im really nervous how am i supposed to act i know i know be yourself but this kind of thing is different plus ill probably end up wearing way too much makeup trying to get myself to look perfect even though normally i stick with some mascara and foundation and sometimes a pretty lip gloss also all of my friends are really pretty and im sure there will be even prettier girls in high school how can i keep up with looking as good as they do everyday and how should i do my hair please help with everything prefferably people who have been through this kind of thing already we have uniforms btw and i come from a really small school this high school is realy big plus has soo much more people in it how do i make a good impression i went through the same thing when i started hs after the first week of school i got sick of trying to make myself look perfect everyday so most days i only wear mascara and i pull my hair up no one really cares don't over do it stick to your normal make up routine don't start getting up at am to do your hair and make up you'll fall asleep during class and thats not good you want to look like yourself not someone else for your hair do something that will stay all day and that is comfortable if it annoys you to wear your hair down then don't wear it down to school also factor gym class into planning your hair style you want it to still look nice after gym i'm not sure if your school makes you shower after class or not my school doesn't so you need to quickly fix it after class and go if you are nervous about classes make sure you go to the freshman orentation if your school offers one it'll give you a chance to walk the halls and find your classes without a bunch of older kids shoving past you also do your homework it helps so much and it really doesn't take that much time another thing don't do drugs or drink it only hurts you finally relax high school is great you'll be fine and your friends will be there with you Kodocha Social rule Humphrey Bogart Shaggy dog story Urinary incontinence Theory of conduct The Adventures of Pete & Pete EastEnders Pok__mon Live!
