spelling bee problem i'm going into th grade and i am usually a straight a student in th grade i wasn't in the spelling bee because i was point off i was very close to it and i would have done it if i had my friend had said no which she did but my teacher said that there was someone else liar so this year i don't want to be in the spellling bee but still mantain my position as straight a student the teachers said that you can't say no but my friend got to because her mom called the teacher and talked to it but my other friend didn't want to and did the same thing but still had to do it help if there is any activity extra than the course work and it isn't part of a grade or anything then the teacher cannot require you to do it if this isn't an activity for class then it is legally impossible for her to require you to do a spelling be that you do not want to do you have a right to refuse just because you are in a free country Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Education in the United States Graduate school Grade (education) Education Shaggy dog story Jumpstart 3rd Grade Hey Arnold!
