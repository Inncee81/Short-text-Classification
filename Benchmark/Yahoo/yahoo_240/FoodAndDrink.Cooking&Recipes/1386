how do you deal with cooking w hot weather especially if you don't have air conditioning by the kitchen do you cook a lot when you have hot weather i know some people are lucky to have central ac but not me with the hot and humid weather we've been having i just don't feel like cooking and making the kitchen even hotter than it already is i wish i had central ac but i only have a wall ac unit in a bedroom on the first floor so it's hard for the cool ac air to reach the kitchen i do use a fan but hopefully i'll have a ceiling fan installed in the kitchen in the future sometimes cold dinners are the best on days like that our favorites are sandwich nights and nacho nights for sandwich nights i simply put bread mayo lunch meat tuna salad tomato slices lettuce mustard peanut butter and jelly on the table and everyone makes their own dinner sandwich on nacho nights i put chips sour cream diced tomato salsa cheese refried beans heated in the microwave so it doesn't heat the kitchen onion olives and avocado chunks on the table and everyone heaps their plates as they wish Hot dog Hamburger Cuisine of Denmark Sandwich Jewish cuisine Breakfast Barbecue Japanese cuisine D__ner kebab Salad Peruvian cuisine Cuisine of the Philippines McDonald's Pizza German cuisine Chili con carne MRE Nachos French cuisine Sauce In-N-Out Burger Cuisine of the Southern United States Cuisine of Argentina Kitchen Cuisine of Brazil Cha chaan teng Bagel Bread Burger Gyros Food Meal Cajun cuisine Pea soup Cuisine of Singapore Bengali cuisine Peanut butter and jelly sandwich Soul food HVAC Soup French fries Ketchup Serbian cuisine Grilled cheese sandwich Peanut butter Cuisine of Vietnam Curry Potato chips Fast-food restaurant Cuisine of Africa Cuisine of Turkey Potato salad Dim sum Cookware and bakeware Solar power Russian cuisine Cuisine of Greece Swedish cuisine Air conditioning Serial comma Fish and chips Domesticated turkey Italian cuisine Potato Korean cuisine Tea (meal) Food preservation British cuisine Tamale Ice cream Hell's Kitchen (television) Cuisine of the United States Tomato Cincinnati chili Sushi Dumpling The Star Wars Holiday Special A&W Restaurants Ramen Coffee Cookie Gumbo French toast Caesar salad Steak n Shake Jelly Hot pot Cheesesteak Mayonnaise Cuisine of Malaysia
