old timer cooks how do make a apple crisp my recipe is the same as mommyof 's w the following exceptions i use only a slightly rounded teaspoon of cinnamon i add teaspoon of nutmeg teaspoon of cayenne pepper and tablespoon molasses reasons i prefer a more subtle cinnamon flavor i like nutmeg and molasses and the cayenne pepper perks the flavors without adding heat i also find it easier to mix the flour and spices first then cut in the butter then mix in the brown sugar and molasses finally stirring in the oats i use smart balance's regular margarine for health reasons and find it tastes as good as butter and better than regular margarine your choice of apple will make or break your recipe as mommyof suggested the braeburn is a good choice any of the johnathons winesaps and pippins are good choices the gravenstien and liberty are a good choice many consider the granny smith and lodi good choices but i do not particularly care for either as their apple taste is weak to me i've tried red golden delicious fuji gala and several of the pink flesh apples their taste is just ok to me but the texture after cooking is much too soft i prefer to chew the apple rather than mush it with my tongue regardless of the apple variety insure that the apple is ripe enough for the apple taste to develop but not ripe enough for the flesh to soften a variation to consider for tots and ole timers i have an acquaintance in a care facility who has lost her teeth and refuses to deal w dentures but she loves apple crisp so i mince the apples and use instant oatmeal in hers the same as i did for my kids when they were teething Apple Halva Apple pie Bread Jewish cuisine Tea Curry Soul food Chili con carne Cajun cuisine Cuisine of the Philippines Cheese Barbecue Ketchup Chocolate Coffee Rice pudding Potato Vinegar Mayonnaise Idli Wine Tooth Cider Bengali cuisine Hot dog Recipe Cooking weights and measures Cuisine of Brazil Cinnamon Haggis Black pepper Porridge Toffee Ramen Cuisine of Denmark Breakfast Butter Martini cocktail Alice B.
