why is my cake not rising whenever i bake my cake does not get spongy sometimes it gets slightly hard sometimes it is slightly moist but never really spongy here are a few details my oven i have an old fashioned round oven which has a glass top i was setting it at about centigrade it takes really long to bake something like hrs the glass generally forms water droplets on the inside which sometimes drip into the cake can you please tell me where all i am going wrong my cakes never do rise perfectly except once when i baked it for an hour i have recently got the oven checked by the manufacturer the description of your oven confuses me the only oven i know of that is a stand alone round baking oven is the one found in the eastern mediterranean there are likely other areas where the oven is common these ovens can be either gas or electric i've never seen one with a glass top but they may exist these ovens use the celsius centigrade scale your setting of centigrade is too hot for baking a cake the correct setting should be about degrees centigrade celsius if the oven is operating properly there is no plausible reason for it not to properly bake a cake so you must be doing something incorrectly your comments that it takes a long time hours to bake a cake and that water droplets form on top of the lid and drip onto the cake hints that you may be trying to bake your cake in a covered dutch oven sometimes referred to as a french oven a dutch oven is a pot about inches in diameter and about inches deep if you are using this to bake your cake you are using the wrong baking container you should be using a cake baking pan these pans are usually about inches in diameter and inches deep or so there are other shapes and sizes cakes are generally baked in open top containers so that moisture can escape readily the other possibility i discern is that you maybe be using a bead making machine such as the dak which has a round baking chamber bread making machines do not lend themselves well to baking breads with a sugar content as high as the sugar content in cake batters and they are not designed to bake a thin batter such as a cake batter they are designed for lower moisture doughs hopefully something in the foregoing treatise helps you solve your problem or at least gets you on the track to solving your problem Cookware and bakeware Cookie Pancake Microwave oven Tofu XML Japanese cuisine Pita Explosive material Coffee Vacuum tube Cuisine of Denmark Fiberglass Doughnut Flour Jewish cuisine Water Internal ballistics Thermal power station Menstrual cup Idli Muffin Strap-on dildo Stove Hot dog Barbecue German cuisine Glass Maple syrup Slow cooker Chocolate Wok Carburetor Violin Cartridge (firearms) M16 (rifle) Screw Chicago-style pizza Diamond Dumpling Drill bit Dairy Bacon Gas metal arc welding Shewbread Town gas Amateur telescope making Water (molecule) Deep frying Degree Celsius Casting Textile manufacturing Mooncake Sauna Tea Classics Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Eyepiece Tortilla Pasta Carbon dioxide Fire fighting Compact disc Solar power Bengali cuisine Cake Fish and chips Diamond cut Nuclear power Breadmaker Inkjet printer Volcano Incandescent light bulb Cuisine of the Philippines Bong Tuff Fujian tea ceremony Sundial Opportunity rover Printed circuit board Pachypodium baronii Geology of the Moon Cuisine of the Southern United States Domesticated turkey Vacuum Hydroponics Solar cell
