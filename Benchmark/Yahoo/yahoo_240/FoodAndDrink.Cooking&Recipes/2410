i have a half pound of snow peas what can i make with them i have no clue so any ideas would be appreciated treat the first snow peas of the season as a real delicacy steam the pods and serve as you would asparagus with a little melted butter or a drizzle of olive oil to serve as an accompaniment boil the prepared snow peas for minutes until just tender they are best eaten with light dishes like chicken or fish so that their flavour isn t swamped raw snow peas are lovely as a crudite served with hummus or guacamole stir fry snow peas on their own as a side dish or make a meal by adding other vegetables such as baby sweetcorn or mushrooms or with tofu or chicken in a stir fry make sure the pods are dry before you add them to the hot pan otherwise they will spit toss in a sprinkling of sesame seeds to serve use snow peas raw in green salads of leaves and herbs mange tout are good for adding colour to mixed salads they also work with well with fresh fruity flavours so try them as part of a salad with sliced grapefruit or pineapple this isn't exactly one of the snow pea recipes but it's a brilliant idea nonetheless add a handful of mange tout to children's lunch boxes they love the sweet crunchiness and it all helps towards making sure they get their five a day Pea Cuisine of Laos Cantonese cuisine Korean cuisine Hamburger Breakfast French cuisine Cuisine of Malaysia Bengali cuisine Jewish cuisine Bread Curry Pizza Sandwich Peruvian cuisine French fries Dim sum Cuisine of the Southern United States Cuisine of Thailand Salad Chili con carne Fish and chips Soup Cuisine of Cambodia Bacon Gumbo Tea Cajun cuisine Cuisine of Brazil Cuisine of Africa Roman eating and drinking Russian cuisine Egg (food) McDonald's Dumpling Plantain Porridge Potato Vegetarian cuisine Barbecue Kebab Pancake Ramen Cuisine of Greece Hot dog Pea soup Cha chaan teng Nabemono Cuisine of Vietnam American Chinese cuisine Sauce Common bean Food Kelantan Risotto D__ner kebab Sushi Asparagus Deep frying Tempura Maize Ice cream Rice pudding Paella British cuisine Canadian Chinese cuisine Wasabi Cuisine of Argentina Domesticated turkey Chicken soup Recipe Mayonnaise Hummus Veganism Swedish cuisine Chinese cuisine Japanese tea ceremony Laksa Stir frying Halva Food preservation Wiener schnitzel Meal Roux Potato salad Coffee Maple syrup Cuisine of Myanmar Chocolate Bagel
