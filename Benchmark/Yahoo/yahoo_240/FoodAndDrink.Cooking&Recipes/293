does this sound good shrimp and garlic with stir fry vegetables over rice wine well maybe a few gin and tonics lol any alterations or ideas to snap it up keep it simple don't make the shrimp compete with too many other flavors and textures maybe onions and mushrooms or onions and some kind of hot pepper like jalapenos or thai chiles if you like it hot you may want to give the onions a little pre cook to get rid of some of the volatile compounds and start to bring out the sweetness you could go classic on the seasoning like garlic butter and a splash of white wine or aim for something more oriental with soy sauce ginger or thai basil because of the variety of flavors in a stir fry it needs a strong central flavor like beef to anchor it with shrimp stir fry can turn into a fishing expedition with the flavors and textures clashing and your guests eating things just to get them out of the way as for gin and tonic the anti malarial properties of the quinine will enable you to pass out properly outdoors without fear of mosquitoes and the preservative properties of the gin will keep you young and vital Japanese cuisine Cuisine of Denmark Korean cuisine Curry Tofu Cajun cuisine Cuisine of Laos German cuisine Cuisine of Thailand Bengali cuisine Hamburger Cuisine of the Philippines Cuisine of Malaysia Ramen Cuisine of Singapore Cuisine of Brazil Soul food Risotto Cuisine of Cambodia Cuisine of Africa Barbecue Hot dog Peruvian cuisine Pizza Breakfast Dumpling Stir frying Cuisine of Vietnam Porridge Chicken soup Chile pepper Cuisine of the Southern United States Chili con carne Pickling Kelantan Cuisine of Greece Soup Nabemono French fries Taiwanese cuisine Dim sum Jiaozi Hot pot Sauce Gumbo Ketchup Basic taste Polish cuisine Sushi Food Donburi Kimchi Russian cuisine Pancake Fried rice Kebab Mayonnaise Coffee Udon Cuisine of Turkey Common bean Fish sauce Satay D__ner kebab Soba Wine Roman eating and drinking Gin Tea Martini cocktail McDonald's Ice cream Capsicum Cincinnati chili Ginger Domesticated turkey Soy sauce Bread Garlic Chocolate Kung pao chicken Pasta Apple Meat analogue Tempura Idli Cuisine of Canada Vegetarian cuisine British cuisine Chinese cuisine Sichuan Pepper Rice congee
