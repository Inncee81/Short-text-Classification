how do i keep my quesadillas hot without them getting soft i want to have a bunch of friends over and serve chicken quesadillas i usually make them for my husband and kids one quesadilla at a time i've tried making them and putting them in the oven to keep warm but they get dried out and if i cover them they get soft it's possible that the only way to make them is one at a time but i am hoping that someone has a better way place them in a dry hot skillet and heat on each side addition place them in the oven with a pan of water on the bottom rack the steam will help keep them from drying out and they won't get soggy Cookware and bakeware Bread Quesadilla Wok Tortilla Steam engine Tofu Sauna Japanese cuisine Barbecue Toast Diving suit Idli Cuisine of Malaysia Heat Cuisine of Brazil Cuisine of the Philippines Cajun cuisine Coffee Baking Roast beef Fire fighting Hot spring Pancake Microwave oven Tea Renewable energy Kitchen Solar power Stove Baked Alaska Pizza Sento Hot dog Sandwich Fried chicken Upholstery Tlingit Souffl__ Bento Jewish cuisine Instant coffee Seismic retrofit Solar box cooker Cantonese cuisine Thermal power station Brewery Mexican cuisine Dishwasher Death Valley National Park Poker jargon Hydrotherapy Baby bottle Hangi Rice French fries Dosa Sterilization (microbiology) Soup Cuisine of Denmark Toaster Slow cooker Cookie Geothermal power Textile manufacturing Leather Yoghurt Refrigerator Bacon Mummy Plaster Dutch oven German cuisine Plantain The Critic Manicure Ramen Curry Ironing HVAC Town gas Mattress Flax Korean cuisine Furnace Pasta Carbon dioxide Chipotle Mexican Grill Dim sum Cuisine of Laos Soldering Casting Climate of the United Kingdom Scrambled eggs Motor oil Sulfuric acid Houseplant Hamburger Precipitation (meteorology) Green tea
