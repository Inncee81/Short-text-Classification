roasting pan instead of baking dish i'm trying to make lasagna and discovered i don't have a baking dish i have a pan for making brownies a glass cake pan or a roasting pan will any of these do also i'm only cooking for two so i don't need a huge pan i used the metal brownie pan and it was perfect thanks we make ours in a glass cake pan all the time just turn the heat down degrees and it will work great we also use an or inch square pan for smaller quantites it that is what you mean by a pan for making brownies that should work well too cooking time will be less of course for the smaller size so check it a little sooner than normal bert Cookware and bakeware Baking Pancake Cookie Chicago-style pizza Bread Pizza Wok Cold Stone Creamery Jewish cuisine Cooking Barbecue Coffee Bacon French cuisine Cuisine of Denmark Cuisine of the Southern United States German cuisine Cuisine of the Philippines Japanese cuisine Vegetarian cuisine Chocolate Bloody Stupid Johnson Potato Baked Alaska Roast beef Recipe Tortilla Cartridge (firearms) Blood sausage Roman eating and drinking Cuisine of the United States Cajun cuisine Meatball Stock (food) Tofu Muffin British cuisine Solar power Alice B.
