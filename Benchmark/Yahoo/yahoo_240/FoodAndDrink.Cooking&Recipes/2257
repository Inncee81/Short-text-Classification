do you actually put the pizza on the oven rack i was going to cook a frozen pizza but it said to put it directly on the oven rack am i actually supposed to put the pizza in without a pan it seems a little absurd to me if so how do you get the pizza off of the rack thanks if you like crispy crust you can put it directly on the oven rack place a piece of foil on the second rack below the one you put the pizza on to catch melted cheese that drips off remove the pizza with a spatula slide it onto a pan when it's finished cooking if you don't prefer a crisper crust you can cook the pizza on a cookie sheet both ways are fine i have a pizza pan that's full of tiny holes to make the crust crispy without placing it directly on the rack all these ways are fine enjoy your pizza Pizza Bread Cookware and bakeware Bacon Pizza Hut Bagel Tofu Cookie Chicago-style pizza D__ner kebab Cuisine of the Philippines Microwave oven Cheese Jewish cuisine Pop-Tarts Brewery Okonomiyaki Stove Cuisine of Argentina Pie Peanut butter Peking Duck Wok Professional wrestling holds Souffl__ Barbecue Glacier Printed circuit board Cremation Pasta In-N-Out Burger Cuisine of Denmark Pancake Food Japanese cuisine McDonald's Baked Alaska Fast-food restaurant 19-inch rack Casting French fries Chuck E.
