pork chop recipes i want to make porkchops but i make them often and i am kind of bord i love onion and ushrooms so anything incorporating the two would be good ive tried broiling them with salt pepper garlic salt ive tried lemon pepper ive fried them a couple of ways and i would ike to maybe fry them with onion and mushroom or bake them i am open to any other seasonings and techniques thanks in advance logan heres an easy way the incorporates both of your favorites put the pork chops in a slow cooker crockpot and mix a package of onion soup mix with about c of water pour over the pork chops and turn heat on medium until the prok chops are cook through probably about hours the slow cooker i use has temperature settings and i put it on for hours after the pork chops are done turn the slow cooker off now take a package of fresh mushroom and cut them up you can use canned too but freah are much better pour about tbsp of olive oil into a saute pan and saute the mushrooms and chopped onion season with salt and pepper to taste and a few dashes of worstichere sauce now add enough flour to make a gravy you may need to add a little bit of milk to the gravy to thin it out it just depends on how you like it put the pork chops on a plate and pour your mushroom and onion gravy over this goes great served over steamed rice and works best for me with boneless centercut pork chops if you use breakfast chops which are much thinner just cut down the cooking time happy eating and i hope you enjoy Cantonese cuisine Tofu Ramen Chili con carne French fries Jewish cuisine Korean cuisine Cuisine of Singapore Bengali cuisine Bread German cuisine French cuisine Pancake Pizza Cuisine of Vietnam Dumpling Peruvian cuisine Kelantan MRE Fish and chips Cuisine of Malaysia Russian cuisine Meatball Cookware and bakeware Polish cuisine Breakfast Soup Idli Recipe Porridge Cuisine of Laos Cuisine of Africa Vegetarian cuisine Chowder Gazpacho Dosa Satay Kebab D__ner kebab American Chinese cuisine Pickling Tamale Cooking Curry Roman eating and drinking Cuisine of Cambodia Ketchup Rice pudding Cha chaan teng Gumbo Cuisine of Greece Onion Potato chips Mayonnaise Cincinnati chili Sauce Roux Coffee Wiener schnitzel Laksa Roast beef Cuisine of Turkey Cheesesteak Salad Potato pancakes Cantharellus Brewery Sichuan Pepper Tea Nabemono Slow cooker Rice Hakka cuisine Sushi Kentucky Fried Chicken Domesticated turkey Taco Canadian Chinese cuisine Meatloaf Hot pot Miso soup
