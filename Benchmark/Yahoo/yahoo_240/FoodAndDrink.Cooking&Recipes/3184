marinades in a crock pot i use my crock pot alot and was wondering if you could just put chicken breasts in the crock pot with a marinade if you use straight marinade in your usual manner you might find that the chicken is a little too strongly flavored other than that no reason why not the food will be cooking for a good long while the flavors will mingle with your food i don't see it as any different than adding seasonings if it comes out too strong add a little liquid water stock etc the only thing i'd look out for is marinades with much sugar honey or vinegar the higher concentrations of those especially if undiluted by water might have some drawbacks to the taste or texture of your food Barbecue Chicken soup Slow cooker Cantonese cuisine Vinegar Japanese cuisine Rum Gumbo Coffee Honey Jewish cuisine Cheese Ramen Food preservation Cajun cuisine Hot pot Cookware and bakeware Chocolate Chili con carne Culinary mustard Cholent Tea Mayonnaise Brewery Recipe Glycerin Soul food Cuisine of Brazil Roman eating and drinking Bread Stock (food) Cuisine of Laos Soup Sauerkraut Peruvian cuisine Cuisine of Denmark Pot Noodle Anchovy Apple Curry Alcoholic beverage Sushi Domesticated turkey Ham Cuisine of Malaysia Halva Seitan Cuisine of Greece Solvent Fish and chips Sugar Basic taste Acetic acid Stir frying Food additive Food Ice cream Beer Veganism Soy milk Oyster Sake Espresso MRE Nabemono Rice congee Korean cuisine Single malt Scotch Bengali cuisine Idli Scotch whisky Poker jargon Genericized trademark Kosher foods Rainbow Wine Vodka Soy protein Dumpling Beef noodle soup Ketchup Essential oil Chewing gum Irish stew Japanese tea ceremony Soy sauce Sugar substitute Pressure cooking Roux Street food Breakfast Common bean Cuisine of the Southern United States Fish sauce Apple pie Fondue
