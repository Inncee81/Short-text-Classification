kraft mac and cheese ingreidents which ingrediant do i add first chesse milk or butter whats the order and how can i make it thicker without cream cheese you know what i never thought about that before lol that is a good question silly as some may think it sounds especially if you are not that skilled in the kitchen i have a few friends who dont know how to cook much so i am very understanding to your question i thought about it and this is my personal opinion i would add the butter first because once you add the milk it will cook down the pasta and the butter might not melt properly or distribute evenly after i have made sure all the butter was melted evenly throughout the pasta i would add the milk if i were to add the powder cheese mix next it wouldnt break down properly but clump because their is no liquid to break it up and that is why i would add the milk next and last of all the cheese mix make sure you mix all of this very well sometimes i would also add a little grated parmesan cheese i hope my advice helps you i am years old and my mother had me cooking since the age of i was the first year old that owned her own carving knife lol but my mom was there to guide me on how to use it right and to respect the knife as a tool and not a toy she even got me a small stool so i could reach the stove i sure miss her at times but she remains in my heart and i am thankful for all she taught me so i am glad if i can pass along some of her tips recipes and words of wisdom Cheese Kraft Dinner Tofu Ice cream Chili con carne Dairy Pasta Cuisine of Denmark Butter Japanese cuisine Dairy product Fecal incontinence Pizza Cake Soup Genericized trademark Curry French cuisine Food Recipe Jewish cuisine M__m__lig__ Cuisine of Brazil RuneScape quests French fries D__ner kebab Breakfast Cajun cuisine Tea Idli German cuisine B__chamel sauce Kosher foods Spaghetti Scrambled eggs Risotto Vegetarian cuisine Fondue MRE Coconut milk Glass Casting Bengali cuisine Trans fat Rum Hamburger Gumbo Plastic Peanut butter Cheesecake Roux Omega-3 fatty acid Gnocchi Rice pudding Biscuit Muesli Cha chaan teng Macaroni Coffee Alfredo Sauce In-N-Out Burger Heath bar Australian words Halva Knife Yoghurt Schlock Mercenary Meatloaf Gas metal arc welding Soul food Kashrut Ricotta cheese Breastfeeding Cookware and bakeware Veganism Joke 10cc British cuisine Barbecue Hot dog Sushi Asiago cheese Microwave oven Soy milk
