how can a hacksaw blade be baked into the middle of a cake i'm trying to bake a hacksaw blade into a cake for my friend of mine that has alot of time on his hands the problem is that the blade keeps settling to the bottom of the pan how do i prepare this tasty dessert so that the blade is in the middle and out of sight you can try wrapping the hacksaw blade in some waxed paper first which ought to create enough air pockets around it to keep it from sinking to the bottom of the cake pan or you can bake two layers and conceal the blade in the frosting between the layers and not bake it into the layers at all since you seem to have a problem with it sinking just tell your buddy to be careful taking that first bite ouch does this make me an accessory lol Cake Bread Cookie Pancake Cookware and bakeware Pizza Flour Chicago-style pizza Knife Cheesecake Baking Pita Casting Japanese cuisine Blade (comics) Coffee Baklava Tank Maple syrup Bagel Cuisine of the Philippines Halloween Dim sum Wok Cuisine of Denmark Brewery Woodworking Baked Alaska Passover Mattress Mooncake Saw Tofu Cuisine of Singapore Jewish cuisine Ice cream Sin City Chocolate Manicure Dumpling Apple Twinkie Muffin Trapping Palindrome Chicken Axe Minas Gerais Bengali cuisine Sword German cuisine IPod Doughnut Cuisine of Malaysia Canoe Fan (implement) Polish cuisine Robot Master Kim Possible Sword making Traditional animation Barbecue Sling (weapon) Bacon Equine conformation Hot dog Tea (meal) Dairy Kugel Stollen Paint Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II Bassoon Harp Sugar Vermicompost Rice pudding Fruit Cocaine Blade Flax Toa Fish and chips Blade (film) Tea Classics Frost EIA-708 Cha chaan teng Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Zerg First Battle of the Atlantic Sushi Cuisine of Austria McDonald's USS Tang (SS-306) Tractor Klingon Hemp Pocket knife Mokume-gane
