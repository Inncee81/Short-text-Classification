any way to fix recipe after adding too much cinnamon i followed the only peach butter recipe i could find and boy it's overwhelming with cinnamon flavor so much so you can't taste the peaches much is there any fix to reduce to the flavor i know wishful thinking right thanks the only way i know how to fix that is to make more peach butter make another batch without any cinnamon and when it's finished mix the two batches together you'll cut the cinnamon flavor in half Rum Bread Butter Halva Rice pudding Curry Gumbo Vodka Wine Gatorade Barbecue Cheese Cider Baklava Chocolate Ramen Coffee Tea Bagel Apple pie Ketchup Cinnamon Tofu Cuisine of Brazil Cold Stone Creamery Alice B.
