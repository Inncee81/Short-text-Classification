i neeed help to make a home made chocolate frosting so i want to make this cake but to realize i have no frosting so can you please help me find a recipe for chocolate frosting please thanks alot i for got to add that i dont have a microwave ours broke were getting a new one soon first of all i don't use accurate measurements because it's no fun that way just follow this and you'll get the idea so like get about a third of a block of butter get it soft by putting it in the microwave for couple of seconds or in the oven on low get a bag of icing sugar mix in about a cup to start into the soft butter add some milk try whipping it with an egg beater to get some air into the stuff or perhaps just a wooden spoon whatever at the same time put about a cup of semi sweet chocolate chips in a pot and heat on the stove very low so that the chips melt add a tablespoon of butter to help develop a good consistency add about cup of sugar and a teaspoon of vanilla extract mix this up until it's smooth add a little water or milk if it's too course i don't care how much once that is done you can set it aside back to the plain butter icing once you have the proper consistency between the butter icing sugar and milk and you have an amount you consider to be enough to cover your cake then you can add the chocolate to it mixing it thoroughly if it's too thin or watery just add some more icing sugar let it cool down a bit before you spread it or it will make a mess of the top of your cake that's all Chocolate Cake Coffee Cookie Tofu Bread Microwave oven Tea Breakfast Halva Pancake Yoghurt Rice pudding Cooking weights and measures Cuisine of Brazil Bagel Turkish coffee Dairy Pizza Japanese cuisine Idli Butter Cuisine of the Philippines Cuisine of Denmark Cold Stone Creamery Milk Jewish cuisine Cocoa Chili con carne Chocolate Salty Balls Cheesecake Drill bit Soft drink Oreo Flax Peanut butter Rum M&M's Cookware and bakeware Barbecue Sandwich Bacon Tortilla Milkshake Soup Dim sum Confectionery Kraft Dinner Pop-Tarts Plastic Marshmallow Espresso Porridge Heath bar Food Sugar beet Recipe Brewery Mayonnaise Kitchen Cha chaan teng Spoon Wine Gatorade Custard Hong Kong-style milk tea Russian cuisine Apple Enceladus (moon) Kit Kat Conker's Bad Fur Day Poker jargon Tooth Cuisine of Singapore Bengali cuisine Magnesium Hamster In-N-Out Burger Souffl__ Alice B.
