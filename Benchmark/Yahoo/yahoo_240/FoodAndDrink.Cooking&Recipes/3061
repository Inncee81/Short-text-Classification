baking crispy homemade french fries cooks help i more than often bake up sweet potato french fries but regardless of whether i use sweet potato or regular fries i have a hard time keeping them crispy and cruncy we dont like large soft ones i dont have a mandoline or any appliance cutter so i usually cut them by hand into small thin strips i normally brush them with olive oil and season with salt pepper and ground cumin so how do i cut them and bake them in a way that they come out crispy without adding a heavy batter or frying them also if you have interesting recipes that would be cool before taking them out of the oven let them sit under the broiler but you have to stay near by cuz they could burn fast flip 'em do both sides i do it every time they come out nice crispy with a great golden color Pizza French fries Bacon Potato chips Cuisine of Denmark Tofu Soul food Pancake Jewish cuisine Cookie Bread Hot dog Potato Peruvian cuisine In-N-Out Burger Bengali cuisine Barbecue Cuisine of the Philippines Idli Deep frying Cantonese cuisine Japanese cuisine Dumpling Haggis Fish and chips Cajun cuisine Sandwich Cookware and bakeware Paint Waffle McDonald's French cuisine Ice cream Cuisine of the Southern United States Chocolate Cuisine of Malaysia Domesticated turkey German cuisine Cuisine of Brazil Doughnut Bagel Chili con carne Hamburger Dosa American Chinese cuisine Flour Gumbo Korean cuisine Breakfast Recipe Mayonnaise Drill bit Taco Wok Cuisine of Africa Risotto Cuisine of India Pie Muffin Cooking Dim sum Ramen Full English breakfast Chicken Fondue Rice pudding Roman eating and drinking Tempura Empanada Potato pancakes Plantain British cuisine Cuisine of Turkey Porridge Biscuit Culture of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Knife Cha chaan teng Naan Internal ballistics Peking Duck Curry Peanut butter Halva Plastic Blintz Cocoa Kentucky Fried Chicken Baklava Food Egg (food) D__ner kebab Poutine Professional wrestling throws Sweet potato M&M's Black pepper Cuisine of Thailand Lancashire Hotpot
