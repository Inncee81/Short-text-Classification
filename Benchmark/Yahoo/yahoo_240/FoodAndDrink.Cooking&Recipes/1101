what do ido i put baking powder instead of soda in my cookies how do i fix it help please baking soda is four times as strong as baking powder so if your recipe calls for teaspoon of baking soda you would need four teaspoons of baking powder to produce the same amount of lift unfortunately though it s not that simple baking powder is made of baking soda and the right amount of acid to react with the soda it also includes corn starch to keep the ingredients from prematurely reacting in the privacy of their container so if your recipe already has acidic ingredients that were going to neutralize the necessary baking soda you are adding other ingredients in the baking powder that may not sit well with them substituting for a lack of baking powder is very easy teaspoon of baking soda plus teaspoon cream of tartar ignoring the cornstarch for each teaspoon of baking powder required no one provides information for the reverse procedure substituting baking powder when you don t have soda on hand to do so you would have to consider the acidic ingredients in the recipe and perhaps reengineer the recipe to replace them with more neutral ingredients using whole milk instead of buttermilk perhaps but at that point you would see it would be easier and probably a lot more successful to pick up a box of baking soda Bread Baking powder Flour Chocolate Biscuit Pancake Vinegar Ice cream Chili con carne Dairy Glass Cocoa Tea Cake Mouth ulcer Sugar Pizza Cheesecake Carbon dioxide Tofu Mayonnaise Brewery Milkshake Cajun cuisine Alcohol Rice pudding Vegetarian cuisine Soy protein Food additive Tooth Cooking weights and measures XML Black powder Sodium hydroxide Sulfuric acid Sherbet Curry Plastic Sugar substitute Twix Ramen Cookie Food Milk Hydrochloric acid Idli Japanese cuisine Jewish cuisine Soft drink Hot dog Margarine Toothpaste Turkish coffee Trans fat Potato chips Breakfast Potato Hypoglycemia Illegal drug trade Cocaine Gumbo Muffin Kraft Dinner Cookware and bakeware Medical prescription Custard Japanese tea ceremony French fries Laundry detergent Breadmaker Haggis Alum Sour cream Coffee Dairy product Ammonia Sodium Paint Soul food Soy milk Cheese Baking Aspartame Breastfeeding Kosher foods Veganism Rice Staining (biology) Hamburger Meat analogue Toffee Carboxylic acid Rum Experiment Explosive material Russian cuisine Nutmeg
