hi all i'm new to the cooking and recipes group i'm a year old man who has enjoyed cooking in the past but is not very knowledgeable i would really like to learn more and have considered taking classes but my schedule is too irregular to allow it does anyone have any suggestions i'd need to know what sort of tools pots pans utensils etc to buy to start off with and where i can obtain recipes that aren't too complex having said that i'd like to advance further so ideally i'd get some info on a site that has beginner recipes advanced recipes etc perhaps even my question is naive but hopefully you all get the point oh i forgot to mention that while i'm a meat eater chicken and beef mostly my wife is vegetarian and i'd like to be able to either have simple recipes that i can cook in parallel or good vegetarian recipes that i would enjoy as well lol peach i have pots and pans i was talking about if there's anything special i need to buy that a typical person wouldn't have in their kitchen sorry for the confusion this is a big ask i learnt to cook as a single father and built on basic skills and tools slowly so for a number of years i always had to cook something pretty much every day and didn't want to cook boring food i extended my repertoire gradually as i gained confidence my view is not to focus too much on tools provided you have a sharp knife and a couple of good pans almost anything is possible add things gradually as you know you are going to use them regularly i don't focus on any particular genre but mix things that can be done minutes in the evening with meals that might take several hours in the kitchen over several days this includes planning and preparing stocks and other preparatory cooking to set up for the preparation of the meal itself after years of collecting there is little storage room left in the kitchen but every device has stood the test of being useful and used some less often than others but if they are not used they don't deserve to take up space there are a couple of sites below that i use fairly regularly but there are heaps available depending upon where you are located find one that has the same seasonal rhythm as where you live they will give you in season ideas about ingredients and preparations in the us lhj seems like a good site Japanese tea ceremony Kitchen Barbecue Cajun cuisine Recipe Food Chili con carne Veganism Cuisine of Denmark RuneScape quests Bengali cuisine Korean cuisine Chinese cuisine Kosher foods Bread Tofu Cooking In-N-Out Burger RuneScape skills Pizza Hamburger Cuisine of Laos Sushi Jewish cuisine Cuisine of Brazil Cuisine of Thailand British cuisine Curry Martial art Idli Ramen Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Hell's Kitchen (television) Cantonese cuisine MRE Gumbo Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Minestrone C programming language Iron Chef Chicken soup Theory of conduct Vegetarianism Roman eating and drinking Computer Cuisine of the Southern United States Vegetarian cuisine Slow cooker GED Risotto French fries Extreme Programming Haggis Rice cooker Rice pudding Rum Social rule Meal Cuisine of Ethiopia The Star Wars Holiday Special Raw food diet Knife Chopsticks Mayonnaise Domesticated turkey Pasta Breakfast Restaurant Soup Expert system Stove Foodborne illness Halaal Portable stove Chicken Thanksgiving Technology Kimi Finster Beef noodle soup Stock (food) Humphrey Bogart Tamale About a Boy Shaggy dog story Hot dog Scientology beliefs and practices Roast beef Culture of Korea Egg (food)
