can you cook bulgar wheat in a rice cooker does anyone have experience doing this bulgar wheat is cooked so similarly to rice so it seems like it could work in the rice cooker but i don't want to ruin my machine i thought bulgar is typically soaked in hot water and does not really need to be cooked like rice however rice cookers typically have an automatic shut off switches from cook mode to keep warm mode or off if you have an old rice cooker when a certain temperature is reached that's how it knows when the rice is done it shouldn't ruin your machine if you cook something else other than rice Rice cooker Rice Slow cooker Idli Solar box cooker Solar power Pressure cooking Japanese cuisine Tofu Tortilla Kitchen Brewery Ramen Cereal Bread Quinoa Rice congee Beer Cookware and bakeware Stove Korean cuisine Barbecue Fuzzy logic Breakfast Global warming and agriculture Flour Mercury Atlas 6 Common bean Steam engine Mandriva Linux Cuisine of Brazil Boiling Floppy disk Food preservation Jewish cuisine Swimming pool Chinese cuisine Bulgars Risotto Ice cream Sake Pea Customs and etiquette of Japan Starch Cuisine of Denmark Steaming Cuisine of India Gluten Cantonese cuisine Carburetor Agar plate Ska Apple pie Bengali cuisine Glutinous rice Patna Tea Curry Rum Dosa German cuisine Solar oven Natt__ Raw food diet Gumbo Climate change Cuisine of Thailand Thermostat Cuisine of Singapore Dry cleaning Boyd Rice Tatars Hot spring Cooking Combine harvester Transistor Cajun cuisine Sushi Culture of Africa Escherichia coli O157:H7 E85 Cuisine of the Philippines Donburi Veganism Cuisine of Argentina Magyars Cuisine of Laos Soup Nuclear reactor Porridge Dumpling Pancake Kazan Corn flakes Kosher foods Recipe
