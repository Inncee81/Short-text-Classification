what goes in first help needed asap hey im making muffins right now and i'v made them before so i have the recipe but i remember putting everything in a certain order can anyone tell me what i put in first and so on with these ingredients milk eggs self raising flour butter sugar quick help needed thanks well it depends on the type of muffin you are making the bread like muffin batter is made using the muffin method this batter can be assembled and baked 'quickly' usually in minutes only two bowls are needed to make the batter one bowl is used to mix all the dry ingredients together the second bowl contains all the wet ingredients the fat used with the bread like muffins is usually in liquid form either an oil or melted butter when the wet and dry ingredients have been mixed together separately then they are combined the important step here is not to over mix the batter mixing too much overdevelops the gluten in the flour which will cause a tough muffin with tunnels and a compact texture only to strokes are needed to moisten the ingredients and the batter should be still lumpy and you may still see a few traces of flour don't worry about these lumps as the batter continues to blend as it bakes and any lumps will disappear the cake like muffin batter is prepared using the same method as making a cake batter the butter room temperature and sugar are creamed together the eggs are mixed in and then the wet and dry ingredients are added alternately the higher sugar and fat content in this type of muffin act as tenderizers producing a richer cake like muffin with a softer cake like texture the increased fat content also minimizes the development of gluten which also helps to produce a muffin with a softer texture Pancake Flour Tofu Chocolate Ice cream Muffin Japanese cuisine Breakfast Cookie Jewish cuisine Bengali cuisine Cuisine of the Philippines Brewery Vegetarian cuisine Coffee Tea Soy protein Cuisine of the Southern United States Cuisine of Denmark Casting Cheese XML Soul food Pizza Beer Recipe Butter Gumbo Dairy Cuisine of Malaysia Cookware and bakeware Food Bagel English muffin Idli Russian cuisine Carbon dioxide Rum German cuisine Puff pastry Veganism Bacon Cajun cuisine Breastfeeding Dim sum Sushi Cuisine of Brazil Pottery Cantonese cuisine Cheesecake Halva Trans fat Baking Hamburger Soap Dairy product Chili con carne Curry Meat analogue Mooncake Margarine Dumpling Biscuit Stollen Rice pudding D__ner kebab Paint Wheat Hot dog Korean cuisine Compost Pudding Ramen Peruvian cuisine Food preservation Pasta Plastic Soy milk Coeliac disease Rice Baking powder Sandwich Fried chicken Cuisine of Singapore Drawing Milkshake Cannabis (drug) M__m__lig__ Chicken soup Roux Polish cuisine Roman eating and drinking Milk Egg (food)
