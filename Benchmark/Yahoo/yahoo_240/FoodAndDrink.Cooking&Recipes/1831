recipe idea has this been done ok you take some cooked chicken grind it fine down to a paste then you mix your chicken paste with something like cornmeal or maybe instant mashed potato mix mix the stuff to a paste like consistency maybe add some egg for cohesion roll your stuff into stick type pieces maybe the size of a kindergarten pencil either deep fry or bake i'm going to try this but i just thought of it and wonder if something like this already exists or have i invented the next snack sensation and given it away on the internet yep that sounds great but those are chicken fries now if you could figure out how to incorporate other flavors with this mixture or better yet stuff some cheese in the center of them that came out all nice and melty when cooked that would be cool Tofu Japanese cuisine Potato Jewish cuisine Cuisine of Denmark Cuisine of the Southern United States Pizza Bengali cuisine Hamburger Soul food Cuisine of the Philippines Pancake Bread Peruvian cuisine Dim sum Ramen Ice cream McDonald's Cajun cuisine German cuisine French cuisine Domesticated turkey Potato chips Hot dog Deep frying Cuisine of Brazil Barbecue Brewery Chili con carne Fried chicken Dumpling Sandwich Korean cuisine Gumbo Cuisine of Argentina American Chinese cuisine Pie Cuisine of Singapore British cuisine Vegetarian cuisine Cornmeal Stuffing Chicken Chicken soup Soup Fish and chips Haggis Chinese cuisine Egg (food) Buffalo wings Mayonnaise Cooking Curry Biscuit Mooncake Tea Cookie Cuisine of Africa Muffin Porridge Snack food Idli Bacon Kentucky Fried Chicken Meatball Bagel Cantonese cuisine Fondue Empanada Irish cuisine Kosher foods Peanut butter Recipe Hot pot Food Culture of the Democratic Republic of the Congo MRE Irish breakfast M__m__lig__ Food preservation Dosa In-N-Out Burger Chocolate Polish cuisine Coffee Blintz Sushi Tamale Cuisine of India Salad Fried rice Cuisine of Laos Walkers Rice pudding
