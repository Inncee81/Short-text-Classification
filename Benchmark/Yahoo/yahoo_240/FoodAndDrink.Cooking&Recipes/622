how do i un soggy my sandwich i made a huge killer sub this morning for lunch it was so big i only ate half of it and now that other half is the only thing i have for lunch tomorrow at work by now it has gotten rather soggy and by lunch tomorrow it will be uneatable i there anything i can do to it now so it won't be soggy tomorrow at work i have access to a microwave but no toaster or oven i have no more bread and the stores are closed i know this doesn't help much for this sandwich but what i'll do if i'm making a sandwich for someone to eat later on is to make it but leave out the tomato and lettuce i'll put those in a separate sandwich bag or just wrap them in plastic wrap for this sandwich the only thing i would try at this point is to maybe take off the ingredients and toast the bread wet side up in a toaster oven or regular oven at home before work on say for about min and see if it's dried at all once the acid in the tomatoes touch the lettuce it starts to draw out the moisture and lettuce is almost all water good luck with whatever you decide Sandwich Bagel Hamburger Hot dog Bread Pizza Toast McDonald's D__ner kebab Toaster Barbecue Kitchen Bento Cuisine of Denmark In-N-Out Burger Breakfast Potato chips Cookware and bakeware Pasta Dim sum Cha chaan teng Hamster Lunch Cuisine of Vietnam Jewish cuisine German cuisine Shawarma Serbian cuisine Pita French cuisine Mushroom hunting Idli Grilling Cookie Full English breakfast Ketchup Food Chili con carne Peanut butter and jelly sandwich Tofu Coffee Baking Vegetarian cuisine Microwave oven Sausage The Rutles Peruvian cuisine Delicatessen Textile manufacturing Upholstery Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Japanese cuisine Cuisine of Argentina Domesticated turkey Tomato Burger Bacon Sushi Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Indian cricket team in Zimbabwe in 2005-06 Red Dwarf characters Spidey Super Stories Korean cuisine English muffin Peanut butter Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Convenience store Cuisine of Brazil Fiberglass Marmite Dialysis Mnemonic Futurama (TV series - season 4) Hydroponics Subway (restaurant) Teletubbies Rice pudding Egyptian Ratscrew History of Test cricket (1884 to 1889) Grilled cheese sandwich Characters in the Smurfs Customs and etiquette of Japan French toast Jute Fire fighting Cuisine of Turkey Pickling British cuisine Food science Peanut Plastic bag Soy protein Puff pastry Pulp Fiction Polish cuisine Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Australian cuisine Oreo
