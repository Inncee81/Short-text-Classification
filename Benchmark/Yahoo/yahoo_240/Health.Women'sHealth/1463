i have been daignosed with a blocked fallopian tube what are my chances of conceiving my husband and i have been trying to get pregnant since december i recently had a procedure called an hsg or hysterosalpingogram and was told that my left fallopian tube is blocked due to scar tissue from previous surgeries my reproductive endocrinologist told me that i still have an chance of conceiving but that it may take or tries of intrauterine insemination unfortunately my husband and i can only afford one attempt has anyone out there been diagnosed with this and become pregnant and if so how long did it take you to conceive thank you for serious answers i forgot to add that my husband was tested and his count was one of the best the doctor had ever seen he was very proud of that but obviously it's not helping and my hormone levels are all perfect you may not need iui your right fallopian tube is still fine im assuming the months you ovulate from your left ovary you wont conceive the months you ovulate from your right ovary you have as much chance as anyone else to conceive my sister lost fallopian tube due to ectopic pregnancies and then lost her nd tube due to another ectopic pregnancy so she now has no other option than ivf i did ivf because i dont ovulate at all and need the drugs they give you to make you produce heaps of eggs iui is certainly cheaper than ivf but with ivf you have the chance of several attempts from the treatment personally i would give it a go with the attempt that you can afford i fell pregnant on my nd insemination after ivf just remember it is still possible for you to fall pregnant naturally unless there are other things going on has your husband been tested i only ask because it was a given i was infertile i knew this at the age of so i was given drugs to make me ovulate etc but it still wasnt working it wasnt till months down the track that i changed drs and he tested my husband only to find he had a problem also so all the drugs in the world wont work on you to get you pregnant if there is also a problem on your husbands side good luck with your baby making dreams Ectopic pregnancy Endometriosis Menstrual cycle Pelvic inflammatory disease Pregnancy Ovary Obstetrics Polycystic ovary syndrome Ovulation Prostate cancer Fertility awareness Multiple birth Oral contraceptive Prolactinoma Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Ovarian cancer Miscarriage Artificial insemination Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Androgen insensitivity syndrome Stomach cancer Emergency contraception Urinary incontinence Sexual reproduction Human chorionic gonadotropin Fertilisation Cryptorchidism Intersexuality Neighbours Pregnancy test Breastfeeding Growth hormone treatment Friends Female reproductive system (human) Puberty Human cloning Gynecologic hemorrhage Androgen Birth control Amenorrhoea Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Turner syndrome Medicine Twin Prenatal diagnosis EastEnders Abortion Gynaecology Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Ovarian cyst Hypoglycemia Cancer Acne Progesterone Transsexuality History of intersex surgery Cephalic disorder Stroke Sexual differentiation Surrogacy Sterilization (surgical procedure) Childbirth Hyperprolactinaemia Sex reassignment surgery female-to-male Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Sexual intercourse Cytomegalovirus Sex assignment Endoscopy Spina bifida Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Knots Landing Chlamydia Abortion debate Terri Schiavo Pneumonia Vaginal bleeding Code 46 Swyer syndrome Pachypodium brevicaule Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog Days of our Lives Homosexuality and transgender DDT Endocrinology Coeliac disease Psoriasis Intersex surgery Shan Ratnam
