mini pill question no period perfect use i have been using the mini pill for months i take it at the exact same time everyday i had a little bleeding the first pack but i haven't bled since i've taken a few pregnancy test but i'm not pregnant every month i feel as if i'm going to start but i never do i read this a fairly normal to miss periods but after how long without a period should i see a doctor normally if you hadn't just started a new hormonal birth control it would be recommended to call your doctor after two missed periods however three months is the time it takes for your body to fully adjust to a new hormonal birth control method so i think you've waited the appropriate time to start asking questions since it's been a full three months you should probably talk to your doctor about this side effect and whether you should switch birth control methods Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Pregnancy Endometriosis Prostate cancer Emergency contraception Tocopherol Urinary incontinence Birth control Miscarriage Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Depo Provera Childbirth Stomach cancer Breastfeeding Psoriasis Obstetrics Coeliac disease Guinea pig Folic acid Hypertension Sulfasalazine In vitro fertilisation Acne Cancer Abortion debate Spina bifida Prolactinoma Abortion Puberty Carpal tunnel syndrome Turner syndrome Breech birth EastEnders Progesterone Hypoglycemia Transsexuality Baldness treatments Ben Johnson (athlete) Gonorrhoea Androgen insensitivity syndrome Diabetes mellitus Maprotiline Growth hormone deficiency Insulin Intrauterine device Friends Chronic fatigue syndrome Glycogen storage disease type I CPU cache Carburetor Anemia Ectopic pregnancy Postpartum depression Growth hormone treatment Breast cancer Spacecraft propulsion Ovarian cyst Pregnancy test Chemical abortion Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Sharon Tate Homosexuality and transgender Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Malaria Sleeping Murder Clinical depression Neighbours Fecal incontinence Migraine Vitamin D Vaginal bleeding Diabetic retinopathy Legal aspects of transsexualism Twin Phoebe Halliwell Intact dilation and extraction Sexual abstinence Milton H.
