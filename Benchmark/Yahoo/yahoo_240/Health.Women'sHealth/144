jasmin birth control question i've been on jasmin for almost a year now always take my pills on time and what not here's the backround so after my last row of pills i did the norm and took my reminder pills and what not and like normal my period started tuesday that week and lasted up until friday now i start my pack on sundays so of course i waited to start a new pack on that sunday i had intercourse that saturday night was i protected if i didn't use a condom does the rd week of pills protect you the week after please help i'm afraid yes you are fine you have been on the pill yasmin i think is what you are trying to say for about a year so it is in your body and is regulated even though you stop for the week for your period your body still has some of the hormone inside and is not ready to ovulate yet once you start taking your pill again on that sunday it is preparing your body again to not get pregnant so basically you can have sex on any of the days during your pack and not get pregnant that's the beauty of the pill after the first month you don't have to worry about condoms again assuming that you are monogamous and don't have std's Menstrual cycle Oral contraceptive Fertility awareness Birth control Pregnancy Sexual abstinence Fasting Condom Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Liturgical year Safe sex Psoriasis Sexual intercourse Sex education Human sexual behavior Human penis size Easter Alanis Morissette Puberty History of sex Diaphragm (contraceptive) Pornographic movie Sunday Endometriosis Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Jewish holiday Sexual revolution Elvis and Me Sabbath Guinea pig Holy Week Acne Apollo 8 STS-59 Tocopherol Ocean's Twelve Saturday Night Live Dominical letter Oral sex Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Sexually-transmitted infection Sleep Depo Provera Intrauterine device Week Days of the week Marriage Saturday Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Urinary incontinence Sharon Tate Gregorian calendar Niddah Knots Landing Anal sex Friday Abortion debate Hebrew calendar Elvis Presley Homosexuality and transgender Aladdin (1992 film) Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Ovulation Marilyn Monroe Calculating the day of the week Estrus cycle Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Carnival Gay bathhouse Big Brother (Australian TV series) Mid-Autumn Festival Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Eminem Ben Johnson (athlete) Insulin National Football League Neighbours Tour de France AIDS Monday Night Football Coffee MTV2 Ovarian cyst Irish calendar Cordelia Chase Sandy Koufax Breastfeeding Sexual reproduction Monogamy Doomsday rule Billboard Hot 100 Tuesday Sex toy UK Singles Chart Monday Katelyn Faber Child sexuality Hormone
