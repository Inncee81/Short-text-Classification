could having sex during your period cause it to stop im on birth control pills i have been on birth control pills for more than a year now ive taken them on time and always used a condom as a double protection thing but i recently had unprotected sex during the sugar pill week my period was starting but i was only spotting really light i believe it was the st day of my period week well that was when i had unprotected sex and right after that my period stopped and it hasnt come back its been days now and im due to start taking a new pack soon could i be pregnant has this happened to any of you sometimes when you have sex on your period the blood is pushed back up into your vagina so it takes longer for it to come back out so sometimes if you period is heavy and you have sex your period lasts even longer but if it is light it might just take a while to come out i believe though that if you take a pregancy test while on birth control it will skew the results so just to be safe i would see your doctor and ask them Oral contraceptive Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Emergency contraception Birth control Safe sex Condom Pregnancy Psoriasis Urinary incontinence Pornographic movie Childbirth Anal sex Tocopherol Menstrual cup Endometriosis Sexual intercourse Acne Oral sex Gonorrhoea Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Randomized controlled trial Intrauterine device Prenatal diagnosis Puberty Sex education Abortion debate Big Brother UK series 6 Niddah Alanis Morissette Strap-on dildo Depo Provera Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Folic acid Miscarriage Neighbours Guinea pig Sewage treatment Crystal methamphetamine and sex Androgen insensitivity syndrome Soap opera Herpes simplex virus Vernon Schillinger Breastfeeding Sleep Human sexual behavior Hepatitis C Premature ejaculation Methamphetamine Twin Sexual reproduction AIDS pandemic Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sex assignment Atherosclerosis Diabetic retinopathy Prostate cancer Placebo Obstetrics Diaphragm (contraceptive) Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Human adaptation to space Jeopardy!
