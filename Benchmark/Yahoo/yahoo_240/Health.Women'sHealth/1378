girl question i would like to start using tampons and i need some advice i've done a lot of research and i think i know what to do im just confused how you know when the tampon is all the way in i would try the lightest tamp possible i find that inserting is easier if i elevate my leg by placing my foot on the toilet and you must place it so that it points toward your back not up if you hold the ribbed end with your thumb and middle or ring finger you push it in until these fingers are at the opening of your vagina then push the tampon in with your index finger keep trying 'cause i have be honest they are a whole lot nicer to use than a pad that feels like a diaper plus you don't smell as bad either just remember to change them about every four hours or more as needed also i had a problem once with the tamp getting caught on my hymen and i couldn't get it out i had to call my mom for assistance which was way embarrassing but should this happen to you just stay calm push it back in with your finger and try again the tamp must come out the way it went it right nothing to worry about i hope that i have answered your question and please feel free to e mail me if you have any other questions that i may help with Tampon Sanitary towel Professional wrestling holds Aerial (dance move) Milton H.
