why does bleeding occur while in the female on top position not all the time but most of the time i have two sex partners i only bleed when i'm on top with one of my partners no issues at all with the other partner never sex at the same time with both of them and they have almost the same size penis if your partner is rougher then the other this can cause some bleeding being rough can cause tearing and can rub the skin raw and cause it to bleed you might not notice a difference in size but there may be a difference they both may be average size as far as girth goes but length could be a different story if one is longer then the other it will obviously go in farther and could cause some bleeding just take it easy and maybe try other positions a little more often please be careful with having two partners make sure you are being safe good luck Anal sex Strap-on dildo Puberty Penis Human penis size Bleeding Oral sex Condom Sexual intercourse Equine conformation Orgasm Intersex surgery Human sexual behavior Safe sex Gender role Penis enlargement Manicure Breastfeeding Callus Childbirth Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Medical analysis of circumcision Androgen insensitivity syndrome Violin Shoe size Zoophilia Menstrual cycle Herpes simplex virus Nile crocodile Stroke Sexual differentiation Female genital cutting Group sex Birth control Civil unions in the United Kingdom Drill bit Shaving Sex reassignment surgery female-to-male Gonorrhoea Mattress Abortion Platypus John Holmes (actor) Age of consent Stomach cancer Gay slang Bondage (BDSM) Masturbation ECW One Night Stand Upholstery Penis envy Acne Pubic hair Premature ejaculation Malignant melanoma First aid Wound Anal masturbation Swingout Intersexuality Ebola Internal ballistics Lightning Transsexuality Human sexual response cycle Friction Goatse.cx Ric Flair Sin City Sex assignment Traumatic brain injury Hipparchus (astronomer) Aerial (dance move) Quicksort Smallpox Tourniquet Woman on top sex position Double bass Diamond cut Sonar Child sexuality Bleed Like Me (single) Sexual reproduction Small penis humiliation UTF-8 Perfume Domination & submission (BDSM) Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Sex and the City Blood type Bled Sten Crystal methamphetamine and sex History of intersex surgery Bleed Like Me Bong Cervical cancer Episodes of Lost (Season 1) AIDS
