another question for the ladies ok so yesterday i asked how many times a day women think about sex i got the answer to that but lots of the answers said that you think about it more when you are having your periods so is there a reason for that i have always had the impression that sex was one of the last things that would be on your mind during that time so i'm wrong couple of things first the wow factor goes to calyxt and second of course im a virgin i'm not desperate enough for a hooker and if i had a girlfriend i would just ask her thanks for quick responses too for myself the urge is so intense one day before my period that there are nail marks in the ceiling and yes it's all about hormones having sex during your period is an extremely bad idea girls especially if you have endometriosis or have a strong family hx of it there have been multiple studies that have shown that blood and menstruum can get pushed out of your uterus and back up and out the fallopian tubes and into the abdominal cavity that blood and tissue is hormonally highly active and can form masses and adhesions all over your abdominal organs not a good idea at all ladies menstruation is a time when things are coming out nothing should be going in but a tampon or a sea sponge i don't know many women who want to get f ked when they're in their moons but i know plenty of them who are as randy as goats just before and right after i will say also from personal experience that having an orgasm or really helps w both menstrual cramps and massively shortening the duration of my moon makes it get over much faster Menstrual cycle Endometriosis Puberty Orgasm Pregnancy Urinary incontinence Tampon Dysmenorrhea Sexual intercourse Ectopic pregnancy Androgen insensitivity syndrome Prostate cancer Pelvic inflammatory disease Intersexuality Oral contraceptive Fertility awareness Abortion Gynaecology Miscarriage Infertility Sexual orientation Endometrial cancer Sexual differentiation Sexual reproduction Anal sex Human sexuality In vitro fertilisation Endometrium Time Out of Mind Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Social rule Gynecologic hemorrhage Cancer Peritoneum Endocrinology Weight training Cramp Religion and sexuality Sanitary towel Borderline personality disorder Breast Gender role Sterilization (surgical procedure) Traumatic brain injury Emergency contraception Estrus cycle Little Britain Childbirth Uterus Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Human Oral sex Hormone Hypoglycemia Growth hormone treatment Polycystic ovary syndrome Twin Theory of conduct Equine conformation Breastfeeding Sleep Feminism Hysterectomy Hormone replacement therapy Signal transduction Abortion debate Homosexuality and transgender Human sexual response cycle Serial killer Cervix Mesothelioma Swyer syndrome Insulin Anorexia nervosa Human height Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Bondage (BDSM) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Glucocorticoid Sex reassignment surgery female-to-male Acne Human sexual behavior Antidiuretic hormone Sadism and masochism Babe Ruth Sexual dysfunction Marriage Gender identity Avenue Q
