please share your experience i just thought of a few more questions so i decided to post another question has anyone asked their doctors about using tampons before they started if so how did you ask and what was their response also was it really uncomfortable and how did you come up with the courage to ask i'm nervous to ask my pediatrician and trying to come up with idea on how to ask i never asked but if you want to ask i would just be blunt and ask whatever you was needing to know if you don't feel comfortable asking your dr then ask a female relative they might could answer your questions as well as the dr Milton H.
