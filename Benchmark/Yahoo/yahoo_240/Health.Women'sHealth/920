this isn't a uti it's different this morning i had to pee every half hour for a while now i don't get the urge to go for about two hours i had a uti recently and back then i would only go a tiny bit each time this time every time i go it's quite a bit and it's not dark like it was during my uti two weeks ago it's really clear and it doesn't hurt to go i was wondering what could cause this i had to do last night really bad but i strained a lot would that have anything to do with it how about eating too much fruit i had some cross breeds of plums and apricots yesterday they're called pluots and that's the only odd thing i had yesterday anything else this definately isn't a uti if you're producing a normal or larger than normal amount of urine with each session it isn't dark cloudy or smell bad and it isn't painful to go then i would say that your body is just eliminating excess fluid perhaps you drank a larger than normal amount of fluids the night before if you have no pain discomfort or other signs of a uti then i wouldn't worry Urinary incontinence Urine Urinary tract infection Social rule Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Penis Time Out of Mind Fecal incontinence Guinea pig Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Theory of conduct Breastfeeding Medical analysis of circumcision Poker jargon Cat Dialysis Ron and Fez Dehydration Urinary system The Amber Spyglass Prostate cancer Piccolo Junior Saga The Inside Diabetes mellitus Equine conformation Sin City Bread Blood (computer game) House Mouse Menstrual cycle Traumatic incident reduction Scientology beliefs and practices Procrastination Endometriosis Carbon dioxide Decompression sickness Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Cocaine First aid The Wotch Treehouse of Horror V Hey Jude Hypoglycemia Shark Diabetic retinopathy Fancy rat AFI 100 Years series Steven Wright LSD Shaggy dog story Spider Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Milton H.
