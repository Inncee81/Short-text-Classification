how do i know if i put two tampons in the day before yesterday my period was getting lighter so i was still using tampons i used a couple that day and i honestly think i remember taking every single one out before i left the house i took one out and it wasn't that saturated it only had blood on the top then i put in another and left well while i was out my stomach began to hurt soooo bad and i figured it was just cuz i wasn't that heavy so i took it out and used a pad instead but my stomach continued to hurt badly and also i had sharp pains in my lower back so i went to sleep and woke up and had the same pains allll yesterday so i got in the shower and reached up there to see if i could feel another i use regular and slim so they're not that long but i felt nothing but the stomach ache has continued all through today as far as i can tell i have no symptoms of tss except the stomach ache but i'm very worried that maybe i just put two in and forgot and one is still up there how can i tell for sure all yesterday and today i have had very brown spotting that i get at the end of every period and i'm hoping that means there isn't anything up there because if there was then that wouldn't be coming out right deelee said they would xray you they won't very seldom will a tampon show in a pelvis xray anyway you should be able to reach up there so high to feel your cervix if you don't feel any cotton up there you are in the clear tss symptoms after days include rash diarrhea and fever you are fine Toxic shock syndrome Menstrual cycle Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Menstrual cup Stomach cancer Tampon Group A streptococcal infection Pneumonia Kodocha Sanitary towel 1957 World Series Paracetamol Endometriosis Aspirin Yesterday (song) Professional wrestling holds Babe Ruth Cliff Richard Equine conformation Infectious mononucleosis Tocopherol Prostate cancer Smallpox Diarrhea Breastfeeding Rocky Mountain spotted fever Donna Summer Hey Jude Humphrey Bogart Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The Beatles discography Chronic fatigue syndrome Trichinosis Sulfasalazine Autonomic nervous system EastEnders Acute pancreatitis Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Jacob Pitaten Typhoid fever Decompression sickness Fluoxetine Pok__mon Live!
