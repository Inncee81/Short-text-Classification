anyone know whats wrong ok i am and i am of course a virgin but i missed my period should i go to my doctor or just wait and see if i get one next month it's not necessary for you to see a doctor right away especially if you haven't been sexually active periods can be very tempermental anything can cause them to be late or early or not even come at all has there been any added stress in your life because than can contribute to a late period too if you want to see a doctor it wouldn't hurt but they're just going to tell you it's normal because you're young however if you miss it again next month i would consider seeing a professional good luck hun Virgin New Adventures Urinary incontinence Doctor Who spin-offs Pedophilia Prostate cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Teen Girl Squad Theory of conduct Game programming Sexually-transmitted infection Social rule Pregnancy Serial killer Russell T.
