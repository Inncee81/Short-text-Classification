i want to go see a ob gyn i want to go see a ob gyn but im a virgin ive only had oral a couple times what do they usually do do they put anything in there i want to see him cause i think im too tight down there ive tried to loose my virginity a couple of times but it doesnt open enough i would recommend going to a real ob gyn not a general practitioner although i am sure you are healthy gps are notorious for not detecting cervical uterine cancer i just buried my year old friend last week because her gp saw her uterine cancer but didn't recognize it as cancer i first went to a gyn when i was because i hadn't gotten my period in quite a while i started at it was horrible and traumatizing because the gyn was a complete buffoon it felt like rape to me be sure to talk to the nurse practitioner gyn before you go for your pelvic there are some gyns that specialize in first exams here is how most exams go breast exam to check for lumps it doesn't hurt the doctor will use a speculum metal instrument to take scraping from your cervix for a pap if you want to be tested for stds the sample will also be taken at this time the speculum isn't great fun but should not be painful many women get scared and have psychosomatic symptoms the doctor will do a digital exam she will use her fingers to feel your vagina and cervix for abnormalities she will also look around your vulva for any lesions this does not hurt either the doc will use ky jelly for the speculum and her fingers that is pretty much it no big deal if you are old enough to have sex you are old enough to get an exam it was traumatic for me because at i had never had sex it was degrading and looking back that doctor should not have needed to do a pelvic i didn't have sex until i was however i did hear that this doctor died horribly from brain cancer a few years back Gynaecology Human papillomavirus Cervical cancer Endometrial cancer Cancer Gonorrhoea Cervix Colposcopy Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Fertility awareness Endometriosis Medicine Ovarian cancer Stomach cancer Abortion Menstrual cycle Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Childbirth Urinary incontinence Vagina Sexual intercourse Breech birth Medical analysis of circumcision Colorectal cancer Androgen insensitivity syndrome Premature birth EastEnders Pap smear Breast cancer Masturbation Post-traumatic stress disorder Oral sex Anal sex Vulvovaginal health Fecal incontinence Genital wart Rape Strap-on dildo Brain tumor Miscarriage Ectopic pregnancy Physician Dyspareunia Pelvic inflammatory disease Sexually-transmitted infection Great Teacher Onizuka Breastfeeding Hysterectomy Futurama (TV series - season 3) Multiple sclerosis Traumatic incident reduction Cancer of the larynx Polycystic ovary syndrome Menstrual cup Pregnancy AIDS reappraisal The Shining (film) History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Massage General practitioner Condom Malignant melanoma Milton H.
