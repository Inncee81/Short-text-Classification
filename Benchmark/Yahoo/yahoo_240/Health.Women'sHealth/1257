i shave my pubic area now but heard waxing is better is this true and what wax product should i get thats not pricey thank you waxing or sugaring is better because when the hair grows back in it is soft and no nubs and can last weeks and for some longer i recommend getting it done professionally first so you can see how they do it and you can also feel what it is like and decide if you want to go that route if you do it by yourself at home i guarantee that you will not do it right and make it hurt so much more than it needs to there is a technique to it and you don't need to get everything removed either just shaping it up is enough for a first time then when you do it yourself you can be more daring like another poster said waxing hurts the most the first time and that is partly because you don't know what to expect it only hurts for a few seconds and is worth it also if you do it for years yes you will have less hair that will grow Pubic hair Waxing Depilation Casting Brazilian waxing Haircut Phonograph cylinder Menstrual cup Hair Kurt Angle Leg shaving Cross-country skiing Guinea pig Puberty Dice Social rule Leather Breastfeeding Hypertrichosis Wax play Crab louse Professional wrestling match types Androgen insensitivity syndrome Motor oil Shaving Jon Secada Manicure Trish Stratus Wig (hair) Diseases of the honeybee Bee Moustache Wax Ben Johnson (athlete) Vulva Honey Carnivorous plant Baldness Tofu Milk First aid Emotions (album) Beekeeping Tooth Ruby Wax Upholstery Double Dare One Tree Hill (TV series) Theory of conduct Biochemistry Body piercing Tai Chi Chuan Delayed puberty Baldness treatments Repouss__ and chasing Acomoclitism Internal ballistics Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Earwax Carpal tunnel syndrome Violin Marilyn Monroe Mummy Champagne (beverage) Stuttering Fame Academy Law of value Pitaten Playboy (magazine) Windows XP Cheese Shaggy dog story Blood Syndicate Double Dragon Razor Cotton Coca-Cola Tarantula Beeswax Radiation therapy Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Ron and Fez Major League Baseball television contracts Massage Madonna (entertainer) Joker (comics) Swimsuit Mississippi John Hurt Customs and etiquette of Japan Figure drawing Gramophone record Steganography Mattress Fancy rat Billboard (advertising) Hash table Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Norah Jones Hyuga Hinata Social role of hair
