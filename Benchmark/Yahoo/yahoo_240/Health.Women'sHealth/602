really bad cramps i hate getting my period because every day that i am on it i experience unbearable cramps that cause me to cry i used to go to the doctor about it because i was also kind of irregular and it would worry me anyway she told me to take tylenol or advil every hours each day i have my period but i don't like putting that much medication into my body i also take a centrum vitamin each day because i lose a lot of iron is there anything else i can do so that my cramps who be so bad and so i don't have to take so much medication if i wanted to get on the pill can you give me advice on approaching my mom about it we don't get along and she likes to make assumptions about me i'm sure if i told her it was because of my period she would still turn it around and think i only wanted it to prevent myself from getting pregnant she acts like it's a bad thing i won't lie i have had sex but i don't make a habit out of it so it would probably be a good idea anyway i just don't know how to talk to her i was molested as a child and she never talked to me about it sex drugs alcohol it's hard i do exercise i'm not lazy well you can take hot baths or showers exercise crunches help you can place a heating pad on the area or drink hot fluids coco and tea i'm glad your taking the vitamins but i also had this when i was younger and the doctor actually suggested that i go on the pill it really does help it's not always given just b c you have sex and if you have a hard time talking to your mom about it talk to your doctor first and ask them to suggest it to your mom maybe that will help also check to see if there is a planned parenthood in your area they will see you if you are under and give you the meds free as long as you don't tell them you have insurance and its completely confidential so that may be a way to avoid talking to your mom but i would try to deal with her first it's hard but it's usually not as bad as you anticipate good luck and feel better Breastfeeding Hyperthermia Menstrual cycle Social rule Fecal incontinence Stomach cancer Urinary incontinence Prostate cancer Folic acid Psoriasis The Catcher in the Rye First aid About a Boy Milton H.
