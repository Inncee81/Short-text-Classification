girls a quick question is it okay to have like bump or a pimple sort of this underneath the skin of your vagina i think its like a soar but its deffinetly a bump and i have no idea what it is it hurts sometimes and i just want to make sure its natural before i jump to conclusions its not an std cause i've never had sex but still i'm a bit worried what it could be its been there for a few days now and its not going away it's something similar to a cyst actually when you shower use anti bacterial body wash and wash it good if you continue to use the ab wash it will cut down your chances of getting them again it will pop though and it will hurt it's really gross when they pop just put antibiotic ointment on it every time you go pee and it will heal within a couple of days Condom Psoriasis Eczema Strap-on dildo Sexually-transmitted infection Wound Social rule Oral sex Birth control First aid Anal sex Fecal incontinence Lymphogranuloma venereum Skin Group A streptococcal infection Puberty Antibiotic Urinary incontinence Equine conformation Guinea pig Thermoregulation First aid kit R.
