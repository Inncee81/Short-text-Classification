please answer i need to get this off my mind ok i had my last period on june th i have a day cycle so i should've gotten my period on like july rd or something but i didn't get it i know it could have just skipped it cuz i only got my period years ago but on the nd of july i had like really light brown spotting and it went away now in the past weeks i have been getting on and off very mild cramps lately i've been paying alot more attention to my body if you read my other questions you will see why could this have happened before and i just didn't notice it also my boobs are swollen like i'm about to have my period but it hasn't come yet i've heard that if you worry about your period it can be delayed and stuff if that is the case for me would i have cramps until i got it or should they have gone away if my period is late so what was the brown spoting why is my period late and why do i have cramps i do not think i can be pregnant because i've never had sex and i've never done anything sexual with any guys well the immediate thought would be pregnancy but you didn't say whether or not that was possible because everything you listed could be part of that in reality though being young you're going to have all sorts of weird menstral irregularities from being late to skipping to long cycles as you said perhaps skipping and spotting a little and having cramps is just part of being a girl and they can come and go as they please especially in younger girls Menstrual cycle Pregnancy Leo Frank Milton H.
