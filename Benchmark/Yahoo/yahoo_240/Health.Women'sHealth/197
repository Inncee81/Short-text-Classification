i am having trouble getting wet before sex i am and in my second marriage i never had an orgasm until i met my second husband our sex life is great and i have never had a problem getting wet before sometimes i would get so wet we woud have to change the sheets for the last week or so i havent been able to get wet i am turned on and want to have sex i started dieting about weeks ago and have been exercising and using the atkins diet and have lost lbs already could this be the reason i am unable to get wet it is they only thing i can think of i dont want to go off the diet or stop exercising because i am getting such good results but i also want to be able to enjoy sex without using lubricants please help i'm not an expert by any means but by my understanding estrogen and other female hormones are stored in fat and when you lose fat these hormones are released into your body and wreak havoc for a while it doesn't matter what diet you are on but it tends to show up pretty strongly with a low carb diet because the initial weight loss is so rapid this is also why women frequently notice changes in their monthly cycle when losing a lot of weight if you go to this forum http forums lowcarber org and ask you question i bet you'll find others having the same problem i expect that it will pass when you stop losing weight however it's always best to consult with a doctor if there is a problem Dieting Atkins Nutritional Approach Urinary incontinence Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Prostate cancer Puberty Low-carbohydrate diet Breastfeeding Anorexia nervosa Obesity Oral contraceptive Weight training Insulin Sexual orientation Zone diet Domestic rabbit Diabetes mellitus Hyperglycemia Hormone replacement therapy Weight loss Orgasm Exercise Birth control Tocopherol Menstrual cycle Protein-energy malnutrition Oral sex Transsexuality Human sexual behavior Hypertension Little Britain Osteoporosis Binge eating disorder Social rule Cancer Case-control Adjustable gastric band Child sexuality Sexual dysfunction Theory of conduct Bodybuilding Childbirth Chronic fatigue syndrome Hair Sauna Sexual intercourse Protein Homosexuality and transgender Traumatic brain injury Infantilism Extreme Programming Polycystic ovary syndrome Androgen Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Religion and sexuality Coeliac disease Dehydroepiandrosterone Masters and Johnson Fertility awareness Human height Legal aspects of transsexualism Guinea pig Turner syndrome Gender identity About a Boy Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Castration Fancy rat Carbon dioxide Jam (TV series) Fecal incontinence Folic acid Human Piccolo Junior Saga Sex Pistols Baldness Negima Gallstone Gender-neutral language Veganism Mixed martial arts Masturbation Carburetor Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses History of intersex surgery Bedwetting Strap-on dildo Sex assignment Equine conformation Woman Intersex surgery Motorcycle Signal transduction
