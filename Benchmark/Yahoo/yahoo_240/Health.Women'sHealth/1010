how long does it take the depo shot to take away your period i had depo shots and i still kinda had a period while i was on the shot but a couple days after i was scheduled to get my rd injection in which i missed my periods just went away does this mean im preg or my periods just went away bcuz of the shot periods can be delayed by taking the shot as well because you have had two shots already your period should be gone by now but breakthrough bleeding or spotting can occur because of being late with the shot i would recommend checking with your doctor as well to see what they say John F.
