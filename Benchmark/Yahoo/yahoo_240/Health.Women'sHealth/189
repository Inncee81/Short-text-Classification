question about sex being unusually painfull for the past year or so every time my fiance and i make love it is extremely painfull i have cramps for the next few days after we do it and he is scared to even do it with me sometimes is there anything i can do to stop this from happening i mean i thought making love felt good and it's not even bearable at all anyone experienced this i am going to make an appointment i was just seeing if anyone else has ever experienced this from the information i have looked up it may be ovarian cysts which can come and go from strees etc yes i have and it's not normal or so i have been told sounds like a trip to the gyn is warranted you want to rule out things like pelvic inflammatory disease or other things that could be causing you this pain seriously go to a male gyn and tell him you can't enjoy sex with your partner because it's too painful and he will make sure he does everything he can to help you find some relief for that it's in the male handbook i think but really they are very helpful and want to get to the cause of the pain so it's time to check it out i am assuming you have tried different positions to find one that is anatomically comfortable for you and your partner it could be an anatomy issue and you would be surprised at what a little positioning can do good luck Endometriosis Polycystic ovary syndrome Sexual intercourse Prostate cancer Ovarian cyst Orgasm Medicine Dysmenorrhea Pelvic inflammatory disease Anal sex Fecal incontinence Sin City Child sexuality Androgen insensitivity syndrome Happiness Infantilism Medical analysis of circumcision Milton H.
