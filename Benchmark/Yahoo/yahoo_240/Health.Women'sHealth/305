girls only period question i am days late and i know i am not pregnant i feel like i am going to start but haven't as of yet sorry for being graphic but my stomach is really upset which is not pretty i feel nauseaus and have a terrible headaches is this normal and does this mean my period could be bad and heavy i have to work tomorrow and thursday and i don't want them to be days from hell i think stress may be the cause of my period being late other that i eat heathy and exercise regularly if your positive your not pregnant and your period has never done this before then don't fret i promise you have no serious problems but i can't guarantee that it wont be heavy and bad when it does come the stress can be a serious factor though and it could cause you to miss your period for several months the headaches themselves if bad enough can cause your stomach to be upset and make you feel nauseous you can take an over the counter pain pill but also use bengay muscle rub icy hot works the best and rub it on wherever the pain feels like its coming from especially the temples neck shoulders and scalp keep it away from your eyes though this stuff will work wonders also you may wanna try drinking at least a cup of peppermint tea which you can get at any grocer or walmart you may be someone who hates tea but the peppermint will help control menstrual cramping get rid of gas and help with the upset stomach hope this helps Menstrual cycle Stomach cancer Urinary incontinence Breastfeeding Milton H.
