ladies i need your help so heres the deal i just got back from a long weekend visiting my lady friend at school and it dod not go as well as i wanted it to i found out that she has stoped loving me i think it is because of the fact that we have been hrs away all summer but she says that that is not the deal i also found out that she has slept w my old roomate over the summer when i found this stuff out i flipped i was punching poles and i ended up almost breaking my hand i thought that it was the rite thing to do i would rather punch something than some one i talked to her about me punching stuff the next day and i told her that i was sorry from flipping out and she said it was okay i still have really stong feelings for this girl and she does not have them for me anymore so wat im asking is wat should i do leave her alone or try to make her love me again i really did think that she was the one and now that we are done i feel lost and i dont no wat to do any help would be great i say get over her by filling your days with things that don't remind you of her if you had a really deep relationship that probably sounds impossible but i got over a year smothering relationship and i'm glad it has ended now you can't make anyone love you if you keep pursuing it will probably annoy her and make you look like a stalker you may be spending too much time on her to appreciate someone new or other things sorry about the sitch it does take time to move on so why not start now by erasing this question as soon as you are finish with it One Tree Hill (TV series) The McGuire Sisters Friends EastEnders Shaggy dog story Pitaten The Amber Spyglass Cliff Richard The Ashlee Simpson Show Jennifer Lopez Jon Secada Avenue Q The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe About a Boy Knots Landing Kodocha Good Times Spice Girls Time Out of Mind The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan W.I.T.C.H.
