embarrassing question my boyfriend and i have been together for like years i dread having sex with him because it's horrible it hasn't always been like this it is sometimes very hard to talk about anything with him i feel like i will hurt his feelings he just pounds me he won't let me on top even though i try he puts all his weight on me and moves his whole body not just his torso part it's just like he's laying there shaking or somthing he also stares at my face the whole time like he is dead and never blinks it kind of creaps me out what can i do to make things better when i try to talk to him he doesn't listen he just keeps on doing the same thing we have done different positions and i've told him to just go slow but it always ends up feeling like i'm being jack hammered or something no i don't fake having orgasms i just lay there and wait until he's done we don't have sex often but when we do it doesn't take long so i just get it over with to make him happy you need to sit him down in a non sexual setting and speak candidly with him about this tell him that you are not enjoying your sex life because of what he is doing explain that you want him to be more gentle and that you would like to be on top every once in a while if he doesn't change despite your conversation you may need to start withholding sex from him so he understands that you are serious also if you are faking orgasms when you have sex with him stop if he thinks you are having orgasms he thinks he is doing something right and will continue to do the same things if he notices that you are not having orgasms he may realize that he needs to make some changes Social rule Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sexual intercourse Shaggy dog story Orgasm Avenue Q Piccolo Junior Saga Child sexuality Sin City Professional wrestling holds Sexual orientation Theory of conduct Pitaten Anal sex Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The Catcher in the Rye Strap-on dildo Time Out of Mind The Shining (film) Human sexual behavior Humphrey Bogart The Amber Spyglass Conspiracy (TNG episode) Transactional analysis Prostate cancer Miss Saigon Jiddu Krishnamurti Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Sex and the City Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Futurama (TV series - season 5) It's All Gone Pete Tong The Ashlee Simpson Show The nature of God in Western theology Swingout God Emperor of Dune Fight Club Bondage (BDSM) Past teachings of Prem Rawat Jam (TV series) Ocean's Twelve Rich Mullins Smallville (Season 4) Blood Simple Friends EastEnders Tenshinhan Oral sex Survivor (novel) BDSM The Inside Haven (TNG episode) Poker jargon The Emancipation of Mimi Happiness Anne Rice Shit Vernon Schillinger Puberty The Death Gate Cycle About a Boy Fiddler on the Roof Laura Schlessinger Ben Johnson (athlete) Le Malade imaginaire The Big Goodbye (TNG episode) 2005 trial of Michael Jackson The Lovely Bones Kender Blood (computer game) Masturbation The Smoking Room Woman on top sex position Little Britain One Tree Hill (TV series) Coming of Age (TNG episode) Dog training Wilhelm Reich The Empty Child The Curse of Fenric Philosophy of language Beetle in an Anthill Goodness and value theory Night (book) The Silence (The Twilight Zone) Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Extras (sitcom) Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Incarnations of Immortality Rent (musical) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Jon Secada Phoebe Halliwell Bill O'Reilly (commentator) Scenes from a Memory
