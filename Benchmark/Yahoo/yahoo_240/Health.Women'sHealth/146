question about cerazette contaceptive pill hi iv been on the pop micronor for about yrs maybe longer and have had no problems with it i went to doctors today to get more and the doctor said i should try cerazette i have children all planned are only month old twins so when she mentioned that it can stop periods and ovulation and is more reliable i thought id get some to try children is plenty for us but now iv read the side effects im not sure i dont know if its worth swapping because micronor has always been reliable and never caused me any side effects anyone out there that uses has used cerazette would you like to tell me how you got on with it if you had any side effects etc to help me make up my mind it would be very helpful and appreciated thanks micronor is a progesterone only pill too its side effect profile is identical to micronor it also works in exactly the same way micronor also tends to stop ovulation and periods cerazette is a newer version of the same thing doctors and patients tend to prefer cerazette as it has a much longer safety window this means that unlike micronor which needs to be taken within hours of the set time each day cerazette has a hour window much like the combined pill there are few other differences Menstrual cycle Oral contraceptive Emergency contraception Progesterone Birth control Psoriasis IBM PC compatible Apollo 8 Stomach cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma In vitro fertilisation Urinary incontinence Ovulation Acne Pregnancy Puberty Progesterone only pill Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Gregory Goodwin Pincus Antidepressant Bipolar disorder Abortion debate Radiation therapy Polycystic ovary syndrome F.
