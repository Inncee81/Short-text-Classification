if i go to the doctor to check if i have uti will the doctor definitely examine my vagina i'm not uncomfortable with a doctor examining my private parts i just don't want it to be done for other reasons so is it definite that if i go in to check if i have uti urinary tract infection that my vagina will be examined hi your dr should not check your vagina for a uti that only requires a urine test you simply urinate in a cup and they stick a little 'dip stick' in it and test for particular levels of substances that may or may not be present to identify a uti the only time the dr should have to check your vagina is if you had pain or unusual dishcharge etc down there or were having your yearly papsmear women's exam or where pregnant not for uti in fact you can buy a test over the counter now at most drug stores to test at home for a uti much like a pregnancy test but if it's positive definately go see your dr for an antibiotic they can get serious if left untreated also if in the meantime if you are having bad burning or the feeling of 'urgency' still after empying your bladder like you still have to go but don't then there are products over the counter like azo or uristat that help with numbing the pain until you get to the dr but still go to the dr for antibiotics also don't be alarmed if you do get the azo or uristat pills they will turn your urine bright orange but they do help so much for the pain until the antibiotics kick in i hope this helps Urinary incontinence Urinary tract infection Prostate cancer Cystoscopy Urinary system Pregnancy Medical analysis of circumcision Endometriosis Multiple sclerosis Obstetrics Pneumonia Menstrual cup Menstrual cycle Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Urine Birth control Vulvovaginal health Psoriasis Fertility awareness Cancer Acne Tobacco smoking HIV test Hepatitis Oral contraceptive Prostatitis Medicine Breastfeeding Pharmacology Stomach cancer Female genital cutting Hip fracture Group A streptococcal infection Guinea pig Folic acid Human sexual behavior Urination Medical prescription Drug test Masturbation Rape Diabetic neuropathy Acute renal failure Hypoglycemia Vagina Pelvic inflammatory disease Lyme disease Gynaecology Kidney Cytomegalovirus Coeliac disease Ovarian cancer Bearberry In vitro fertilisation Benign prostatic hyperplasia Clinical depression Epididymitis Penicillin Sexual intercourse Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Diabetic retinopathy Cephalexin Lactobacillus acidophilus Diabetes mellitus Pyelonephritis Cirrhosis Traumatic brain injury Colorectal cancer Antibiotic Crohn's disease Schistosomiasis Colposcopy First aid Chlamydia Urethra Lupus erythematosus Miscarriage Abortion debate Vitamin C Intersex surgery Nephrology Cocaine IgA nephropathy Trichomoniasis Intravenous therapy Herpes simplex virus Diabetic ketoacidosis Episodes of Lost (Season 1)
