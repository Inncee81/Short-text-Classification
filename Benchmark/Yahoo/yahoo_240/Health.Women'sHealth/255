broken hymen i am a virgin however i think have managed to break my hymen i own a toy made from glass which i have ahd for sometime but recently i have been m sterb ting much more frequently and have been much rougher with myself now i am quite sore lol but no where inside the actual vagina it is specifically the hymen that hurts me if i touch it no the hymen is not inside the vagina it's not the muscles that hurt me it is only the hymen i was wondering if it is possible that i have broken it or torn it slightly it is fine if i leave it alone but it sort of burns aches if i touch it so have i done damage haha or am i just sore not worried but very curious thank you for answers thoughts please serious answers only for bigeyes some proof that the hymen is not inside the vagina and that you obviously have no idea what you are talking about http www soc ucsb edu sexinfo article teensex refid the hymen is external deal the hymen is external i have no idea why so many people seem to think it's inside or what their problem is anyway it can be quite common for girls to stretch or tear their hymen the way you did it's also possible you just made the entrance sore from jacking off too much with the friction i don't know how big your toy is but you may have gradually stretched your opening if you've been using different objects for a long period or you may have torn it before or maybe still not torn it if your glass toy is very small there probably would have been pain and blood and you would have noticed it incidentally i didn't know they made toys from glass and i think you should be very careful about using that just so it doesn't break or get sharp i would say wait a day or two without masturbating or doing anything and see if it gets better wash it carefully if the pain doesn't go after a couple of days then you might have done some more damage in which case i recommend seeing a doctor and being careful with yourself from now on Menstrual cup Anal sex Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Strap-on dildo Masturbation Condom Urinary incontinence Prostate cancer Fecal incontinence Virgin Tampon Deconstruction Vagina Human sexual behavior Domestic violence Child sexuality Traumatic brain injury Female genital cutting Androgen insensitivity syndrome Theory of conduct Childbirth Massage The Inside Babe Ruth Safe sex Oral sex Weight training Piccolo Junior Saga Land mine Pain Jon Secada Casting Milton H.
