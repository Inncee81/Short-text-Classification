i thought ortho tri cyclen lo was supposed to make acne better not worse i'm on my twelfth day using this birth control pill and i have noticeably more pimples than i did before starting it especially on my back they are small so is this just 'cause i just started using this pill how long will i have to wait for the acne to go down before the pill it wasn't even too bad ortho may cause your acne to get better but it's not a guarantee it is a listed side effect that your acne may worsen i wouldn't panic yet though you've only been on birth control for two weeks and your hormones are going through crazy cycles to regulate to the pill it will probably take three months before your body is used to it until that time expect side effects like spotting and breakouts don't stop taking the pill without talking to your doctor Acne Oral contraceptive Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Menstrual cycle Isotretinoin Fertility awareness Emergency contraception Puberty Anabolic steroid Prostate cancer Psoriasis Birth control Alanis Morissette Urinary incontinence Endometriosis Caffeine Androgen insensitivity syndrome Diazepam The Pet Sounds Sessions Pregnancy Baldness treatments Antidepressant Ben Johnson (athlete) Tocopherol Scar Operation Market Garden Piccolo Junior Saga Placebo Prohormone Resident Evil Outbreak: File 2 Old wives' tale Sleep Soap opera Rugby union Hey Jude Taxi Driver Knots Landing Testosterone Chronic fatigue syndrome Smallpox Kodocha Social rule Clinical depression Sleeping Murder Panic attack Theory of conduct Dietary fiber Hangover Spice Girls Hormone Ashton-Tate Neighbours Boom Town (Doctor Who) Abortion debate The Ashlee Simpson Show 1957 World Series Craps Migraine Shaggy dog story Blonde on Blonde The Inside Polycystic ovary syndrome Stomach cancer Apollo 8 Punk ideology Elvis Presley Humphrey Bogart Dexamethasone Milton H.
