questions about the pill when you take the pill you are told that in my case you must start on the first day of your period to make sure you are not pregnant then take it for days and stop for before starting the cycle again if you stop for days for example and only then start the next cycle dop you run the risk of getting pregnant why and not or and why can you get pregnant if you forget for days and not when you stop for a week what's the difference if someone could explain this to me as clearly as possible i'd be very grateful thanks ok first when i started my pills i was not told to start on the first day of my period i was told to start on the first sunday after my period started that way i would always start a new pack on sunday the only exception is if you start your period on sunday then you start your pills on sunday then you are supposed to take the live pills the ones that are actually filled with hormones for days weeks then you take the placebo pills or blank pills for days after that this is so your hormone levels change and allow your body to have a period it flushes everything out so you can start a new cycle your entire cycle the weeks of hormone pills and week of period pills equals days which is the average length of a woman's cycle if you go for more than days on blank pills or if you are like me and you just throw them away and take nothing for those period days then you run the risk of your body being off of those hormones for too long and you can get pregnant your body will ovulate approximately days after your period starts you have to start taking your pills again on time so that you can prevent the egg from entering the uterus and possibly getting fertilized and you becoming pregnant if you forget your pill for days earlier in your pill pack like during the first weeks you probably will not get pregnant you would just need to take two pills a day for two days so you can catch back up and be on track if you forget pills near the end of your pill pack during week then your period will probably start early and you just throw away the rest of the pack and start a new pack on the day that you would normally start taking them like sunday in my case hope that helped feel free to email me if you want Menstrual cycle Oral contraceptive Pregnancy Emergency contraception Fertility awareness Birth control Ovulation Endometriosis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Puberty Acne In vitro fertilisation Miscarriage Gregorian calendar Estrus cycle Computus Tocopherol Urinary incontinence Androgen insensitivity syndrome Polycystic ovary syndrome Tour de France Prostate cancer Psoriasis Hebrew calendar Ectopic pregnancy Twin Nutrition Folic acid Infertility Ovarian cancer Progesterone Hormone replacement therapy Human chorionic gonadotropin Malaria Obstetrics Turner syndrome Friends Homosexuality and transgender Sexual differentiation Orgasm Sleep Tide Intrauterine device Hormone Abortion Depo Provera Endometrium Antidepressant Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma National Football League Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Menstrual cup The Inside Kodocha Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Human height Fasting Tobacco smoking Caffeine Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Gregory Goodwin Pincus Resident Evil Outbreak: File 2 Atherosclerosis Conker's Bad Fur Day Sexual reproduction Breast cancer Female reproductive system (human) Biology and sexual orientation Neighbours Religion and abortion Glucocorticoid Ovary Maya calendar Pregnancy test Tag Poker jargon Signal transduction Ocean's Twelve Swyer syndrome Volleyball Morning sickness Chemical abortion Fertilisation Diazepam Cryptorchidism Time Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Infantilism Resident Evil Outbreak Vitamin D Weight training The Dalek Invasion of Earth Social rule Extreme Programming Sumo
