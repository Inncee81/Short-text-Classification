contraceptive injection question i had the depo provera injection week ago friday june i had it done on the rd day of my period that period was normal and lasted days but a few days later i started 'spotting' and its still happening is this normal also do you thinks its safe to have sex without protection while this is happening thanks in advance x yeah spotting is normal with depo especially at first it will take a few months to settle into a pattern which is normal for you everyone is different with depo some still have a period of sorts some spot some have no bleeding whatsoever time will tell what you will have as a normal pattern it takes a few injections before things settle into a pattern i can't remember what the initial precautions are with depo you would have been told to use protection for the first days you're protected after that i suggest you make a note in your calendar as to when you spot or bleed and keep this for the first year and you should see a pattern emerge which will help you anticipate when you will spot if indeed you do at all good luck Depo Provera Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Birth control Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma She Loves You Hebrew calendar Safe sex Progesterone only pill Stomach cancer Diabetic retinopathy Social rule Stroke Migraine Julian day Liturgical year Dominical letter Oral contraceptive Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 Gregorian calendar Jewish holiday Abortion debate Urinary incontinence Roman calendar Billboard Hot 100 Dialysis Psoriasis First aid Computus I Want to Hold Your Hand Japanese calendar Pregnancy John F.
