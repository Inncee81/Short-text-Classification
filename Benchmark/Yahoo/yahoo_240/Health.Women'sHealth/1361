i have never had an orgasm is this normal in young women thats could this be the issue when i was i walked in on my mom and her boyfriend doing a and ran out crying because i didnt know what he was doing i thought he was hurting her it mess me up to the point where i started pleasing myself at a young age did i mess myself up by doing that my mind be thinking things doing sex and im always talking and not focusing is there a way i can fix this even when i try to focus i still dont achieve you still may be traumatized by that experience and so that adds on to your muscle tensions when your being pleasured you should relax especially if you have a partner have him help you relax by talking to you when he is doing things if you drink doesn't matter if its moderate or heavy drinking try to take a few shots of some sort of alcoholic drink and either do it to yourself or have someone else do it it'll help you relax greatly and make it possible for you to reach orgasm i think the real reason for you not being able to achieve it is that you think too much therefore your muscles are tense in that area and your brain isn't focused on the pleasure like it should be best of luck to you Orgasm Social rule Masturbation Sexual dysfunction Child sexuality Anal sex Oral sex Theory of conduct Urinary incontinence Human sexual response cycle Alcoholics Anonymous The Smoking Room Aikido Premature ejaculation Massage Shaggy dog story Anorgasmia Human sexual behavior Out-of-body experience Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The Shining (film) Breastfeeding Sin City Sauna Neurofeedback EastEnders Sex and the City Traumatic incident reduction Puberty Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Taxi Driver Sexual intercourse Nicomachean Ethics Childbirth Soap opera Clinical depression American Psycho Friends Pitaten Alcoholic beverage Sexual abstinence Traumatic brain injury Badly Drawn Kitties Rape Scenes from a Memory About a Boy Bernard Williams Kodocha Great Teacher Onizuka Infantilism Bondage (BDSM) Bates Method Dualism (philosophy of mind) Sex toy Sexual orientation Caffeine Humphrey Bogart Reflexology Episodes of Lost (Season 1) RuneScape quests Hypnosis Sexual arousal BDSM The nature of God in Western theology Something Positive Diving Bipolar disorder The Inside Birth control Happiness History of sex Blonde on Blonde Sleep apnea Avenue Q Alcoholism Karen Horney Blood (computer game) Malcolm in the Middle Kim Possible Calvin and Hobbes Coffee Laura Schlessinger Equine conformation Addiction Scientology beliefs and practices Milton H.
