unprotected sex what sould i do not a pregnacy question ok i had unprotected sex with a guy that i know gets around alot when things started to get steamy we didnt stop to use a condom i could tell from the way he was acting that he may not use them regulary and probably dosnt have protected sex with many of his other partners i feel a dirty today and i am worried that i may pf gotton something what should i do this is not a normal thing for me and i am normally so very careful should i wait a particular period of time before getting tested by that i mean should i wait a litle while incase i go and get tested now and it comes up negative but then later on i notice that i do have something do sti and std's show in your system straight away some will show up straight away and some will take a while it can take up to months for hiv to show up so there are usually follow up tests and a longer wait than for the other results what you need to do is go to the doctor straight away and explain the situation he or she will be able to do the appropriate tests now and advise you on follow up treatments or testing don't wait to go though it's best to get it sorted out as quickly as possible also make sure you don't have unprotected sex again until the clearence period is over not that you should ever to make sure that you don't potentially infect anyone else mistakes happen and obviously you know not to make the same mistake twice but don't beat yourself up too much over it you're doing the right thing now by taking responsibility for your actions good luck and i hope everything is ok take care Safe sex AIDS Anal sex Human sexual behavior Social rule Prostate cancer Crystal methamphetamine and sex AIDS pandemic Hepatitis C Condom Infantilism HIV Oral sex HIV test Herpes simplex virus Harm reduction Barebacking Sexual intercourse Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Sex education Pelvic inflammatory disease Medical analysis of circumcision Sexual orientation Fertility awareness Pornographic movie Gonorrhoea Sexual abstinence Breastfeeding Rape AIDS in Africa Theory of conduct Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Abortion debate Bioethics of neonatal circumcision Prostitution Pornographic actor Gay slang Stomach cancer Pitaten Gender role Prenatal diagnosis Child sexuality Monogamy Andrew Sullivan Diving Gay bathhouse Psoriasis Socrates Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Karma Cytomegalovirus Equal Protection Clause Malaria Transactional analysis Chucky Pancamo Polyamory Vernon Schillinger Antiretroviral drug Human adaptation to space Meme Poker jargon Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Orgy Health insurance A Canticle for Leibowitz Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Unsafe sexual practices Time Out of Mind The Amazing Race Emergency contraception Androgen insensitivity syndrome Genital wart Jeopardy!
