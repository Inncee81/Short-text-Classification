i had a miscarriage three months ago and and i only just had my period only the period is different to normal i'm real heavy and it feels like it did when i was miscarrying rather than just a normal period like i wont bleed at all and then it just floods out and the pain isn't really like cramps there is a very very small chance i could be pregnant again but i was wondering if this was just normal after miscarriage you should go see your doctor and see if this is normal after a miscarriage Miscarriage Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Stomach cancer Endometriosis Obstetrics Intact dilation and extraction Fertility awareness The Inside Abortion Childbirth Premature birth Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Polycystic ovary syndrome Coeliac disease Endometrial cancer Miscarriage of justice Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Abortion debate Morning sickness Twin Dinah Marler Chemical abortion Neighbours The Caves of Androzani Gonorrhoea Nuclear fallout Pelvic inflammatory disease Obstetrical hemorrhage EastEnders Sex and the City Hemorrhagic stroke Deluge (mythology) Knife Hollyoaks History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Spina bifida Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an First aid The O.C.
