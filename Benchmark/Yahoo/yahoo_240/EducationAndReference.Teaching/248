how can teachers help their students on the first day of school many children are nervous and anxious how can we help them succeed thank you i'm not sure what grade you teach but most students just expect their teachers to be fair and provide them with guidelines regardless of age start out by introducing yourself and explain that you expect positive results from them and are there to help them succeed but not do all of the work for them then next tell them specifically what your course will attempt to teach them and then explain to them in a positive way what you expect from them and what they can expect from you then move into what they are going to learn from your course and the ways that is accomplished including class etiquette and participation respecting their peers and you as the instructor positive learning environment and other aspects like that then you need to stress that everyone learns at different levels and you will do your best to accomodate the different personalities in your class but you must stress that no question related to your subject matter is considered stupid or dumb and that anyone who does not understand the material should be comfortable to ask you without feeling silly or made fun of this is why the what's expected of each other part is so important after that just kind of sit back a little and interact with them and let them interact with each other for a little bit then you will have a better idea of how to handle your specific classroom dynamic from the atmosphere they establish you will also have the opportunity to observe how they relate to each other by listening to them and watching their behavior when they first arrive for class and sit down then later in the class session after introducing yourself and the guidelines ask them if they have any questions of you about the course and you should be able to have a better idea of how things going also you want to make sure that you let them know that you will answer their questions but only if they address you in a polite way be acknowledging hands in order to get your attention and not just shouting out things first and talking over their classmates when someone else is speaking you should be able to present this information without seeming like a tyrant or authoritarian and i'm sure you will do fine just remember it is the role of the teacher to teach provide useful information provide structure give guidance and encouragement when necessary command respect and preserve authority without stating such and being contradictory hypocritical to setting a good example obviously you modify your introduction and instructions to make this age appropriate but i'm sure you will do fine just remember that you can't satisfy every student but most of childern students are usually good kids and are not looking to encounter problems it's the parents that are often times more of the problem or the cause of potential problems so communication with everyone is key however i don't think you should discuss school policies specifically because then that puts the emphasis on the school having authority over you and even though we know this is true you don't want to emphasis that because that diminishes the key role you play as the authority figure to them it's just like in business you never encourage employees to appeal to upper management until they have tried direct communication with their immedicate boss supervisor again communication is key and also establishing guidelines without ever referring to them as such and without directly saying you are in charge because for some reason those terms seem to make students tense Scientology beliefs and practices Education in the People's Republic of China Past teachings of Prem Rawat Second language acquisition Education in the United States Intelligent design movement A Course In Miracles Education Social psychology Economics Alexander Technique Education in Japan Current teachings of Prem Rawat Philosophy of language Homeschooling Theory of conduct Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Ethics Fair use Logic Transactional analysis Strategic management GED Aikido Catechism Milton H.
