good elearning g science course for my kid my son wants to be homeschooled for valid reasons and i am looking for a good onloine grade science course for him any suggestions i don't know of any pre fab online science courses per se most science instruction in schools is moving away from pure textbook approaches one source only towards more hands on approaches focusing on experimentation and design processes the online learning resources i've encountered have been just that tools to draw upon to teach concepts not fully designed courses for a child to read work their way through it seems to me that if you are going to be responsible for your son's homeschooling your first step is to check out what the topics are that he needs to be learning about in your home state province or country most departments of education are posting these online nowadays then to prime the pump with some basic information you could take out a membership with brainpop com for the planning of some actual learning activities you could look at a resource like curriculum navigator at the site listed below it helps you to plan lesson and unit activities that frequently come with some support materials that are only a click away once again i don't know whether this resource will match up with what your son needs for where you are living create an account at http www edu gov mb ca cn login jsp then click on create learning experiences it's pretty straightforward from there on in once again your government's department of education or local school district is your most accurate resource for what your child should be learning and how they could be learning it good luck let me know how it goes hi there kept thinking about your problem and did some looking came up with some more info found the following recommended websites in the homeschooling discussion area you might want to check in with people there who are used to dealing with this subject http www sonlight com by level html http www k com the first one is a christian based program that seems to have programming geared to what i assume is your child's age range it just seems a little difficult to nail down a clear grade level the site seemed to be set up in a quite byzantine manner so i wasn't able to figure out whether it was set up to take just one subect at that level or whether you need to sign on for the whole program the second site a secular one was set up very clearly however after being very clearly labeled kindergarten to grade five the science options are just generally labelled by broad categories earth science life science and physical science their recommendation for grade is essentially choose one i gathered from scanning your other questions that you are based in ontario i hadn't been clear on your location when i had first responded to your question if you are anywhere in canada the curriculum navigator topics for grade eight science should be applicable wishing you great luck still hoping to hear how it goes hi there more information check out http www connectionsacadamy com they seem to have a very clear grade eight course option Education in the United States GED Education in the People's Republic of China Education Waldorf Education Gmail Education in Japan Economics Logic Scientology beliefs and practices Software engineering Intelligent design movement Graduate school Legal research Teach the Controversy Domain Name System Open access Mathematics Object-oriented programming Education in Australia Massachusetts Institute of Technology No Child Left Behind Act JavaServer Pages Prostate cancer XML Law school Philosophy Geography Uniform Resource Locator Extreme Programming Experiential education HTTP cookie Biology Secondary education in Japan High school Cognitive science E-learning Education in Germany Public education Enterprise content management HyperText Transfer Protocol Education in Hong Kong Grade (education) World Wide Web Geographic information system Open Directory Project IB Diploma Programme Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Psychology Education in Malaysia Education in Singapore Creation-evolution controversy Theory of conduct Alcoholics Anonymous PLATO Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Tripartite System Education reform Expert system The Skeptical Environmentalist Medical school Civil Air Patrol Python programming language Presuppositional apologetics PHP Law of value Science Physics Kasparov versus The World A-level Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Boy Scouts of America Literacy Intelligent design Common Unix Printing System Motivation Microeconomics Caulfield Grammar School Search engine optimization A Course In Miracles Web crawler Compiler optimization Charter school Database management system Advanced Placement Program Center for Science and Culture Cross site scripting Test (student assessment) Education in Romania Autism
