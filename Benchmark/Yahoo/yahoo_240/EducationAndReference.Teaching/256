question for teachers in grad school or who already have their grad degree i am going into my th year of teaching and i need to take classes to renew my teaching license i want to start graduate school and work towards something rather than take any class just to fulfill the requirement the problem is i'm not sure what program to take i love being in the classroom now but in years i might want to move on to something else i am considering a curriculum program or maybe a reading specialist but i am still very unsure any suggestions or experience would be appreciated by the way i am a first grade teacher now i did the same as you are considering i simply went for a basic curriculum and instruction masters i was lucky enough to find a program where the profs were excellent i keep in touch with a couple of them to this day i too may want to switch it up a while from now but my thinking was i dont want to do a program that i will not use immediately in years the information will be old your degree certainly still valid but why not wait until you are closer and take classes then so my plan is if i decide to do something different i join another program good luck Teacher Education in the United States No Child Left Behind Act Education in the People's Republic of China Professor Education Education in Japan Homeschooling Education in Portugal Education in Germany Master's degree Medical school Education in France Secondary education in Japan __cole Polytechnique Education in Romania Glen Ridge, New Jersey Nurse Education in Sweden Intelligent design movement Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Education in Taiwan Physician Tripartite System Juris Doctor Education reform Emerson College Standardized testing Bellarmine College Preparatory Academia Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Massachusetts Institute of Technology Charles William Eliot College Lyceum of the Philippines Teach the Controversy Bologna process Librarian Secondary education in France IB Diploma Programme New York State Department of Education High school Columbia University University of Pennsylvania Law School Education in Malaysia Middle school GED Community High School, Ann Arbor, Michigan Education in Australia Shreveport, Louisiana Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism Physical therapy Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Grade (education) Education in Finland U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School Waldorf Education Asperger syndrome Rabbi Danish Folkeskole Education Doctor of Philosophy Education in the Republic of Ireland Gwinnett University Center Franklin W.
