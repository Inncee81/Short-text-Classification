what are the most important things to keep in mond when tutoring a young child i start tutoring a young child about the age of english language today and its my first time it will be a second language for her i was wondering if anyone has any advice or some guidlines i could follow i meant in mind hehe i've worked with kids ages and swear by the following rules dont ever forget that a child is a child first don't put adult pressures and expectations on them children learn best when they are having fun it just means you have got to spend a little more time in preparation making your lessons interesting and your method of teaching i call it sharing knowledge creative and at times unconventional children are restless by nature and get bored easily its okay if they dont want to sit for too long or want to talk about something else i found that doing a few activities and lessons in the garden or incorporating a little trip to a place that could tie in with the theme for the day was a huge learning experience for the child they just love learning through songs story telling and word play i taught them basic words and phrases in spanish chinese italian by playing corners adding a new set of words to the corners every other day above all let them perceive you as being a friend and a fun one at that and that's half your battles won good luck and enjoy yourself Social rule Avenue Q Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Philosophy of language Kender About a Boy Education Numerology Relative clause Storytelling Great Teacher Onizuka Philo Dictionary Extreme Programming Socrates Quotation mark Esperanto as an international language Singlish Faye Wong The Catcher in the Rye Hearing impairment Mnemonic Swami Vivekananda Theory of conduct Martial art Pinyin Cognitive science Charles Dickens The Jazz Singer English language Spanish verbs Time Out of Mind Hungarian language Novel Chinglish Meaning of life Japanese tea ceremony American Sign Language Craps Education in Hong Kong Charles Darwin's education Languages of Hong Kong Philosophy American and British English differences Suzuki method Pitaten Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Chinese language Spanish language Mojave people Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Korean language Drama Second language acquisition Maison Ikkoku Bill Peet German language Blonde on Blonde Little Britain Gerund Opus Dei English grammar I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Ocean's Twelve Japanese language Mao (game) Current teachings of Prem Rawat Kodocha Ido Transactional analysis Non-native pronunciations of English The Amber Spyglass Contract bridge Religious Society of Friends Sesotho language Aikido Piccolo Junior Saga Max Stirner Sant Mat Teacher Endowment (Mormonism) Education reform Sant Thakar Singh Literacy Phonics Mathematics Love Avicenna Electrophysiology Richard Feynman God Emperor of Dune Language education Parkour Cultural relativism Spot the Dog Indian English
