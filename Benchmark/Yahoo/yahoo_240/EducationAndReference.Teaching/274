have ever just not gone to a workshop you signed up for if it's a free workshop not required during the summer and the workshop is full is it a big deal if you just don't go have you ever just not shown up just because it is free to the teacher doesn't mean your district or school isn't paying per person if you cancel enough in advance you might save your school money i know when i give workshops the cancellation deadline is week notice other wise the school will be paying for that persons spot unless they fill it with someone else it is not fair to the school nor the presenter to not give notice but understandably i too have ducked out of a few pointless workshops in my day not my own of course that would be really bad business practice lol have a good workshop or cough cough sick day before school starts up again Professor Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?
