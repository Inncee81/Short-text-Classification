should i take this job i am a special ed teacher and i was offered a new job by a different school district this year i resigned from my last position the end of the school year the reason being i didn't like the micromanagement lack of flexibility criticism or the severe needs of the students the position at this school is a little different but it is still special ed and the principal seems eager to hire me my dilema is that i have some hesitations with accepting this position because of the problems of this previous year the real pro for this position is the salary i'm looking at other job positions within the school system non teaching accepting a different position will mean less pay but less responsibility more flexibility and less stress please give me any constructive input or advice i just want to make sure that i am not over thinking this thing or jumping the gun it seems to me that you've burned out on special ed which happens to many se teachers at any time in their career how long have you been an se teacher teaching is hard enough but the trials and difficulties double with special ed students so it's no wonder that you're conflicted perhaps the best way to deal with your dilemma is to take the compensation element out of the equation and consider the importance of reduced stress peace of mind and the feeling that you're doing your best in the capacity which suits your current frame of mind conversely if you want to leave the compensation element in consider how much of a decrease in salary you have to take to accept the non teaching position would you be able to adjust your standard of living or spending habits to be able to afford the decreased salary are the benefits of the non teaching job similar or would you have to compromise benefits as well i believe peace of mind and a stress free life are tantamount to living a good life but you have to decide what will allow you to live that way i hope this helps good luck Education in the People's Republic of China Microeconomics Professor Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Aikido Education in Japan Graduate school Gross domestic product Unemployment Economic inequality Tai Chi Chuan A Course In Miracles Supply and demand Boston Public Past teachings of Prem Rawat Education Publicly funded medicine Principal-agent problem Scientology beliefs and practices Alexander Technique Education in Portugal Education in the United States Affirmative action Salary cap Dog agility Philosophy of space and time Education in Germany Operational amplifier Social rule Tariff Inflation Current teachings of Prem Rawat Alcoholics Anonymous Game programmer Car handling Contract Capitalism Free trade Final Fantasy XI Reiki Air traffic controller Secondary education in Japan Tripartite System Extreme Programming Summa Theologiae No Child Left Behind Act Infantilism Software engineering Teach the Controversy Meditation Strategic management Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Welding Hogwarts subjects Education in Hong Kong Insurance Equine conformation Corporate governance Nuclear power Separation of church and state Labor theory of value Prisoner's dilemma Freeters Socrates Software patent debate 2004-05 NHL lockout Education in Romania Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Kyoto Protocol Mutual fund Property (ownership right) Psychoanalysis Wal-Mart Call centre Unemployment benefit Workers' compensation Second language acquisition Homeschooling Non-native pronunciations of English Jet engine New Deal Breastfeeding Canadian and American health care systems compared Chinese martial arts Life insurance Mountain bike Democracy Economics Indian Round Table Conferences 1931-1933 Time Out of Mind Workplace democracy Israeli Arab
