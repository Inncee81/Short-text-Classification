violent kids in class in my class there are two boys who seem to believe that violence is the only way to react to any situation the other day these two notorious boys fought in class boy a slapped boy b which caused boy b to punch boy a this is just one instance of their violent behaviour what do you suggest i do to make them more calm and rational and not instinctively punch someone i agree that you should take the situation to the school psychologist or counselor you can try whole class activities like role playing somehow incorporate life skills into the classroom if you have time it depends on the ages too you could have the students watch videos play with puppets read stories about anger management and violent tendancies i know that in some districts it is difficult to get additional help so have you tried talking to each of the boys to see what is going on there is obvisously an underlying reason try being their friend try your best to relate to their issues try to find out their interests and maybe fit in a lesson around that focus their attention on their interests instead of their worries even though they are children they still feel the pressures of life they just don't know how to focus it good luck with this one Domestic violence Hikikomori Aikido Boston Public Martial art Second language acquisition Social rule Empathy Transactional analysis Milton H.
