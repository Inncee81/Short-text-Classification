why do schools favor the primary parent divorce especially those earning more income don't they teachers staff and administrators realize how difficult this is for the student in the u s many students come from dual or two family households the secondary parent does not like to be treated unfairly and out of the loop and the child does not like witnessing this joint shared custody the secondary parent lives in different city due to job the child goes back and forth between two households even if there is actual custody as opposed to say physical and legal schools often have a records system that holds one primary address when a mailing has to go out someone clicks a mouse and a printer spits out one address label per student it's best to have whichever parent is in the school records as primary address this schools get lots and lots of angry phone calls from non custodial parents trying to do an end run around their custody decrees so if the custodial parent of record makes the request to have your child's record flagged for double mailings it will carry more weight and frankly if a high school child is upset to witness this the high school child should say something to the teachers i have more than once witnessed a child who says to teachers you only need to notify the one parent my other one has nothing to do with me and then turns to the upset other parent and says gosh mom dad i don't know why they're doing this it sure makes me upset too Fathers' rights Divorce One Tree Hill (TV series) Pledge of Allegiance Domain Name System Kodocha Education in the People's Republic of China School choice Polyamory CPU cache Friends Motion picture rating system Education in Germany Education in the United States Visitation Charmed Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Education Primary education Boston Public Education in Portugal Waldorf Education Interstate Highway High school Secondary education in France Fathers' rights movement in the UK Plame affair United States Postal Service Hikikomori Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Tai Chi Chuan Status of religious freedom in Sudan No Child Left Behind Act Culture of the United States Education in Japan Mach kernel Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Intelligence quotient Status of religious freedom in Malaysia Alberto Gonzales Charter school Barack Obama Terri Schiavo Mouse (computing) Education in England 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Shaggy dog story SAT Education in Singapore Grade (education) Education in Hong Kong Appeal Section 28 Children of God Rent (musical) Private school Israeli Arab Social Security (United States) AppleTalk John Edwards My Parents are Aliens George W.
