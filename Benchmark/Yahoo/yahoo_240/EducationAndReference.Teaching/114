to be an accounting teacher i have been in college for two years now going for a bachelor's in accounting and business administration i love accounting but i sometimes ponder what it would be like to be a teacher i enjoy being able to inspire people with thoughts and ideas if i wanted to become a high school accounting teacher like the man who inspired me to enjoy accounting would i need to go back and get a degree in education teaching too or would the road i am on right now with my accounting degree eventually lead me to be a teacher i just figured this was a way to be able to do both of my passions i love accounting but i don't want to be an accountant and i think it would be really great to be a teacher they really deserve a lot more credit than they get sometimes in fact if it wasn't for my high school accounting teacher i probably wouldn't even be in college trying to get a degree is it possible to be both without going back for a teaching degree its good to se somebody praising a teacher well comming to your question generally to be a teacher u need a master degree but in most reputed colleges and universitites a degree in teaching is mandatory since u have passion in teaching doing a degree in teaching is worth spending money and time u need not worry because u r already in the correct path only thing is that u need some expertise in accounting hope for the best best of luck Education in Germany Graduate school Teacher Education in Portugal Education in the United States College Avenue Q Education Church of Christ, Scientist Master's degree Chinese University of Hong Kong Far Eastern University The College of New Jersey Socrates Juris Doctor Buddhism Theory of conduct Community college Columbia University University of Houston Master of Business Administration Academic degree Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Finland Medical school A Course In Miracles Academia Great Teacher Onizuka Education in Japan Education in Malaysia Professor Ball State University Law school Ramakrishna City and Guilds of London Institute Degrees of Oxford University Christian Brothers University Salt Lake Community College Jiddu Krishnamurti Western Kentucky University Stoicism Summa Theologiae Blood on the Tracks Athabasca University University of Phoenix Reiki Israel ben Eliezer Past teachings of Prem Rawat Education reform Current teachings of Prem Rawat Divine grace Knots Landing Brian Jones (musician) Librarian Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania Ludwig Wittgenstein Aesthetic Realism Shaggy dog story Education in France Indiana State University Charter school University of Chester Education in the Republic of Ireland Education in Australia Seneca College Confucius Franklin W.
