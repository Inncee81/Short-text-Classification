high school teaching question what's your best get to know you activity i'm thinking of doing a couple of different things on the first day but i'm looking for some fresh ideas i'm a high school english teacher and it's important that the kids feel safe in the classroom i start off with an introductory activity so that it won't be so hard to share work with strangers in the following months for those of you that think that building trust in the classroom isn't important i recommend taking some education classes sure it's easy to say that it's a waste of time but how hard is it for a year old to share a poem that he or she has written think of it that way before you answer you're right kids wig out when it comes to sharing what they've written especially when it's got to be shared in speech form it's good to give them some practice early on have you heard of the toilet paper game you ask the kids to tear off a typical amount of toilet paper that they'd use if they've done the activity before they might wise up and just tear off a square but it'll still be silly fun once everyone's torn off their share explain to them that each square they have will represent one thing they'll share about themselves to the class start off yourself to get the ball rolling another thing you could try is to have them write down things about themselves tell them one of the things can't be true when they read them to the class the class has to decide which fact is the one that's made up not only does it allow the students to share things about themselves it also forces them to be creative and it engages the whole class when it comes time to guessing have them write down their top or top of things they like movies music tv shows books for books might as well say you can just let them share them with the class or you can have them interview classmates for the answers and then let their partners introduce them to the class w that information another twist would be to let one person read one of their favorite movies anyone else who has that movie listed on their own top or stands behind that person's desk it'll help them see what they have in common with one another Theory of conduct A Course In Miracles GED Shaggy dog story Teach the Controversy Extreme Programming I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Columbine High School massacre Drama Scientology beliefs and practices Aesthetic Realism Beavis and Butt-head Socrates Floppy disk Avenue Q Education in the United States Experiential education CPU cache Kodocha Education Aerial (dance move) Big Brother (USA TV series) Care Bears Whose Line Is It Anyway?
