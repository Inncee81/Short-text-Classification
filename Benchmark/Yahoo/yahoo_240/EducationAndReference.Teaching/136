teaching job questions i'm a recent graduate and i just received my first teaching job when i was on the job market i had hoped to receive a teaching job close to home however there were few jobs so i branched out and the job that i ended up getting has a twenty five minute commute each way now that it's mid august the school district that i had hoped to work for has posted a lot of positions why do big school districts wait until the last minute to hire teachers won't they get the teachers who are the least qualified and have been turned down the most what do you think about this practice i'm not planning on reneging on my contract it just makes me wish that i'd waited to accept the offer hey at least i have a job yep just like others said many people back out of contracts during the summer of course it's for various reasons got married found a better job parent kid got seriously ill etc it sucks but people do leave jobs like this at the last minute and really this might be standard for most teacher contracts but mine says i have up to before the new school year begins to resign without reprecussions i kind of have the same issue as you but i also have to take my child to his school as well and this year i have a newborn so she will need to be dropped off at daycare so really the school i work at is about miles from my house but i'll have to leave about an hour before i need to be there to get everyone to the right place hubby cannot help out because he goes in the complete opposite direction but ilsedog answer above mine makes a good point about living and working in different towns i've been trying for the last two years to get a job in the district i live in i may rethink that speaking of trying to get a job in the district i live in my town is growing so quickly that the district is opening a new elementary school each school year so jobs are certainly available and in mass quantities and yes they did call me last year about weeks into the school year hello if i quit the job i've already started to take their job then the job i quit will have my certification taken away making me not qualified for the other job and this was a job that had been posted since the march before obviously i was not their st choice that's ok the job i have is fantastic i just thought it would be nice to cut that hour commute down to about minutes in other words i'm right there with ya babe No Child Left Behind Act Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Romania Education in Germany Graduate school Education in the United States SAT GED Software engineering Education in Portugal Social rule Canadian House of Commons Charter school Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Boston and Lowell Railroad Professor Poker jargon Avenue Q Unemployment Education reform Hogwarts subjects Current teachings of Prem Rawat Education Breastfeeding Pittsburgh Steelers Freeters Affirmative action Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Principal-agent problem Warren Buffett Air traffic controller Economics Pitaten Good Times Ernest Harmon Air Force Base Springfield Elementary School Past teachings of Prem Rawat Academia Labor theory of value Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Day care Efficiency wages Public education Time Out of Mind Education in France Contract Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Economic inequality Intelligent design movement Education in Australia Rabbi Education in Taiwan Escape from New York Wal-Mart Homeschooling High school IB Diploma Programme Make money fast Boston Public Unemployment benefit Troms__ I.L.
