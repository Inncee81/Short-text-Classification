why science for year old kids why not you introduce them to science what it is how it works you can give an over view of some of the more widely known branches starting with medicine and doctors and how they use devices and substances to check your state of heatlh you can talk about chemistry and show them litmus paper and how it changes color testing for acids and bases litmus paper and a lemon or some vinegar you can show how acids and bases react such as the vinegar and baking soda experiment you can talk about astronomy and if you're up with it you can tell them a few things about what's out at night such as right how jupiter bright and high in the south right after dark and how it's planet and not a star you can also explain that science goes hand in hand with arithemetic and numbers that will help stimulate an interest in math for some students there are probably some nice introductory videos from time life that can be shown you can get a dual thermometer set up and put a wet paper or cloth over one bulb and leave the other alone and spin this on a handle then take the temperature readings the wet bulb is diffeerent from the dry bulb if you subtract the numbers you can use to chart to show the humidity or amount of mosture in the air this can be a math demonstration using large number such as from is and from seven is zero so it's an degree different and you can find on a chart what this means in humidy again it shows how arithmetic and science work together Carbon dioxide Mathematics Mnemonic Experiment Acetic acid Mercury (element) Battery (electricity) Acid Incandescent light bulb Light-emitting diode Vinegar Lighting Alum Vitamin C Sulfuric acid Science Francis Crick Electrophysiology Water (molecule) Education in the United States PH Graduate school William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sun Cold fusion Chocolate Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Hydrochloric acid Strap-on dildo CPU cache Technetium Air conditioning Physical science Garlic Henri Poincar__ Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Geber Amateur astronomy Onion Physics Linus Pauling Traditional Chinese medicine Scientific method Laser Glass Invisible ink Hydrogen Urinary incontinence Sulfur Ultraviolet Opportunity rover Explosive material CPU design Dairy Robert B.
