is making the crap money that teachers get worth having the summer off summer's off i've been teaching for years and making about a year during the last summers i've been going to graduate school to finish a master's degree so not exactly time off normally i spend the summers researching material for the next year i start making lesson plans revise my curriculum rewrite tests quizzes etc i use the time to take advantage of training opportunities and professional development some teachers choose to use the summers to write or work on projects others spend time with their families some travel many get jobs or fellowships there are plenty who go back to school to further their education get ahead of the trends learn something new etc others still have hobbies they enjoy dedicating some time to developing teaching isn't something most people go into for the money we become teachers because we have a genuine desire to work with students we want to help future be the best they can and achieve their dreams it's an incorrect idea that those who can do and those who can't teach it is instead those who can teach sorry i got a little side tracked and jumped on my soap box i'm a little passionate about what i do and why i do it Education in the United States Graduate school Teacher Homeschooling Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Germany Education Education in Portugal Physician Education in Hong Kong College Master's degree Standardized testing Education in Japan Hogwarts subjects Columbia University Quizbowl Alexander Technique Lyceum of the Philippines Waldorf Education Software engineering Librarian Experiential education Education in Australia Juris Doctor Medical school Education in the Republic of Ireland Caulfield Grammar School Academia Education in Taiwan Great Teacher Onizuka University of Chicago Teach the Controversy Doctor of Philosophy Reiki Welcome Back, Kotter Education in Austria Indian Institutes of Management Education in Romania Professor Robert Hutchins Nurse Law school PLATO Education in France American University Propaedeutic value of Esperanto SAT Tai Chi Chuan Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Higher education Software testing Bah__'__ Faith and Education Medicine Danish Folkeskole Education Avenue Q Open University (Netherlands) Chinese University of Hong Kong NHH Genseiryu Physical therapy Center for Science and Culture A-level School counselor Teaching English as a Foreign Language The College of New Jersey Rabbi Charter school Education reform Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism Tianjin University Space colonization Zen U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School Bologna process Eagle Claw Education in Albania Athabasca University Friends Jacob's Pillow Jiddu Krishnamurti Secondary education in Japan Jewish studies Cooperative education Cornell University Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology National Certificate of Educational Achievement Gifted Education Programme (Singapore) Anti-intellectualism Dice __cole Polytechnique Stevens Institute of Technology Secondary education in France Dog agility Franklin W.
