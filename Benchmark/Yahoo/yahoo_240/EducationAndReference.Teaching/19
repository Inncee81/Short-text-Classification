how much supplies does a school provide a teacher i'm going to need a lot of certain supplies and wonder will i have to go buy them or the school provides as many as you need how does this work the only place you are going to get that answer is to ask the school i would suggest asking someone who has taught at your school for a couple of years not only will they be able to tell you what the school will provide but they can explain the process to request supplies if it's acceptable to ask the students to contribute or if the pto parent or community organization contributes anything if you do need to purchase supplies yourself save your receipt for your taxes teachers get to claim up to or somewhere around there each year for classroom supplies and if your school has you purchase supplies and then they will reimburse you make sure that the items on the receipt are only school supplies if you have to purchase dog food and deodorant you'll need to have them on a separate receipt Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Homeschooling Education in the United States Teach the Controversy Teacher Establishment Clause of the First Amendment Economics Labor theory of value Education reform Town meeting Reaganomics Student loan Primary education Boston Public Separation of church and state United Kingdom corporation tax Catholic school Intelligent design movement Food Stamp Program Credit card No Child Left Behind Act Taxation in the United States Textbook Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Supply and demand Education in Germany French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Education in Romania Education in England A Course In Miracles Education in Hong Kong Board of Cooperative Educational Services Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Contract Measures of national income and output Economy of Maldives United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East Religious education Community High School, Ann Arbor, Michigan Education Publicly funded medicine Article One of the United States Constitution Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Ethical consumerism SAT Reiki School choice Insurance Microeconomics Experiential education Fort Ashby, West Virginia Creation and evolution in public education Say's law Value added tax Kitzmiller v.
