is it normal to want to be alone i feel like i want attachments like friends but i mostly want to be alone i feel like i want attachments like friends but only sometimes but there are more times when i just want to be by myself its definately normal to want to be alone its perfectly natural to go back into your shell whenever you need to chill out from the world it can be a bit stressful sometimes it is important to find a balance between time alone and time for sharing with others whether it is family friends or strangers because if you spend too much time by yourself you may end up forgetting what life is all about it is also important to value friendship without attachment becuase these are the most fulfilling kind of relationships based on mutual respect and enjoyment rather than needyness and comfort hope you found this useful Love Infantilism W.I.T.C.H.
