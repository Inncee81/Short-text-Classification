manic depression can anyone tell me what manic depression is and has anyone suffered from it thanks xx i do it's hard to explain this sight doesn't quite hit the nail on the head but start here honey most people have moods that swing from sadness to happiness in the person who suffers from manic depression these moods swings are greatly exaggerated there are two features to this disorder the depressive phase often arises out of the blue and with no obvious cause the depression is quite profound and often associated with guilt feelings which centre on something that may have happened in the past the person's judgement is impaired and so he does not believe himself to be ill the manic phase is often the opposite of the depressive phase the patient becomes elated and has far more energy than normal he often stays up all night not because he can't sleep but because he has so much to do he is very talkative and speaks fast he often has several ideas but often loses his train of thought he has great optimism and blind faith and enormous self confidence sometimes believing himself capable of irrational deeds this belief in himself can lead to spending a great deal of money on impractical projects he is less inhibited and sometimes remarks made can offend or hurt relatives or friends he does not appear to recognise that he is ill or that his behaviour is irrational if challenged about this he can often become impatient irritable and angry some sufferers have both manic and depressive illnesses at different times while others just have a manic phase the phases may last for weeks or months and there is a tendency for them to recur and become more frequent with age how does manic depression occur the cause of this condition is not known some people think that the underlying illness is depression and that the manic phase is purely a defensive reaction against the depression others believe that there is an undiscovered chemical cause for this disorder hereditary factors may play a part and it can certainly run in families why does manic depression occur it is not clear why the disorder may have been brought on sometimes there is an obvious external trigger such as disappointment or stress at work treatment involved for manic depression sometimes admission to hospital is considered necessary in milder cases treatment may be started at home treatment is mainly in the form of drugs in the depressive phase antidepressants are used the main drugs used here are known as tricyclic antidepressants electroconvulsive therapy ect is used occasionally when the depression is very severe and when there has been no response to drugs in the manic phase a group of drugs known as the major tranquillizers or neuroleptic drugs are particularly useful these drugs are often used in the short term to calm the agitated person examples of these are chlorpromazine and haloperidol lithium priadel is particularly useful in manic depression this drug appears to lower mood in the manic phase and lessens the frequency and extent of the mood swings it is therefore more often used to prevent further recurrences during treatment for manic depression although side effects are common with antidepressant drugs they are not usually too troublesome they consist mainly of drowsiness blurred vision dry mouth and constipation these tend to decrease after a few days of starting the medication the major tranquillizers can also cause excessive drowsiness and sedation they can also cause trembling restlessness and uncontrollable movements these resemble the symptoms of parkinson's disease sometimes severe muscle spasms or cramps can occur these particular side effects can be controlled and prevented by giving anticholinergic drugs at the same time they reduce the action of a substance in the brain called acetylcholine the commonest drug used in this group is procyclidine which may be taken by mouth or by injection anticholinergic drugs can cause dryness of the mouth and blurring of vision lithium has the potential for side effects and therefore its dose is usually monitored by regular blood tests to measure the amount of the drug in the blood if the dose is not carefully maintained side effects such as trembling nausea diarrhoea speech difficulties and unsteadiness can occur lithium can produce an unusual condition of excessive urination and thirst it may also affect the function of the thyroid gland reducing its activity if manic depression is left untreated although there is a natural tendency for this condition to get better the consequences that arise out of the behaviour of the patient may be serious in the manic phase it is possible that behaviour may lead to serious financial and marital problems which may be difficult to reverse furthermore there is a potential risk of attempted suicide in the depressive phase it is therefore recommended that help is sought early effects on family of manic depression this is a very distressing condition for relatives and friends the depressive phase can obviously be very worrying and the irrational behaviour in the manic phase can sour relationships exhaust the family and lead to serious financial concerns family and friends have an enormous role to play in the treatment of these sufferers and will need to work closely with the doctors sadly the patient may refuse treatment either in the form of medication or admission to hospital tactful advice may be more acceptable from relatives than from a doctor sometimes the behaviour of the manic depressive becomes so worrying that compulsory admission to hospital may be required
