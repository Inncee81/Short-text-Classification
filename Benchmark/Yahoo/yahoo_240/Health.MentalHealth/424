am i messed up i can't believe i'm even asking about this but i have really bad emotional problems i know i need help but i'm so afraid and i'm depressed and i don't know what to do or how to get help i would never really hurt myself like some people cut but i've recently started pinching myself i don't do it a lot but it helps me sometimes when i'm feeling so low i could hit the floor has anyone ever had a problem like this it's okay it sounds like you just need to get some help for depression but it's not as bad as it could get at all if you're just pinching yourself there are a lot of people with emotional problems and most of them won't admit it so admitting it and getting help for it is courageous and necessary to feel better i have had that problem but it got worse after an ex left me so i did start scratching myself and then attempted suicide a couple of times and i put myself in the hospital got on meds and did a lot of soul searching and emotional growth it doesn't have to get as bad as it did for me just get help now i am actually completely free from depression now so there is a light at the end of the tunnel i am now working on issues for anxiety which i have also always had but since i defeated depression i know i can do the same for anxiety so go talk to a psychiatrist they will get you on the right meds if necessary and i highly recommend talking to a psychologist to explore the roots of these problems and come up with a plan for behavior modification Clinical depression EastEnders Chronic fatigue syndrome Procrastination Psychoanalysis Transsexuality Post-traumatic stress disorder Anorexia nervosa Borderline personality disorder 1957 World Series Cognitive therapy Divorce Psychiatry Antidepressant Suicide Obsessive-compulsive disorder Stuttering Combat stress reaction Psychotherapy Binge eating disorder Panic attack Ex-gay Pitaten Bipolar disorder Narcissism Alcoholism Theory of conduct Addiction The Ashlee Simpson Show Homophobia Traumatic incident reduction Prayer Multiple sclerosis Sigmund Freud Antisocial personality disorder Meditation Charles Darwin's illness Breastfeeding Anger management Controversies in autism Fathers' rights Refugee Phoebe Halliwell Schizophrenia Drug addiction Vernon Schillinger Postpartum depression Asperger syndrome Autism Friends Domestic violence Emotions (album) Out-of-body experience Transactional analysis Keynesian economics Medicine Dog Psychology Columbine High School massacre Unemployment Diving Cult Boston Public Reparative therapy Psychiatric hospital Real Love (song) Mental illness Traumatic brain injury Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Prostate cancer Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Equine conformation Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Screenwriting Karen Horney About a Boy Oh My Goddess!
