how many years of sobriety should a recovering alcoholic have before working in a place that sells liquor i think that the temptation is too great why work there at all it is a big step to be a recovering adict but my friend who is a recovering alcoholic says that with discpline it can be done tell me what you think serious answers please perhaps it can be done perhaps and addicts don't fit a particular mold though addiction itself does to me family and friend to several addicts the real question is this is it worth it to even consider jeopardizing all of the work that goes into recovery for many addicts recovery is something they will spend their lives repeating we all stumble and fall the trick is to avoid the things that cause us to stumble and that may take a long time to learn if your friend is involved in a program such as aa or another recovery group suggest that they ask the group for their opinion if your friend is not in a recovery group encourage them to find one your friend also needs to learn that addiction recovery isn't about self control or discipline addiction isn't something that can be beat it's something to be lived with at some point willpower is always weaker than the desire to feel better or return to the familiar it isn't about how strong a person is blessings hope this helps Alcoholics Anonymous Twelve-step program Narcotics Anonymous Drug addiction Addiction Knots Landing Goodness and value theory Lance Armstrong Bill W.
