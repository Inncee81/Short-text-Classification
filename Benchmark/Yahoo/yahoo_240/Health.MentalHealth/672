would antidepressants affect my job i love my job it doesn't pay hardly anything but i love feeling a little competitive and having people notice that i like to do stuff i'm not expected to do i get a lot of compliments from my challenges the harder it is the more i love it i do suffer from anxiety and panic attacks in social situations though and am considering taking antidepressants for this not what i really want to do but what i am being advised to do would this affect my job performance i mean would i still love taking on challanges and feel driven to surprise people i dont want to lose my drive because i want to continue to impress my boss please only honest answers i wouldn't want antidepressants to numb my feelings yes it could i was in university when i tried antidepressants my psychiatrist put me on prozac within the first week or so i was experiencing maddening insomnia i'd sleep once every days i couldn't sit still i couldn't concentrate i felt like i was stoned a lot of the time like far away and i was always yelling when i talked and i was always talking or bursting out laughing but then i would have 'crazy time' where i would just stop and sit in a dark room for awhile i wasn't numb at all i was more alive than ever but dead at the same time and i really don't know what they're talking about with the sex drive thing my sex drive was incredibly high i'd practically orgasm from a slight breeze i went to the doctor and i told him what was going on well most of what was going on because half of was crazy he rolled his eyes at me told me to be a good student i had stopped going to class because i couldn't sit still and upped my dosage that's when i started having panic attacks and crying spells and oh did i ever get mean to the people around me everything was way too bright or too loud i was seeing colours that were not there and i couldn't tell what was real or not i was very impulsive and in one of my 'crazy times' i got very down on myself for fucking up my life so much and overdosed luckily no one found out and i woke up a day or two later just fine who knows what they would have done to me if i ended up in the hospital so i quit mg of prozac 'cold turkey' had some headaches and that was that now of course they say this isn't a usual response but as you can tell from my story my doctor ignored me and i quit going to him after that months of hell unfortunately i have panic and anxiety in addition to my occasional bouts of depression and am considering going back on medication of course i'm waiting until it is convienent for me some few months i can take off of school and find a better doctor and let the meds do what they do until i find the right one perhaps a leave of abscence would do you well when nothing else works and panic is almost as bad as panic plus depression plus prozac alas desperation Clinical depression Shaggy dog story Panic attack Piccolo Junior Saga Fluoxetine Borderline personality disorder One Tree Hill (TV series) Pitaten Sin City Paroxetine Bipolar disorder Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Friends Milton H.
