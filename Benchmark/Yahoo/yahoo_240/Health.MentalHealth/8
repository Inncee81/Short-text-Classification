can you be a good parent if you smoke marijuana i only smoke at night when my daughter is asleep never ever around her or anything where she is exposed to it do you still think that makes me a bad parent i am a very high anxiety person and smoking marijuana is almost like medicine to me it calms me down and centers me you're not a bad parent and niether is smoking pot the only reason why society believe marijuana is bad is because it can't be legalized and regulated marijuana has certain healing properties such as helping anxiety dulling pain and it can actually enhance memory if it were to be legalized the price would be much higher in the stores than it would be on the street and people would continue to buy it off the streets the taxes would also be through the roof maybe it would be best for you to find a different way a more legal way of helping your anxiety it wouldn't do your daughter much good if you were arrested for possesion would it Cannabis (drug) Medical cannabis Arguments for and against drug prohibition Health issues and the effects of cannabis Health insurance Tobacco smoking Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Cigarette Hypnosis Breastfeeding Legal issues of cannabis Free trade Cannabinoids Poker jargon Capitalism Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle Cannabis cultivation Cocaine Consensual crime Clinical depression Post-traumatic stress disorder Hashish Black market Urinary incontinence Cannabis Gonzales v.
