sudden violent nightmares out of nowhere i started having insane nightmares about weeks ago i've had them almost every night though one or two nights i've had a reprieve with no dreams at all it's getting to the point that i'm afraid to go to bed i've been staying up later and later which of course leads me to waking up later which makes me feel tired and cranky all day i can't figure out where they're coming from or why everything else in my life seems to be going well classes are over for the summer i've got year left before i graduate college my boyfriend loves me and vice versa i'm not going through anything traumatic nor have i in the past few months what is wrong with me how do i make it stop i have a very comfy bed with soft sheets and fluffy pillows and i hate being afraid to go to sleep that is your subconscious way of processing stress and change Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Mattress Avenue Q W.I.T.C.H.
