when does a pyschiatrist think you should be placed in a mental hospital if someone is told they have signs of psychosis a mood effective disorder and obsessive compulsions then gets placed on antipsychotics the person still goes out and drinks on a night out whilst on the drug the person bearing in mind had read that it is a bad idea to stop taking medication one day stops taking the antipsychotic and becomes quickly manic again and feels better for doing things like taking a lot of caffeine pills to get a buzz for example and just feels happier then almost 'comes round to their senses' because notices severe mood changes again and decides to take the antipsychotics after all the person doesnt feel very stable and wants to 'change' things a lot so does things like stops medication to change themselves etc is this the sort of time a psychiatrist would think about sending the patient to a hospital for care or does that not happen anymore if the person feels they need more support any info wud b helful also do you have to go to a hospital if told also if there is also self harm and other danger to self this is to do with care in england by the way the only time they will admit you into the hospital is when you are a threat to yourself or others if the doctor feels you should be admitted they will ask you if you will sign yourself in the hospital if you do then that s good if you don't want to sign yourself in then most likely he will force you to go and you will stay longer in the hospital then you may need but if he doesn't think you need to go then he will let you go home however if you feel that you need to be admitted even though your doctor doesn't think you need to you can sign yourself in to get checked out and then they will tell you if they think you should stay longer or not they will watch over you and talk to you about how you are feeling also when you sign yourself in you can sign yourself out after three days of being in the hospital it is only there to help you and i know this because i have been in that situation before don't be scared to ask for help it is only there to help you get better good luck Bipolar disorder Psychosis Antipsychotic Obsessive-compulsive disorder Clinical depression Schizophrenia Borderline personality disorder Psychiatric hospital Antidepressant Involuntary commitment Psychopharmacology Anxiety Psychiatry Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Mental Health Act 1983 Chlorpromazine Mania Triage Theory of conduct Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Milton H.
