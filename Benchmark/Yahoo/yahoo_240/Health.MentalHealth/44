if you have an anxiety disorder and the doctor does not prescribe you any medication that helps you should you go out and find drugs that help you on your own reminder this anxiety disorder is conflicting with your daily professional and home life i was wondering the same thing for a long time because i have major anxiety due to an existing health issue i was put on four different types of anit depressants to control the anxiety all at diff times one after another of course the first one worked wonders immediately but then after two weeks of use i had an allegeric reaction and my face swelled up like the old movie rocky it was not good the rest of the medication prescribed made me even worse more depressed suicidal emotional wreck etc so after the last try i just gave up and decided i was going to have to face the fact that i need to learn to manage it without medication since the doctors were no help it's getting better slowly but def still exists and conflicts with my everyday life i am starting to get my medical condition under control which lightens the load i know how stressful things can be and i am sorry the docs being lame dont put yourself in danger by trying diff medications though try natural supplements and maybe even marijuana to reduce anxiety i was sooo tempted to try it but i dont want to get into legal trouble if it helps maybe talk to your doctor or a therapist about it and get a prescription for it i heard it works wonders best of luck and i am sooo sorry for what you have to go through on a daily basis god bless Clinical depression Antidepressant Psychiatry Anxiety Panic attack Cannabis (drug) Chronic fatigue syndrome Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Urinary incontinence Clomipramine Anorexia nervosa Post-traumatic stress disorder Transsexuality Traumatic brain injury Medicine Psychotherapy Stroke Medical prescription Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor Childbirth Mental illness Psoriasis Drug addiction Osteoarthritis Diazepam Controlled Substances Act Doxepin Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Combat stress reaction Procrastination Obsessive-compulsive disorder Medical cannabis Addiction Parkinson's disease Drug abuse Folic acid Sigmund Freud Psychoanalysis Migraine Stress (medicine) Stuttering Maprotiline DSM-IV Codes Suicide Ex-gay Project MKULTRA Arguments for and against drug prohibition Prostate cancer Fluoxetine Electroconvulsive therapy Avenue Q Autism Fibromyalgia Adult attention-deficit disorder Schizophrenia Opioid Alcoholics Anonymous Propranolol Divorce Palliative care Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Psychopharmacology Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Reparative therapy Alprazolam Mental health Physical therapy Hypertension Breastfeeding Lorazepam Mental Health Act 1983 Acne Milton H.
