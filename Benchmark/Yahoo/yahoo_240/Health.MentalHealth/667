what's your worst antidepressant experience did you lose impulse control have the most fun ever and try to kill yourself like i did or what 'cause i'm really sick of this lie that these medications are safe it's not safe but maybe it's worth it when you're that desperate who knows but stop lying i went into a major depression a few years back and was prescribed a new then it was new anyway medication called cymbalta first of all it did absolutely nothing for my depression in fact it made it even worse i didn't want to get out of bed at all while taking that stuff never mind getting up at noon or pm i was very irritable on it and isolated myself from family and friends i went to my regular medical doctor for a checkup and he noticed that something was wrong as well he took my blood pressure and it was higher than it had ever been in my life i do have hypertension in my family but i never had it myself so i really didn't think much of it at the time and he told me to just keep an eye on it i kept going back to the psych dr to tell him that something wasn't working with this medication and he kept telling me to give it more time to kick in finally after being on it almost three months i got taken off of it and switched to effexor after about a week on the effexor my mood was improved and i was able to start functioning and living again when i went back to my medical doctor for another checkup he was amazed to see my blood pressure had come down significantly and asked me if my meds have changed on the psych end i told him about the cymbalta and he told me that one of the i believe more rare side effects can be high bp the truth not all antidepressants are right for everyone also you do need a doctor that will listen to you going to my doctor who is no longer my doctor now was like going through the drive through at mcdonalds you were in and out in less than five minutes he didn't talk to you but rather just pulled out the prescription pad to refil your prescriptions i was waiting for him to offer me a hamburger and order of fries on my next visit rather than pills however unfortunate it is to find the right one for you is little more than trial and error method therefore do not give up hope and do what you can to help yourself while you are on the meds Clinical depression Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Bipolar disorder Venlafaxine Maprotiline Migraine Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor Psoriasis Hypertension Medical prescription Doxepin Chronic fatigue syndrome Shaggy dog story Stroke Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Milton H.
