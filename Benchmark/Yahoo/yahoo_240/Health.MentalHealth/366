i feel depression creeping up to me slowly how do i avoid it i've moved to a new place and i hardly know anyone there life seems pretty tough i have no choice but to stay coz i just got a job there how do i go on without feeling so lost and alone i've been in some very negative states of mind and emotion and i know it's not easy sometimes we think that the light at the end of the tunnel has been turned off especially when we don't have money to pay the bills school fees homework family problem rather than being annoyed be amused instead of getting angry become curious in place of envy feel admiration in place of worry take action in place of doubt have faith negative energy is just positive energy that's flowing in the opposite direction there's no need to fight or run away from that negative energy all you need to do is change its direction the more negative you are the more positive you can be an automobile that can travel miles per hour to the east can also travel just as fast when going west but first someone must turn it around when you sense yourself becoming negative stop and consider what it would mean to apply that negative energy in the opposite direction turn your sadness into caring transform your complaints into useful suggestions change your bitterness into determination the energy is already there all you need to do is change its direction if it's something that lightens your mood and doesn't hurt anyone yes some very simple things can calm you down and put you in a better frame of mind simple but very soothing and it took me a long time to learn that i didn't need to let my thoughts and emotions control me it's normal to worry a bit sometimes we do have to spend a few minutes worrying or on the pity pot as long as we don't stay there maybe what you can think about working on is just taking a baby step toward what you want you can make a start by being grateful for the things you already have food in your stomach a roof over your head clothes on your back and internet access then you can start using daily affirmations look at yourself in the mirror several times a day and tell yourself how great you are everybody has something they're good at remind yourself of those things start researching a subject you've always been curious about and expand your knowledge eliminate negative words from your vocabulary instead of can't can instead of i don't have enough money say the money for that item is coming just a few things to get you started prayer man there is always an oppurtunity in everything but i just pray and let the spirit lead me man let god work it out turn your stress and anxiety over to him let him deal with it how heroes use this problem and turn it around and face life so what you can do is write down all the things you don't want the way your problem is and then write down the exact opposite the point is always in action thinking about it is the first step the second step is believing in it the third step is acting like you believe in it and the fourth is in being in a place where you can receive it check all these desires of yours against those steps when things get tough do something that makes you happy listen to some good music meditate watch a funny tv show or movie read a good book play cards with a friend whatever works for you to reduce your stress and make you more joyful sometimes you are where you are supposed to be for a reason perhaps it isn't time for you to move on don't give up on your dream work a little at a time to prepare yourself for the time when you have the success that you want get things in order use this time wisely as you may become very busy soon and feel overwhelmed if you don't have your home and affairs in order it sounds like you have decided upon one path to take often life presents more than one way to reach your goal i believe opportunites will come and you must be open to new experiences even if you think it isn't your chosen path this new occurance may lead to other opportunities in ways that you may not recognize at first as long as you keep your eyes on your goal and keep moving forward success will come to you i believe that toxic people can make you sick even shorten your life the best thing to do is to do something for yourself leave so you can live by yourself and go after what you want in life the more you stay with the same people the more your life will stay the same also every time you catch yourself saying something negative keep changing it around you're seeing how it works to some degree just intensify it my suggestion would be for you to attend school do you have your high school diploma yet or anything if not go get it go to college school do not sit in your house worrying get out into the world and get busy talk with a counselor at the college school so you can find out what courses then decide which one would interest you do not stop educating yourself until you are at the point where you can smarter and become that extremely successful person you want to be the key is to work hard and get out in the world and do something else another one is thinking positive thoughts thought is the only power that can produce tangeble riches from the formless substance the stuff from which all things are made is a substance which thinks a thought of form in this substance produces the form original substance moves according to its thoughts every form and process you see in nature is the visible expression of a thought in the original substance as it thinks of a form it takes that form as it thinks of motion it makes that motion that is the way all things are created we live in a thought world and this world is part of a thought universe the original thought of a moving universe first extended throughout the formless substance the thinking stuff resulting from that thought took the form of systems of planets and continues to maintain that form thinking substance takes the form of its thought and moves according to the thought i think it is important to be surrounded by positive and supportive people that is a first step finding a group like this one can be the beginning toxic people are all around energy suckers i just can not afford and want to be around people like this you need to be around people that love you and support you that want the best for you you can also meditate to find that peace within and take time for yourself in nature a friend of mine and coach also recommended to have on a bathroom mirror i am lovable and totally deserving if you can build an image in your mind and hold it you will attract all that is required for the manifestation of it look at it this way your hand is made of energy it's a mass of molecues at a very high speed of vibration what's a glass made of energy what's water made of energy now if you take and boil that water that water is not called water any more it will be called steam it's the same energy just moving at a different speed what's the glass made from energy use to be sand what we've done is alter the molecular structure of the energy and we've turned the sand into glass still the same form of stuff thought and energy is one thought waves are cosmic waves that penetrate all time and space there is one original formless substance and which all things are made where does everything start it starts in thought and whats thought thoughts energy thought in substance produces shapes a human being is a thinking center capable of original thought so you are a thinking center you're the center of thought thoughts are on the present thought energy is everywhere and this energy moves in to your conciousness and you can think anything that you want to think if anyone of us can communicate our thought to original substance we can cause the creation or formation of the thing we think about that's a huge idea so begin right now to calm your mind bring yourself to a place of peace and be open to loving direction keep in mind that the direction or help offered may not be what you thought it would be it is important that you not dictate when i say submission i mean submission also in order to receive miracles and blessings you must be willing to accept them be on the lookout for small things offered give thanks and receive the gift even if it is something as small as advice be aware search when inspired with guidance now you must pick yourself up and take action swift action you'll know if it is divine revelation if the guidance is life affirming either to you or someone else get up and just do it don't wait yes it is possible for something to be handed to you but taking action on guidance should be just as much of a miracle to be realized everybody's journey will be different and unique to their own personal experience although what i've suggested here is the beginning foundation necessary after you've worked yourself out of an immediate crisis a few important questions should arise for your consideration how do you move forward and close the gate behind what are you going to do to build a better life i don't think you want to come back to this horrible wretched place again right well to build anything you must start on a firm foundation you've started your building process by changing the way you think you've planted the good seeds now the good seeds must be fed and nurtured to grow but what about all those weeds the weeds must be pulled up one at a time or they will over run the good seeds of your garden again there is still more work to be done for a good foundation i know some are thinking they already have a good foundation in place and want to start moving forward on their journey i suggest they ask themselves a question before beginning look at your surroundings right now what do you see if your life is in chaos your surroundings are a mess literally and figuratively your health is substandard have addictions or a number of spirit killing situations then you need to work on yourself first remember god is not the author of chaos this is also true for those who have asked for advice paid for programs and or coaches and nothing seems to work if the advice received is good and nothing is working then something of a higher priority should be attended to if you are in bad health or physical pain your body is trying to tell you something listen to the alarms going off your state of mind has manifested everything you are experiencing right now working on yourself first before starting any new venture or relationship is absolutely necessary because it is you holding you back the traditional way is to gather a group that has an interest in what is being stormed go around the table and each person may present an idea only one at a time someone must act as secretary and record the ideas on a large tablet that everyone can read only one or two ideas to a page keep going around the room until no one has anything further to offer no idea or comment is off limits doing this once everyone is done the moderator of the group goes back over each idea some will need to be discounted as not being practical others will have merit to consider further the refined list then goes to management who will decide which ideas are implemented focus on quantity no criticism unusual ideas are welcome combine and improve ideas set the problem determine and specify the problem which needs a solution every participant must know the problem generate ideas generate as many ideas as possible keep in mind the four basic brainstorm rules and record the good ideas continue for five to fifteen minutes select best idea select the most appropriated idea from the suggested ideas i have tried to get you to see that the power to change is within you that when you focus on others and see yourself as a victim that you will give that power to them and forever remain a victim the key is in knowing clearly what you want and focusing on that not what stops you then let go and let god allow ideas to come to you have faith that people will help you if you don't trust them as you don't trust anyone in singapore then you will reject god's attempts at sending you helpers finally be ready to take action when the moment arrives and don't fear what comes next go forth boldly this is what i came into your life to tell you now it's up to you to make it happen there's a book called great failures of the extremely successful it describes how failures happen to everyone only the successful people never give up they understand that failure is part of the process so when things go wrong or people try to stop them they just keep going until they succeed somehow someway you got to where you are now because of how you think i'm going to make a suggestion please take the time to read a very short book you can also go to any bookstore in the classic section and buy it it's called as a man thinketh by james allen and was written in the 's this book is deep and every single sentence has wisdom so it is something that has to be read and studied slowly i highly recommend this little book because it changed many life in a profound way after reading as a man thinketh and absorbing what it says you will begin to understand why i am sending you in this direction before starting your journey my idea how to win friends and influence people is an awesome book and i highly recommend you pick it up the book goes into detail on how to be more of a selfless encouraging and humble person and those attributes we'll attract people to you one of my favorite lines of the book says that 'you can make more friends in two weeks by taking an interest in others then you can in two years trying to tell others about yourself' my suggestion to a book it s a book called the conversations with god there are in the series you may want to read them and see where that takes you as a start to getting your life on track you can go on the web and search neale donald walsh as he is the author and has several very good sites life can always be difficult at times the key is to realize that there is another law called the law of polarity for every negative there is a positive for every up there is a down we tend to stay focused on the negative but the sight should be on the fact that there is a positive in direct proportion to the negative always keep your focus on your dream and possibility and never on your current situation create what you do want in your mind and ignore what you don't want and don't let the present situation that you don't like be your focus againfocus on what you do like and want then trust and believe if you do not then your situation cannot change i'm wishing you well and sending love your way hope this helps warm regards and thank you for your question
