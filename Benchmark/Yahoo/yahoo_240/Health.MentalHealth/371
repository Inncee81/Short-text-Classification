what is wrong with me is this depression i can never commit to anything i will make an appointment to something and just not show up i get like scared or something like my sat test i just didn't go or my community service orientation or my dmv appointment i just get like scared to go so i don't and after on i always regret it and i never ever look forward to anything i am always worried oh am i going to know people here or am i dressed right or blah blah why can't i just live with no worries is this depression cause i dont think so or what is it i think it could possibly be a mild form of depression in other words i don't think you'd be diagnosed as clinically depressed sounds more like something called social anxiety since you specifically mention situations in which you feel like it doesn't matter whether or not you show up when and where you're expected this is a disorder characterized by the person suffering from it not realizing or appreciating that his or her actions do have an effect on others worry is also a common feature of this disorder you mentioned your sat test so i'm assuming you're a teen i hope you understand that being unsure of yourself during your high school years is very common i hope you'll talk to your parents your doctor or a school counselor or another trusted adult about how you're feeling and i can assure you that you are not alone in feeling the way you do you do seem very mature to have realized that something is bothering you and to be able to describe it so well good luck to you i'm pretty sure you'll be fine and you'll feel a lot better after talking with someone who understands Anxiety Adult attention-deficit disorder Asperger syndrome Clinical depression Post-traumatic stress disorder Transsexuality Bipolar disorder Controversies in autism Anorexia nervosa Chronic fatigue syndrome Borderline personality disorder Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Karen Horney Psychoanalysis God Emperor of Dune Social rule Homophobia Antisocial personality disorder Autism Psychosis Obsessive-compulsive disorder Narcissism One Tree Hill (TV series) Theory of conduct Milton H.
