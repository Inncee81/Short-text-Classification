it's not the fact that we've ended things that bothers me it's the fact that we ended things on such a bad note that depresses me i've pretty much made up for everything i did wrong except one thing and she still refuses to talk to me i just want my peace of mind back but this whole break up is weighing me down help you cant force the pace of someone else's recovery as i have discovered through experience i think that for now you have to consciously make an effort to let go and do what is good for you if that means turning your back for a while on someone who you still care about so be it you can only hope that she will understand and if she needs the space and time to recover grant it to her give it to her with love say in your mind i am giving you this because you need it in the final analysis i think the test of a solid relationship is whether it survives a break up and you can still respect each other in thought word and spirit forgive her and forgive yourself you are both human its not easy i myself have lost not just a lover and a friend but she took many of my friends with her by telling them horrible things about me but i am alive i have people i love and trust and most importantly i believe in myself and my ability to care for others Theory of conduct A Course In Miracles Scenes from a Memory God Emperor of Dune Social rule EastEnders The Amber Spyglass Sin City Current teachings of Prem Rawat John Howard Yoder About a Boy Socrates One Tree Hill (TV series) Pitaten Athrun Zala Alcoholics Anonymous Friends Meaning of life Milton H.
