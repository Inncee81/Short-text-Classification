when therapy outpatient and hospitalization inpatient aren't effective what rd options exist hi i guess for while i've circle around this question in seeking help i've felt it important to realize that i have and am trying even if it's not in the forms that seem to work hence my question having tried multiple therapy group progams and hospitalizations and asking in here i know even if i don't believe it that i'm trying to get help what i've also noticed are my shortcomings on getting help given my lack of socialization economic status insurance etc though i get that recent line is somewhat an excuse so what isn't my journals indicate all the things i don't want to be or do or become though can't seem to list any of the do's no matter how much i've tried i get i have multiple issues ranging from detachments isolation despair etc so the is what options are there i know i'm not suicidal though i know i'm not an extrovert nor any desire to become one so what do i do thinking more is needed to be posted by me quick clarifications yes i do walk miles every day to and from work no i don't take meds last therapists a few yrs ago recommended not taking them stating issues are personality not chemical though thanks for early bit of advise thanks for the advise so far though presently it's ideas i've considered before obviously you all couldn't have known that lol maybe i'm seeking a th or th option who knows i feel as two persons the one knowing i need help for which i don't think is out there and the other who still has the ideation of hoping to not wake up though i also know i can't go anywhere since i pay the bills for myself and others others are actually disabled wondering if maybe the issue is i have no respect and am disgusted with myself but no concept of what happiness is for i can't see a lifestyle out there that appears happy to me who knows still looking i guess thanks for the ideas regarding ect been informed ect doesn't work for those with dysthymia mild depression schizoid narassistic personality disorder which is my situation though again i do appreciate the rd option if there are any more out there since to be honest tired of a dozen attempts of therapy group therapy and meds and seeking something else out let me know though not pray spiritual but not religious so please no come to god ideas okay thanks question are you the kind of person that gets suggestions from professional caregivers therapists psychiatrist and answers yes but and then explains why it can't won't work i'm working on a hunch here that may be totally wrong but in my practice i've found it very difficult to treat patients who will reject all suggestions made for various reasons they usually end up being the treatment failures and being convinced that no one no treatment can help them if this sounds like it could possibly be you consider doing therapy and medication and following the suggestions given instead of finding reasons why they won't work i know that involves trust and that may be a hard thing for you but it's the only way i see you getting better if you have tried everything and nothing's worked you are an ideal cadidate for ect shock therapy as the success rate for turning around episodes of major depression is better than any medication however in order to maintain gains made there you'd need to continue with medication and therapy afterwards or else the positive effects would likely be lost quickly ect has an success rate in turning around serious depressive episodes best antidepressant works no better than of the time Reparative therapy Bipolar disorder Psychiatric hospital Transsexuality Psychiatry Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Antidepressant Chronic fatigue syndrome Palliative care Psychoanalysis Medicine Borderline personality disorder Anorexia nervosa Psychotherapy Milton H.
