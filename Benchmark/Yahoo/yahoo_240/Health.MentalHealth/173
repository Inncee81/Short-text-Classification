over and you frequently feel exhausted even after numerous tests your doctor can't find anything specifically wrong with you if this sounds familiar you may have fibromyalgia fibromyalgia is a chronic condition characterized by widespread pain in your muscles ligaments and tendons as well as fatigue and multiple tender points places on your body where slight pressure causes pain fibromyalgia is more common in women than in men previously fibromyalgia was known by other names such as fibrositis chronic muscle pain syndrome psychogenic rheumatism and tension myalgias although the intensity of your symptoms may vary they'll probably never disappear completely it may be reassuring to know however that fibromyalgia isn't progressive or life threatening treatments and self care steps can improve fibromyalgia symptoms and your general health signs and symptoms signs and symptoms of fibromyalgia can vary depending on the weather stress physical activity or even the time of day common signs and symptoms include widespread pain fibromyalgia is characterized by pain in specific areas of your body when pressure is applied including the back of your head upper back and neck upper chest elbows hips and knees the pain generally persists for months at a time and is often accompanied by stiffness fatigue and sleep disturbances people with fibromyalgia often wake up tired and unrefreshed even though they seem to get plenty of sleep some studies suggest that this sleep problem is the result of a sleep disorder called alpha wave interrupted sleep pattern a condition in which deep sleep is frequently interrupted by bursts of brain activity similar to wakefulness so people with fibromyalgia miss the deep restorative stage of sleep nighttime muscle spasms in your legs and restless legs syndrome also may be associated with fibromyalgia irritable bowel syndrome ibs the constipation diarrhea abdominal pain and bloating associated with ibs are common in people with fibromyalgia headaches and facial pain many people who have fibromyalgia also have headaches and facial pain that may be related to tenderness or stiffness in their neck and shoulders temporomandibular joint tmj dysfunction which affects the jaw joints and surrounding muscles also is common in people with fibromyalgia heightened sensitivity it's common for people with fibromyalgia to report being sensitive to odors noises bright lights and touch other common signs and symptoms include depression numbness or tingling sensations in the hands and feet paresthesia difficulty concentrating mood changes chest pain dry eyes skin and mouth painful menstrual periods dizziness anxiety doctors don't know what causes fibromyalgia current thinking centers around a theory called central sensitization this theory states that people with fibromyalgia have a lower threshold for pain because of increased sensitivity in the brain to pain signals researchers believe repeated nerve stimulation causes the brains of people with fibromyalgia to change this change involves an abnormal increase in levels of certain chemicals in the brain that signal pain neurotransmitters in addition the brain's pain receptors neurons which receive signals from the neurotransmitters seem to develop a sort of memory of the pain and become more sensitive meaning they can overreact to pain signals in this way pressure on a spot on the body that wouldn't hurt someone without fibromyalgia can be very painful to someone who has the condition but what initiates this process of central sensitization isn't known it's likely that a number of factors contribute to the development of fibromyalgia other theories as to the cause of fibromyalgia include sleep disturbances some researchers theorize that disturbed sleep patterns may be a cause rather than just a symptom of fibromyalgia injury an injury or trauma particularly in the upper spinal region may trigger the development of fibromyalgia in some people an injury may affect your central nervous system which may trigger fibromyalgia infection some researchers believe that a viral or bacterial infection may trigger fibromyalgia abnormalities of the autonomic sympathetic nervous system part of your autonomic nervous system the sympathetic or involuntary system controls bodily functions that you don't consciously control such as heart rate blood vessel contraction sweating salivary flow and intestinal movements it s thought that sympathetic nervous system dysfunction occurs in people with fibromyalgia particularly at night which leads to fatigue stiffness dizziness and other signs and symptoms associated with the condition changes in muscle metabolism for example deconditioning and decreased blood flow to muscles may contribute to decreased strength and fatigue differences in metabolism and abnormalities in the hormonal substance that influences the activity of nerves may play a role psychological stress and hormonal changes also may be possible causes of fibromyalgia diagnosing fibromyalgia is difficult because there isn't a single specific diagnostic laboratory test in fact before receiving a diagnosis of fibromyalgia you may go through several medical tests such as blood tests and x rays only to have the results come back normal although these tests may rule out other conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis lupus and multiple sclerosis they can't confirm fibromyalgia the american college of rheumatology has established general classification guidelines for fibromyalgia to help in the assessment and study of the condition according to these guidelines to be diagnosed with fibromyalgia you must have experienced widespread aching pain for at least three months and have a minimum of locations on your body that are abnormally tender under relatively mild firm pressure in addition to taking your medical history a doctor checking for fibromyalgia will likely press firmly on specific points on your head upper body and certain joints so that you can confirm which cause pain not all doctors agree with these guidelines some believe that the criteria are too rigid and that you can have fibromyalgia even if you don't meet the required number of tender points others question how reliable and valid tender points are as a diagnostic tool
