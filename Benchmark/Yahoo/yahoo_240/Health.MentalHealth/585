am i suffering from depression okay so i'm years old at school you would say that i'm in the popular group but not the bitchy kind i mean i have other friends who arent so popular and i like them and all but sometimes i fear that my popular friends wont like me and i'll end up like them with only one or two friends sometimes when i'm all alone in my room staring at the ceiling i ask my self questions about the past like why didnt you say that why didnt you do that i shouldnt have said that to her stuff like that i feel less confident by the minute and i feel as if everyone is gonna hate me when i get back to school i'm losing my confidence everyday i find funny movies less amusing then i'd usually find them and i'm not as happy as i use to be please help me sincerly rae i dont think your depressed but if you're not very active in the summer sometimes you feel really bored and you start to doubt yourself i would recommend going out more and if that doesn't help then wait until you go back to school and see how you feel if you still feel lousy then talk to someone like your family or a councelor or a best friend it will help also dont be afraid to pamper yourself get your nails done or buy something that you really want itll cheer you up Shaggy dog story Atomic Kitten The Smoking Room Pitaten Milton H.
