how do you deal with a brother who is not mentally all there he is not retarded mentally handicapped nor challenged he does not suffer from any mental illness far as i know nothing very severe and yet he is mentally not there for example he tries to hang clothes all over his apartment without hangers and does not think about getting hangars until i mentioned it to him he buys funiture that is about dollars yet refuses to buy a dollar screwdriver to put the stuff together he buys canned food and yet never even considers buying a can opener the thought never enters his mind how can i bring him back to reality what may be causing this non sensical behavior not to mention the finances i will not mention details of this however he is my roomate and the person i am supposedly be sharing expenses with he cares about rent yet does not get the idea that saving money may actual help him with this he can't seem get the concept to his head help please he does not shave wash himself nor his uniform for work unless i yell at him for it may i remind you this is a year old man i am talking about imagining having to babysit someone which in his own words says the basic concepts don't enter my mind ever common sense is something he his lacking very much and it is to the point i have to baby him to do what a normal person does for themself i am not offended by suggesting he is stupid however since he is my brother and finding people i can get along with is very dificult i do want to help him out before bailing out on him however i am not his mother not his father nor babysitter and should not have be one of those roles while i am his roomate no he does not make alot of money he works a minium wage job saving money should be the way he should handle future exspenses he one time tried to row a canoe to russia i am not kidding i think your brother might have some mental disorder are you sure he's not mentally retarded i would recommend he get tested he might have autism or obsessive compulsive disorder or something like that his behavior doesn't make sense clearly good luck to you dana Autism Mental illness Mental retardation Autism rights movement Obsessive-compulsive disorder Asperger syndrome Intelligence quotient Friends Rain Man Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Theory of conduct Psychosis Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Mental Health Act 1983 Procrastination Milton H.
