why do i think that all my friends hate me i have a good set of friends and we all live on the same street always have street parties in the summer go to each others houses for coffee etc but i always feel 'out of the loop' i cant help but think that they don't really like me and that they just tolerate my company instead of really liking me do you think that i think like this because i am depressed because i find it hard to believe that people really like me i used to feel the same way i don't know what your age is but teenagers also get that way sometimes i had depression and i think that is why i felt that way you might want to get everyone together for a serious conversation tell them how you feel and maybe they will make a better effort to include you Friends My Life as a Teenage Robot Wall Street Neighbours Social rule Megan Griffin Everwood The Adventures of Pete & Pete Pitaten Abigail Folger Milwaukee, Wisconsin Kurt Cobain Chicago Loop The Smoking Room The Catcher in the Rye One Tree Hill (TV series) Nancy Witcher Astor Kender True Crime: Streets of LA Unemployment Shaggy dog story Sauna Avenue Q Leonard Cohen Recurring South Park characters Grease (film) The Ashlee Simpson Show Okashina Okashi The Cure Jim Henson The Beatles Days of our Lives Equation of time The O.C.
