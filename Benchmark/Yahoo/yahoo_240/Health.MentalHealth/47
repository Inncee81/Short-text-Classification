why does it feel like my emotions are trying to kill me not all the time but sometimes things will hurt or disappoint me so much it feels like my emotions are trying to strangle me from the inside today for instance i had a couple disappointments for me after the last one i just wanted to lash and slam doors but that's not the type of person i want to be temper tantrums solve nothing so i just curled up on my bed and rocked flexing muscles until i was too numb to feel the disappointment anymore i generally think that being an emotional person is a bitter sweet gift it's hard to go through such deep unhappy times but the sky high good times are great plus being an emtional person makes you a better artist however times like this makes me wonder if it's really worth it i don't want to be an unhappy person but sometimes i just don't have anything left inside of me sometimes the hurt is all i have and i don't know how to make it go away is there anything i can do other than endure no pat answers please most people go through these feelings at some point in their life you are overwhelmed and you need to talk to people as you are doing now to get more than one viewpoint you have your viewpoint but it is not the only one and your viewpoint of life may be limited or inaccurate that is why you need the input of others who have been through this and to talk to others Shaggy dog story Social rule Theory of conduct Transactional analysis Out-of-body experience Cliff Richard Self-harm Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Babe Ruth One Tree Hill (TV series) Goodness and value theory Traumatic incident reduction Asperger syndrome Jon Secada Anger management Stoicism Grief Richard Rahl Boston Public Aretha Franklin Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Futurama (TV series - season 2) Nirvana (band) K' Equine conformation Borderline personality disorder Narcissism Polyamory Domestic violence The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Yoko Ono Year of the Spider One Life to Live Strap-on dildo Tina Turner The Curse of Fenric The Death Gate Cycle Customs and etiquette of Japan Humphrey Bogart Luck EastEnders Nicomachean Ethics Force (Star Wars) Wheel of Fortune Bernard Williams The Lovely Bones Professional wrestling holds Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Dead Like Me Marilyn Monroe Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism God Emperor of Dune The Fairly OddParents Friends Knots Landing Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Mahatma Gandhi Bill O'Reilly (commentator) Immortality Sant Thakar Singh Kill Bill Current teachings of Prem Rawat Anne Boleyn Utilitarianism Religion Bat Lash Sadism and masochism Scientology beliefs and practices The Wall Shit Storytelling Blonde on Blonde Fleetwood Mac Aesthetic Realism Shania Twain Avenue Q The Smoking Room Orgasm Martial art Rich Mullins Function (mathematics) Another Side of Bob Dylan Ayyavazhi mythology Sinfest Drill bit Richard Nixon Copyleft Emotions (album) Past teachings of Prem Rawat The Inside Rei Ayanami Carpenters The nature of God in Western theology G-Man (Half-Life) Alignment (role-playing games) Ty Cobb Autobiography (Ashlee Simpson album)
