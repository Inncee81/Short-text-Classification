my husband was just recently diagnosed w bi polar before he or i knew he was mentally ill during one of his manias he cheated on me twice once going to dinner w girl and then making out and the other time mnths later and had sex w a different girl we have a child together and have had a rollercoaster marriage now i know the reason why he has been put on meds and is back to his normal self and feels horrible for everything he has done but personally i am battling my emotions part of me wants to understand and excuse him b c he was out of his mind basically but the other part of me thinks i am being one of those stupid girls who is a push over i am wanting to know if anyone has had a cheating bi polar spouse and if they got through it and how or if they left the relationship and are better off please help thanks i've not been in the situation you're describing but i have studied bipolar quite a bit and one of the things that go along with bipolar is that people will sometimes cheat in their relationships a lot of times during mania sex drive increases and since mania causes a person's state of mind to be unclear that leads to the manic person to not use good judgment from what you have described it sounds like his behavior was the result of mania and not because of anything about you or your relationship with him however you do have the right to feel hurt because he did cheat it might have been because of the mania but that doesn't change the hurt you feel i can see how you would feel conflicted in this situation i don't think it would make you a stupid girl or a pushover if you took him back but i can understand why you feel that way i would suggest attending some sort of marital counseling so this issue can be addressed in a professional way hope this helps Clinical depression Psychosis Psychoanalysis Infantilism Sexual orientation Polyamory Divorce Social rule Social psychology Mania Borderline personality disorder Domestic violence Grief Transsexuality Mental illness Transactional analysis EastEnders Marriage Pedophilia Love Schizophrenia Friends Theory of conduct Sex and the City Psychology Homophobia Milton H.
