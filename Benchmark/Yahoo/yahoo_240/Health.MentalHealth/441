have you ever had rage and anger against someone and didn't know why i have a nephew that has been on and off of drugs for the past years he is years old now his mom does everything she can to help him and is very patient with him he has agreed to go to a teen retreat for months to help with his problem drug and to get counseling he gets so enraged if she ask him any questions or tries to help him in anyway he says he doesn't know why himself but he stays mad at her and gets so furious and enraged at even thinking about her he admits she has only been good to him and he can't explain his feelings has anyone here ever been angry at someone whether they had a reason or not that just seemed to consume them to the point they couldn't let go and didn't know why if so what was the reason if there was one what did you do and how did you ever get past it he doesn't really seem to have a problem talking with others just his mom maybe he has secret anger in his subconscious mind and he blames her for what happened to him maybe he hates her for not being more strict on him and he wouldnt have done the drugs if she was there more beforehand if she noticed earlier it might all be held up inside i think he should tell someone and get some help it's very good that he stopped and is clean but he needs to let someone know what he's going through it could drive him crazy and make him guilty and he might end up back on the addiction if ur close to him talk to him and let him know that he should get help yes i have gotten mad at people when i didnt know why but it was some middle school thing idk it went away but that's more serious good luck Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Kodocha Pitaten Shaggy dog story Free will Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an EastEnders One Tree Hill (TV series) Phoebe Halliwell Piccolo Junior Saga Ranma __ characters Obi-Wan Kenobi Vernon Schillinger Knots Landing Kim Possible Pok__mon Live!
