a not so hard choice ok yesterday i asked a question about addiction and i got many answers which i will take into consideration so thank you my problem now is that my best friend of two years said that she is sick of my addiction which i dont blame her she basically told me that i either quit everything or our friendship is over so i have to stop taking painkillers which i have been addicted to for about years and im only so i kno i have a problem i have to quit taking ephedrine which i have been addicted to for three years i only had to take painkillers for actual pain like three times in my life i would lie to the doctors or get them illegally it surprised how stupid doctors are and just give painkillers out like candy anyways when my best friend asked me to choose between her and the drugs i had to think a long while about it which scared the hell outta me she is the only true friend i've ever had everr i started using painkillers to not feel anything i have a lot of family history mainly with my dad he is now dead b c of painkillers so people say i just wanna kill myself and sometimes they are correct but i realized now i dont want to die but it feels like its too late now im too far in my addictions no it is not too late but you cannot do it by yourself you need to check into a rehab clinic and it will take time you are very young and you have your whole life ahead of you thank god for your best friend she is trying to save your life Johnny Cash Kurt Cobain Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Addiction Incarnations of Immortality Analgesic Sin City Rush Limbaugh Alcoholics Anonymous Drug addiction Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Methamphetamine Theory of conduct Arguments for and against drug prohibition Red Hot Chili Peppers Mother Teresa Avenue Q Knots Landing Daredevil One Tree Hill (TV series) I, the Jury Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Sexual orientation Cindy Sheehan Ben Johnson (athlete) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma EastEnders Days of our Lives Ty Cobb Eddie Guerrero Friends Vernon Schillinger Le Malade imaginaire The Young Ones (TV series) Goodness and value theory Rent (musical) The Amber Spyglass Guns N' Roses Kodocha Kyle Broflovski Fitz Hugh Ludlow YuYu Hakusho Fred Phelps Social rule Anxiety LSD Procrastination Religious views of suicide Stomach cancer Father's Day (Doctor Who) Charmed Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Recreational drug use The Shining (film) Obsessive-compulsive disorder Spiritism Brian Griffin Mary Jane Watson Saved by the Bell Angel Sanctuary The Catcher in the Rye Withdrawal History of As the World Turns (2000-present) God Emperor of Dune One Piece minor characters Piccolo Junior Saga Brett Favre Migraine Dawson's Creek Jumpstart 3rd Grade Courtney Love The Invisibles Anesthesiologist Health insurance Bradley Nowell Hubert Selby Jr. Max Payne Moe Szyslak About a Boy A Course In Miracles Whitney Houston Charly Garc__a Prostate cancer Humphrey Bogart Domestic violence Babylon 5 Medical cannabis Boston Public Expert system The Marshall Mathers LP Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Megan Griffin Suicide methods Grandview, U.S.A.
