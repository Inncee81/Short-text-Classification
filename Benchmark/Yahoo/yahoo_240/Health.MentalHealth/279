my friend thinks he has a mental disorder what could it be the symptoms are basically he thinks he's falling behind other people in life he finds the simplest things not worth doing he says if he thinks too much it effects him he also said that it feels like something is wrong with him he says it's all in his head but it comes out like there is something wrong physically he said it's old like he's tired of feeling that way when he comes home from work it gets worse when nobody is awake he talks about wanting to admit himself somewhere i love him a lot and don't want to see him suffer it's been happening the last two or three years so sad to hear him talk about it any ideas he has been to a doctor before regarding all of this and they diagnosed him with mdd major depressive disorder and gave him lexapro which totally changed him and he's finally off of it the last few months i'm proud of him but like he still gets bouts he has anxiety to go along with it because of his lack of not doing anything and it snow balls into something really bad basically he feels like things aren't worth doing then he worries about it and it creates anxiety and it just cycles i know i've had that happen in the past to me it still happens i just manage it apparently he can't and that's where the disorder comes in i suppose i don't want to see him on lexapro again he made him like a zombie it was so bad and it didn't help him meds are bad in general there has to be an alternative like a way of thinking or something to fix this what are alternative treatments to anti depressants and other medications i mean this is some sort of new diease popping up in society or has it been common for people to have it through history and never been identified or what it just seems like people are quick to throw medication at the problem i'm glad that your friend is getting treatment for depression and that he is responding to it with only occasional setbacks depression and anxiety are evil twins it is hard to change depressed and anxious behaviour because those behaviours become habitual just be patient and upbeat with your friend all things in good time Anxiety Bipolar disorder Transsexuality Anorexia nervosa Chronic fatigue syndrome Antidepressant Borderline personality disorder Procrastination Charles Darwin's illness Obsessive-compulsive disorder Eating disorder Sigmund Freud Panic attack Social rule Hypoglycemia Theory of conduct Multiple sclerosis Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Autism Medicine Insomnia Mental illness Alcoholism Traumatic brain injury Schizophrenia Cognitive therapy Adult attention-deficit disorder Ex-gay Narcissism Psychotherapy Psychiatry Shaggy dog story Controversies in autism Psychosis Coeliac disease Debugging Stuttering Gender identity disorder Addiction Mental Health Act 1983 General anxiety disorder Psychoanalysis Parkinson's disease Post-traumatic stress disorder Combat stress reaction Baldness Magical thinking Transactional analysis Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Evil Asperger syndrome Alcoholics Anonymous Unemployment Binge eating disorder Sleep Migraine Psychosurgery Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder Asthma Humphrey Bogart Involuntary commitment Karen Horney Childbirth Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Homeopathy Drug addiction Philosophical skepticism Phobia Pitaten Sin City Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Psychopharmacology Ethics Stress (medicine) Postpartum depression Stomach cancer Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an One Tree Hill (TV series) Hearing impairment Dualism (philosophy of mind) Homophobia Behavioral therapy Sexual dysfunction Balance disorder Neurosis St John's wort Stroke Anger management Avenue Q Mania Placebo effect Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
