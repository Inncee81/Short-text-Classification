does anyone else find porn disgusting after orgasm when i'm watching a porno pre orgasm it seems very sexy and exciting but after i suddenly find myself disgusted by it especially the noise and have to shut it off anyone else experience this lol yes i do believe that's totally normal sometimes it can have to do with your upbringing if you were taught that sex is dirty that could effect how you feel after watching porn in general people use porn to get off after they have an orgasm there's no reason to continue to watch in some ways it resembles sex once you have an orgasm after sex you don't usually feel like continuing unless you are one of the people who can have multiple orgasms you probably just want to lay there and cuddle up with your lover so watching someone still getting it on can seem kind of gross when you're no longer in the mode Orgasm Strap-on dildo Child sexuality Prostate cancer Sexual dysfunction Masturbation Oral sex Pornographic movie Human sexual behavior Zoophilia Obscenity Masters and Johnson Deep Throat (film) Sex and the City Sexual intercourse Anorgasmia Bondage (BDSM) Anal sex Sexual orientation Infantilism Little Britain Pornographic actor Avenue Q Wilhelm Reich Human sexual response cycle Motion picture rating system Group sex Crystal methamphetamine and sex Demographics of sexual orientation Sexual arousal Pornography Puberty Rape Sexual addiction Friends Buzzcocks Jamie Gillis Cybersex Tom Cruise Rob Cryston Ion Davidov Social rule Erotic sexual denial Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Normal distribution One Tree Hill (TV series) EastEnders Child pornography John Holmes (actor) Birth control Cyberspace Eric Cartman Missionary position Gender identity The Children of Men Kender Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story!
