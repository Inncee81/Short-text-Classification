low self esteem confidence i'm going to come straight out about this i have extremely low self esteem i have absolutely no confidence it makes life very difficult i always look down on everything when someone says something bad about me it gets to me very badly i care way too much about what other people think about me i kind of hate myself some of this is due to an ex boyfriend who basically made my life hell he put me down every given second he could now i believe all of it i'm going into my senior year of highschool how can i build my confidence and love life without caring about what other people think about it i can sympathize with you since i went thru that when i was young up until my sophomore year and that was when i came out of my shell but considering you have someone to blame and not yourself stop blaming yourself and lift your chin and be proud of what and who you are i know it's easier said than done but you can do it even if you have to reinvent yourself to be someone different start with telling yourself that you aren't going to take the same bs from anyone you took from your boyfriend who in the heck did he think he was that he made you feel less of a person than you are oh i have known a couple like him in my young life they are beyond the word jerk you can't control the guy but you can control how you feel now about yourself so it's time you took a good look at how you can make some changes in you and for you start with changing your appearance tomorrow go for a free facial or make up session at a dept store where they will use their products on you and give you a makeover if you want to try another makeup co another day try someone else spend a girlie day by yourself and just for you call it a 'reward day' if you need an excuse reward yourself for getting rid of that jerk would be good for starters try on something new you can wear to school and buy it if you like it well enough do your nails or have your nails done buy a gooey ice cream sundae or eat something really pleasureable do all the things you probably would not splurge on and do them all in one day then when you've done something about your outward appearance to make yourself look better you should feel better too then start on your inner self go to the library and start looking for books to build your confidence and read to actually learn what you can do to do just that you can also repeat to yourself til you believe it that you are a great person worth knowing and loving and you have alot to share with the world around you each guy you meet and may have a re lationship with will be a stepping stone to finding the right person who you will share your life with you will learn from your mistakes as you must learn from this last one you will not fall for a controlling guy again or one to talk down to you or make you embarrassed or one who disrespects you for you've already been there and done that to not repeat yourself haven't you so maybe the next guy will not be the type in love with himself or gods' gift to women as this one probably did you might even go for the brainy type that is more quiet and reserved you might meet over a book in the library or at a computer station or even a magazine rack but you won't be looking and he won't either but you'll just happen to walk into each others' life and you'll strike up a friendship and relationships that start out as friends are usually long lasting and often don't disolve as the lover types will you've got alot of living to do and lots more males to associate with before you find the right guy who for once will treat you as his equal so don't fall into the doldrums the guy isn't worth it no guy is not even if he's your husband you never ever let a man take control of you he can claim your heart but he can't claim your soul so remember that always be inde pendant and self reliant always and you'll never go wrong and males will always find you interesting when you are that way because you'll always be a challenge that will keep them interested and you interesting now lift your chin and open your eyes and get rid of that houndog look smile and the world will soon be smiling with you greet people with a smile at school say hello in the halls to people you don't even know soon when they see you they'll smile at you first when they recognize you for your friendliness in order to make friends you have to be open to friendships and that is what you need now more than ever are friends and lots of them what you don't need now is another love interest don't be in a hurry to love again that will come when you have made some changes and you will be more ready stop going to places where the two of you hung out distance yourself from those areas get an after school hobby or volunteer for something that interests you work part time for some spending money that will make anyone feel good getting a paycheck you can spend on yourself do things that will make you take on responsibility all things different from the norm will be building opportun ities for you take my word on that good luck and if you need any advice on things you'll find my email as close as my avatar Social rule
