what is raising a bipolar adhd teenager like kids answer too my year old son has bipolar and adhd as he gets older some characteristics improve others worsen the past few years have been rough can anyone tell me their experiences with teeneagers with either both disorders i would love to hear from kids too my son takes meds in the morning and at night he sees his doctor every month and therapist every week i'm going to type but my bipolar husband is going to be the one responding to you here is what he says to that yes it is hard but here are some tips and tricks i always had a problem with my mom not believing what i said like if i learned something at school or from tv my mom always pushed her opinion and everything else on me so maybe if you incorporate his opinion or his knowledge and let him know that learning about that is cool that will make him less apt to lash out because he feels he is not being taken seriously so when he tells you something stop and listen don't just half listen or interrupt him in the middle of a thought or stop him from explaining what he knows he needs to feel like you respect him and take him seriously my mom wouldn't do that for me most of the time i would get so mad i would just run away she wouldn't know where i was for hours sometimes days when i would get back she wouldn't even talk to me when he gets mad just back off and let him cool down do not argue back with him even if you know you are right just let him calm down first and say okay go back later and talk about it openly like adults my mom also like the above parent who posted reacted badly and ashamedly to how i behaved this really was fuel for my fire the madder she got and the more she pleaded with me to cut it out the more i wanted to push her buttons as a general rule if his embarassing behavior is not harming him physically or causing physical harm to others or property then ignore it as best as you can try redirecting him by focusing him on something else or even asking him a question about something he knows a lot about tell him to explain it to someone else around him or something most of his public behavior is for everyone around him to look at him he will feel like everyone is watching him explain what he knows best if you ask him questions i hope my husband helped you out Clinical depression Plame affair Stuttering Autism Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Borderline personality disorder Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Adult attention-deficit disorder Bipolar disorder Social rule Milton H.
