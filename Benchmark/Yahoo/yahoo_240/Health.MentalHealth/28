someone to talk to my life is not quite the way i'd like it to be and there are things that i'd like to talk about with somebody where can i find information about counseling or someone to talk to i've called those hotline numbers beforee but they really are no help and plus i think i need to talk to someone on a regular basis oh and also i'm not able to afford counseling or therapy tell me about it i called one of those 'suicide crisis hotline' numbers the night i took a major overdose of benzs they did nothing not even encourage me to seek help a lot of descent sized cities have available some type of counseling for free or based on income and if yours is incredibly low probably free still in my community they have catholic charities unfortunately what is available may or may not be good enough for someone with severe problems and needs i for example really need something called dialectic behavioural therapy which can really only be done by a psychiatrist or psychologist which is nearly impossible as these doctors are too expensive for individuals to pay for insurance virtually never will pick up the tab and because it is so unusual now for people to do this the waning demand has made for very few people of this qualification to actually be around with time to do these kinds of things finding the resources for counseling therapy on a charity basis can be tricky but check with like your county health department state contributed mental health place or psychiatrist's office of private practice and see if they can give you some referances my thinking now is that help is at least to some extent available at least in good sized cities Psychotherapy Psychiatric hospital Psychology Involuntary commitment Clinical depression Psychiatry Transsexuality Mental illness Psychoanalysis Reparative therapy Sigmund Freud Suicide Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Cancer Unemployment Microeconomics Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Anorexia nervosa Scientology beliefs and practices Bipolar disorder Divorce Psychiatric and mental health nursing Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Schizophrenia Transactional analysis Medicine Health insurance Procrastination Altruism Milton H.
