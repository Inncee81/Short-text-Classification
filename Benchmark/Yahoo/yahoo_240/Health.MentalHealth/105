therapy and insurance future problems my parents are driving me crazy so i thought i'd see a therapist then i read this scary story about a woman who was turned down for insurance because she saw a therapist years earlier even though she wasn't medicated or anything i know whatever i do through my insurance company will be disclosed in the future but how bad could it get i don't need medication or anything i just want to talk through the problems with someone before my baby comes in months but i'm more stressed out about this insurance stuff than i am about the actual problem with my parents i can't afford it out of pocket should i be worried it actually depends upon your insurance carrier get your folks to get a benefit booklet and pore over what is covered and what is not my youngest has adhd odd our insurance paid for the psychiatrist but not the therapist odd yes daughter is only on medication for depression and not adhd and her psychiatrist gets paid after a yearly deductible is met we are responsible for the rest of the cost the therapist worked out a schedule where we could pay what would normally be our insurance copay so it is okay altogether an insurance company can change its policy in the middle of coverage and many do too many change so what you heard may very well have been true you have to sign consent forms for the insurance to review your case regardless of where you go and who treats you good luck Health insurance Insurance Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Life insurance Transsexuality Auto insurance Clinical depression Unemployment Psychotherapy Dissociative identity disorder Medicine Publicly funded medicine Social Security (United States) Procrastination Adult attention-deficit disorder US health reform under FDR Ex-gay Variable universal life insurance Health care in the United States Legal aspects of transsexualism Milton H.
