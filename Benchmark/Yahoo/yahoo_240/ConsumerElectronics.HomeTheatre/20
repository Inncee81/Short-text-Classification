sub woofer making unwanted noise my sub woofer is making a horrible humming noise when either there is no output from amp or when theres a break in music or in the film im watching ive tried a different cable but this doesnt make any difference the sub is new i bought it to replace my last sub that ironically made the same noise ok this is a relativly easy one you are having a problem with ground loop isolation ie the power that your reciever is getting from the wall is slightly varied from the power that your sub is getting there are two ways about this you can use a surge protector and plug both the reciever and the sub into it or if that doesnt solve the problem you can run a lenth of wire from the outside part of the rca on the sub to a screw on the back of the reciever to try to create a consistant ground between the two components i had this problem with my theater system only because i am using a computer power supply and an bazooka bass tube out of a car i ended up grounding the rca to the computer power supply to correct the problem Loudspeaker Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Operational amplifier Vacuum tube Transformer Oscilloscope Spark plug Electronic amplifier Audio crossover Audiophile Universal Serial Bus Jack plug IPod Television Musical Instrument Digital Interface Electric guitar Carburetor Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Electronics BS 1363 Radar SCART Antenna (radio) RS-232 Nintendo Entertainment System Personal computer Circuit design Alternating current Fuse (electrical) Digital circuit Phase-locked loop Synthesizer Earthing system Central processing unit Cray-1 D-subminiature TGV Motorcycle Electrical wiring Uninterruptible power supply Ethernet Analog computer Switched-mode power supply Pickup (music) Fuel injection Computer bus Printed circuit board Ground (electricity) Capacitor Atari 8-bit family Three-phase electric power PID controller Halting problem X10 (industry standard) Advanced Technology Attachment Atari ST Electricity meter Solar power Xbox DVD Computer Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Noise music Jet engine Electrophysiology Trombone TIA-568A/B Liquid crystal display Drill bit Expert system Hearing aid Wire Welding Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Thermal power station Tire Telephone exchange Bass guitar NTSC Ground and neutral Overhead lines Modem Dimmer Commodore 64 Lighting Radiation hardening Quantum computer Overclocking Static inverter plant Digital photography Coaxial cable Submarine Aluminium Enigma machine Lisp programming language Embedded system
