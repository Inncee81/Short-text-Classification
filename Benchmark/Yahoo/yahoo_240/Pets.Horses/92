any insite on the welsh cob breed what is everyones opinion in regards to welsh cobs i know every horse is different but what is the experience you all have had with them i have an opportunity to buy one for my kids to ride but have never been around the breed before i appreciate any insite that you all may have thanks this breed is a wonderful breed for children and is very popular as a family horse because not only is it small enough for a child to ride it is also very strong and can carry a large man with great ease the welsh cob is one of four different types of the welsh family it is the largest and strongest of the breeds as it was the result of the welsh mountain ponies being crossed with roman imports such as the analucian it became a war horse both carrying mounted men as well as for pulling cannons this is a very versitile pony and does very well in both riding and driving and jumps extremely well these ponies are very brave and kind and come in any color except pinto and there height only goes up to about hands i myself never had a welsh but i have plenty of friends that do and they never seem to buck kick or rear which makes them very safe for kids if the pony is good with kids then i would consider it but before you buy it make sure to take the kids to see it and ride it and make your judgement from there if it handles all the petting and is patient with them when they are riding him then i would see no reason not to get it have fun Welsh Cob (Section D) Horse Pony Welsh pony of cob type (Section C) Welsh mountain pony (Section A) Welsh pony (Section B) Arabian horse Equine conformation Connemara pony Domestic rabbit Hunt seat American Quarter Horse Working animal Pony of the Americas Morgan horse Hackney (horse) Dales Pony Dressage Horses of Middle-earth Chocobo Scuba set Domestication of the horse The Red Pony Wales Cowboy Show hunter Aerial (dance move) Roan (color) Dog Horse show My Little Pony Anchor Icelandic horse Friesian horse Tire Lipizzan Maize Wayne Corporation Mixed-breed dog Livestock Falconry Domestic goat Horse gait Horse tack Species Dog agility Comanche Show jumping Skateboarding trick Volleyball Herding dog Kimi Finster Super Mario 64 Thoroughbred Akhal-Teke Eventing Zoophilia Evolution of the Horse Bondage (BDSM) One Piece minor characters Road Ancient warfare Labrador Retriever Dragon Booster Bicycle frame Shetland pony Bicycle Minor Harry Potter Beasts Hamster Mountain bike Cavalry New Forest pony First English Civil War Spanking Anglesey Shaggy dog story Kitesurfing Abortion debate The Fairly OddParents Rear wheel drive Milton H.
