senior feed i have a yr old retired barrel mare she is pretty running horse bred granddaughter of lady bugs moon she has a nice belly on her and is in general good weight she gets a timothy alfalfa mix for hay and she had been getting purina equine sr because i was not happy with how she looked i switched her to nutrena senior it's her topline all the way back from withers to hips her top line protrudes she is de wormed regularly rotating wormers she is turned out hrs day she gets joint supplement has anyone had experience with these feeds or another they liked the results on better i tried a local feed when i first moved here months ago but her tongue was swelling so i switched back to the national brands i was thinking on just switching to the nutrena vitality a sweet feed thoughts a little snarky are we anna thanks m r shay for the input good god m r i hope not a heart condition i need her to hang around another years for my own mental well being shay her hocks are fusing together at the central joint some days she is better than others we do trail ride mostly walking about once a week and about once a month or so we do some arena exercises and i usually let her go through a pattern at her own speed she absolutely hates being relegated to retirement but no there is no structured exercise for her it is a common condition in older horses without proper stimulation the muscles cannot build up to the point of covering the skeletal structure if she is retired i understand that but is she arthritic if not i always recommend to have all horses in an excersise program nothing stressful just trotting you can purchase expana reins the stretch reins used to train a proper head set if she naturally carries her head about her whithers but she needs to trot times weekly with her head slightly below her whithers to encourage the muscles along her neck back and croup to stimulate and build senior feed if wonderful as it has the lsightly increased protein they need and usually are made to be digested easily i am not sure about that type of feed but a senior feed that is not corn based is the best way to go i use xtn and vitality for my horses corn is the main cause of colic founder and most other gastric upset issues and is sometimes not easily digested by horses that would be the direction i would go but you are right not to put a load of supplements into her if she starts becoming stiff ask your vet about corta rx its a miracle worker and a simple glucosamine complex its sold only to vets but you can get a years supply for half the cost of most over the counter supplements is my payment but every vet is different you can ask him if he doesnt usually carry it if he can get it to you for 'cost' good luck but just remember most elderly horses have this situation if you have seen horses that look when they are that is the exception not the rule Horse gait Osteoarthritis Weight training Guinea pig Domestic rabbit Dressage Urinary incontinence Breastfeeding Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Fancy rat Welding Horse tack Milk Eye Rail terminology Massage Atkins Nutritional Approach Chicken Horseshoe Professional wrestling holds Insulin Dog Laminitis Horse colic Cat Organic farming Arabian horse Carburetor Clinical depression Car handling Exercise Thermal power station Mattress Gas metal arc welding Aerial (dance move) Traumatic brain injury M16 (rifle) Creatine The Contender (television series) Milton H.
