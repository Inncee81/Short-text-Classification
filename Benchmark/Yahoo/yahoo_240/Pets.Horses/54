horse back riding jumping help whenever my coach lets me jump she'll never let me go higher than like ' i know she knows that i'm not afraid or anything because she puts me on the tougher horses i also know that these horses would be able to jump it too i don't want to ask her why she never goes higher because maybe there's a reason that i won't like are there any possible reasons why i am years old i've been riding since i was there could be hundreds of reasons but the best way to know is to ask her you may not like the answer but you will know her reasoning and be able to talk to her about it i am not sure how old you are but discussing it with her like an adult might show her something about your maturity level and help her to make a new decision best of luck Horse Hunt seat Guilty Gear Dressage Equine conformation The Catcher in the Rye Eventing Diving Show jumping Horus Skateboarding trick Aerial (dance move) Three-point field goal Parachuting Pittsburgh Steelers Only Fools and Horses Connemara pony Baseball Stars Milton H.
