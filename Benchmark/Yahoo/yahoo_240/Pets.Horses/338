arabian halter and showmanship showing yea i know in huntseat you use your bridle but in western do you use this http www arabhorsestore com store images gazal al shaqab jpg or do you use this which i use on my quarter horse http www horselegs com show halters turquoise light oil html thanks even in western you could use any of the ones that you posted or one like the first person had posted i would not use a stock horse halter as it would take away from you arabians chizzled and delicate face features it would make your horses features harder to be seen by a judge in confirmation classes the first one you posted is a not so traditional but very arabian show halter you could certainly use a halter like that i would suggest using one like the first person posted that is a more traditional halter that will be more compatible with a western outfit that is what most people use when showing in western attire you could look up pictures of arabian halter classes to get a better idea of the attire and halters in the arabian classes i am sure you know how to set an arabian horse front feet square and the left back leg set slightly further back than the right your horse shouldn't look like its body is all stretch or parked just a nice lengthy neck good luck and have fun Equine conformation Horse tack Horse Arabian horse HyperText Transfer Protocol Professional wrestling holds American Quarter Horse Horse gait Bridle Milton H.
