would video taping myself riding help i have no pictures and no tapes of myself riding except for about two months after i first started a couple of the other girls at the barn have told me it can really help to see what you're doing wrong and correct yourself especially with some of the posture problems i have should i bother or not it seems like a bit of a pain and if it wouldn't help i don't want to bother i ride with a trainer and anywhere from one to three other girls and all of us make sure to help the others correct their mistakes so i'm in no way suffering from lack of critique but i still don't improve the little things because i forget them in favor of working on bigger things so people have suggested taping video taping yourself is one of the best tools you can use for improvement in your riding skills you can rewind your ride over and over catching little nuances someone watching you may miss going over rides with a trainer or friend is even better because she he can help you pick out weak areas and help with advice on ways for improvement re taping over and over again daily weekly or at shows will allow you to see how the things you watch and then try to correct from the prior tapes are set into action i highly recommend you going to the trouble of asking someone to help you with video taping in barrel racing it is done regularly for these purposes good luck and hope this helps wish we would have had videos when i started out but believe me i use them still today watching pros in your event is even helpful i never miss an nfr Social rule Milton H.
