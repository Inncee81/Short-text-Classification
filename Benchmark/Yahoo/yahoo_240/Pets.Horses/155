where can you go to get info on western riding my daughter lives in arkansas and does it and barrel racing and i'm trying to strengthen our bond by getting some knowledge because it is her passion and i know nothing about it first off you rock that's the coolest thing i've heard all week i wish my daughter's dad had taken that kind of interest in her when she was younger i recommend checking out a few local barns and taking a few lessons find a good trainer tell them what your goal is and even if you aren't interested in horses take two or three lessons not only will you get knowledge but you'll gain experiences to share with her and should y'all go riding together you'll feel more comfortable and can concintrate on bonding instead of staying on lol good luck and best question evah c Socrates Nicomachean Ethics Milton H.
