barrel racers do you do this i don't do alot of extra things for my horse in the way of suppliments for my horse they are healthy and well taken care of but my question is this i have a friend who is always adding things to her horses feed giving injections for this or that and then she gripes because her horse won't work for her i think she is doing to much to him and he has all this crap in him and he doesn't know what to do she trys all the new gimmicks to make your horse do this or that i don't get it never have i have noticed this alot in our profession and my friend is a very good horsewoman and i don't get how she doesn't see that all this crap is hurting her horse i have tried to talk to her but she doesn't or won't hear me girls guys any answers whew i am so glad i am not the only one that feels this way i know some suppliments are needed but for the most part it is over kill thanks for your great answers all but one and you all know who that is i know of several people doing the same sorts of things those dang injections seems like everyone wants to give them 'cause every horse out there has a hock problem one girl does this every so many months and has even found a person to do this for bucks now why would someone allow for possibly making the horse lame and i swear by what i've seen of this horse that it is not a hock injury it is in the stifle and i don't know if she actually had this horse checked out by a licensed vet or not since she is having joe blow out there risk her horses well being anyway moving on no i do not fall into this category and i will retire a horse before i start paying to have it injected thank god i don't have any facing that people are constantly running there horses to chiropractors message therapists accupuncture etc etc and they never seem to do any better in that arena i swear its an excuse trying to take a short cut like already said and then when they screw up out there they have something to blame their mistakes on you watch them and you can see that it was obvious rider error but when they come out and tell you what happened it's oh my horse is too sore or something similar and my thought always is so why did you haul in the first place i am completely against all drugs and i am soo sick of ace i have heard well have you seen my horse run if i don't give it to him but the girl claims to be a big shot trainer in our area lol these girls go out behind the trailer and sneak a shot into the mouth of the horse or at larger events get up and use the bathroom at about am you'll find people sneaking around their stalls pearing out from around corners i have stopped and peared around myself thinking that i may be watching a horse theft in action and ready to stop it only to realise that they had a little bag of goodies they went into the stall with and then fed their horse and back off to bed they went if i need to supplement my horse with something i will do that but i do not fall prey to all those articles and advertising tactics out there all the endorsements and promises of this and that its all just hype if you ask me and everyone is so eager to win that and gain points for year end prizes that they will spend hundreds leading up to the little local event and when it doesn't happen they are back to the catalogs buying new bits and getting on the phone to their chiro's etc and telling them they need to get back in if they would spend more time riding and conditioning their horses they may just be amazed at what will happen and the money they could save i'm not saying there isn't a horse out there that has issues but today it seems like everyone is doing it and if that horse shoulders a barrel there's something wrong with the horse even though the rider has the horses nose tipped to the outside the whole distance to the next barrel whew i could go on and on this is definately something we agree on in and yes she should back her horse down to the essentials and not pump all that into the horse Sin City Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Horse Friends Ben Johnson (athlete) Social rule Poker jargon Professional wrestling slang Tour de France Good Morning, Vietnam One Piece minor characters The Amazing Race Miss Saigon The Amber Spyglass Kill Bill Aerial (dance move) Humphrey Bogart About a Boy Toilet humour The Contender (television series) Craps Seabiscuit 1957 World Series True Crime: Streets of LA EastEnders Carburetor Blackjack Diving The Shining (film) The Inside Socrates The Ashlee Simpson Show Blood Simple Milton H.
