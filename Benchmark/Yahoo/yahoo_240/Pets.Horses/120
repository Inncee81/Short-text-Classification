my friend flicka whoever coined that term sorry but i just have to use it for lack of a better description what can you say to a person to get them out of their my friend flicka mindset my mother is a total my friend flicka advocate i want to get some ideas on what to say to snap her back into harsh reality ok to explain a description of a my friend flicka it's a person who believes that horses act just the same in reality as they do in movies these people think that if you whisper to a wild horse and pet it and love on it you can go galloping through the wildnerness bareback without having to actually break it they think it's cruel to give a horse a slap for anything even if it's mowing you down kicking or biting at you or is otherwise showing bratty behaviors they often give you bad advice for such situations like feeding the horse out of your hands and giving it lots of treats and love should the horse kick at you ect i totally agree with you mulereiner but what can you say to a person with that kind of a mindset my mother keeps nagging me you're so cruel to that horse don't whip him for biting you that's mean it's about to drive me slap nutty crazy i need a way to explain to her that these animals need discipline no no i'm just using the biting scenario as an example now now let's be nice and not target certain individuals in our posts okay xd show her pictures of what happens to the blm's that end up at auction because someone with that mindset bought them for their teenager try to look on youtube for horses gone crazy videos to show her if that doesn't sink in show her the bronc competitions on espn those horses are that way for a reason my friend flicka thunderhead and green grass of wyoming is the ultimate trilogy but there was more to the original my friend flicka than was portrayed in the recent rendition when the original came out the majority of people were still country bumpkins with a little bit of horse sense enough to know what side to mount on the new my friend flicka was a good movie for disney purposes but it just reinforced the belief of the citizens that they can hop on a wild animal and gallop away with the aid of a few carrots and sneaking into the pasture it's a damn shame people should leave the horses to the horse people and if they want to learn about them they should do it slowly and invest into it free horses cheap or free trainers trouble old cowboy saying green green black and blue Horse Theory of conduct Only Fools and Horses Horse breaking W.I.T.C.H.
