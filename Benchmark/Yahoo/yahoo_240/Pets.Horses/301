strange mark on horses shoulder my horse has had a strange circle shaped indent on her right shoulder since i got her about months ago i havent seen it get larger or really cause an issue i figured it was an old injury about a week agoi noticed that in the same spot but on the other shoulder a smaller circle indent like the other seems to be developing the vet came out to check her and didnt say anything about it i was just wondering if anyone has seen this before is it just the shape of her muscle or do i need to get the vet back out my saddle fits fine its on her shoulder above her forearm and closer to her neck it sounds like one of those thumbprints she is a tb the one she already had is about inches long or so the other one is like an inch you can get indents on the neck as far down as the shoulders and they are called mohammad's thumbprints they are usually within the region of the jugular but i've seen them in other places the story says that when the prophet mohammed laid his hand on the first arabian horse he left his thumbprint and all descendants of that horse carry the mark i've seen loads of tb's with them and they are harmless of course can't tell if that's what you are talking about quaint little tale though Horse Professional wrestling holds Arabian horse Humerus Aerial (dance move) Terminal ballistics Piledriver (professional wrestling) Doom enemies Weight training Double bass Scapula Neck Knife Ulna Mattress Harp Captain Thunderbolt Chair Wildcat cartridge Bass guitar Occipital bone Sin City Powerbomb Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Guinea pig Bullet Professional wrestling attacks Anatomical terms of location Thoroughbred Brassiere Conan the Barbarian Casualty lifting Repetitive strain injury Contredanse Internal ballistics Shotgun Swingout M16 (rifle) Eventing Parade (military) Glossary of climbing terms Suplex Strike (attack) Carbine Sailing Opportunity rover Leaf Dog agility Bow (weapon) Springfield 1903 rifle Succession crisis (Mormonism) Archery Wing Chun Professional wrestling aerial techniques Leopard Dog Tire Woodworking The Empty Child Whip Tetrapod Softball Hand The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Drill bit Massage Randy Orton Hey Jude Muhammad Microchip implant (animal) Heckler & Koch G3 Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Dutch Schultz MS-06 Zaku II Akhal-Teke Conspiracy (TNG episode) Unreal Scoliosis Cowboy Neckbreaker Scar Jennifer Parker Temporal bone Compact audio cassette Road The Inside Spanking Shawn Michaels Puberty Recumbent bicycle Nintendo GameCube Triage Nine Inch Nails Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Patterson-Gimlin film Hamster
