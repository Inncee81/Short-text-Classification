horse care products i've been hoping forever that i'll finally be able to own my own horse one day its becoming nearer and nearer in reach my dad is getting a raise and business plans are getting better so next year he says that we'll be able to get a horse most likely i'm very excited i have a horse i'm hoping for but she may as well be sold by then sadly i know quite a few things about horses but not everything whe the day comes where i get to go out and buy grooming supplies and begin looking at tack and stuff what are your favorite brands of supplies and tack from flie spray to brushes to saddles tell me what you recomend and what all do you buy that is nesicarry that probably sounds dumb but really i'd like a list thanks ok let's see if i can think of everything off the top of my head grooming i like to have a soft bristled brush stiff bristled brush rubber curry comb metal curry comb or shedding blade hoof pick the kind with the brush on one side long plastic comb pulling comb if you plan on showing show sheen or some other shine detangler spray small bucket sponge shampoo sweat scraper the kind with the rubber squeegee sort of thing are the best and there's a thing called a slick n easy grooming block that's also good to have great for getting rid of bot flies i used to use a brand of shampoo conditioner detangler called sunsheild it smelled great and helped keep the horse's coat from fading in the sun however i haven't seen it sold anywhere in a long time i'm not sure if it's made anymore if you can find it though i highly recommend it what brand of brushes eh i honestly don't think it matters that much don't waste your money on super expensive brushes just make sure that you have a soft brush that's gentle enough to use on the horse's face for fly spray i think repel x was what i used a lot i've tried a ton of different brands some worked ok some worked great for a little while and then stopped working and some didn't work at all i never had any luck with bronco i tried endure mosquito halt and supershield green and all worked fairly well if i remember correctly but were pricier i think repel x was my favorite though i bought a huge bottle of concentrate you just add it to a certain amount of water in a spray bottle which lasted forever and was way cheaper that way you'll also want to get some swat it's a cream that you can put on scrapes and cuts they happen sometimes to keep flies off it comes in pink and clear get the clear unless you don't mind having fluorescent pink spots on your horse along with that you should have some sort of horsey first aid kit with vet wrap and anything else that may be necessary in case of emergency you'll need to deworm your horse every weeks i like ivermectin wormers you can buy them generic for cheaply or there's also zimectrin which is a good brand we used to also worm my horses once a year with safeguard it's good to rotate wormers there are several different effective ways of doing this you'll probably want to get your horse a blanket for the winter if you don't clip and don't live in an extremely cold environment you may just need a light sheet at the most most horses can do fine without a blanket i think more than anything it makes you feel better knowing your baby is nice and warm other things hmm polo wraps you can find all kinds of cool fun colors and patterns or go with the simple classic white you'll need a fly mask i like the ordinary fly masks that farnam makes they're a good thick material that doesn't get torn too easily and they have fleece around the edges for comfort i tried a mask that had ears on it once and my pony hated it i had to cut them off to keep him from rubbing it off all the time some horses don't mind it though obviously you'll need a halter and lead rope i like leather halters myself but nylon halters are great too if you want some color just make sure that if you plan to turn your horse out to pasture with a halter on that you use a leather halter it's dangerous to turn a horse out with a nylon halter since they won't break should the horse get tangled for a lead rope get one of those round poly lead ropes like this http www statelinetack com itemdy asp t slt bgu avoid the flat nylon leads they can burn your hands a lot worse if the horse pulls the rope through your hands don't get a lead with a chain unless you need the chain which for your first horse i really hope you wouldn't you want to be able to hold the lead rope next to where it attaches to the halter comfortably and holding onto a chain isn't comfortable without knowing more about what kind of riding you do i don't know what to suggest as far as bridle saddle etc one thing i can tell you though is don't waste your money on cheap leather save your money and buy a nicer quality saddle or get a synthetic saddle wintec saddles are awesome if you ride english get a shaped fleece pad unless you ride dressage in which case a square quilted pad would be a good choice for western i like a navajo pad they're not expensive come in all sorts of colors and i even used mine with my dressage saddle sometimes i like neoprene girths cinches they're easy to clean and are comfy for the horse also get a girth that has elastic on the end if you ride english get a bridle that has either web or laced reins plain reins are harder to hold on to if you ride western i like a plain harness leather one ear headstall with split reins for normal riding it's simple looks nice and inexpensive for showing i used to have a beautiful light oil headstall with rawhide and horsehair trim it was gorgeous that's all i can think of right now there's always more stuff to buy it'll seem like you're always needing to make a trip to the tack store
