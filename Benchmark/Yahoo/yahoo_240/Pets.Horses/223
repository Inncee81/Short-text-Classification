horse riding i wounder how much time in average would someone take from zero to be a good horse rider i guess it would also depend not only upon the rider the horse the instructor but also what you define good as if you define good as olympic level grand prix jumper or world class level reiner etc then consider that most of theeeeee top riders have ridden every day of their lives since their early childhood and have ridden many horses per day this is best chance of learning riding more than one horse getting that vast experience it is what will get you over the bumps and get you to learn your trade better ride many horses a day and in years or so you'll probably be a top competitor with quality instruction and the right horses of course if you consider good a person who can go from not knowing anything to being able to properly ride through a walk trot canter and basically build a safe enough level of skill to go out and enjoy themselves on a trail or something like that i would say that this goal would probably be acheivable in months with the right instruction the right horse and regular lessons at least a week Horse Dressage Eventing Equine conformation Hunt seat Show jumping Dog agility Snowboarding Seabiscuit Cross-country equestrianism Equitation Parachuting Show hunter Bicycle Tennessee Walker Tour de France Scientology beliefs and practices Cowboy Battles of Lexington and Concord Road bicycle racing Education in the People's Republic of China Kitesurfing Paragliding Education Individual time trial Horse tack Eddy Merckx Species Literacy Roller coaster High jump BASE jumping Trail Alexander Technique Japanese tea ceremony Skateboarding trick Rolex Kentucky Three Day Motorcycle Valentino Rossi Army Cadet Force 2000 Summer Olympics Norway national football team Mountain bike Standardbred horse Volleyball Horse breaking Lucinda Green Mike Smith (jockey) Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Icelandic horse Arabian horse Steve Backley Milton H.
