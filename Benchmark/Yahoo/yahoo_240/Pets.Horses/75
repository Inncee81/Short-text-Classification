horse with infected hock my horse is currently in horsey hospital with an infected hock after being kicked in the field he may also have a hairline fracture which hasn't been confirmed yet however the vets are not worried about this his infected hock has been operated on and all the infection has hopefully been removed and its just a case of waiting to see if it comes back or not and waiting forit to heal has anyone had any experience with this and can let me know how the horse that they know about is back normal etc plz dont anyone just say get him put down as the vets are not saying this and its a very sensitive subject i just want to see if others have had this problem and recovered thanks a lot depends if the infection was in the bursa which is the tendon sheath we had a very expensive show prospect yearling same thing got kicked in the hock infection and she had surgery to flush it it can be a very slow and long process and once he comes home you probably will still be giving antibiotics and changing dressings several times per day our yearling had to wear a pressure garment that went from the fetlock up just past the hock over the top of the dressings because she was a yearling we were in no hurry to start her but it finished any hopes of her being a show horse because the cap of the hock became bulbous with quite a large scar she was eventually broken and sold more as a family type horse the main thing is to write down all the questions that you have and ask the vet before she comes home follow their directions to the letter and if you see any swelling discharge heat etc that wasn't there the day before call them immediately as they may need to change the antibiotics keep on top of changing dressings and ask them to show you how to wrap it because hocks are a pain to wrap and have it stay in place taking his temp is also a good idea morning and night because if it becomes elevated that's a sign that the infection is coming back from the sounds of it the vets seem quite confident and i'd just follow their direction i'm sure he'll be fine but it's slow process Equine conformation Traumatic brain injury Pneumonia Domestic rabbit Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma CPU cache Prostate cancer Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Cirrhosis Hip fracture First aid Sin City Carpal tunnel syndrome Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Brewery Milton H.
