i need help choosing a horse for me help ok so i have been looking for a horse for a long time now so i found a couple and i do not know witch one is the best so i would just ride he she english jumps trail some shows but i do not have a trailer so not as much as i would like to but that is the way it is anyway back to the point yeah i know that you have to find the one that you just click with but i want to know witch one is the best horse over all like witch one i should put my money on well my parents money lol which one is the most trained or which one is the nicest or which one oh you get it thank you so much here are the horses http horsetopia horse for sale org classifieds ad http www horseville com php view php id http www equinehits com horses for sale horse http www equinenow com horse ad http horsetopia horse for sale org classifieds ad http www equinehits com horses for sale horse http www netequine com horses for sale h here is some more i have been riding for years and i am stubborn at times and i love a horse that is tall and jumps and is just a great horse this was that did not work but it works now http www netequine com horses for sale horse oh yeah i am ' but love a big tall horse you should try out all the horses you are considering it will help you get a good idea of what you want and you cant tell everything off of an ad but here are some things i noticed about the ads she looks nice kind of behind the bit in one of the picture it makes it look like the rider pulls in her head rather then really collecting her up she could be worth looking at though she sounds pretty quiet and experianced you posted this horse before i think i like the look of him although his pic isn't very flattering it looks like just bad photography he looks nice and quiet deffinitly worth looking at she looks nice but i would deffinitly want to know why so cheap she looks like a nice horse but her price makes me wonder she may be difficult to ride have some vice issue or just need some miles on her this one is completly different from the other ads you posted she looks to be the most all around horse but she is also short is an akward height it is just over being a pony and a hand horse will have a hard time competing against larger horses with bigger strides she sounds well trained and quiet if you are looking for a horse that will be decent at a few different disciplines and a nice quiet ride she could be great but if you are looking to win a ton of blue ribbons in jumping i would pass on her this horse sounds like the total opposit to horse number he sounds pretty green esp over fences i honestly dont like his look under saddle kind of behind the bit and he doesnt look to have much of stride but these things could be due to bad photography he is bigger though and if he is a decent mover and you have the ability to finish his training he could be worth looking at i like this horse a lot the owner is being very optomistic when they say he will win at the congress this horse wont get a look in at the congress in hunt seat events purely because of his height they want hh tb looking horses with huge strides but he looks to be a really cute mover nice conformation and he sounds really quiet he looks like he will be a great all around horse he is a little young so he may need some finishing but if you ride well and have an instructor it shouldnt be too hard to finish his training providing he is quiet he also looks like he will be a great all around horse i would deffinitly go look at this horse in fact if i lived out near ma i would go look at him for myself he looks really nice aswell looks to have good jumping form sounds like a nice horse i would also deffinitly look at this one too he sounds very experianced and well trained this horse and are my favorites but it all really depends on what you want go try all the horses you like and make a choice from there Equine conformation Horse Eventing Show hunter Show jumping Hunt seat Horse gait Theory of conduct Horse tack Poker jargon Seabiscuit Cowboy Microeconomics Dressage Equitation My Little Pony Fast bowling Tai shogi Sin City The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Usher (entertainer) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Arabian horse Jennifer Lopez Time Out of Mind John Wayne Martial art Bubble Bobble Connemara pony Electronic commerce Taikyoku shogi RuneScape quests Cross-country skiing Humphrey Bogart Captain Thunderbolt Gambling Kodocha MoveOn Milton H.
