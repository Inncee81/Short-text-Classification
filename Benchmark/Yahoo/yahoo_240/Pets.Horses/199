horse with heaves my year old mare has heaves started years ago and this year we had to start her on dex and now we switched to prednisone she seems to have the most problems if the grass gets high so we keep it mowed short any advice or tips to help her to remain comfortable would be great my vet says just to keep doing what i'm doing but it's breaking my heart thanks yeah i don't want her on the steroids long term i will definately ask my vet about the inhalers and the syrup she did really well til about weeks ago and she suddenly started coughing and wheezing really bad scared me to death it's somewhat under control now with cc's dex a day hopefully we can go to something without all of these sideeffects thanks she is outside all day really rural area in fl this time of year they have so much grass they don't even touch the hay but when they do eat it we soak it while we are at work she seems to only have this problem during the summer thanks for your help keeping the seed heads from the bahia mowed down definately helps too much grass right now no need for hay this only occurs in the summer dust doesn't seem to bother her because earlier this year before all of the rain they were plowing up the acres across the street dust everywhere and she didn't start coughing only weeks later after the rain and the seed heads came up is when this started again really stinks she my first horse for managing copd you should effectively stop feeding hay because pasture kept horses that have been fed hay still show inflamed lungs and airways days afterwards even though they are outside you can get products such as horsehage which is almost like silage without the risk of botulism another is mollichaff if you must feed it it needs to be soaked for hours prior to feeding and be fed wet do not allow it to hang and dry otherwise you have defeated the purpose if she has to be stalled she should be on peat or paper and hay and straw should not be stored near her stall ventopulmin or any bronchodilator can ease the rasping and open the airways the use of azium or prednisone stops the body's inflammatory response to the allergens dust etc usually with copd you start with a several day high dose and then drop back to a maintenance dose which they take long term we've had mares on low dose steroid maintence and they have had no adverse effects and it has helped their breathing it's no different to children with asthma they have an albuterol inhaler or other bronchodilator and then they take advair or singular which is a steroid for maintenance my son is and been on singular for years with great results the low dose steroids really can make a difference and improve quality of life and reduce the number of attacks i would not rule out steroid therapy until you discuss it with the vet because imagine what it must be like not to be able to breath and feel your airways closing up although you may be opposed to steroids consider what the vet says and if it's going to make the basic function of breathing easier for her Allergy Salbutamol Hay Glucocorticoid Guinea pig Anabolic steroid Psoriasis Equine conformation Acute respiratory distress syndrome Drowning Pneumonia Radiation therapy Cystic fibrosis Eczema Rebreather Breastfeeding Fire fighting Urinary incontinence Growth hormone treatment Lung cancer Insulin Bong Bronchoconstriction Hypoglycemia First aid Folic acid Carbon dioxide Mattress Tobacco Diving regulator Air pollution Dairy Botulism Non-medical use of dextromethorphan Ionizing radiation Sorghum Health issues and the effects of cannabis Domestic rabbit Aspergillosis Textile manufacturing Diabetes mellitus Hydrogen sulfide Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Multiple sclerosis Clinical depression Tobacco smoking Cocaine Growth hormone deficiency Prostate cancer Swimming Omega-3 fatty acid Cancer Bronchiolitis Liquid breathing Chronic fatigue syndrome Paracetamol The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Weather lore Weight training Chernobyl accident Aspartame Cannabis (drug) Puberty Chicken Atherosclerosis Crohn's disease Gastroesophageal reflux disease The Amber Spyglass Sarcoidosis Nuclear fallout Haloalkane Nutmeg Pulmonary alveolus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Opioid Bird migration Immunosuppressive drug Atkins Nutritional Approach Maize Migraine Drug abuse Carnivorous plant Toilet humour Decompression sickness Cannabis cultivation Ultimate (sport) Yarrow Thermal power station Mesothelioma
