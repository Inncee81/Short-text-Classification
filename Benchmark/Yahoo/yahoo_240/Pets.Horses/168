would you say that now in australia horses are fairly cheap generally i know there are the top quality competition horses but a general young all rounder is fairly inexpensive compared to other countries at the moment obviously there is nothing constant but if someone could give me a general idea of the horse market is aus it would be greatly appreciated the average going price for a reasonable all rounder is between yes the prices have dropped with people finding it hard to keep up with the escalating feed costs due to the drought but people that know their horse's real value will stick to the price knowing they will get it because a good horse is worth it's weight in gold personally i would rather spend the money to get a good horse in the end it is worth it rather than feeding a horse that isn't suitable i have been blessed with fantastic horses one i got for and the other i paid for so they are out there at either end of the scale i can't comment on other countries as i have never really looked at what horses are worth in other countries Inflation Deflation (economics) Gold standard Hyperinflation Supply-side economics Tax Gross domestic product Microeconomics Law of value Economy of Africa RuneScape economy Health insurance Money Money in Harry Potter Exchange rate Hydrogen economy Insurance Nuclear power Welding Tariff Balassa-Samuelson effect Software patent debate Capital accumulation Goodness and value theory Monetary policy Value Publicly funded medicine Ra (board game) Public policy Economics Economy of Russia Toyota Camry Unemployment Common Agricultural Policy Strategic management Roman currency Opportunity cost Arguments for and against drug prohibition Surplus value Free trade Supply and demand Paintball Public good Professional wrestling slang Commodity markets Heckscher-Ohlin model Gambling FairTax Great Depression Bass guitar Philatelic investment Airline Technocratic movement Bicycle lighting Economic history of communist Czechoslovakia Energy development Horseshoe Economy of the Republic of Ireland Poker jargon Pitaten Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Gold Exchange value Gold as an investment Prices of production Public transport Theory of conduct 2000 Australian Grand Prix Aldi Capitalism Monopoly Estoppel Uranium Final Fantasy XI MMORPG Mutual fund Keynesian economics United States dollar John McDouall Stuart Farthing (coin) Horse Bond Graduate school Canadian and American health care systems compared Equine conformation Bretton Woods system Value added tax Canadian and American economies compared Transformation problem Floppy disk Book collecting Internal ballistics Diamond Famine Privatization Price School of Salamanca Natural monopoly
