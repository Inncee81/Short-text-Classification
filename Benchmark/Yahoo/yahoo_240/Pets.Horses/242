are there such things as reputable dealers my two freinds came over from jersey to look for horses to buy both are experienced horsewomen who have owned and ridden all their lives both had the horses fully vetted as in five stage which they both passed one is now having to have a court battle as her vet and farrier told her a week after the mare arrived that the mare has a deformity in her leg which should have been picked up in the vetting been there since birth and should never have passed as she cannot be rideen ever again sold as year old competition horse the other horse has a club foot i'm not going to name the yard because of the court situation and don't want to jepodise the proceedings but is there such thing as a reputable dealer they couldn't use their own vet becuase they are from jersey and the vet wouldn't come over to the uk the club foot is not that bad the farrier has only picked it up because he has shod it correctly and the vet reports have not mentioned anything about the deformity in the mares' leg i think it's a case of the dealer knew the problems and paid the vet off to pass the horses the deformed horse the one that is going to be the court case the club footed one isn't couldn't be spotted by the eye hence the fact my friend didn't pick it up it's not a visual problem in short no there is no such thing as a reputable dealer horses tend to go to dealers for one reason a problem weather its behavioural or physical always use your own choice of vets look in yellow pages for a local one to where you are looking at the horse first find out who the seller uses never the one the seller recommends always have bloods taken proof of doping should temperament change the very best of luck to your friends Sin City Craps Horse Docking Equine conformation Piccolo Junior Saga Tour de France Roswell UFO incident Brian Close Garfield Horseshoe Captain Thunderbolt The Contender (television series) Microeconomics Milton H.
