how do i ask for a passage and a piaffe in a horse that has never even thought about doing one before there are three different horses that i might be working with a qh percheron mare very bulky but has good movement huge greenie but willing is spooky but not uncontrollable huge ground covering stride a thoroughbred gelding spooky long legs but has a bone shaft in his right foreleg and therefore has trouble with going to the right and has awkward short strided gaits a qh appaloosa gelding a bit headstrong quick but not uncontrollable not spooky tends to trip often big rather weird stride in the front instead of moving his whole leg forward smoothly he tends to bend his leg at the knee so that his hoof comes almost level with his knee then he moves his knee foward and sets his hoof down i'm not looking for anything fancy just something very small the horses are ridden all week by other people than me i only ride an hour each week and i'll have four one hour dressage sessions to try for it i suppose i can try it during a trot warm up during regular lessons but i'm aiming to be able to know how to ask for and get at least a little something by january which is when the freestyle performance is honestly i doubt that the thoroughbred and the qh appy cross could ever compete well above training level the thoroughbred has awkward not to mention short strided gaits which are a disadvantage the qh appy cross is also a combination of two downhill horses depending on their breeding some qh rarely are even or uphill but rarely can a downhill horse perform movements that are upper level the horse has to be on his haunches and even placing his wieght on both hindfeet not leaning or allowing his shoulder to collaspe the qh percheron has some potiential she has good movement as you say and a good ground covering stride however do not ask her to do any upper level movements without guidance from an instructor or a ground person who can tell you things that they can see and until you have completed her training if you are planning on training this mare up the levels i suggest that you read several books about getting a horse up the levels the late reiner klimke has a series i think they're dvds abou the development and training of a horse that is planned to go up the levels find an instructor who has also ridden at these levels even if you have already been there yourself one of my friends rode up to third level on her hanovarian mare won the dad perputal trophy and trained her to grand prix she can do canter half passe piaffe and passage but is now riding on a four year old oldenburg mare that she plans on taking up the levels she stills rides with her trainer whom shes worked with for years at least once a month Arabian horse Lipizzan Harness racing Seabiscuit Charisma (horse) Trot (horse gait) American Saddlebred Standardbred horse Skateboarding trick Connemara pony Fast bowling Professional wrestling holds Thoroughbred Swimming Tennessee Walker Trakehner Aerial (dance move) Show jumping Weight training Cross-country skiing Appaloosa Hackney (horse) Might and Power Equitation Captain Thunderbolt Horse tack Powerbomb Glossary of ballet terms Professional wrestling throws Japan Cup Dog agility Gliding Akhal-Teke Clydesdale (breed) Swingout Recumbent bicycle American Quarter Horse Paragliding Backstroke Icelandic horse Traveller (horse) Horse racing Makybe Diva Selle Fran__ais Baseball Thoroughbred horse race Professional wrestling aerial techniques Evolution of the Horse Bicycle GED Obedience training Cricket Hunt seat Battles of Lexington and Concord Oldenburg (horse) Breaststroke Dog training Comanche 2000 Australian Grand Prix Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Glossary of climbing terms Front crawl Alexander Technique Ravi Shastri Suplex Northerly Rugby union Ben Johnson (athlete) Softball Japanese tea ceremony Piccolo Junior Saga Tetrapod Scientology beliefs and practices Dragon Booster Extreme Programming Melbourne Cup Smarty Jones Watkins Glen International Snowboarding Mouse (computing) Motorcycle Breeders' Cup
