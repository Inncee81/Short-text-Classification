horse biting at chest shoulder when i put my leg on my year old anglo has these periods of biting snapping at his chest shoulder he mainly does this when i put my leg on i have had vet chiropractic dental work and checks with nothing standing out as the cause tried different saddles different riders but always the same he gets so bad sometimes he feels like he will buck or rear if i ask him forward i have found the only way to stop this is to ride with a crop and sometimes as he will attempt to bite at both sides he does this for periods of a few weeks then settles again with only the occasional half hearted attempt i have tried herbal remedies had him checked for allergies in the paddock he is allergic to wheat i am now at a total loss as to what to do in every other way he is a fantastic horse and so obliging and easy going what are ppl's thoughts behavioural or physical this is holding back our progress thanks i purchased this horse as an unstarted yo had him started by a friend so i know there is no history of abuse cause i also knew the breeder well he was started at yo put out for mths then brought back in to begin training has only had light medium work this started around months ago and has been on and off since he is fine with cinching girthing for us aussies ha ha absolutely no issues there i agree with some of you i thought he was ticklish but there is no set pattern i can ride for hour with no sign of it yet the next time he does it from the moment i ask him forward extremely frustrating i ride with a crop and give him a gentle tap on the nose or just let him run into the crop as he swings his head around and that soon stops him so i agree it is more behavioural but i would still love to find out why he does this my own thoughts are that he may have had a problem cause the first time he did it i got off and checked him out and got back on then did it again so i got off again voila he had found a way to be allowed to stop and me get off so he keeps trying it but i am wise to this tactic he is a smart boy i agree it could be that he has sensitive or touchy sides since you have consulted a vet dentist and chiropractor i would assume this is behavioral have you tried correcting him when he does this maybe there are some holes in his training that need to be patched up before you ask for any more progress from him maybe you could have your friend who trained him to come out and help at least you're on the right track Equine conformation Horse Horse tack Dog Professional wrestling throws Milton H.
