horse riding recently i found out i was taking lessons with this girl that i was sharing the same horse with for a show four months ago while i was doing ft classes she was doing the beginner w t and w t c classes and she didn't even get high placings since then i had gotten a horse three weeks ago and i have been riding well now she is taking lessons with me and this other girl also i have jumped ' and i am working with a green jumping horse on x rails probably the whole winter unless we move up when he gets comfortable i was supposed to be showing ' this september if i didn't stop taking private lessons it seems every where i look riders who were lower than me or on the same level are jumping ' and getting better with each passing day some are leasing horses and half leasing and i am sitting here wondering 'how any tips on really improving my riding i can't two point or drop my stirrups on my horse because he freaks out on the xtra pressure and the hitting stirrups con also i want to get more familiar with the horse before i start lounging lessons with him and my mom we were going to start today because the indoor arena flooded and there was a circle left but we didn't have the lounge line or whip and my mom said no riding so we went home after leading him around i recently have been taught how to post right by my mom one advantage over these other people because they all post up and down and their legs move i am riding hunters any other tips on really improving my riding at home and on my horse i am really serious about this because every video i see of me riding after three days of the taping i want to cry not literally yeah i know ft isn't a big deal but the highest i am going is ' so yeah i know i am not the best but i really want to be good and do well i am not trying to brag or anything because i know i have nothing to brag about wow it looks like i confused some people here okay the reason i am not riding with out stirrups i love to ride with out my stirrups because i am crazy my horse used to be spurred to go back behind the girth and so if a stirrup hits him there he will gallop he used to be a barrels horse and speed events i can do it and i want to do it but i need to get used to my horse first and train him to see that it is okay two pointing i have been two pointing my whole life basically i am training him to except the pressure behind there and the shortening of the reins we got it at the halt walk and we are starting it at the trot i can't do it prolonged though because i need to release and sit to reward him jumping thing i am not going to jump any higher than ' or ' probably in my life so it is not technically fence height it is equtation i have a trainer and take lessons a week and ride times a week oh and i am training him over the winter i just said that i will be doing cross rails all winter with him probably to build up his confidence i just got him three weeks ago and his training will continue under the guidance of a trainer all winter and then in the summer spring of we are going to show you answered your own question you can be the best rider in the world but you are only as good as your horse and if he's having issues freaks out with pressure and the stirrups hitting him you are adjusting the way that you ride to accommodate him and therefore hindering yourself the others are learning and riding on horses without those issues so that it's easy for them to learn and progress quickly but you are getting left behind not because you aren't picking things up or not as good you are trying to get better and learn while having to deal with the horse's issues it shows that you are a competent rider because you are still holding your own but i think you'd go further if either your horse didn't have these problems or you were able to get another horse that will enable you to go forward and progress quicker without the hassles keep the faith it'll work out good luck Horse gait Show
