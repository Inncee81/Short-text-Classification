what should i do if my horse rejects its foal my mare gave birth about a week ago poor thing in the heat but still yay she let it suckle for the first days but then the next couple of days she would allow it to feed we bottle fed it for days and it seems to be doing all right what is going on here why did she abandon the baby is there anything we should do all answers greatly appreciated there is no way to say why she rejected the baby the best thing for both you and the foal now is to get it onto a bucket and off the bottle you get mare's milk replacer and just train the foal to drink from the bucket if you have a black bucket it needs to hang from a white wall or a white bucket needs to hang from a darker wall fence etc they have trouble at that age making out shapes etc and this helps them recognize and find the bucket maiden mares can be a bit stupid and it might just mean that you hold the mare every couple of hours while the foal nurses or you can tie her short and hobble her however if she has truly rejected the baby quit the bottle and get her onto a bucket makes your life easier and the foal can feed as required in a few weeks as she gets bigger she will start bullying you and getting rough when she wants to feed and you are not going to have a bottle big enough to do it Breastfeeding Bong Dairy RuneScape quests Baby bottle Infant Champagne (beverage) Milk Thoroughbred The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Max Martin Hamster Teat Gray (horse) Social rule Avvakum Elephant Comanche Kodocha Fiddler on the Roof Equine conformation Dog Trailer Park Boys Fire fighting Childbirth Plastic Sento Antenna (radio) Big Brother UK series 6 Shark The Super Milk-chan Show Rum Guinea pig Professional wrestling match types Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Yoghurt SpongeBob SquarePants Lucille Ball Tea Captain Thunderbolt Sea-Monkey Coffee About a Boy Young Earth creationism Domestication of the horse Paragliding Friends Premature birth Ayyavazhi religious practices Glossary of climbing terms Minnie Mouse The Catcher in the Rye Ben Johnson (athlete) The Family from One End Street The Human Stain EastEnders STS-86 Mosquito Makybe Diva Climbing equipment Livestock Black Sabbath The Apprentice 2 Philosophy of space and time Have I Got News For You Dick and Dom in da Bungalow Knots Landing Hash table C__ile Ferate Rom__ne Faith No More Hong Kong-style milk tea Infant formula Northerly Lammtarra Domestic goat Firefighter Radix sort Horse colic Bottle Poker jargon Capercaillie Romulus and Remus Scientology beliefs and practices The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time weapons and items Fancy rat Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film) Days of our Lives The Price Is Right Seabiscuit Soccer AM Final Fantasy: Unlimited Might and Power Arabian horse Dead Like Me Kimi Finster Kitchen Drill bit
