best thing to feed my horse my horse is very healthy i ride her everyday and there is no way she is under weight but during the winter where i live it gets about below for about weeks there are some bery harsh winters and i dont ride her as often because its so cold and during the winter i feed her as much hay as she can eat but she still doesn't keep her weight on so i was wondering if anyone new of any grain feed besides oats that i could give her to keep her weight good for winter well she needs to be supplemented with a good quality pellet it won't freeze together like a sweet feed will in cold temps i like nutrena safechoice but any high fat high fiber pellet will work you may also want to add some alfalfa pellets and rice bran for added calories to help her maintain her weight in the cold make sure you start feeding her before it gets really cold so that she doesn't lose any weight before it starts getting bad and you can get her used to her feed by gradually increasing her rations you can even mix her pellets with warm water if you get concerned about her water intake when it is really cold make sure to continue rotational deworming and have an equine loose mineral source available at all times also possibly blanket her when the temps are extremely cold it will help her maintain her body temperature Dietary fiber Dieting Guinea pig Bread Domestic rabbit Milk Beer Breastfeeding Bodybuilding Veganism Carburetor Atkins Nutritional Approach Bran Capercaillie Water E85 Hamster Cereal Tofu Omega-3 fatty acid Temperature Vegetarianism Hormone replacement therapy (trans) South Beach diet Diseases of the honeybee Low-carbohydrate diet Folic acid Maize Soybean Chicken Robert Falcon Scott Nutrition Tocopherol Equine conformation Obesity Alcoholic beverage Carbon dioxide Brewery Tea Thermoregulation Rice Bird migration Anorexia nervosa Severe weather terminology (United States) Alfalfa Ice cream Weight training Food guide pyramid Horse Fancy rat Ocean thermal energy conversion Explosive material Super Size Me Weather lore Magnesium Genetically modified food Vermicompost Foie gras Water (molecule) Warm-blooded Chocolate Wheat Protein-energy malnutrition Carbon dioxide sink Jet engine Tlingit Diesel engine Calorie restriction Calorie Global warming and agriculture Ecology Solar power Thermal power station Egg (food) Food Goldfish Shotgun Fish farming Ceramics Sugar substitute Iron Vitamin C Raw food diet Portland cement Comanche Degree Fahrenheit Desert Hypothermia Horse colic Weight loss Sake Horseshoe Climate of India Dairy farming Little Ice Age Fecal incontinence
