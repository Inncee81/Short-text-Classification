which bridle my horse is really strong i am getting my new horse this week and have ridden him times so i know what he is like i will be getting a new bridle for him and at the moment he has a normal bridle i want more control over him but i don't want to hurt him by getting a stronger bit so i was think that maybe a pelham bridle might work the kind of work i would be doing is hard xc showjumping schooling lots of hacking etc or would a flash bridle work better or is there any other bridles you would reccomend thanks i fell into this trap with my jumper he would blast through my hands on course and it really unnerved me to say nothing about being dangerous when jumping at height he's a big boy hands of throughbred enthusiasm and i'm a tiny rider i thought the answer was a stronger bit to make him stop i worked with my trainer and we tried all sorts of combinations and rigs we'd see improvement but then he'd start blasting through the new bit it's a slippery slope i went into a clinic with greg best and he looked my horse over and said you might as well ride him in a snaffle because there is no bit on earth that will stop that horse i took it as a challenge and showed up for the second day of the clinic with a snaffle and a standing martingale you know what it worked it was a slow twist but it was just an eggbutt snaffle the difference was that we weren't fighting anymore i had to ride correctly since i couldn't just rely on more and more force my horse calmed down since he wasn't worried anymore was he still trying to take off of course but i had to learn to ride from my back and leg not yanking on his face it took an outsider's view to realize that we had gone way too far and that we needed to go back to the beginning just some advice form someone who's been there you sound a bit nervous about your new partner don't make any decisions on a bit until he's at home and settled keep him in the same rig until you get to know him very well keep your trainer close for those first couple of rides you're making an impression on your new partner as well so keep that in mind you don't want him to learn to be scared of your hands or learn that he can be naughty especially on the flat sounds like there some xc in there so i'm assuming you've got some dressage to do go in a snaffle if you can't do the flat in a snaffle there are other issues if you show in dressage at all you have to do it in a snaffle so there is no point in practicing in something stronger i do not recommend a pelham in your situation i use a pelham with both reins in the equitation ring since i need the extra control with my beast but i've been at this a very long time the pelham can be a very harsh bit it's very hard to learn to handle both reins and i've had a horse go over backwards in that set up what's your new friend going in now many horses go in more then one bit depending on what you're working on my beast goes in three different bits with some extras for mood swings and shows if you're worried about the cross country work and most horses get stronger out in the open i can recommend my favorite bit that has worked for several different horses i've had excellent results with a hollow mouth loose ring elevator specifically the three ring style i've found that most horses go well in this since it's a comfortable bit but you do have some brakes if you need it look for the myler version for a very nice feel for the horse put it on the main ring and it's just a bit more then a snaffle but be very careful if you are going to shift down to the lower rings don't forget the bit guards watch our for a horse learning to lean on this bit flash and drop nosebands are for a specific problem and if your horse is not opening it's mouth then i would say don't bother it's harder for the horse to breathe going cross country in that kind of a rig Milton H.
