i think i know somewhere in me that i am not enough of a rider to deal with a bad ankle and this horse but i'm not going to stop riding him because of that because i'm that stupid and i love him that much honestly all it would take is a word to kayla and i could ride any of the other horses but i need to learn to ride this horse well or i will lose it is this incredibly stupid or not should i stop riding this horse until i figure out how to fix up my ankle or should i be stubborn and work through it just a warning suggesting the doctor is always nice and yes i realize one person has always done it and i should have put this up earlier but i have like a clinical phobia of doctors so unless my ankle quits out two more times my set limit was four i'm just gonna od on tylenol okay so y'all seem to think quitting on that horse for awhile is a good idea but really if i quit riding him now i'm not quite sure i'll ever get back on him because in some ways he scares me and if i quit i dunno if i have the willpower and confidence to start on him again i would fix your ankle or risk not being able to ride a horse at all by riding with a bad ankle your not riding properly your compensating in some way which is not good for your learning process and is not good for the horse besides do you really want to fall break your neck and never be able to walk again much less be able to ride Equine conformation The Dalek Invasion of Earth Horse Milton H.
