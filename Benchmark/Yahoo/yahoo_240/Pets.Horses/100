horses kill plants can anything be done to change this i live work in the horse ind i know we dont live in a perfect world i read k horses were killed last year that means k that were not wanted most w bad injuries or others who lived w inadequate food no vet care for too long sure some good ones slip through the thought of a kill plant makes me sick but seeing some of these animals and the thought of making them live makes me furious there are too many in this situation to shut these plants down question for those who fought for the lives of those k horses are you going to open rescue facilities for these animals are you going to supply care others arent horses are already being left on interstates and the neglect is adding up its hard to hear about kill plants but it is cruel to make so many live in the conditions that we create people will let them sit rot that is worse until we live in a perfect world it is inhumane to keep the plants closed please take the right stand and dont let any more suffer i agree that the conditions slaughter bound horses live in before slaughter and the transport to the yards is horrendous many times these horses go from worse to worse situations living in foul conditions being abused no one takes care of their injuries or diseases ultimately the thing is that owners need to step up and take responsibility if you have a lame horse that you cannot find a decent home for and no room for them at home do them the ultimate kindness and have them humanely euthanized domesticated horses cannot survive in the wild turning them loose is a cruel thing to do sending them off to slaughter to become someone else's problem is cruel when you a bring a horse into your life it is your responsibility for the rest of it's life rescue's are full sanctuaries are full there is a glut of horses on the market sound and unsound if you can't make the commitment for a horse's lifetime and cannot get it sold then do the right thing yes the vet call will cost you and the disposal of the body will cost you but in the end you have the peace of mind that old dobbin won't suffer a cruel and tortuous end Sin City Simone Weil Equine conformation 1957 World Series Livestock Theodicy The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Horse Milton H.
