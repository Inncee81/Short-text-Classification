new horse with serious issues help my sister and i went to a sales a couple of weeks ago to buy some tack for one of our horses we ended up rescueing a yo thoroughabred gelding he wore a hole in the concrete weaving was stick thin and absolutly covered in cuts and scrapes we've had him for weeks now and he has put on so much weight it's like a new horse he is an absolute sweetheart and gentleman he has been really badly treated if you go near him with a whip he freaks out completly this i can deal with the big problem is the weaving at the moment it's not to bad cause he is out and he will stay out as long as poss but it is likely that he will need stabled overnight for some of the winter and i wanted some ideas on how to help him relax in the stable i have anti weave bars up a mirror for him licks plenty of forage and we are working on making the stable a good place i feed and groom in the box and generally try to give good experiences inside but he is still weaving constantly and excessivly we are at a livery yard with stables rather than a barn so i can't put up a field shelter or make alterations to the stable he is turned out with our other horses one of whom is in the next door stable he can't see cause the walls are too high but he can hear the one next to him he loads right away but as soon as you start moving he freaks out and has managed to damage the trailer floor on the way home despite the floor being almost new and in excellent cond we turn out with rugs as necessary and he won't be clipped this winter cause we are building up his work slowly as he has no muscle at all he could prob be left out all winter but our other horses will have to come in and there is no one else for him to share a field with and he is much worse alone if he is on his own for more than a minute or two he goes mad trying to see other horses this is something we will work on in the future when he has settled a bit more he has an old tendon injury to the back of his hind leg so will have been box rested for an extended period of time so i think this is probably where the weaving comes from as far as i can find out he has never raced although his pedigree is astonishing and he was bred to steeplchase but i have researched his background as much as possible and none of the racing organisations including weatherbys have a record of him every racing before you have to stall him i would start working on the problem now do approach and retreat pay attention as you approach to his thresholds if he starts to get brassy stiff in the body then stop let him stand there for a minute and the moment you sense any relaxation in him whether his head comes down takes a big breath muscles relax then turn and walk away let him rest when he is standing as close to the barn as he can handle keep approaching and retreating till you can bring him closer and closer do this every day till he is comfortable to where he is not feeling the anxiety which is what weaving is caused by anxiety you don't want to try to distract him from that feeling you want to deal with the feeling i don't know if you know the history behind your thoroughbred but i just got yr old given to me and he was at one point used for racing or they tried to how they train them to race is cruel and not o k and it can make an already claustrophobic by nature horse have really bad claustrophobia which when stuck in an enclosed place makes him instead of being and extrovert and flipping out her turns the anxiety inward and starts weaving i'm guessing he has a hard time trailering also will enter perhaps but gets really introverted and perhaps starts weaving there too anyway hoping that this works for you so that you and your horse can just relax Horse Professional wrestling holds Fecal incontinence Textile manufacturing Skateboarding trick Mattress Swingout Babe Ruth Professional wrestling throws New York Giants Aerial (dance move) Shaggy dog story Horse gait Glossary of climbing terms Archery Seabiscuit Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Wood carving Drowning Traumatic brain injury Diseases of the honeybee Dairy Dog agility Poker jargon Diving Boxing 2000 Australian Grand Prix Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Jon Secada The Time Machine Hamster The Shining (film) Rathfarnham RuneScape quests Humphrey Bogart Social rule Knife Domestic rabbit First English Civil War Drill bit 1957 World Series Blood on the Tracks Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Tire Sydney Riot of 1879 The Empty Child Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Yoga Sutras of Patanjali The Ashlee Simpson Show The Amazing Race M16 (rifle) Battles of Lexington and Concord Action potential Vegeta Anxiety Chair Professional wrestling match types Chatsworth House Fast bowling Terminal ballistics B-47 Stratojet Futurama (TV series -
