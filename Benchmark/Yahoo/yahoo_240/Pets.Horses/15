how can you teach a horse to ground tie i want to teach my appaloosa gelding to ground tie anyone have an idea how too if i drop the reins on the ground and say stand he stays untill i walk then he follows me anyone have a previous ground tie training experience good question ground tying is very useful in many applications but it requires a lot of patience and time to teach first unless your horse has been taught to give to pressure with the bit i caution against dropping the reins on the ground if he steps on his reins and pulls his mouth you may end up with a host of other problems that said giving to pressure is the first step you can start with a halter or start with a snaffle or mild bit hold pressure on the rein or on the lead rope until he moves his head willingly towards the pressure you may have to lock your hand so that if he pulls you are immovable as soon as he gives to your pressure give him slack and praise him practice this and remember that release of pressure on his mouth and head is the best kind of praise immediate release of pressure is the key to getting him to learn this once you have him giving consistently and softly on both sides to pressure on his head you can start attempting to ground tie him the point is to start slow and small practice somewhere quiet where his attention can be on you i'd start with a halter drop the lead on the ground use a soft cotton one that won't cause rope burns should he get tangled and boot him for extra protection pat him and tell him good he won't get what you're about for a while so many many reptitions are the key walk him stop him drop the rope praise him after some repitition of this when you drop the rope take one step away then praise him move back to him pick up the rope and walk somewhere else repeat eventually start to take two steps when you drop the rope praise him move back pick up the rope continue on should he move his feet when you walk away return to him and place him back in the same position he was in don't scold him or reprimand him and do not praise him until he is back where he is supposed to be keep working until you can take five or ten steps from him without him moving after you eventually it will occur to him that when you stop and drop the rope he is to stand until you return and pick up the rope the repetition will drive home the message another key don't burn him out on it you don't have to teach him in one day horses learn in a wave pattern so he might seem like he has forgotten it from one day to the next reteach him and move on his learning downs will get shorter and shorter you can teach it in many shorter lessons but many is the key if he seems like he is getting burnt out give him a break and let him think about something else best wishes and happy trails Equine conformation Horse Horse tack Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling holds Dog training Professional wrestling aerial techniques Glossary of American football Professional wrestling attacks Milton H.
