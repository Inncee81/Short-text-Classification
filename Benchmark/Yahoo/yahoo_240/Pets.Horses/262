how can you tell if your horse is in good shape i was wondering how long should i be able to ride my horse what should i be doing with her and what should she look like when i'm done if she is in good shape if she can't do these things or gets too tired what is the best way to get her into shape i ride her about four to six days a week and i'm the only person who rides her or does anything with her i usually ride her for to minutes and she seems to handle that fine when i ride she is trotting most of the time she is somewhere between and years old i just don't know if she is in good shape because she is fairly fat she is on a diet and she won't slim down just wondering if her weight is decieving she does look very healthy her coat is shiny and her eyes are bright she has been more and more relaxed when i ride her but doesn't deem tired with what i do i've only owned her a year and when i first got her she couldn't even handle half an hour i already mentioned she is on a diet and it's the lowest fat grain we can find she only gets grass during the day and i think she does have arabian in her i don't have an arena all i can do right now is trial rides but they are flat and dry and i do a lot of trotting on them i have just been wondering when you know she is well conditioned because she has lost weight and gotten stronger since i've had her her last owner hardly did anything with her she is not pregnant the place she lived before me was where she grew up and she was only with other mares know that i own her she lives by herself she actually seems happier by herself when she's with another horse she is at the other end of the pasture and she complains when the other horse gets close the amount of exercise a day depends on your horse and what type of work you are doing to maintain fitness and keep your horse healthy minutes of exercise a day is sufficient good job the amount of time you spend in the saddle is not as important as the quality of work when it comes to losing weight building muscle and becoming fit i am not sure what type of riding you are doing however getting a horse fit is the same in all disciplines you start out slowly and gradually building until you are doing more advanced work so how do you know how fit your horse is and when do you know its safe to increase the amount of work the answer is simple before and after each exercise you need to check your horses pulse which is the number of heartbeats in a minute and respiratory rate the number of breaths your horse in a minute after your lesson you will also need to check your horse s recovery rate how long it takes for your horse s pulse and respiration to get back to normal what s normal this varies from horse to horse keep a journal and record your horses pulse and respiration daily to see what is normal for your horse bpm beats per minute here are some average rates pulse resting bpm respiration resting breaths per minute recovery rate now the recovery rate is how you measure exactly how fit your horse actually is the faster it takes your horses pulse and breathing rate to get back to normal the fitter your horse is once your horse s recovery rate is minutes or less then you can begin to slowly increase the difficulty or the amount work your horse is doing remember that just because a horse is skinny doesn t mean that he is necessarily fit my horse appears to have a bit of a belly on him but he is actually the best conditioned and athletic horse in our barn and he is years old keep this in mind when evaluating your horse here is how you check for your horses pulse and respiration pulse to check a horse s pulse you can either invest in a stethoscope or you can just use your fingers i prefer using a stethoscope because it is a lot easier but it is not necessary you will also need a watch with a second hand on it to find the horse s pulse look near the front on the left side of your horses jaw bone under it or behind your horse s left elbow press firmly and count the pulse for seconds and then multiply that number by four the number you get is how many heart beats in a minute here are some pictures i found on the internet to help you see where to find the pulse http z about com d horses steth jpg behind the elbow http www equinevetservice com images proced pulsejaw jpg under the jaw respiration you can either look at your horse s flank or place your hand to your horses nostril and count how many times your horse exhales like you did for the pulse count for seconds and multiply that number by four the number you get is the number of breaths your horse takes in a minute recovery rate after exercise check your horses pulse and respiration rate about every ten minutes record how long it took your horses breathing to get back to normal don t forget to record your results safely getting a horse in shape when conditioning a horse the safest and most effective way is to ride long and slow with a lot of walking breaks here is a is an example of what you can do to get your horse in shape first two weeks start with a working walk minutes and gradually increase to minutes near the end of the second week have a few stretches of trot trot in two minute intervals with at least five minutes of walk in between next two weeks walk up and down hills replace some of your walking with minute trot intervals with at least minute walks in between gradually increase your rides so that they are thirty minutes long next ten days or so increase your rides to minutes adding five minute trot intervals with ten minute walks in between also you can trot up gentle hills and walk down them after ten days add about two minute canters with trot and walk intervals in between second month start increasing the amount of canter and trot work you can also start going over cavelletti cavelletti are four to seven sets of raised poles two twelve inches off the ground for safety on the ground with even spacing that is appropriate for your horses gait and the size of his stride cavelletti are used to get your horse to pick up his feet round through his back and engage his hindquarters to thrust him forward basically it will help his movement and help him gain more muscle mass here is a picture to help you get an idea of what cavelletti look like http www rene wehe de images cavaletti jpg note cavelletti can be ridden at any gait and used for any discipline you should only use cavelletti once or twice a week and you should let an experienced horse person to evaluate your horses movement and determine the right distance between the poles typically trotting poles are set at about apart but again the distance should be set for your horse and should only change when your horse is starting to advance and is ready to shorten or lengthen his stride month three now your horse up to an average fitness level and is ready to start doing more difficult flat work and maybe some light jumping remember to gradually increase the amount and quality of work to prevent injury also refer to your horses recovery rate before you increase the intensity and or duration of your exercises i hope this
