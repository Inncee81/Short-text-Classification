i'm thinking of doing a myspace want a public profile except from just one person i don't mind a public profile b c i think it would be cool to get in touch w old school friends who only know me by my maiden name i had a stalker several years ago he has a myspace account he's the only one i don't want searching finding me is there a way to do this i'm not grasping or is it all or nothing i tried hyphenating my name putting both last names together no matter what i can be found by just searching my maiden name even w the married on there too make sense drew r it's not a case of blocking him it's a case of i don't want him to know anything about me or that i even exist anymore since the stalking i'm in a new place new life etc sounds like you don't want him to see any of your info so blocking might only stop him messaging you and not viewing your info obviously you don't want to use a fake name otherwise people wont know it's you so the only things i can suggest is not getting one or having the police involved when if it gets out of hand if this isn't the best answer you get i really do hope you get one as myspace is a great place for friends and fun it's just a shame some peoples idea f fun is most peoples idea of idiocy peace out Theory of conduct Social rule MySpace Milton H.
