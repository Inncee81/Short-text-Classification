custom myspace profile youtube vids and other vids hi i was wondering how to put youtube vids on my custom myspace profile this profile is a div type profile and so i dont know how to add videos to be viewable i have pasted the embed thing from youtube into my profile in the space i wanted however it wont show up i think it has something to do with my custom profile and how it covers up the regular myspace format i have successfully put vids onto my page before it was custom please help thanks ok well then how do i make it so its not covered btw im able to see pictures and other embeded items it would be good to give us a link to your page however the code you're using on your custom profile is most likely causing the videos to be hidden and not show up MySpace Xbox 360 HTML element Embedded system Opportunity rover Nine Inch Nails Mozilla Application Suite Forth programming language Computer H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Linux kernel Vid__otron Fall Out Boy Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis United States Postal Service Extreme Programming Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Otakon Enterprise content management Aqua Teen Hunger Force Crossword Gaia Online ZX Spectrum ITunes Wal-Mart Stereoscopy JavaScript File Allocation Table Bluetooth Color management PostScript CPU design Don Rosa Super Mario Bros. 3 UTF-8 Len Lighting Xanga Surveillance Laserdisc Magic (illusion) Cross site scripting Nintendo Power Amazon.com Google Video Ebook TV Tome Billboard (advertising) Jennifer Lopez JavaServer Pages Editor Apple typography Musical Instrument Digital Interface Wheel of Fortune Cascading Style Sheets America Online Star Trek, other storylines The Ashlee Simpson Show Mozilla Firefox Censorship in Australia History of Microsoft Windows Satellite television C plus plus Information Services Procurement Library System/36 JPEG Digital rights management Pinball Dark Shadows MOS Technology 6502 Manga MPEG-4 Printf The Star Wars Holiday Special Ultima Online Super Nintendo Entertainment System Blog XML ALGOL 68 DirectShow UK telephone numbering plan TV-FM DX Software engineering Atomic Kitten Microsoft Advertising Macromedia Flash Video LiveJournal MS-DOS Apollo Guidance Computer FairTax Pools of Darkness ImageMagick VH1 Video codec REBOL Book Gmail
