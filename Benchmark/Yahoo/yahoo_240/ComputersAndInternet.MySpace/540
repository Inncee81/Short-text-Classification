why do people hack into myspace accounts mine was and ok mine was hacked into i got on my home page and it said this thing from tom said someone had phished into my account so i had to make a new password what should i do now anything do you think it is better to create another myspace instead of just another password or do you think that will be just as good and ppl wont be able to post any wierd bullitens or anything thanks well a hacker is also a person some can be good other's bad check everything on your myspace is it normal or someone has messing up with anything because a bad hacker will really destroy you the first chance they got or just silently use your account without you even knowing ask your friend if they receive any strange mail from you etc if not changing a password will be okay from what i could gather it seem you open your myspace using public computer eg school computer and forgot to log out or accidentaly save your password on the computer and somebody retrieve it both can be done very easily so be careful with what you do from now on back to topic as i said before there's good and bad and in this case it is either good hacker because telling you to change password or stupid hacker want you to be frightened but i think it is the first case so change your password should be sufficient edit i forgot to mention that if you use same username and password on more than one account you need to change them all the basic mindset if you have someone user pass is trying on the other site to see if it's working so change it all Password Hacker RuneScape cheats Gmail Phishing Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution Password cracking Internet fraud E-mail spam GameFAQs Neopets MySpace Internet forum Hacker (computer security) 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Rootkit E-mail Uniform Resource Locator Timeline of hacker history Password (game) Cheating in Counter-Strike Windows XP Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Social rule Stopping e-mail abuse GunZ The Duel Dictionary attack Surveillance Oracle database Malware Backdoor Password (video games) Kerberos (protocol) Buffer overflow Perfect Dark Computer insecurity Danger Hiptop Phreaking Online banking .hack Xanga Slashdot Undergrads Leet ROM hacking Passphrase Linux kernel Cypherpunk Web traffic System/34 Jumpstart 3rd Grade Neuromancer Spam (electronic) Forum moderator The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Theory of conduct Something Awful Forums Computer forensics RuneScape slang and terminology H2G2 Evil Colossal Cave Adventure MindVox Dystopia (computer game) Social software AOL Instant Messenger Database Gaia Online AOHell MMORPG Richard Stallman Authentication Emacs Ebook Cryptography Hacker ethic Chrono Trigger Pitaten Secure Shell Slashdot subculture Link (Legend of Zelda) LiveJournal Opera (web browser) Computer security Bad Wolf Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act The Long Game Mark Abene British national identity card Warren Ellis Ecco the Dolphin Witches (Discworld) Hackers (short stories) MSN Messenger Hack (technology slang) Shen Gong Wu
