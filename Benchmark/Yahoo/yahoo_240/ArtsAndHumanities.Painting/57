a sunday afternoon on the island of la grande jatte help i dont see what the big deal is with the childs face people tell me they see her face then dont i see her face it doesnt go away am i suppsed to look closer this painting georges seurat's most famous work belonging to the post impressionist period is considered to be one of the most remarkable paintings of the th c let me try to explain why and how one should look at it before he painted this scene in oils seurat made many sketches of it focussing on issues of color light and form he and his colleagues of that time were involved in a serious study of color and optical theory what they learnt came together for the first time in this painting where seurat employed a style of painting now called pointillism instead of applying paint with standard brush strokes he applied miniature dots of different colors which would form a single brilliant hue in the viewer's eye the right way to look at this painting is to step well back from it to a point when your eyes will optically mix these dots of color the colors then begin to shimmer with the figures in the picture seen just as the artist planned either as sparkling clear shapes or in semi shadow i hope this helps you to see the picture in a different light Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte Pointillism Drawing Impressionism Piet Mondrian Autostereogram Vincent van Gogh Academic art Miniature (illuminated manuscript) Cubism Diamond cut Wassily Kandinsky Looney Tunes: Back In Action Color Color blindness Grace Cossington Smith Rembrandt El Lissitzky Photography Andrea Mantegna Titian Glass French art of the 19th century Computer animation Portrait miniature Painting Perspective (graphical) Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Art Bridget Riley Hangul Stereoscopy Frans Hals Serialism United States dollar National Gallery, London Headlight Drew Struzan Pierre-Auguste Renoir Watercolor painting Diamond Surrealist techniques Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Alhazen Sundial Plame affair Brush Ray tracing NTSC CIE 1931 color space Mouse (computing) Software engineering Popeye Franz Boas Abstraction Tempera Light-emitting diode Film Stanton Macdonald-Wright Western art history Hubble Space Telescope Wood carving Physics __douard Manet Traditional animation Quantum dot White Billboard (advertising) Art in Ancient Greece Bill Peet Eye Topiary Comics M.C.
