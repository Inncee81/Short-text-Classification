what can you do to vary the tone of make your voice more musical without sounding silly and artificial i dont have a flat monotone voice by any means but sometimes i have been told i sounded emotionally flat when i thought i was talking normally i suppose sometimes you might slip imperceptibly into an emotional rut and not know your there and this cant help but come across in your voice and i suppose if you do exercises with your voice that makes you sound more up and vibrant then that will feed into how you feel mood wise and how people actually perceive you when you hear a musical voice its engaging because it uncensored and fully committed to the content of what is being said the first thing lose your self conciousness about your 'flat'voice you know not everyone can 'do' that type of voice so don't edit it out completely keep it in your repetoire of many parts of your voice that you're developing also know that there's one sure way to make your voice more flexible and that's by being silly when you're practising you'll have to accept that to some people you may sound silly when rehearsing but those people probably aren't serious about being performers become aware of the pitch of your voice by sirening from as high then down to as low low as you can keep doing this over and over again play with all sorts of sounds not just speech humming and finding where your voice resonates most in your body and at what pitches you resonate most strongly try to feel the vibrations in your chest back throat cheeks and top of your head by playing with pitch and intensity become curious about how far your voice can take you and challenge yourself by building a repetoire of different voice types accents and characters if you do this in the privacy of your own bedroom bathroom cupboard for minutes a day when you're performing in front of others you've already given yourself license to take risks and people love to watch performers taking vocal physical and emotional risks keep daring yourself and try not to judge yourself too much good luck Clarinet Timpani Violin Vowel Social rule Tone (linguistics) Stuttering Tonality Non-native pronunciations of English Weight training Harmonic series (music) Human voice Music Shaggy dog story Sound Speech synthesis Authentic performance Trumpet Jon Secada Synthesizer Flute Equine conformation Quarashi The Ashlee Simpson Show Friends Sound effect Blonde on Blonde Loudspeaker Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Fast bowling Definition of music Electric guitar Emotions (Mariah Carey song) Milton H.
