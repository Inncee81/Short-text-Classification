acting agents in america how important is it to have an acting agent for theater work in the us in the uk you must have an agent to get any sort of paid work but i've read that only film and commercial actors in the states need agents what's the deal and how does one go about getting an agent in the states also can an actor work around the country even if their agent is based in new york for instance you can definitely start without an agent and you can get paid doing non union work though it will not be as much and it is less likely without an agent you will likely do student films indies that are non union theatre usually not paid but some are paid etc you can still do unpaid work with an agent especially if it's something you and your agent agree would be a good move a role that would be good for your reel or a specific person that would be good to work with etc yes you can work anywhere in the world with an agent regardless of where they are based if you book a job that's shooting on location in hong kong that's where you go however you may never be seen for a job casting and filming locally for instance in hawaii they may only be seeing people in hawaii for a film shooting in hawaii because they want to avoid travel expenses and per diem costs for theatre it's my opinion that you don't necessarily need an agent but once you get to be a certain caliber performer in that realm it can certainly help because not every casting will go out to the general public if you want to find a legitimate agent to represent you for commercials tv film go to sag org use the dropdown menu on the right labeled 'resources' and choose 'agent information' on the next screen on the left choose 'find a sag franchised agent' and follow the directions you can look up agents all over the us but there are higher concentrations where the work is los angeles ny il fl ga etc another great resource is ross reports especially because they update their info so often but not all of the agents they list are sag and you have to pay for the list that doesn t mean they re not legit but that s why i always tell people to start with the sag list it s free and those agents have signed an agreement to put the actor first www rossreports com if you subscribe to backstage com you can get a combo subscription which can come in handy but can also get quite expensive then you can send the agencies your headshot resume and a cover letter stating that you are seeking representation and wait to see if they call you in for an interview you never call the agencies directly that is a big no no at least it is in la please remember that reputable agents take exactly of your pay after they help you get a job not one cent more and not one cent before anything else is a scam this is strictly for talent agents not modeling agents or talent managers who take different percentages once you have an agent they will get you the auditions but until then you can check out actorsaccess com you can also see if your state has a film alliance commission society or whatever your state calls theirs some have more than one sometimes they post audition information for projects filming locally for theatre and other auditions on backstage you can go to backstage com or www actorsequity com click on casting call if you find the audition on the equity site you still may be able to go as long as their not taking appointments from equity actor's only on backstage com you have to pay to get all of the info but the initial search is free and you may be able to see enough info to find out the rest on your own without paying good luck Screen Actors Guild Open access Plame affair Internet fraud Advance fee fraud Modelling agency MMORPG Online Copyright Infringement Liability
