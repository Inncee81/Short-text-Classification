does everyone have to get their wisdom teeth out i don't want to because it seems kinda scary does it hurt really bad mine have been in for almost years and they never mentioined pulling them out how old r u usually when u have to get them pulled out when i was in my early twenties i had both my wisdom teeth taken out at the bottom of my mouth i was terrified to be honest but i was sedated and frankly i went straight to sleep and had to be woken up they give another sedative to knock you out until way after the operation is over with they also numb your gums before extracting so pain is not felt at all during the procedure or indeed for a while afterwards you will be given painkillers and antibiotics too for maybe a week afterwards basically don't worry mine was a very comfortable and positive experience and my gums had to be cut to remove the teeth because they were severely tilting onto my other teeth please don't worry you will need someone to take you home afterwards though and probably will just sleep for a while afterwards too but on the other hand if you need your wisdom teeth extraction is a simple manner of just local numbing and extraction then that hurts a lot less and heals a lot quicker also straight growing wisdom teeth are apparently quite easy to remove if needed to be that's what my dentist said last time i saw him need the tops one done soon most importantly though the age of extraction varies wildly from person to person and frankly if they will only be removed if they are causing a problem and in some people they never have to be removed just because they are there does not automatically mean they are a problem or indeed that they need removing let your dentists advise you on this but if its not been mentioned then you probably don't need to worry about this as yet good luck Tooth Dentistry Wisdom teeth Breastfeeding Manual transmission Carpal tunnel syndrome Diving Chronic fatigue syndrome Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Bruxism Dental caries Theory of conduct Dental brace Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Domestic rabbit Social rule Mouth ulcer Oral sex Halitosis Dentures Oral hygiene Dialysis Bondage (BDSM) Drill bit Final Fantasy magic Equine conformation Adjustable gastric band Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Naval mine Cocaine Female genital cutting Certified Nursing Assistant Knife Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Diazepam Strap-on dildo Traumatic brain injury Chlorpromazine Sleep Grief Blood (computer game) Endocarditis Methamphetamine Milton H.
