wisdom teeth issues is it really painful for non impacted wisdom teeth growing in i don't think my wisdom teeth are impacted at all i can see the crown growing up i think is it was growing in sideways or if it was impacted then the crown wouldn't be showing or it would be shown pushing against the nearby tooth but it isn't i think the pain is coming from how the tooth is growing in i think its growing in normal but unsure if theres enough room the tooth is growing up into unsure what the name of the tissue is you know the very back where the wisdom tooth grows theres an arch and a lot of flesh that looks like cheek issue where the gums seem to end well my tooth is pushing that cheek issue in the archway and its growing in a spot and making room i guess its turning the flesh in the back white like stretch marks and its making it wrinkled its just really painful ibprofen only makes the pain somewhat bareable its been days of contact pain there is no infection im sure salt water and bakign soda are useless any ideas if this is normal for growing right yes this sounds very normal teething hurts just ask a baby try to keep it very clean brush across that tissue and make sure to floss the backside of the last molar down under the gumline the only thing i can suggest is to keep the ibuprofen in your system you might try aleve because it is less medicine to take get some freeze pops and chew on them either closed or open just make sure you are chewing with that area this is to numb it you might get some ambesol otc as a temporary numbing solution not much you can do really except get them extracted good luck Tooth Dental caries Cocaine Halitosis Breastfeeding Elephant Carpal tunnel syndrome Domestic rabbit The Wall First aid Characters of Naruto Fancy rat Dental brace Oral hygiene Dental floss Tooth enamel Dog training Cat Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Gingivitis Dentistry Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Equine conformation Tetrapod Twelve Swords of Power Milton H.
