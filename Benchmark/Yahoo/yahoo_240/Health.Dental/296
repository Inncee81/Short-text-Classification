how do i use the baking soda to whiten my teeth each time you are going to brush your teeth dip your damp toothbrush into a bit of baking soda that you've sprinkled onto a paper plate or dish brush your teeth like to would with toothpaste then brush your teeth with regular toothpaste plain baking soda can give you some results for daily stain removal but if you're looking for more dramatic results i recommend getting a whitening treatment i use plus white with their mouth tray there are many different types availalble but the plus white is very low cost yet does a great job i recommend the tray type application because you can let the tray sit in your mouth however long they recommend and the whitener pretty much stays in place with no problem anything else and you run the risk of getting uneven results just follow label directions for whatever type you choose if you have irritated gums or a sore in your mouth don't use a whitener until your irritation is gone if your gums or mouth feel very irritated after use you may be allergic to an ingredient in the whitener let your dentist know the next time you visit his her office that the home treatment was an irritant he she may know of a better alternative that won't irritate the lining of your mouth good luck Tooth Tooth enamel Toothpaste Dental caries Toothbrush Dental brace Fluoride therapy Halitosis Gingivitis Cocaine Dentistry Bread Plastic Bulk vending Glossitis Domestic rabbit Dental floss Eczema Psoriasis Equine conformation Hydrogen peroxide Chewing gum Customs and etiquette of Japan Coeliac disease Listerine Breastfeeding Urinary incontinence Chocolate Oral cancer Sugar substitute Flour Hypoglycemia Nutmeg Airbag Cuisine of Denmark Hamster Vinegar Fecal incontinence White noise World Series Japanese tea ceremony Orthodontics Wisdom teeth Dentures Audio data compression Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Idli Pneumonia Body piercing Irritable bowel syndrome The Apprentice 2 Methamphetamine Folic acid Hydrochloric acid Upholstery Paracetamol Drill bit Charles Goodyear Menstrual cup Hangul Cosmetic dentistry Houseplant Fugu Dim sum Paint Diamond enhancement Kodocha Crown (dentistry) Vegetarianism Glass Pancake 2000 Australian Grand Prix Mercury(II) chloride Common cold Hash table Bagel American and British English differences Dietary fiber Radiation therapy Carbonated water Tobacco smoking Bruxism Coffee Poker jargon Dental fillings Prostate cancer Gas metal arc welding Jewish cuisine Pizza Hard water Sodium hydroxide Clomipramine Scar Hydroponics Fancy rat Common bean
