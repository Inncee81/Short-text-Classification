hairline fracture in tooth cap i had one of my teeth capped a few years it suddenly shattered and i was left with a stump i had an excellent and extremely natural put in its placed but of today it suddenly began to crack i can see a small hairline fracture running up the cap it actually goes all the way around i do not know how deep the fracture is will i ultimately have to have a whole new cap put in its place most likely you will need to get a new crown unfortunatly when you have a crack in the crown it makes it weak and fragile you can have a lot of sensitivity when there is a crack in the crown bacteria can also get through the crack and eat at the tooth that is underneath the crown and if that happens then you got even worse problems cause you most likely you will need to get a root canal or possibly have to have it extracted it you let it go too long so my advice to you is to go to your dentist only he can tell you for sure if that is what really going on good luck Dental caries Tooth Dentistry Equine conformation Glacier Hip fracture Fast bowling Drill bit Hair Crown (dentistry) Plastic Diamond cut Wisdom teeth Baldness European Beech Semiconductor device Glass Mandible Bruxism Root canal Methamphetamine Hamster Enceladus (moon) Halitosis Ultraviolet Abiogenic petroleum origin New Zealand cricket team in Zimbabwe in 2005-06 Maxilla Ammolite Bryan Robson Eczema Ty Cobb Valles Marineris 2000 Australian Grand Prix Fatigue (material) Poker jargon Cheese Hitler's death Breastfeeding Pneumonia Diamond Fracture mechanics Collecting fossils Traumatic brain injury Characters in the Smurfs The Fairly OddParents Water Second Battle of the Atlantic Password Raisin Moss Piccolo Junior Saga Diamond enhancement Turquoise Weathering Alkane Brittle Guinea pig Knife Sandworm (Dune) Brewery FoxTrot Carnivorous plant Dental fillings Oral sex Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Humerus New York Giants Password cracking Fracture USS Yorktown (CV-5) Bone fracture Tyrannosaurus rex Ted Williams Honey fungus Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Material properties of diamond Cocaine Gypsy moth Luck Dairy Domestic rabbit Horseshoe The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe The Dentist Erosion Turner syndrome Ice core Europa (moon) Wood Orthodontics Rail tracks The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland Cryonics Pterosaur Metroid (video game species) Hal Trosky Dead Sea
