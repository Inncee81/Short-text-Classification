root canaled tooth breaking apart do you think i should get it pulled is it possible that it is infected i have a lower molar that was given a root canal years ago within the last weeks all of the tooth enamel above my gum broke off little by little and the large silvery filling that was in the center of the tooth fell out now all that is sticking above the gumline is the silver post if i touch the gum surrounding what little tooth i have left or if i gently touch the tooth with a toothpick or my finger i have excrutiating pain nothing relieves the pain ibuprofren tylenol anbesol nothing i went to an oral surgeon days ago for a consultation he took x rays said i may have a little bit of an infection around the root but vaguely answered my questions when i tried to get him to go into more detail he just wants to pull it i thought root canaled teeth didn't get infected if you have any experience with this sorta thing do you think i should get it pulled and do root canaled teeth get infected if they break apart like mine did root filled teeth have their nerves removed which means the tooth becomes non vital or dead because of this the tooth tends to become quite brittle and if not crowned can break apart such as in your case they too can become infected if bacteria enters the canal even though there is no nerve the difference being you wont feel anything until the infection spreads to the bone aka abscess it is possible the gum is infected because the tissues aren't being kept clean you cant brush that tooth due to the pain the tooth is so badly broken down that the only real option is to extract the tooth unfortunately hope that helps clear things up a little Wisdom teeth Tooth enamel Root canal Carpal tunnel syndrome Dental brace Gingivitis First aid Maxilla Chronic fatigue syndrome Prostate cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Mandible Traumatic brain injury Breastfeeding Stomach cancer Pneumonia Domestic rabbit Surgery Cellulitis Fecal incontinence Poliomyelitis Temporal bone Eye Drill bit Bruxism Urinary incontinence Insulin Wound Halitosis Dental floss Chewing gum Tuberculosis Methamphetamine Cocaine Hip fracture Endocarditis Fluoride therapy Guinea pig Oral sex Milton H.
