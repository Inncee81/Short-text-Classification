what does it feel like getting your wisdom teeth pulled im so scared i heard about wisdom teeth and how they're big and everyone has to get them pulled out and i'm really scared does it hurt do they put you to sleep or do you just sit there while someone's trying to wrench out two of your teeth when i was in my early twenties i had both my wisdom teeth taken out at the bottom of my mouth i was terrified to be honest but i was sedated and frankly i went straight to sleep and had to be woken up they give another sedative to knock you out until way after the operation is over with they also numb your gums before extracting so pain is not felt at all during the procedure or indeed for a while afterwards you will be given painkillers and antibiotics too for maybe a week afterwards basically don't worry mine was a very comfortable and positive experience and my gums had to be cut to remove the teeth because they were severely tilting onto my other teeth please don't worry you will need someone to take you home afterwards though and probably will just sleep for a while afterwards too but on the other hand if you need your wisdom teeth extraction is a simple manner of just local numbing and extraction then that hurts a lot less and heals a lot quicker also straight growing wisdom teeth are apparently quite easy to remove if needed to be that's what my dentist said last time i saw him need the tops one done soon most importantly though the age of extraction varies wildly from person to person and frankly if they will only be removed if they are causing a problem and in some people they never have to be removed just because they are there does not automatically mean they are a problem or indeed that they need removing let your dentists advise you on this but if its not been mentioned then you probably don't need to worry about this as yet good luck Dentistry Wisdom teeth Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Breastfeeding Manual transmission Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Carpal tunnel syndrome Diving Chronic fatigue syndrome Shaggy dog story Bruxism Dental caries Milton H.
