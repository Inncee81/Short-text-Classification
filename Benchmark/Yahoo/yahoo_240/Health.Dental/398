when i eat citrus fruits it gives me a funny taste after in my mouth and my breath smells funny why it should be the opposite because citrus fruits contain citric acid which stimulates saliva flow and saliva keeps the mouth healthy and smelling fresh also citric acid helps to suppress the activity of some odor causing enzymes make sure your tongue is always clean scraped with a tongue scraper if necessary because often tongue coating is a source of bad odour maybe it is your body's way of telling you not to eat them but if you don't have any other problem eating them then continue to do so because they are rich in vitamin c try drinking water directly after swiahin it around the mouth best wishes Tooth Citric acid Lemon Cat Acid Garlic Citrus Hamster Vitamin Vitamin C Breastfeeding Bong Perfume Nutrition Folic acid Olfaction Milk Gastroesophageal reflux disease Saliva Cheese Oral sex Carbon dioxide Healthy eating Vermicompost Gatorade Domestic rabbit Tofu Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Flavonoid Enzyme Citric acid cycle Biochemistry Dieting Water Flatulence Hypoglycemia Foodborne illness Hiccup Digestion Fugu Antioxidant Durian Apple Vegetarianism Hydrogen sulfide Orange (fruit) Chocolate Dental caries Cocaine Vinegar Psoriasis Sherbet Fecal incontinence Heartburn Mango Mouth ulcer Blackcurrant Omega-3 fatty acid Sulfur Yoghurt Natt__ Ozone Vomiting Tooth enamel Snake Stomach cancer Auxin Gastrointestinal tract Ginger Aloe Rum Kiwifruit Chewing gum Food Tomato Body piercing Salt Coriander Ammonia Phosphoric acid Lime (fruit) Fatty acid Rooibos Food science Mosquito Raw food diet Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Orange juice Skeletal muscle Egg (food) Fancy rat Limonene Onion Cancer
