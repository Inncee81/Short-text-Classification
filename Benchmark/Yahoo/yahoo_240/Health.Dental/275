fast ways to whiten teeth overall i would say that most of my patient's have had some measure of success with the crest whitestrips some more than others the results are usually pretty quick noticeable in the first few days best in a week or longer our office uses crest supreme which are much stronger than what you can buy in a drugstore and don't cost that much more vs you can purchase the drugstore version but if you can do yourself the favor of using them right after you get your teeth cleaned as any staining and buildup tartar or plaque will impede their ability to work also don't use fluoride toothpaste before putting the strips on same reason the strips are probably your best low price alternative much less than in office whitening or custom trays about i am also hearing happy reviews with the aquafresh whitening trays unlike the strips they don't have the tendency to slip or move all of the methods strips trays custom trays in office whitening have the potential to make your teeth temporarily sensitive but will not harm the enamel if you get sensitive use the product every other day in conjunction with a sensitive tooth toothpaste you might try to drink dark liquids through a straw and don't smoke most whitening toothpastes just remove stain on the surfaces of your teeth and therefore are not so effective whatever method you use it will not whiten your teeth for life as you age your teeth will get darker and may need to be whitened again good luck jamrdh a dental hygienist Tooth enamel Fluoride therapy Tooth Toothpaste Dental caries Fluoride Oral hygiene Dental brace Halitosis Plastic Tooth bleaching Cocaine Microeconomics Transformer The Apprentice 2 Explosive material Cosmetic dentistry Methamphetamine Dairy Mouth ulcer Oral sex Insurance Chewing gum Crown (dentistry) Inflation Diamond enhancement Psoriasis Bicycle lighting Allergy Supply and demand Drill bit Audio data compression Titanium Theory of conduct Breastfeeding Insulin Homeopathy Acupuncture Sewage treatment Equine conformation Food Dentures Deflation (economics) Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Water purification Mattress Domestic rabbit Corrosion Ultraviolet Chronic fatigue syndrome Overclocking Rum Raisin Magnetic resonance imaging Japanese tea ceremony Growth hormone treatment Tobacco Welding Electrophysiology Coca-Cola Listerine Coffee Alcoholic beverage RuneScape weapons Potassium nitrate Dental floss Medical analysis of circumcision Economics Gingivitis Hygiene Sento Textile manufacturing Poker jargon Daz Dillinger Fasting Surveillance Japan-United States relations Shampoo Free trade Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Wal-Mart Plame affair Coeliac disease Clomipramine Health insurance Digital photography Western blot Houseplant Gross domestic product Social rule Cheating in Counter-Strike Prostate cancer Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Bruxism Arbitrage Hamster Coal
