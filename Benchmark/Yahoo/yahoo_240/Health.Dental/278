do getting ur braces tightened hurt as much as getting them on ok so i've had braces for a few weeks now and im gonna get them tightened soon it hurt like hell for the first week wen i got them and i dont really wanna experience that pain again so wut exactly happens wen the orthadontist tightens ur teeth does it hurt a lot and for how long yes it does hurt but the pain usually goes away within the day your first time tightening it might hurt more than usual and take longer for the pain to dissappear but after you get used to it then it will seem like nothing i would recommend taking some sort of pain killer either before or after you get your braces tightened its not that bad of an expierience just keep thinking of those beautiful teeth you will have after all of this is done much luck Dental brace Drill bit Breastfeeding Nine Inch Nails Jon Secada Carpal tunnel syndrome Doom enemies Pain Migraine Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Care Bears (television series) Massage C.
