pockets between teeth and no periodontal disease i'm years old last month or so i got a check up no periodontal disease i brush daily floss here and there at least every other day wearing braces anyways i have holes between my teeth some of which are really deep and some are just coming about dentist tells me im brushing too hard i dont i brush very light i cant get lighter than that then they say its cuz of the braces again bull my friends have had em too and nothing happened to them and i asked them and turns out they dont floss at all and nothings wrong with them i mean wtf is going on here im pretty pissed any suggestions comments information would be greatly appreciated i am thinking that these spaces might be due to your teeth being moved sometimes just a little bit of space between the teeth can be a major food trap and very annoying also the dentist may think you are brushing to hard because sometimes the gums appear traumatized due to the fact that you brush above the brackets and also below the brackets closer to the gums than you normally would which can cause wearing of the gum tissue it sounds like you are on target with your home care i would wait and see if things improve as you teeth move jamrdh a dental hygienist Dentistry Dental brace Tooth Dental caries Oral hygiene Tooth enamel Halitosis Dental floss Dentures Toothbrush Orthodontics Milton H.
