i just got rubber bands on my braces anyone know a way to stop my teeth from aching so much yup i just got my bands today and right now i can barely move my mouth because they hurt so much its starting to give me a headache does anyone know a way to sooth them other than take pain relievers you can do one of several things light pain relievers like asprin tylenol works well too even some anti inflammatory things like motrin work really anything here ask your dentist for lighter rubber bands they make them in all tensions and maybe you can get a smaller thickness be reminded however that it may take longer for your teeth to go where they need to be and you'll be forced to wear your braces longer probably ask your dentist for heavier rubber bands i wore heavy rubber bands and cut my braces time in half years to about a year the only problem is that this hurts more but for a shorter period of time after about days of wearing your rubber bands the pain completely subsides usually it only returns after a really good tightening also remember the more pain you feel the more the braces are working and the more pain the less time there is before you're done with them good luck Dental brace Drill bit Carpal tunnel syndrome Dentistry Pain Mattress Equine conformation Wisdom teeth Bruxism Paracetamol Menstrual cup Skateboard Breastfeeding Orthodontics Car handling Anti-aircraft warfare Diving 1957 World Series Crown (dentistry) Massage Tire Operation Market Garden Dental caries Headache Tooth Trombone Bicycle brake systems Motorcycle Barbed wire Self-harm Table tennis Dentures Social rule Clomipramine Withdrawal Guitar Boxing training Fecal incontinence Knife Migraine Back pain Tylenol Stryker Chronic fatigue syndrome Tension headache Cluster headache Osteoarthritis Upholstery Carbine Doom enemies Tank Saxophone Horse tack Scoliosis Battle of the Bulge Nine Inch Nails Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Wire Cello Saw Charles Goodyear Medical prescription Manual transmission Darken Rahl Abdominal pain Sail-plan The Beatles discography Angina Peter Griffin Piano Leo Wyatt The Dentist Journey (band) Vulcanization USS Vestal (AR-4) Internal ballistics Shotgun Mouth ulcer Seismic retrofit Pitaten Reflexology C.
