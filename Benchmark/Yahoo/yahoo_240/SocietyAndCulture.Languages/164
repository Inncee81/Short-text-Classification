what's the best way to learn sigh language i feel it is very hard to learn a language without being immersed in it in my experience the people who become fluent in any language are surrounded by the language they are learning for a long period of time anywhere from a few months to a year immersion progams during which one travels to the country of origin of the language are very helpful but how to do that with a language that has no centralized home base i grew up around deaf people and studied deaf culture which included a bit about the structure of sign language it is beautiful and very complex the grammar is so different from any language i know and yet many people who study sign langauge profess to be fluent after a few years of study most are not some go on to work as certified translators and they suck most hearing people who are fluent in sign were raised with the language however it's possible to learn my cousin in spain did and she translates for parliament she's wonderful first take a class or two or three then try to meet deaf people and socialize with them on a regular basis so you can practice there are events that occur with regularity in most cities during which deaf people get together to socialize also keep in mind that there are different forms of sign for example asl american sign langauge is a language signed exact english used widely in schools even though it cannot replace the necessity of asl for the deaf is not there are other forms as well most deaf people who use sign communciate with asl by the way there has been a project in progress for a couple of years to build a town called laurent which will emphasize asl as the primary form of communication there American Sign Language Second language acquisition Sign language Signing Exact English Hearing impairment Nicaraguan Sign Language British Sign Language Languages in the United States Advanced Squad Leader Deaf culture Washoe (chimpanzee) Music Sapir-Whorf hypothesis Models of deafness Esperanto as an international language Deaf Education in the United States Great Ape language Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Language Multilingual Education in the People's Republic of China Chinese spoken language Baptism Charles-Michel de l'__p__e Language education Noam Chomsky Autism Home sign German language Hungarian language Philosophy of language Russian language History of science Japanese Sign Language Stuttering Experiential education Social psychology Spanish language African American Vernacular English Tactile signing Milton H.
