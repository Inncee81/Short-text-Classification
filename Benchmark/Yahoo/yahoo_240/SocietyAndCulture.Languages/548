anybody that can write in chinese if you could is there anyway u could write stay true to yourself and take a pic and post it what you are wanting to say is not easy to express in chinese probably the best way to say it would be something like respect yourself or something near to that there is no way to express the idea of being true to someone even the idea of honesty as we understand it is hard to express unfortunately the chinese mind set does not allow for this sort of thing to be correctly expressed in the language and even if you could it would not be understood in the meaning that you are trying to convey rather it would be taken something more like the idea of spoil yourself take care of yourself or pamper yourself the chinese have not gotten to the point socially to be concerned about others enough to have to worry about not being true to themselves basically they are the most important person to themselves it would almost be better for them to learn to be true to others the cultures are too different Philosophy of language Chinese language Confucius Simplified Chinese character Ethics Chinese character Liang Qichao Truth Deconstruction Meaning Religious pluralism Confucianism Social psychology Cultural relativism Socrates Infantilism Psychoanalysis Mantra Japanese language Meaning of life Lie Philosophy of mathematics Writing system G__del's incompleteness theorem Theory of conduct Alan Watts Logic History of philosophy Art Reality Chinese written language Goodness and value theory Epistemology Writing Universal pragmatics Scientology beliefs and practices John Locke Philosophy Drama Gender role Japanese honorifics Sense and reference Multilingual Simone Weil The Book of Five Rings Numerology Tao Te Ching Science Martial art Infant baptism Buddhism Irony Phoneme Identity Alcoholics Anonymous Culture Singlish Rudolf Hermann Lotze Social rule Natural deduction Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Franz Boas Randomness Sapir-Whorf hypothesis Chinese martial arts Cultural Revolution Phaedo Transformation problem Chinese spoken language Extreme Programming African philosophy Chinese grammar XML I Ching Python programming language Classical music era Dog training A Course In Miracles Hearing impairment Donald Davidson (philosopher) Love Cantonese (linguistics) Causality Japanese poetry Sign (semiotics) Polyamory Scientific method Noam Chomsky Coercion Tone (linguistics) BASIC programming language Hangul Culture of China Body language Internet slang Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles and Fundamental Duties of India John Wycliffe Artificial consciousness Autism
