has anyone made a career change into nursing successfully i have a bs in business and have worked in banking for years i'm thinking of transitioning into nursing but i was wondering if anyone else out there has a similar experience and how it all worked out i want to go back to school to become a nurse but don't know what to do with my full time job any suggestions i was an accountant and after i had my family i decided to change career and do something that was more worthwhile and personally satisfying i did volunteer work at my local hospital and then they asked me to join them as a health care assistant which i did for a year which gave me a real feel for the environment and helped me to decide whether nursing was for me i went to university to study nursing for three years then got a job on a surgical ward as a registered nurse i found that nursing was a true vocation and i loved being able to care for people physically emotionally and socially however after a few years of being there the love of the job has gone its not the nursing just the politics of healthcare the conflicts with staff the lack of equipment and supplies the red tape and paperwork the blame culture the lack of organisational support having to watch your back not being able to make the smallest mistake without the organisation coming down on you like a tonne of bricks the pressure of understaffing the fact that more and more work is put upon you and they expect you to be able to cope the fact that nurses are being expected to take on more doctors jobs on the ward without financial gain and the inflexibility of rostering and i've been fighting a pay dispute for over a year as i am not being paid enough all in all it was not how i expected it to be and it has been a real disappointment to me i am seriously considering leaving i would suggest you apply to do some voluntary work at your local hospital but spend the time watching the work of the registered nurse see if you want their stress level and their responsibility the training takes a long time and you need to know what you are letting yourself in for good luck Nurse Unemployment Nursing United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East Publicly funded medicine National Health Service Ambulance Health insurance Education in Portugal Social rule Medicine National Kidney Foundation Singapore Education in the People's Republic of China Reiki Chinese University of Hong Kong Ethics International response to Hurricane Katrina Reparative therapy Transsexuality Nursing home Mental Health Act 1983 Vivian Solon Graduate school Economic inequality Psychiatry Prostate cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Narcissism Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Gender role Childbirth Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Economy of the United States Inflation A Course In Miracles Avenue Q Independence Party (Iceland) Pitaten Hikikomori Triage Division of labour EastEnders Social work Palliative care Urinary incontinence Opus Dei Anorexia nervosa Paralegal Kyoto Protocol Seneca College Divorce Medicare (Canada) Clinical depression Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Public health in mainland China Canadian and American health care systems compared Conscription Dialysis Economics Terri Schiavo Management History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Far Eastern University Stroke Knots Landing St. John Ambulance Polyamory MMORPG Chronic fatigue syndrome Estoppel Henry Dunant Jessica Lynch Borderline personality disorder Alternative medicine Schizophrenia Mother Teresa Microeconomics Economy of India Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Simone Weil Combat stress reaction Emergency Medical Services Apprenticeship Grief Hypnosis Workplace democracy Drug abuse United States Army
