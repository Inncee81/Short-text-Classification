regarding a degree in nursing is a bs equal to an rn the sign on bonus's are they paid to new graduates i would need an online program and at per credits how far will finacial aid get me i could only afford a month if anyone else has experience getting thru this please let me know also what do they pay an unexperienced nurse straight out of clinicals bs and as and ms are college degrees rn is a license from the state you could have an ms in nursing and still fail the rn exam though not likely you can qualify to take the rn exam with an asn bsn or msn the higher the degree the greater your responsibility and pay a bsn start to finish online would be nearly impossible to do the bsn programs you see out there that are online are for nurses who already have an rn and the asn you may be able to find a hybrid program where part is online and part is in the classroom clinicals a month won't buy books the only way to know what financial aid you can get is to apply per three credits is a really good price but it's very likely that your local community college is even cheaper sign on bonuses are paid to new employees who are hired some are for experienced nurses only others for certain jobs some places need nurses so badly they want anyone who is an rn the average hourly for a new rn is just under an hour some jobs or places pay more some a little less based on a hour week that's a week a month or per year not too bad eh master's nurses average over per year what i'd suggest since you don't have a bunch of money go down to your local community college and talk to them about their asn program get that first apply for all of the aid they will give you don't turn down loans automatically consider the amount that nurses earn compared to what you earn now when you think about loans ie when you make k a year a month payment is a lot when you make k a year is lunch money for a week once you get the asn and your rn license years then start looking at rn to bsn online programs another years which at that point you will be able to easily afford at that point you'd have the bsn and years of experience a really nice position to be in to negotiate for top dollar nursing jobs sometimes we have to suck it up and tighten the belt for a couple years knowing that in just a couple years our life will be much improved for it just a few thoughts Nurse Graduate school Student loan Education in the United States Wal-Mart Education in Germany Unemployment Minimum wage Life insurance Microeconomics Education in Romania Unemployment benefit Bretton Woods system Juris Doctor Real estate broker Education in Portugal Paralegal 401(k) Wheel of Fortune Great Depression Publicly funded medicine Inflation Lawyer Poker jargon Money supply Monetary policy Bond Social Security (United States) MMORPG Health insurance Capitalism Canadian and American health care systems compared Education in Australia Grade (education) Price discrimination National Kidney Foundation Singapore Professor Associate's degree Mortgage Physical therapy Extreme Programming Blackjack Marshall Plan Community college Affirmative action Health care in the United States Capital accumulation Economy of the United States Education in Finland Predatory lending Supply and demand Hyperinflation Principal-agent problem Medicare (United States) PE ratio Satchel Paige Physician Teacher Software engineering Annuity Economy of El Salvador Primerica Financial Services Bank Progressive tax Monopoly (game) Insurance Social Security debate (United States) Copyleft Education in Japan Jeopardy!
