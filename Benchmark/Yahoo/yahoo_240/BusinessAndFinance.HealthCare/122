is it difficult being a registered nurse what is their minimum salary i wanted to know if it would be difficult working as a registered nurse is it a very hectic profession also i wanted to know the difference between a registered nurse and a liscence nurse what is their minimum or starting wage thanks i am a registered nurse and i would consider it to be a very hectic profession it is emotionally and physically very tiring and definitely not a profession to be undertaken lightly in a typical day i have three drug rounds to do assist with washing feeding dressing and mobilising patients liaise with other health care professionals such as physiotherapists social workers dieticians and occupational therapists i may have to prepare up to people for surgery and then care for them when they come back with all their attachments such as pain relief appliances drips catheters and monitors i may have to sort out patient discharges and make sure everything is in place for them to go home giving advice making sure wounds are ok ensuring home care is in place i will give telephone advice to people i will go on ward rounds with doctors and consultants i will do dressing changes take out and put in catheters set up pain relief applicances and take out stitches and clips i will deal with emergency admissions and refer to intensive care or emergency care teams i will do mountains of paperwork everything needs to be documented and there are computer systems that must be updated care plans must be devised i have to talk to relatives and help them with stressful news i have to deal with people after they have died and do all the physical and administrative things in a hr shift i have x minute coffee breaks and half an hour for lunch so yes i would say its hectic we only have registered nurses in the uk so unsure of what a liscenced nurse is and starting salary is obviously going to be different however hope this has been of some use to you i would advise going along to your local hospital and asking whether you can do some work experience so you can shadow a nurse and see exactly what the job entails then you will be able to see whether it is the profession for you good luck Medicine Prostate cancer Palliative care Childbirth Dialysis Traumatic brain injury Myocardial infarction Medical prescription Mental Health Act 1983 Triage Intravenous therapy Nursing Publicly funded medicine Traditional Chinese medicine Paramedic Anesthesia Nursing home Physician Stroke Medical record Urinary incontinence Stomach cancer Transsexuality Emergency department Psychiatry Breastfeeding Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Intensive care medicine Certified Nursing Assistant Terri Schiavo Emergency Medical Services Psychiatric hospital Division of labour Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East Psoriasis Call centre Health insurance Midwifery Canadian and American health care systems compared Community emergency response team Social work Osteopathy Medicare (Canada) Chronic fatigue syndrome Ambulance Psychiatric and mental health nursing First aid General practitioner Animal testing Health profession 2005 Kashmir earthquake Cancer Clinical depression Unemployment Social rule Addiction Insulin Education in the United States Education in the People's Republic of China Domain Name System Baseball Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Florence Nightingale International League Education in Portugal Drug abuse Coffee New Deal Registered Nurse Paralegal Hospital Chinese University of Hong Kong Occupational Therapy Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Emergency medical technician Surveillance Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Ethics Hurricane Rita Salary Local anesthesia Psychotherapy National Kidney Foundation Singapore Epilepsy Public health in mainland China Chiropractic
