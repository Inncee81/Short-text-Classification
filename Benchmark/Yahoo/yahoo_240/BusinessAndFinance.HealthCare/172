what is the best way for a hospital nurse staff rn to develop or improve time management skills especially when you have understaffing emergent situations and nonstop interruptions to name a few i dont think there is an ideal way to develop time management skills on the ward it is just such an unstable and ever changing environment what i do is try and create a basic plan in my head at the start of the shift and use those as a cornerstone for example start the shift at am after handover and spend minutes just going around introducing yourself to your patients and make sure there are no immediate needs for example no one needs to sit up for breakfast no one needs to have their dentures in no one needs a commode no one needs to be reminded of nil by mouth restrictions prior to surgery that sort of thing then a few minutes to make note of any important things that must be done on schedule for example scans xrays surgical procedures discharges these are things that must be done at the right time then at am i will do my first drugs round making note of any iv antibiotics that need to be given and at what time more things that must be done at right time so in this way you are building up a plan for the day you have things to do at certain times prioritise your workload if you have a dressing to do assess its urgency is it something that you need to do straight away or can it wait until you have a quieter spot in the day when you have no scheduled tasks to perform dont be tempted to always run to the phone when it rings as this causes interuptions and usually there is a problem on the end of the phone which will take even more time allow others to answer the phone too ask relatives to pick a representative to phone the ward for news of patients that way you can reduce the number of repeated calls about an individual patient every shift will end with you thinking there are things you havent done but hopefully by prioritising your workload the things you havent done will be the least important jobs and i'm sure the night staff dont mind being left with those Triage Publicly funded medicine Nurse Psychiatric hospital Medicine Stroke Call centre Traumatic brain injury Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Social rule Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Hip fracture Certified Nursing Assistant Extreme Programming Emergency Medical Services Mental Health Act 1983 First aid Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Windows 2000 Myocardial infarction Strategic management Thread (computer science) Stomach cancer ITV Dialysis Ambulance Epilepsy Prostate cancer Replacement joint Pneumonia Medicare (Canada) Microeconomics Traditional Chinese medicine Shaggy dog story Emergency department Jayant Patel Cancer Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Aortic dissection DragonFly BSD Air traffic controller About a Boy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) RISC Medical record Breastfeeding Psychosurgery Malignant melanoma Psychiatry Abortion Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Cornelia Rau Norway national football team Patent Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans National Institutes of Health Mach kernel Information Technology Infrastructure Library History of intersex surgery Health insurance Emergency medical technician Ariel (Firefly episode) Pittsburgh Steelers Field hospital Childbirth Capitalism CPU design Game programmer L4 microkernel family National Health Service Consciousness Physical therapy Organ transplant Sleep apnea Dentures Free trade Hypoglycemia Rational Unified Process Getting Things Done Benchmark (computing) Air traffic control Scrubs Palm OS Obstetrics UK telephone numbering plan Prolactinoma Public policy Milton H.
