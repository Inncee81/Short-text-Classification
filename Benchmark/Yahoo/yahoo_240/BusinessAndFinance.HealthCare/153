health care career after degree in agricultural business my entire life i grew up around animals on a farm joining the national ffa organization so when senior year of high school came it was no question what i would be going to college for agricultural business now don't get me wrong i love my major but i'm having some major problems with my future i'm worried that perhaps i chose the wrong major i'm thinking that i may have just chosen my major because it was in my comfort zone and because i know nothing else and i should just graduate with an associates instead of my planned bachelor's degree and then transfer to an unrelated major i would really love to graduate with my bachelor's degree in agricultural business and possibly an associates degree in something like horticulture or floral design for kicks and then go to graduate school for a career in health care the job security and pay scale is what is most enticing i'll have at least in student loans i'm interested in becoming an xray technician diagnostic medical sonographer or possibly even a therapist of some sort i love helping people and the feeling of giving so what is a career that i could get with a master's degree that has a good payscale and excellent job security and also doesn't mind that my undergrad is in agricultural business ultimately your job history is going to shape your career more so than the actual degrees you obtain if you are really interested in a health care career with a masters degree try getting a masters in health care management it will be the easiest to obtain with the least amount of doctor patient responsibility your primary function will be working with different health insurance agencies or government health care programs the salaries for someone with this degree type can start around per year and cap at around per year there are no long hours there are no on call statuses you work an average work week Nurse Education in the United States Publicly funded medicine Health insurance Physician Graduate school General practitioner Medicine Education in Portugal Chinese University of Hong Kong Economy of the United States Education in Australia National Health Service Chiropractic Juris Doctor Master's degree Medical school Physical therapy Medicare (Canada) Education in Germany Librarian Dentistry Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Oregon State University Medical University of South Carolina Education in the People's Republic of China Life insurance Professor Architect Anorexia nervosa University of Central Florida Education in Finland Division of labour Extreme Programming Far Eastern University Software engineering University of Connecticut Hillary Rodham Clinton Unemployment Psychiatry Columbia University Social Security (United States) Master of Business Administration Lawyer Church of Christ, Scientist Social work Psychotherapy Clinical depression Unemployment benefit Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Community college Cancer Health maintenance organization Scientology beliefs and practices Occupational Therapy Public bodies and task forces of the UK government University of Maryland Baltimore County University of Phoenix Androgen insensitivity syndrome College Academia Emergency Medical Services Social rule US health reform under Truman City and Guilds of London Institute Mapua Institute of Technology Reiki American Medical Association Hypoglycemia Traditional Chinese medicine Student loan University of North Carolina at Charlotte Medical prescription Education in the Republic of Ireland Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Cornell University Public policy Alternative medicine Bond National Football League Bachelor of Arts Freeters
