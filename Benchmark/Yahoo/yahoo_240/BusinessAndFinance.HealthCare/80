nurses i just graduated as an rn and start my first day on the unit tomorrow any words of advice by tomorrow i mean friday however i would still love for anyone to answer after tomorrow as well o i am starting on a med surg unit general surgery night shift i did a round of clinicals in school on the same unit where i will be working but i am still very nervous my clinicals were during the day so i won't recognize any of the nurses if you have any suggestions advice or words of encouragement i would love to hear it what can i expect i will have a preceptor at first but i am still feeling overwhelmed at the thought of so much responsibility talking to the doctors especially if i have to call them for something overnight eek and taking verbal orders i was the girl within my clinical group that wasn't afraid to admit that i felt unsure of myself and if possible always preferred to have a nurse with me when i was starting ivs doing procedures etc i know confidence is important so i guess i will have to fake it in the meantime it can be alittle daunting to be sure when you are new i myself am starting a new specialty and also am alittle unsure of waters most of my background is med surg ortho neuro oncology hospice now i am starting cardiac and plasty but with a strong med surg background i believe i may suggest that you ask plenty of questions no matter how stupid you might think that they are if there is one thing i remember from my early post grad years it's seasoned nurses complaining that the new grads try to come across as not appearing igorant so they don't say anything when they are genuinely finding their way they fear being labled so they stay quiet and nod their heads alot hopefully you will ask alot of questions check on your patients as often as you need to especially if they have questionable vitals pain issues confusion or post op parameters don't wait for your patients to ask for pain meds especially if they have just had surgery your preceptor will help you if you need to call a physician during the night have the following ready the m a r the chart most recent vitals and lung sounds urine output and what is running in the iv have the history page opened in case the doc doesn't know them if he starts to rattle off orders tell him to slow down if you need time to jot down what he says and read it back to him document that you read it back to him document document document if you make a mistake or if you make a med error bring it to your preceptors' attention immediately calmly and seek guidance if you aren't comfortable with the outcome speak with the lead or chg rn thank your preceptor for being willing to work with you it isn't easy to have a patient load and try to teach i love new nurses it means more help and less working extra god bless you hon Medicine Prostate cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Milton H.
