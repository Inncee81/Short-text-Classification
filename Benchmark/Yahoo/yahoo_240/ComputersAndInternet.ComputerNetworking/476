i just made a shared folder on my wireless ntwork but i cant see it on my old win se computer i see it on all my xp machines but not the please help thanks file and printer sharing on windows xp and windows systems can be a little difficult you should first insure that you are on the same network on all the computers you can do this by pressing the windows key and the pause break button on your keyboard this will pull up your system properties window you should then go to your computer name tab check the workgroup name on all the computers ideally you would want to keep these the same to reduce network problems next you will want to go to your control panel then to network connections right click on your local area connection or wireless connection depending on the system and then click on properties check to make sure you have the file and printer sharing for microsoft networks installed and checked if not then go to install and double click service and then find this service once you've verified that you have file sharing enabled and the computers are on the same network it is time to check the settings of your firewalls the windows firewall can be restored to default settings through the control panel if you restore to default settings i'd make sure you set an exception for file sharing under the exceptions tab all other firewalls should have documentation that walks you through enabling file sharing you may need to visit the website of your firewall provider if you ever have problems with file and print sharing you should always look for the following on the same network service installed and enabled firewall not blocking the service good luck Microsoft Windows Mouse (computing) Windows 2000 Control Panel (Windows) Windows Server 2003 Bluetooth Mac OS X System 7 (Macintosh) Firewall (networking) Opera (web browser) Common Unix Printing System Spyware Windows Vista MDAC Universal Serial Bus Embedded system Windows registry Xerox Star Novell NetWare Screenshot Mozilla Firefox PHP Skype Apple Macintosh Virtual memory Unicode Password Object Desktop Buffer overflow Proxy server Network address translation File Transfer Protocol E-mail Pretty Good Privacy Blue screen of death Computer security Computer insecurity Ethernet EMule USB flash drive NTFS Netfilter/iptables AmigaOS PlayStation Portable Apple typography Domain Name System Computer virus Computer Wi-Fi Windows Installer System/36 Hello world program Mandriva Linux Local area network Freenet Cascading Style Sheets Gmail Windows API Double-click (computing) Active Directory Mach kernel NX bit Peer-to-peer X Window System Internet Explorer Kazaa MSN Messenger Voice over IP Mozilla Application Suite IPod 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Python programming language Server Message Block Malware Windows Explorer Spring operating system Common criticisms of Microsoft Mac OS history Mac OS X v10.4 Device driver Stardock DragonFly BSD
