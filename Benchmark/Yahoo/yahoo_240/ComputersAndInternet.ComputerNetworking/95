internet question does cable internet access come through my phone line like dsl or does it have its own type of line and if so how do i have that line installed thanks cable internet comes in on your cable line assuming your area is cabled the same line that cable tv comes in on if you have cable tv already then it's just a matter of getting a modem and enabling the service with your cable provider if you don't already have cable tv but you know your area does have cable then you can get cable internet by contacting your cable provider if you don't already have cable tv and your area is not cabled then basically you cannot get cable internet Digital Subscriber Line Cable modem Broadband Internet access Modem Internet service provider Integrated Services Digital Network Cable television Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line Private branch exchange Ethernet Power line communication Broadband Rogers Communications Alcatel EarthLink Telstra DOCSIS IP Multimedia Subsystem WiMAX GSM services Internet ITU-T Telegraphy Video on demand Dialer Etisalat Password StarHub Router Universal Serial Bus Bluetooth Public Switched Telephone Network Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act HomePNA Eircom Voice over IP Telewest Broadband Telephone exchange Telephone Asynchronous Transfer Mode Public-access television Rogers Cable Inc.
