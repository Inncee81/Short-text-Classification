linking a wireless enabled computer to another with ethernet to share a connection is it possible to do so can i run the cable to a hub to use more links yes this is possible and yes you can connect it to a hub to share more connections that said let me tell you the down side to this configuration the main computer will need to stay on at all times you will also need to enable ics internet connection sharing on it you will manually need to setup all the ip addresses and subnets for each computer you want to connect to the hub your shared internet connection will be slower because the internet is fed through the wireless adapter and ics for multiple computers at the same time it would be alot better and less of a headache to you if you just went and bought a few cheap wireless adapters on ebay and installed them on the other computers Ethernet Wi-Fi Digital Subscriber Line Universal Serial Bus USB flash drive Computer bus Wireless LAN Telegraphy AirPort Bluetooth ALOHAnet Windows XP Internet Broadband Internet access Modem Floppy disk WiMAX Xbox Local area network Network address translation Cray-1 Hard disk IEEE 802.11 PlayStation Portable Transmission Control Protocol Asynchronous Transfer Mode Computer network Internet protocol suite Bus network FireWire IP address AppleTalk MAC address Secure Digital card Game Boy Advance TIA-568A/B IMac GSM services Wireless access point Central processing unit Computer and video games Server Message Block Apple Macintosh Serial communications PlayStation 2 Telephone Xbox 360 Nintendo Revolution Internet service provider Proxy server Computer Mozilla Firefox Wireless community network AT&T Cisco Systems Router Internet Group Management Protocol Wireless ITunes Private branch exchange Windows 2000 System/36 Cray-2 Btrieve Digital Equipment Corporation Personal computer PowerPC Category 5 cable FidoNet CDC 6600 IPod Windows Server 2003 Mouse (computing) Information Age Distributed computing PlayStation 3 Internet Explorer Federal Standard 1037C MDAC Computer surveillance Coaxial cable LAN party Network switch Wireless mesh network Laptop Copy protection Super Nintendo Entertainment System ARCNET Gmail Universal Plug and Play RS-232 OSI model LocalTalk Apple Newton SCSI Loudspeaker Skype Apollo Guidance Computer
