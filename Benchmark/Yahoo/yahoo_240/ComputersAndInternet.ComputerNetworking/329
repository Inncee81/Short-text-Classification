wifi for my desktop pc there is a library that is close to my apartment that provide free public wireless internet what do i need to connect my desktop pc to wifi and get a good signal also what is dhcp the library does mention that i need to have dhcp enabled what do i do if it is legal you can install a wireless network interface card wnic on the pc and configure it if the signal is too weak you can see if the wnic maker offers an external antenna for it so you can mount it outside and wire it inside you may look for a wnic that has this ability first as i suspect you may need it dhcp is dynamic host configuration protocol this is commonly used to automate lan ip address issuing the alternative is to use a static ip scheme and you need to keep a manual record of ip addresses which is a book keeping chore i suspect your library uses dhcp to assign lan ip addresses Wi-Fi Voice over IP Windows XP WiMAX Wireless LAN Telephone IEEE 802.11 IP Multimedia Subsystem AirPort Universal Serial Bus MAC address Pretty Good Privacy Preboot Execution Environment Federal Standard 1037C Universal Plug and Play Wardriving Internet Local area network PHP Router Apple Macintosh X Window System Secure Shell Java programming language Linux Wireless Hotspot (wifi) Windows Server 2003 MDAC Amateur radio Transmission Control Protocol USB flash drive Microsoft Musical Instrument Digital Interface Antenna (radio) Point-to-Point Protocol Cable television History of Microsoft Windows Hard disk Integrated Services Digital Network Broadband Internet access Power line communication Television Global Positioning System Internet protocol suite Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing BitTorrent Modem Extensible Authentication Protocol Computer Digital Subscriber Line C programming language Commodore 64 Wi-Fi Protected Access Wireless community network Wireless mesh network Mobile phone Global System for Mobile Communications Wireless access point Surveillance AppleTalk Wireless Application Protocol Radio Windows Vista Cheating in Counter-Strike Private branch exchange Mac OS X Computer bus Information Technology Infrastructure Library Microsoft Windows AmigaOS Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection Xbox Universal Mobile Telecommunications System RS-232 Advanced Technology Attachment Telephone exchange Mozilla Firefox IPv6 WebObjects Network address translation Web crawler Novell NetWare Common Unix Printing System PlayStation Portable Enterprise content management Xbox 360 Library (computer science) IMac IPod
