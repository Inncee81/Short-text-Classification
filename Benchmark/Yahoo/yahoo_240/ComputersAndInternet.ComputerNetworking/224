what is the maximum no of computer can i connect with my kpbs smartbro connection i want to know what is the maximum no of pc i can connect with my kbps smartbro currently i have pc's connected but this wonders me if is it limited regardless of the performance's speed i want to know if it is unlimited or limited as long as you have a router connected you can put as many as you like a standard class c subnet is machines with a router connected there is only public ip assigned then all your machines are connected to a lan connection in most routers you set the number using the proper subnet mask most routers default that mask to which is a class c network with that one set you can hook up machines and as far as the internet is concerned all of them appear as one connection if you change that setting the subnet mask you can change the number of machines that can connect using that one ip for instance if you set the routers subnet to you theoretically can hook up million machines however as a practical matter the bandwidth will keep you from using more than a few machines with kbs each one will use part of it Subnetwork IP address Routing Information Protocol AppleTalk Network address translation Internet Group Management Protocol Router Universal Serial Bus Wi-Fi Ethernet Classless Inter-Domain Routing General Packet Radio Service Wireless LAN IPv4 ITunes Digital Subscriber Line Differentiated services IEEE 802.11 Active Directory Web crawler MAC address Voice over IP Password Classful network Content-addressable memory Server Message Block Streaming media Virtual Network Computing Local area network Netfilter/iptables IS-IS Communications protocol Border Gateway Protocol Modem Quality of service PlayStation 3 Domain Name System Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol Telnet Internet protocol suite Telegraphy Open Shortest Path First Central processing unit Turing machine Request for Comments Lag Slot machine Bluetooth Serial communications Skype Cisco Systems Email authentication Cray-1 Antenna (radio) Redundant array of independent disks Laptop LAN party Operational amplifier PowerPC WiMAX Cheating in Counter-Strike Computer network Embedded system Supercomputer History of the Internet Transmission Control Protocol MIPS architecture Xbox 360 Musical Instrument Digital Interface Novell NetWare Digital circuit Octopus card Quake Tor (anonymity network) HyperTransport HomePNA Virtual LAN Infinity DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Distributed computing Bonjour (protocol) Onion Routing NSA encryption systems Windows Server 2003 EMule Silicon Graphics Net (mathematics) Visual Basic History of Microsoft Windows Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Linux kernel Fiber distributed data interface Banyan VINES
