networking between two buildings my business has acquired another building and naturally we need to incorporate the new building into our existing network the buildings are located down the street from one another and there are houses and trees inbetween we currently have a wireless antenna set up on each building but we have experienced limited connectivity during stormy weather there are trees that block the line of sight in the spring when the leaves come it there are a total of about seven houses in between our two buildings we are basically looking for a reliable alternative to the faulty wireless solution that we have in place now any suggestions now obviously you are looking for the cheapest solution being a business and must conform to all appropriate regulations you say you have a wireless antenna and have not specified what bandwidth this can carry i'll assume therefore you only require a standard speed link the fastest and most reliable method is obviosly using standard ethernet cables from router to router giving you a megbyte per second link between buildings easily enough for the e mails between workers the downside of this solution is that seven houses in between woulod mean a cable above or below the ground between buildings if permission wasn't required for this it would easily be the cheapest solution but any one of the seven householders could say no or the council which they will so virtual private networking if both offices have connections to the internet then you can host a link via your internet connections but i would assume as you are small businesses that your link would be slow and therefore this would not be suitable two servers at each end can be set up to route external traffic other the internet between each other this can also be encrypted and secured another method is requesting bt to establish you a conneciton however this method is likely to be expensive which as i mentioned earlier is probably out of your budget hope this helps Wi-Fi Ethernet Wireless LAN Transmission Control Protocol Telegraphy IEEE 802.11 Broadband Internet access Cable television Universal Serial Bus AppleTalk Asynchronous Transfer Mode Voice over IP Wireless access point Digital Subscriber Line Federal Standard 1037C Router USB flash drive WiMAX Network address translation Internet Denial-of-service attack Global Positioning System Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Password Quality of service Internet protocol suite Television TGV Amateur radio MAC address Cisco Systems Electric power transmission Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus IP Multimedia Subsystem Digital television Antenna (radio) Private branch exchange Routing Storage area network Skype Windows 2000 Internet Relay Chat AirPort Xbox IPv6 Personal rapid transit Wireless mesh network Proxy server PlayStation 3 Internet service provider Redundant array of independent disks Domain Name System Computer BitTorrent Local area network E-mail Peer-to-peer Frame relay NSA encryption systems Differentiated services Communications satellite Novell NetWare Nintendo Revolution Hard disk PlayStation 2 Lag Radio Electrical wiring Pretty Good Privacy Satellite internet Streaming media Wardriving IPv4 PowerPC Enterprise content management Oscilloscope GSM services Server Message Block Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol Serial communications Surveillance LAN party Computer virus Wind turbine Teletext Xbox 360 Digital circuit Communications protocol Stopping e-mail abuse X Window System PHP CPU cache HTTP cookie PlayStation Portable
