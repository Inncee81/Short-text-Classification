wireless router how do i secure my router i have two laptops that log on to my unsecure network use either wep or wpa encryption you should be able to set this up using the manual if you do not have the manual just go to the manufactures website and download it wpa is more secure than wep i recommend also turning on mac address filtering and allow only the mac addresses listed to access the router to see what your mac address is on your wifi card click start then run they type cmd once there type ipconfig all the mac address is the physical address which looks somthing like this ab b enter that into the routers authorized mac address list this will give you much more security and make it pretty much impossible to get in Wi-Fi Wardriving IEEE 802.11 Wireless LAN Wired Equivalent Privacy IEEE 802.11i Wi-Fi Protected Access Wireless access point Windows XP Related-key attack Router AirPort Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Mac OS X Bluetooth Internet Group Management Protocol RC4 Ethernet MAC address Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection Password Apple Macintosh PowerPC Hard disk Gmail Hotspot (wifi) Apple Open Collaboration Environment Extensible Authentication Protocol Cisco Systems Denial-of-service attack Copy protection Windows 2000 FreeBSD Linux Data retention Skype Common Unix Printing System Internet Internet Relay Chat Computer virus Commodore 64 Netfilter/iptables PlayStation Portable Mozilla Firefox Wget OSI model Mac OS 9 Federal Standard 1037C USB flash drive Local area network Mac OS X v10.4 AppleTalk Network address translation Pretty Good Privacy 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines System 7 (Macintosh) E-mail Embedded system Apple Computer Microprocessor Laptop Cryptography Public-key cryptography PHP Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol Cryptographic hash function Java programming language Peer-to-peer Malware PlayStation 3 Mouse (computing) E-mail spam Telegraphy ZigBee Differentiated services Secure Digital card Knoppix Onion Routing Mach kernel MDAC NSA encryption systems Perl History of Microsoft Windows Stopping e-mail abuse Proxy server Screenshot File system IPod Windows Vista Surveillance Network switch X Window System ITunes Cisco IOS Comparison of web browsers Xbox IPv4
