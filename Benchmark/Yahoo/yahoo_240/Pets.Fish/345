do petsmart employees know what theyre talking about fish question i am planning on going to petsmart and asking some questions about my ruykin i wouldnt ask walmart but is petsmart any better in everyones experience are they generally well educated in their department we have no small pet stores nearby and i have been asking on answers but on questions such as age of a certain size ruykin nobody seems to know i could easily ask them what the age of the fish they purchase is tho it really depends some employee really know their stuff some know nothing helpful at all the worst part is you will find many that know nothing but will pretend to know and tell you incorrect information in my experiences with petsmart i have found that most are very poorly educated concerning fish and that you would do far far better at a locally owned pet shop just go in and ask for the owner mm Wal-Mart Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stomach cancer Pet store Password Internet troll Neopets RuneScape locations Richmond, California Animal Crossing Plame affair Best Buy Little Britain Neighbours Pet skunk Domestic rabbit GED RuneScape Random Events God Emperor of Dune Friends The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Commodore International The Nameless Novel Hamster Economics Expert system Target Corporation Test (student assessment) The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Signal Hill, California Pet SmartAsk Pet Shop Boys Gaia Online Henry Kissinger Breastfeeding Political correctness The Princeton Review Prostate cancer Graduate school Pets.com Bulk vending Aphasia Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Standardized testing Palmdale, California SAT Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Electronic commerce Academia Quizbowl Fancy Crane Molecular structure of Nucleic Acids Whitton, London Big-box store Department store Ouija Vehicle registration plate Shopping Donald Rumsfeld Microchip implant (animal) Sears Holdings Corporation Grand Forks, North Dakota National Health Service Wall Street Illegal drug trade Portsmouth ASDA Psychology SCO-Linux controversies Virginian Railway $ale of the Century Le Duc Tho United States Postal Service Many-worlds interpretation Bat Cognitive science Wheel of Fortune Thousand Oaks, California Milgram experiment American Broadcasting Company Shau Kei Wan English grammar Coercion CPU cache Linguistics Cranford, New Jersey Management information system Remediation Hybrid vehicle Jade Empire Fish and chips The Joker's Wild Hwi Noree MapleStory Fancy rat Lie Compact audio cassette Complexity classes P and NP
