what would happen if i put a goldfish in a man made lake meant for swimming in a county park it wouldn't have any filter or anything like that i think and it is very large it does have bass and other fish mostly small living in it and people go fishing there sometimes there is seaweed and other water plants there so would the fish survive even with nobody feeding it i don't actually plan on doing it this question is hypothetical hi emily i'm relieved to hear it's merely hypothetical it's strange that some people who would not even consider tipping crude oil into a local lake or river would think nothing of releasing their unwanted pet fish in there yet the damage to the eco system is potentially comparable captain obvious put it perfectly a non fancy carp type fish will theoretically survive plenty of things for it to eat but it has to contend with a large handicap it's bright orange colour which will undoubtedly attract the unwarranted attention of every predator in the book four legged two legged birds fish so i doubt it would last long if by chance it did survive breed with the carp population a large potentially damaging carp hybrid strain would ensue which could have far reaching consequences for all the wildlife in the area not just fish i believe this has happened in several places with devastating results this is why it's illegal in many areas Goldfish Carp Murray Cod Fish farming Seabird Fishing Antarctic krill Pikmin Sewage treatment Aquarium Light pollution Dog Bird migration Animal communication Fauna of Australia God Emperor of Dune Falconry DDT Great Lakes Discus (fish) Salmon Shark Theory of conduct Aquaculture Kakapo Mojave people Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) American Alligator Goodness and value theory Hamster Philosophy of language Muskellunge Gray Wolf Striped bass Feral cat Australian bass D'ni wildlife Sexual selection Spider Grammatical mood Great White Shark Species Albatross Hemp Angling Chinook salmon Plame affair Philosophical skepticism Bird Dam Roswell UFO incident Invasive species in Australia Carnivorous plant Pok__mon Abilities Common carp House Mouse Fly fishing The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Garfield Shaggy dog story Livestock Lake Erie Creatures in Bionicle Hurricane preparedness for New Orleans Nile crocodile Clownfish Internet troll Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Liger Auk Color Hunting Giraffe Introduced species Environmental concerns with electricity generation Person Elis Prefecture Myxobolus cerebralis Gal__pagos Islands Samuel Goldwyn Fancy Crane Dolphin Agusan del Sur Water purification Zoo Orlando, Florida Bat Chew Valley Lake Brown Bear Murray River Nuclear power Tilapia Social rule Double-crested Cormorant Lake Friends Time Out of Mind
