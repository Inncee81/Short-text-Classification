i've heard of giving a pea to your fish to heal him well what does it cure i think i've heard of it curing gull bladder issues but i have no clue also how does it work do you have to break it up into smaller peices so that the fish can eat it easier my fish don't have any health issues but i was wondering peas act as roughage and cleanse out your fish's digestive system they take care of most digestive problems like constipation or swim bladder disease preparing a pea for your fish is simple you must use frozen peas as canned and fresh ones have preservatives and pesticides respectively place the pea in a dish of tank water or dechlorinated water and microwave for seconds leave to cool and then remove the shell of the pea cutting its insides up into tiny pieces that your fish can eat you should only feed your fish about a third to half of the pea depending on how large your fish is it's also recommended to fast your fish for a couple of days before feeding the pea since it is not part of many fishes' natural diet and they might need to be fasted a little before they are hungry enough to eat it Hamster Food Pea Fishing Dietary fiber Fecal incontinence Domestic rabbit Salmon Cuisine of Denmark Carnivorous plant Stomach cancer Nutrition Cuisine of the Philippines Kosher foods Tofu Foodborne illness Seabird Fugu Egg (food) Dairy Sewage treatment Urinary incontinence Prostate cancer Soul food Natural Hygiene Pea soup Food preservation Organic food Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Bong Raw food diet Brewery Vitamin C Fancy rat Peanut Cantonese cuisine Chicken Tomato Coffee Adjustable gastric band Sauerkraut Hypoglycemia Myxobolus cerebralis Polychlorinated biphenyl Shrimp farm Foie gras Menstrual cup Vegetarianism Fish farming Tlingit Mosquito Coeliac disease Milk Veganism Pok__mon Abilities Jewish cuisine Folic acid Schistosomiasis Shark Casting French fries Sea-Monkey Ham Breakfast Cancer Cuisine of the Southern United States Soup Vegetarian nutrition Roman eating and drinking Bird Obesity Agriculture Fish and chips Krill Bladderwort Marine aquarium Cuisine of Malaysia Food storage Diabetes mellitus Pig (zodiac) Axolotl Water Goldfish Passover Fasting Thermal power station Tilapia Bacon Battle of Pea Ridge Bengali cuisine Dieting Animal French cuisine Coconut crab Gelatin
