aerator needed for litre tank hi there i have had my litre tank for a month and a half now i currently have shubunkins colourful goldfish i do a partial water change every week and siphon out thir gravel from gunk every month they have a filter in their tank elite stingray one but the question is do they need an areator because i was thinking i could get one and hook it up to a special typr of toy you get in pet shops that let out the oxygen so do i need one also how far down the tank wall do i place the filter i have it about one inch below the surface right now oh and btw i use the nessacery water conditioners and suppliments oh sometimes i see them at the surface but for only like twice a day for a few seconds thanks for looking yeah i think i will also bubbles look nice well ive only recenly bought this tank and well the fish expert at the aquarium store did say maximum goldfish but maybe in the future when the fish do eventually die like all fish i wont replace them their more work then my shih tzu you don't need an aerator unless you want one your fish aren't gasping for breath most filters provide adequate aeration if you are really worried about the oxygen i recommend moving the filter so that the out end is close enough to the water line to agitate the surface this adds more than enough oxygen also i recommend that every few weeks you take the filter apart to clean the mechanical parts many sources have told me that the stingray kind clogs easily if your filter is clogged it will not be able to process as much water as it should and your fish could get very sick Goldfish Aquarium Sewage treatment Diving cylinder Brewery Marine aquarium Fish farming Dry cleaning Water Motor oil Scuba set Solar power Dairy Decompression sickness Glossary of firefighting equipment Sea-Monkey Siphon Houseplant Coffee Hydroponics E85 Gar Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Hamster Acute respiratory distress syndrome Discus (fish) Thermal power station Biodiesel Water purification Clownfish The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Tilapia Bong Wine making Sylvia and Gerry Anderson Axolotl Carburetor Flush toilet Color Autonomous building Carbon dioxide Hard disk Eutrophication Earthworm Fire fighting Lionel Corporation Corrosion Fishing Textile manufacturing Neighbours Hydrogen vehicle Sun Space shuttle main engine Wine Torpedo Apollo 8 Breathing gas Octopus Atlantic herring Hydrogen economy Oxyacetylene PID controller Antarctic krill Stingray Mattress Syphon Filter Water (molecule) Renewable energy Drowning Glossary of wildland fire terms Cell (biology) Tooth enamel Energy development Dive computer Whitewater Drainage Home repair Cyanide Floppy disk Blood (computer game) Explosive material Water pollution Chinook salmon Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster XML GunBound Irrigation Digital photography Lake Casting Brewing Marathon (sport) Stock car (rail) Stingray (TV show) Space Shuttle external tank Gaia Online
