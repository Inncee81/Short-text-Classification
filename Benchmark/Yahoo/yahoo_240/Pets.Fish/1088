why did my large two year old angelfish die i just started a new gallon tank a week and a half ago and i initially put tetras to cycle it and then added four large angelfish from a different tank yesterday i added a red parrot and a gold severum and when i got home today i saw one of my angels which is about two years old dead i was wondering whether it could have been a disease or the addition of new fish or perhaps my tank is too crowded or maybe the fact that its a new tank i check all the water parameters and everything looks good any ideas also ive noticed that some of my fish have what seems to be bloodshot eyes usually one of the two eyes is redish is this normal or is it a sign of sickness thank you so much are your ammonia and nitrite levels at because if they aren't your tank isn't cycled and it sounds like ammonia poisening as for the angels they are extremly sensitive and you can't put them in an not established tank hope that helps good luck eb Marine aquarium Ammonia Discus (fish) Sewage treatment Hydrogen economy Paul Is Dead Freshwater angelfish E85 Eutrophication Thermal power station Aquarium Fish farming Sea-Monkey Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Chinese New Year Too Short a Season (TNG episode) StarCraft: Uprising Goldfish Wine making Biogeochemical cycle STS-59 Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder YuYu Hakusho Biochemistry H5N1 Poker jargon Piccolo Junior Saga Nitrogen Social rule Singlish Maser Nitric acid Brewery Refrigerator Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Hamster Life expectancy Carbon dioxide Betting (poker) Dyslexia Ja Rule Toyota Prius Kender Donald Rumsfeld Ron Weasley Loudspeaker Rum Tank Tidal power Paintball Microeconomics Sun Hall & Oates Mark I (tank) Pasadena, California Second Battle of El Alamein Myslovitz Equine conformation 2000 Australian Grand Prix Norway national football team Cirrhosis Timeline of alternative rock Rei Ayanami New York Giants Polycystic ovary syndrome Duesberg hypothesis Characters of Naruto Messerschmitt Bf 109 Speech synthesis GunBound Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 Sharon Tate Haven (TNG episode) The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) The Strangerhood Natural gas Dialysis Myxobolus cerebralis Color Naruto jutsu Kelly Clarkson USS Tunny (SS-282) Copper National Football League The Death Gate Cycle Origin of life Cyanide Tank classification Yellowstone National Park Red Hot Chili Peppers World Championship Wrestling Sodium nitrite Diseases of the honeybee Normal distribution The Shining (film) Battle of Kursk Autonomous building PID controller
