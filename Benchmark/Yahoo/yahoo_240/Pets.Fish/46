my beta fish aren't eating i think they are two males and i only just got them i noticed that everytime they reach for their food round and red ones bloodworm maybe they either miss it or it either floats back out their mouth and they can't be bothered going for it again it's common for newly bought bettas to refuse to eat for a few days they are getting used to their bigger tank new decorations new water chemistry and so on everything has been completely hauled over for them so they need awhile to adjust their systems to the new environment before they will eat another reason is that bettas are picky eaters and usually don't like changes in food that they've been fed for a long time the pet store has probably been feeding them the same stuff for ages and now they don't want to switch this is easily cured however just give them a couple of days and they will start eating the new food don't worry about your bettas starving they can go up to a week without food completely unharmed Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Discus (fish) Sea-Monkey Shaggy dog story Insulin Hamster Dwarf gourami One Piece minor characters RuneScape quests Minor Harry Potter Beasts Gar Halfbeak American lobster Taboo food and drink Food preservation Fugu Cannabis cultivation Goldfish Breastfeeding Shark The Amazing Race Elephant Chicken Sewage treatment Environmental vegetarianism Axolotl Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Cat Dairy Binge eating disorder The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Tlingit Guinea pig RuneScape skills Garfield Aquarium Anorexia nervosa Vitamin Fecal incontinence Carburetor Sin City Chinese New Year Livestock Koi Bird MapleStory Bread The Pet Sounds Sessions Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma RuneScape locations Fancy rat RuneScape economy House Mouse Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Comanche Gray Wolf Raw food diet Domestic rabbit Clownfish Tomato Bird migration Ecology Salmon Nile crocodile Dieting Eastern Front (World War II) Russian joke Carnivore Gold standard Stomach cancer Chocolate Neopets Locomotive RuneScape Mini-Games Thermal power station Wheel of Fortune Equine conformation Chopsticks Fire-control system Lutefisk Red Squirrel Frog Acorn Lisa the Vegetarian Sea Otter Wall Street Fish farming The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Cheese Kyoryuu Sentai ZyuRanger Ron and Fez Mountain Gorilla Fire fighting Kelly Clarkson Drawn Together Brown Bear Pork Textile manufacturing Electrophysiology
