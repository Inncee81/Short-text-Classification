bio wheel filter questions hi there i was just wanting to know what would be a good bio wheel filter for a gallon aquarium i am planning on having a moderatly planted aquarium with in of substrate rocks and d wood and small community fish tropical would it be okay to put smaller bio wheels on each end of the aquarium or will that cause to much turbulence thus releasing all of my co also has anyone ever tried putting some of those bio balls in the back of a bio wheel filter just wondering if it would even work giving me name brands would be appreciated i know i've been asking alot of questions lately but no i am not a novice that will be spending on something i'll stick with for a year lol i have always had aquariums right now i have three g two g and a g i just wanna make sure i do my right the others were all trial and error hi yes that will work fine i did the same thing in a gal and plants grew fish multiplied and had cover for hatches as for bio balls i never used them i use marineland brands completely best choice you can make also use underwater heater as the turbulence is faster a good thing to remember when starting any tank is to let it run completely set up excluding fishes for hrs check the ph and temp and make adjustments add chems and then add each species of fish separately and over time use the bacterial vac it is a tube that you use without any motor i can explain this more if you need i use the vac weekly but only on the settings ie plants rocks shells etc best wishes on your fishes and i think you will enjoy it more if you will use your gal and hatchery tanks to proliferate your new tank and always ask your pet store about the community acceptance of different species go wild have fun fish are cool Marine aquarium Aquarium Brewery Autonomous building Motorcycle Thermal power station Hamster Reef tank Sea-Monkey Textile manufacturing Shrimp farm Fish farming Poker jargon Tank Sewage treatment Fishing E85 Discus (fish) Shedd Aquarium Biology PID controller 1957 World Series Goldfish Floppy disk Mouse (computing) Krill Coffee Extreme Programming Carburetor Octopus Cannabis cultivation Fossil fuel power plant Dog agility IBM PC compatible Amateur telescope making Fancy rat Great Lakes Recumbent bicycle Biodiesel Galileo spacecraft Mars Exploration Rover Filling station Coral reef Goby Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) T-72 Hard disk Three-phase electric power Clownfish Diesel engine Mantis shrimp New England Aquarium Axolotl MAME Beer Ecco the Dolphin Nuclear power Drag racing Robert Ballard Irrigation Hot Wheels Redundant array of independent disks BMW Novelty (locomotive) Wheel of Fortune Biodiversity Spirit rover timeline for 2004 April Dairy Georgia Aquarium Danio Tesla coil Swimming pool RuneScape skills Finding Nemo Mark I (tank) Pachypodium habitats Killifish Solar power Switched-mode power supply Halfbeak Futurama (TV series - season 5) Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Rail terminology Alcohol fuel Cigarette Stock car (rail) Insect Radio controlled airplane Chevrolet Corvair Hydrogen economy RISC Crayfish Zerg CDC 6600
