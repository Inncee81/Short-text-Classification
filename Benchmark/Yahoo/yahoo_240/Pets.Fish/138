help my corydoras are trying to breed okay so today i bought and added an albino corydoras and a peppered corydoaras to my already peppered corydoras when i got home and put them in my original two jumped right to my other peppered corydoras and starting dancing and shaking around it i then realized i had a female and males they are in a tank with an otocinclus and australian rainbows if they do breed which i am going to go buy a small tank for the fry will my rainbow fish eat the eggs and fry a lot of times they attempt to mate or do something that looks like mating but it may not be you will have a heck of a time trying to remove cory fry and getting them into another tank keep lots of cover like plants plastic or real and the fry will have a higher survival rate and the adults will be happier too corys hide if the tank is too sparse Kakapo Hamburger Clownfish Fish farming Goldfish Sea-Monkey Leatherback Sea Turtle Discus (fish) Pizza Spider Ramen Chicken Rocko's Modern Life Tofu In-N-Out Burger Cantonese cuisine Philip J.
