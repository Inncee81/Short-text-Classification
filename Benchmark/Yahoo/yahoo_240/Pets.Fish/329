how long does it take for bettas to mate i have two males and one female betta the two males seperate of course there is one male who puffs up a little and chases her and does a dnace in front of her but she always swims away is that normal this is the first time together too the other male will do nothing sometimes she'll chase him and he'll run off or swim off is this normal in the start it sounds like your fish are not in breeding condition i would suggest you keep all of them in separate containers and condition them well for a few weeks you will know they are ready to breed when the male makes a bubble nest and the female is pump with eggs and her egg spot is showing that's when you put them together once they are in proper condition they will breed in a few hours here's how i breed my bettas i have been breeding bettas for show and for sale for over years and this system works well for me breeding tank a gallon makes a good breeding tank for bettas place in on a dark surface and set it up with no gravel or decorations use a small sponge filter and a heater maintain the heat at the temperature is not really that critical using a hood is a good idea to hold in heat and moisture conditioning condition the male in the breeding tank condition the female in a separate tank and be sure they cannot see each other feed well on frozen or live foods alternating with flakes or pellets for at least a week the female should be plump with eggs and the male should be flaring and showing his best color maybe even building a bubble nest spawning drop the water level in the breeding tank to about deep place the female in a bowl or other container next to the breeding tank so that the male can see her as soon as there is a good bubble nest in the breeding tank add the female check for eggs in the bubble nest every few hours you know they are finished when the female is hiding from the male and he no longer leaves the nest to chase her down he will also not be trying to attract her to the nest at this time remove the female from the breeding tank if they fail to breed within a few hours go back and repeat the conditioning steps for a week eggs and fry the eggs will hatch in days at first the male will collect the babies and return them to the bubble nest this is normal once you see that the babes are able to swim in a normal fashion remove the male now is the time to start feeding the babies feed them newly hatched brine shrimp micro worms or vinegar eels feed several times a day for the first week to days at that time you can start adding some powdered flake food to their diet and begin increasing the water level in the tank care the babies need very clean water do a or more water change every day and be sure to remove any uneaten food or dead babies that you see keeping the water clean and changed very often is one of the major keys to success be sure you cull the brood culling is to remove unwanted fish remove any deformed fish right away and destroy them rearing and selection eventually you will need to split the batch as they will over crowd the gallon removing the females to another tank is the best way the males can stay together without a problem continue to feed quality foods of increasing size working your way up to frozen or adult brine shrimp and continue to do large daily water changes once they begin to develop color you should cull based on color keep the color you like and remove the rest even if you started with two reds you will get a few that are not red or are not evenly colored if they are near adult size a shop should buy them from you or at least give you some store credit be ruthless keep only the very best to breed with next time around the males can stay together basically for their entire lives as long as you never separate them once separated even for a day they will begin to fight so keep that in mind best of luck and stick with it you'll have baby betta before you know it mm Dairy
