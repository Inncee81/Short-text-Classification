have a new somewhat imcomplete aquarium enough money for one thing which is the most vital fish in tank i have a ten gallon for my ruykin we have the aquarium filter water conditioner plants gravel food and a net the question is this i can afford either an aerator which the filter seems to do an ammonia test kit a nitrite test kit or bacteria to jumpstart the cycle of the tank bear in mind the fish has been in the tank for two days now he is doing great by the way i think an ammonia test kit would be the most beneficial but what are your opinions five or so dollar budget feel free to suggest a different product oh and a thermometer is on the tank as well ok i am sorry but i am not sure how to elaborate on this point this is the problem with yahoo answers enough money for one thing maybe not he is a rescue fish and is was all we could do to get what we have sorry but a baby ruykin can live in a gallon easily for a few months regardless of what anyone says and really given a choice between the poor fish dying in walmarts tanks living in a toxic gallon bowl while i save for a gallon or getting a clean gallon immediately i think its rather obvious what the fish would go for and considering he is doing wonderfully and would be able to live in a bowl for years i really doubt a few months in a filtered gallon will kill him so i would really appreciate some serious answers i dont want the dramatic you put him in a tank oh hes definately gonna die because thats stupid and we all know it i do intend to upgrade him and please give me help within my budget thank you thank you magicman and ninjaaa its refreshing to get a well edjucated answer from someone who has actually paid attention to the question the ammonia test kit is right by a long shot nitrite test kit can be a good idea but it's not as important as the ammonia test kit and often the bacteria you buy in stores is totally worthless since it is often handled improperly and is actually dead when you buy it carbon or charcoal will not handle the amount of ammonia your fish will produce so you need to monitor it and do water changes until the tank cycles in a few weeks obviously adding another fish tot he tank would be a horrible idea since it would only make more ammonia i'm sure you know that over time your fish will outgrow your gallon and you will either need to find him a new home or get a larger tank but if its a small ryukin you have a year or so before that's a problem sounds like you have done your research well you are right on target mm Sewage treatment Aquarium Hydrogen economy Eutrophication Biodiesel Microeconomics Autonomous building Cyanide Ammonia Carbon dioxide Fish farming Biogeochemical cycle Brewery Dairy Sea-Monkey Dry cleaning Water purification Hydroponics Biochemistry Toyota Prius Hydrogen vehicle Cannabis cultivation Hyperinflation Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Bacteria Poker jargon Illegal drug trade Omega-3 fatty acid Refrigerator Goldfish Consciousness Jumpstart 3rd Grade Tilapia E85 Fugu Hydrogen sulfide Thermal power station Hypoglycemia P-47 Thunderbolt Gross domestic product God Emperor of Dune Energy development Ocean thermal energy conversion M16 (rifle) Nuclear power Keynesian economics Milk Ecology Menstrual cycle Autism Halitosis Town gas Sun Nitrogen Beer Houseplant Fossil fuel power plant Hubble Space Telescope Homebrewing Discus (fish) Fire extinguisher Alcohol fuel Photosynthesis Water (molecule) Tank CPU cache Tax Space Shuttle program Oplan Bojinka Soil life Apollo 13 Urea Origin of life Explosive material Hydrogen Cellular respiration Depleted uranium B-47 Stratojet Coffee Artificial consciousness Expert system Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Chopsticks Cessna T-37 Economics Wal-Mart The Apprentice 2 Ashton-Tate Bipolar disorder Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina
