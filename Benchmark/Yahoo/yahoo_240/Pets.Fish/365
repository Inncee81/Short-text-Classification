what water treatments do i need for aquarium fish hi i've bought a foot fish tank with large goldfish in it off ebay about weeks ive only ever had one tiny goldfish before who ive successfully put into the tank but with him ive never treated the water he was just in an old fashioned bowl which im told now is a big fishkeeping faux pas obviously as its been two weeks its time for a partial water exchange but ive been told to treat my tap water and test it im pretty dumb and have no idea what to use or what im testing for can anyone tell me more and where i can buy some treatments preferably lower end of the budget though i have a teensy budget wow there are some pretty windy opinions here this is what i think you need to purchase a siphon have the store manager give you a lesson on how to use it or im email me and i'll walk you through it use the siphon to vacuum out all the crap out of the gravel it sounds like your tank is already established were the goldfish living in this same tank when you purchased the tank or are the fish new if the tank has only been running since you purchased it then your tank is still cycling you might want to purchase a master test kit this will allow you to monitor ammonia nitrite and nitrate keeping yourself informed of your tank's water qualtiy will help prevent any major problems down the road when it comes time to fill your tank back up use a dechlorinator most are in liquid form follow the instructions on the bottle you can also leave the water sitting out for the chlorine to evaporate but if your local water treatment plant uses chloramine you will have to wait much longer magicman taught me that chloramines have a half life of about hrs at ph and degrees this means that if you set your water out to age for hrs and the city puts chloramines in your water it will not be safe to add to the tank without water conditioner the cheapest way to dechlorinate your tank is to purchase sodium thiosulfate crystals this is the main ingredient of dechlorinator and for a few dollars you can dechlorinate thousands of gallons it is pretty hard to find but you could probably order some off the internet email me if you have any questions Sewage treatment Marine aquarium Ammonia Water purification Sea-Monkey Aquarium Siphon Hydrogen economy Polychlorinated biphenyl Autonomous building Brewery Chlorine Cyanide Flush toilet Hydrogen peroxide Solar power Rebreather Dairy Axolotl Water (molecule) Thermal power station Prostate cancer Ocean thermal energy conversion Illegal drug trade Water Cannabis cultivation Fish farming Microeconomics Nitrogen Japanese tea ceremony Chlorination Computer Carburetor Mattress Decompression sickness Charles Ives Sulfur Nuclear power Dishwasher Battle of the Bulge Desert Discus (fish) Wine making E85 Bottled water Cruising (maritime) CPU cache Diabetes mellitus Renewable energy Internet fraud Fire fighting Food preservation Sewer Hydrochloric acid Alum Reef tank Asthma Coffee Titanium Rocket fuel Mercury (element) Cocaine Surveillance Sugar beet CPU design Biogeochemical cycle Hyperthermia Pretty Good Privacy Hydropower Japanese toilet Rail terminology Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Salt Fossil fuel power plant Opportunity rover Urinary incontinence Aluminium Single-stage to orbit Electrophysiology Textile manufacturing Pebble bed reactor Acetic acid Nuclear reactor Fugu Extreme Programming Toyota Prius Gasoline Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Motorcycle Tag
