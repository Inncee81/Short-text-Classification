goldfish black areas torn tail i have a young goldfish who has always been very healthy but the past days i have noticed blackish areas on the edges of his fins and a couple of tiny spots on his side also his tail seems to be torn at the ends his fins etc are all ok and he appears very active and eating ok i did add a new fish who didnt get on with him and they fought a bit i didnt see him do the damage but i'm not sure of he did or not could he be sick ammonia and nitrate nitrites are fine i would add a small amount of non iodized plain or kosher salt just to help with the healing and to kill any disease or fungus waiting to infect the wounds the general rule is one tablespoon of salt per every five gallons of water but if you want to be slightly more conservative that would probably be fine too salt is great for helping fish heal and it generally just helps them function better when used as a treatment in situations like these Sewage treatment Shark Marine aquarium Goldfish Kashrut Kosher foods Eutrophication Aquarium Food preservation Ammonia Diarrhea Spider Psoriasis Hamster Bread Stomach cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pneumonia Salt Cirrhosis Sea-Monkey Curing Prostate cancer Myxobolus cerebralis Tocopherol Diseases of the honeybee Shrimp farm Sodium chloride Nutrient Iodine Cyanide Chronic fatigue syndrome Nitric acid Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Edible salt Vegetarian nutrition Drill bit Rabies Unclean animals Foodborne illness Sexually-transmitted infection Duesberg hypothesis Potassium nitrate E number Diabetes mellitus Pansy Tofu Paget's disease of bone Dutch elm disease Idli Equine conformation First aid Elis Prefecture Koi Cantonese cuisine Hypoglycemia 613 mitzvot Tuberculosis Nutrition Internal ballistics Fancy rat Fish anatomy Mouth ulcer Biogeochemical cycle Wetland Vitamin C Natural health Urinary incontinence Insulin AIDS Silver Fugu Nitrogen Oarfish Australian salmon Space habitat Potassium Goldeen Omega-3 fatty acid Ham Ammonium nitrate Great Salt Lake YuYu Hakusho Vegetarianism Gray Wolf Danio Eldfell Eczema Vegeta Rehydration Jewish cuisine Veganism Sodium nitrite Coeliac disease Dog Traditional Chinese medicine Dead Sea American Alligator
