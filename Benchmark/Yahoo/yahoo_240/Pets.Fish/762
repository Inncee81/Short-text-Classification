any advice for changing filter types in an aquarium i have a gallon acrylic hex tank with a male betta and a mystery snail the tank has been completely cycled for quite some time now the tank came as a package topfin aquascene with an undergravel filter the filter seems to be working ok but i keep hearing so many negative things about ugf filters plus there seems to be a lot of surfarce agitation from the air pump bubbles and my betta can't create bubble nests i would like to replace the ugf with a small gallon in tank filter that i have in a different gallon tank is it ok to change fitler types in a cycled tank if i do do i have to re cycle the tank do i need to completely clean out the bottom of the tank below the ugf plate or just remove the plate ugf do suck in my opinion lol i'm not real familiar with their set up it's been over years since i had one but is there any kind of filter pad in them if so add that to the new filter beneficial bacteria grows all over the tank in the gravel so be sure you only rinse that in a bucket of used tank water not tap water any decorations in the tank and the filter media so if there is no filter pad in the ugf to move to the new filter there will still be some beneficial bacteria in the tank it may go through a mini cycle just monitor the levels and increase the water changes if you need to i would completely clean the bottom of the tank because those ugf have a tendency to trap uneaten food and waste under there which can cause an ammonia spike i'd do a good gravel vac remove the fish and about the water and put the gravel in the bucket with the used tank water then remove the ugf also is that new filter on an established tank that's been running if so then don't change the filter pad in that one keep it on and it should be ok no cycle good luck Marine aquarium Brewery Aquarium Dry cleaning Sewage treatment Autonomous building Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Bong Dairy Sea-Monkey Reef tank Water purification Fossil fuel power plant E85 Thermal power station Vacuum cleaner Dishwasher Tank Biodiesel Refrigerator Carburetor Shrimp farm Agar plate Carbon dioxide Energy development GunBound Water Dredge Hydrogen economy Goldfish Dialysis Toyota Prius Microeconomics Wine making Eutrophication Tlingit Flush toilet Irrigation Dwarf gourami Water supply Sake Tilapia Coffee Ultraviolet Cannabis cultivation Rail terminology Photosynthesis Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Sterilization (microbiology) Cruising (maritime) Ocean thermal energy conversion RuneScape quests Ecology Vinegar Siphon Inkjet printer Bubble Bobble Glacier Motorcycle Halitosis Gasoline Axolotl Depleted uranium Hash table Bloom filter Transformer Fountain Glossary of climbing terms Sugar beet Intravenous therapy Bacteria Circuit design Swimming pool Honey Capacitor Phase-locked loop The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Glossary of wildland fire terms Fugu Dead Sea Cheating in Counter-Strike Pump Fume hood Two-stroke cycle Air conditioning Japanese tea ceremony Water (molecule) Diseases of the honeybee Low-pass filter Kosher foods Loudspeaker Plastic Digital photography Ice core
