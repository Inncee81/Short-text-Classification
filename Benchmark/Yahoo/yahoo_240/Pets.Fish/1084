i brought a beta fish home days ago and it has stopped eating and hides all the time the first day we brought our beta home he ate pellets we're feeding him hikari betta pellets the next day he ate but today he wouldn't even look at them this isn't the first beta i've owned but it's the first one i've had trouble feeding i know they like blood worms but i thought those were only supposed to be used as a supplement so i wanted to get him used to beta pellets first could the water be the problem i had dechlorinated the water in the tank and followed all the steps you're supposed to follow to acclimate a new fish to a new tank we had also bought the fish a live plant and he spends a lot of time either hiding behind it or resting in the leaves of the plant the other thing he does is rest close to the gravel in the tank he will swim fairly actively around the tank but always heads towards a wall and swims up and down the wall of the tank with his head against the glass any suggestions ideas or is it too soon to worry i changed the water tested ammonia ph and water hardness and temperature after the water change he is much more lively but still refuses to eat the store said they only feed their fish the hikari pellets so i'm still not entirely sure why he's not eating if he's flaring the gills towards the glass it's possible he might be seeing his reflection and is stressed over the other male betta that won't go away try covering the sides of the tank even taping up paper on a temporary basis and see if this helps also do you have a heater for him their water should be between o the only other possibility i can think of here is if he's in a small tank there may be ammonia building up in the water it might be time for a water change you don't mention a filter still a good idea to use a small one but if the tank doesn't have one i'd suggest changing about of the water when you get a chance take a sample to your pet store and have them test it for ammonia and nitrite also please read the links below Marine aquarium Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Axolotl Fish farming Solar power Sewage treatment Thermal power station Discus (fish) Shark Hydrogen economy Hamster Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Goldfish Stomach cancer Clownfish Sea-Monkey Blood (computer game) Swimming pool Sun Jumpstart 3rd Grade Ammonia Pikmin Aquarium Guinea pig Tag Shrimp farm Customs and etiquette of Japan Conker's Bad Fur Day Eutrophication Insulin Ecco the Dolphin Happy Tree Friends Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Nuclear reactor Prostate cancer Electrophysiology Shen Gong Wu Autonomous building T-64 StarCraft: Uprising Animal Haibane Renmei E85 Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Breastfeeding Cocaine Platypus 2000 Australian Grand Prix Gaia Online Chicken FoxTrot Vermicompost GunZ The Duel Taboo food and drink Iron Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Cigarette Smoking Man Neopets Clown loach Nuclear power Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Floppy disk Combine (Half-Life 2) Dairy Earthworm Danio The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Characters of Naruto Hydropower Domestic rabbit Sin City Garfield Apollo 8 Refrigerator Creatures in Bionicle Philosophical skepticism Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Irrigation The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Kodocha English grammar God Emperor of Dune Technetium RuneScape quests Extreme Programming Fire fighting Biogeochemical cycle Theory of conduct Naruto jutsu Vegetarianism Hard disk Roswell UFO incident
