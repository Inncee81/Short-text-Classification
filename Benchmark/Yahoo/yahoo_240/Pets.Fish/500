do you have to have soil to keep plants alive i have a few plants that are just in the gravel and have been for a few days they seem fine so far how long can they live with no soil no co but a shitload of light no but it will depend on the plant some types should have their roots completely out of the water and some do better as floating plants if you have fish they do respire so they take in oxygen and give off co for your plants they have easy access to water of course and the main minerals plants need nitrate phosphate potassium calcium are supplied by the fish food and water you add to the tank which is one reason it's not good to use distilled water and your fishes' wastes one mineral that's usually in short supply though is iron it helps if you use an aquatic plant fertilizer that contains this to prevent the leaves from yellowing the light is needed for photosynthesis but also for movement of water containing minerals through the plants as photosynthesis occurs and oxygen is given off more water is needed for the process to continue the water is used in the plan's cells and is split into hydrogen and oxygen with the oxygen being released through the leaves and the hydrogen going to carbohydrates or cell structures think of this as water being pulled through the plant to make these or to be released and the water molecules being connected to each other through their chemical bonds as one molecule is used the rest get pulled along which means more water and all the nutrients in it is constantly being pulled absorbed into the root system as long as the lights are on this is what happens Carnivorous plant Sewage treatment Nutrient Carbon dioxide Soil pH Sulfur Water Biochemistry Rebreather Sulfuric acid Fertilizer Water (molecule) Aluminium Potassium Stoma Phosphorus Nutrition Hydroponics Oxygen Ammonia Leaf Biogeochemical cycle Solar power Cell (biology) Eutrophication Chlorophyta Mineral Alkane Acetic acid Soil life Iron Glucose Hydrogen economy Sugar beet Hydrogen Redox Plant Cyanide Hydrogen sulfide Houseplant Root Ethylene Alcohol fuel Aquarium Thermal power station Fire fighting Enzyme Insulin Fuel cell Carbon dioxide sink Explosive material Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Alcohol Uranium Renewable energy Moon Chemistry Hydrogen peroxide Water purification Signal transduction DNA repair Salt Origin of life Fish farming Chlorophyll Global warming and agriculture Earthworm Phosphate Nitrogen Carbon Titanium Protein Irrigation Corrosion Wetland Bone Brewery Vermicompost Battery (electricity) Biodiesel Hydrochloric acid Compost Eye Carbon cycle Nuclear reactor Sugar E number
