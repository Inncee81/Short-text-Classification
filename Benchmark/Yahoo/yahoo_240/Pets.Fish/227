why did clownfish die i had two percula clownfish for a year and a half they died suddenly a few weeks ago i noticed the smaller fish one morning swimming rapidly sideways with a whitish face and he died minutes later i tried to feed him before he died but he wouldn't eat he was heading towards the filter so i shut it off so he wouldn't be sucked up after he died i promptly removed the dead fish and the other one seemed fine i was very distraught over the fish dying so i forgot to turn the filter back on the next morning the other fish still seemed ok so i turned the filter back on he immediately began acting as the other fish had before he died and was also soon dead within minutes what could have caused this i'm confused because i had them for quite a while with no problems whatsoever they seemed to be very happy and active when they were alive i want to know because i'm thinking of replacing them but am hesitant to because i'm not sure what went wrong this could have been a water quality issue but it may have also been a parasite that produces the condition called clownfish disease brooklynella which is somewhat confusing because fish other than clownfish can get it i would try to rule out a water quality problem first because it's easier to remedy test or have a pet store test for you the ph ammonia nitrite and nitrate levels in the tank and also the temperature and salinity if all these check out as within normal ranges ph ammonia and nitrite nitrate temperature o salinity fish only or reef i would suspect the parasite you an check the photos in this link to diseases of marine fish http home pacific net ph sweetyummy disease html for brooklynella and others but also click on the name brooklynella where it appears in red names in red will open a link to another page with more photos and information about the condition if this is the cause you should not have any fish in the tank for at least weeks to allow time for the parasites to die for lack of a host reef setup you couls also drain all the water and refill the tank with freshwater which ould also kill the parasites but it will also kill the bacteria that cycle the wastes as well as any inverts in the tank if you habe fish other than the clowns you should remove these as well and treat them in a separate tank with a medication containing formalin Clownfish Sewage treatment Fish farming Eutrophication Aquarium Diseases of the honeybee Coral reef Ecology Shark Thermal power station Dairy Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Ammonia Reef tank Traumatic brain injury Shaggy dog story Percula Clownfish Asthma Tidal power Cyanide Dialysis Carburetor Tuberculosis Biogeochemical cycle USS Tunny (SS-282) First aid Hydrogen sulfide Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Fugu Dead Sea Fishing Foodborne illness Water purification Hydrogen economy Malaria E85 Dam Poker jargon Snake Fossil fuel power plant Items in the Metroid series Brewery Insulin Hypoglycemia Cirrhosis Virus Common cold Dry cleaning Aquaculture Autonomous building Hard disk USS Yorktown (CV-5) Finding Nemo Water Kidney Krill Biology Fancy rat Water (molecule) Great Barrier Reef Drowning Antarctic krill Mosquito Chronic fatigue syndrome Rebreather Carbon dioxide Sea-Monkey Ozone depletion Global warming and agriculture Immortality Nuclear power Nerpa Heartworm Medicine StarCraft: Uprising Hamster Toyota Prius Medical prescription Nitrogen Sonar Marine biology Schistosomiasis Characters of Naruto Dead Like Me Halitosis Salmon Energy development Agar plate Atlantic Ocean Salton Sea Baylisascaris
