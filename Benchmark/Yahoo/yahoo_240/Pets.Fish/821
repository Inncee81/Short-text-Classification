fin rot again i think that my fancy goldfish had finrot so i was told to give him melafix he has been taking that for a week so today should be his last treatment he seemed to look much better for a few days but now it seems like his fins are getting a little white again is this normal or is he getting it again i haven't changed any of the water this week because of the medicine but i plan on doing it tomorrow why does this keep happening and how can i prevent it odds are good it's still the fin rot melafix is actually a very weak medication that over all has very poor performance against a disease once it's affecting the fish i would suggest you do a water change place the carbon back in your filter and allow it to remove the remainder of the melafix after that time remove the carbon again and treat the tank with a broad spectrum antibiotic maracyn erythromycin or maracyn tc tetracycline are good choices for fin rot this should completely clear up the problem in days mm Acne Psoriasis Prostate cancer Goldfish Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Dialysis Urinary incontinence Bipolar disorder Stomach cancer First aid Cancer Mouth ulcer Folic acid Pneumonia Legionellosis Common cold Anthrax Stroke Diarrhea Sewage treatment Shrimp farm Medicine Androgen insensitivity syndrome Isotretinoin Chiropractic Group A streptococcal infection Extreme Programming Blood Water purification Helicobacter pylori Fancy rat Tooth enamel Cephalic disorder Hypoglycemia Traditional Chinese medicine Psittacosis Malaria Ulcerative colitis Sickle-cell disease Insulin Eczema Rocky Mountain spotted fever Antibiotic resistance Atherosclerosis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Aquarium Fecal incontinence Clostridium difficile Traumatic brain injury Peptic ulcer Marine aquarium Carbon dioxide E85 Cryptosporidium Radiation therapy Natural health Crohn's disease Bone marrow transplant Glaucoma Chlorpromazine Alcoholism Chronic fatigue syndrome Medical analysis of circumcision Wine making Decompression sickness Lyme disease Vitamin C Gonorrhoea Breast cancer Cardiovascular disease Environmental concerns with electricity generation Syphilis Asthma Naturopathic medicine Cellulitis Omega-3 fatty acid Streptococcus pneumoniae Ehrlichiosis Dracunculiasis Cirrhosis Paget's disease of bone Clinical depression Sun Hamster Dairy Leprosy Decomposition I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Health insurance Publicly funded medicine Lupus erythematosus Gastroparesis Epidemiology Diabetes mellitus Multiple sclerosis Tetracycline Corrosion Mental illness Tuberculosis Diabetic retinopathy
