weird betta behavior this isn't really a concern more of a curiosity question two weeks ago i got my betta a bigger tank gallons his old one was really small pints and he's much happier in his new tank the weird part is that in the smaller tank he would always build huge nests but in the new big tank he doesn't at all i've also noticed the same thing w my second betta when he was in a smaller tank he'd build nests but when i got him a bigger one he stopped why is that btw my two male bettas were never together their tanks have always been on opposite sides of the room that's the same with one of my bettas he used to be in a gallon tank and he blew bubble nests all the time then i bought him a gallon bowl and he never builds nests anymore although there are many plants and hiding spots in the bowl so it might just be because he has more places to swim however my other betta who's in the old gallon tank builds bubble nests all the time once he built one that covered the entire water surface it probably does have something to do with their boredom levels lol so it's very possible that your fish might just be having fun swimming around in their extra space Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Aquarium Dwarf gourami K' Goldfish Autonomous building Swimming pool Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Sea-Monkey Bong Fire fighting Winning Streak Soap bubble GunBound Zerg Fish farming Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve P-47 Thunderbolt Hamster Carbon dioxide StarCraft: Uprising Marine aquarium Tilapia Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Bubble Bobble Gallon Great Teacher Onizuka Quicksort RuneScape quests The Legend of Zelda series enemies Brewery Panama Canal "Weird Al" Yankovic Surtsey Siphon Ecology Hydrogen economy USS Yorktown (CV-5) The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Jet Force Gemini Bottlenose Dolphin Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Jumpstart 3rd Grade Flush toilet Sewage treatment Russian joke FoxTrot Gourami Fast bowling Ecco the Dolphin God Emperor of Dune Seabird Coriolis effect Microeconomics Solar power Conker's Bad Fur Day Thermal power station Supply and demand Barton Springs Piccolo Junior Saga Shaggy dog story Leatherback Sea Turtle Kakapo Pure Pwnage Nile crocodile Dyson sphere Tank truck Volume Rebreather Champagne (beverage) Sento Glacier Swimming First Battle of the Atlantic Professional wrestling slang Cooking weights and measures Advance Wars: Dual Strike Combine (Half-Life 2) Pop punk Sorting algorithm Castlevania: Symphony of the Night The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Futurama (TV series - season 5) Tank Sin City Fight Club Isetta Albatross Diving suit Wine making Three Mile Island Pok__mon Live!
