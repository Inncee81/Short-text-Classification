fish tank filter questions please can you help i have just started my new l tank for goldfish it can supplied with an internal submersable filter the instructions were pants where in the tank should i put it as in how high low in the water it has a water jet so if i put it near the top of the water can i get away with out using an airpump many thanks the filter is a rena filstar with plungers on to attach to the side of the tank we are in the uk thanks for the replies so far you can place it anywhere in the tank lower in the tank will stir the debris like food making it more likely it will be filtered out but may irritate any bottom dwellers you may get some fish like corydoras catfish might like it higher up will provide better surface agitation promoting higher oxygen exchange in the water and evaporation to keep the tank cooler but might make feeding upper tier fish difficult without turning it off an air pump isn't necessary if you have enough surface agitation elsewhere the bubbles don't add oxygen to the water the bubbles breaking on the surface do so a good powerhead churning up the water can be used instead take into account any plants you might put in there the type of fish that you plan to stock it with some don't like any currents other enjoy them and the size of your tank after that lecture i personally would put the filter on the bottom in a back corner with the jet pointing across the back of the tank like if you were to choose the back left corner point the jet to the right as an aside make sure you know that a l will stock fish that reach a maximum of inch in length Brewery Thermal power station Aquarium Carburetor Fish farming Siphon Motor oil Goldfish Glossary of firefighting equipment Water (molecule) Sea-Monkey Sewage treatment E85 Autonomous building Bong Coffee Water purification Petroleum Supply-side economics Dry cleaning Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Apollo Command/Service Module Carbon dioxide Gas compressor Gas metal arc welding Space shuttle main engine Apollo 13 Scramjet USS Yorktown (CV-5) Jet engine Air conditioning Shrimp farm Anchor Irrigation Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Lake Diving regulator Loudspeaker Dead Sea Space Shuttle external tank Lake Burley Griffin Equine conformation Space Shuttle program Fossil fuel power plant Eutrophication Ozone depletion Ocean thermal energy conversion Textile manufacturing Mattress Drill bit Paintball marker Turbocharger Hydrogen economy Mooney M20 Reef tank Seismic retrofit Tank Oxygen sensor Ozone hole Saturn V Diving suit Energy development Antarctic krill Intravenous therapy Twelve leverage points Scuba set Tesla coil Water supply Incandescent light bulb B-47 Stratojet Terminal ballistics Diving cylinder Tetrapod Rocket fuel Gasoline Dam Fire fighting Hydroponics Ice core Pulmonary alveolus Decompression sickness Vacuum Explosive material Wind turbine Motorcycle Radio controlled airplane Biodiesel Marine aquarium STS-51-L
