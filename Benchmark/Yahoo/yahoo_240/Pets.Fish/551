guppies in gallon hi i have a gallon that i posted on criagslist com that i was looking for some community fish for it i have got responses for guppies though the guppies are too young to identify the sex yet they said so my question is how many guppies can i put in there it has gallon filtration and we would like to have a few other fish with them like panda cories and a bristlenose pleco or otocinclus the tank has been running for over a year we recently rehomed some goldfish that were in it to add on to my question should i only get males or can i do a mixture i don't want to overpopulate it also how old do guppies need to be before you can sex them thanks by the way the tank has a heater and the water stays around f if i get both males and females were the tank over populate also i was thinking of instead of the pleco and the ottos get female balloon sailfin mollies you are completely right blue if you get several males and females eventually some of the fry will live and sooner or later youwill have tons of guppies in the tank unless of course you have no hiding places and plenty of adult fish in the tank then you may not have that problem if you don t want fry the best choice is all males no chance at all of any fry that way usually you can sex guppies by the time they are weeks old but it can take a little longer to be positive of the sex you can usually tell them apart a week or two before they can actually breed so if you want a batch of young very carefully you can remove the one's that look like males asap and not have fry in the tank then once they are older swap the males hback to the tank after removing the females as for how many in the tank easily mm Goldfish Aquarium Marine aquarium Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Discus (fish) Sewage treatment Brewery Condom Abortion debate Tilapia Sailfin Molly Gasoline Fish farming Pocket cruiser Mark I (tank) Anal sex Wine making Androgen insensitivity syndrome Cruising (maritime) Alcohol fuel Stock car (rail) Intersex surgery Age of consent Reef tank Live-bearing aquarium fish IAR 80 Gender role Guppy Extreme Programming Demographics of the United States French fries Clownfish Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Hydrogen economy Tofu E85 Parthenogenesis Dwarf gourami Sexual selection Fishing Sex assignment Refrigerator car Rum Cessna T-37 Intelligent design movement Vickers Valiant Platypus Biology and sexual orientation Koi Homebrewing Gender-neutral language Nerpa Homosexuality and transgender Biodiesel Fish and chips History of intersex surgery Sexual reproduction Social rule Autonomous building Honey Sauna Fugu Kakapo British Rail Class 42 Gay slang Have I Got News For You The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Bread Tank Milk Samuel Goldwyn Burma Campaign Water heater Fossil fuel power plant Nuclear power Bob and George P-38 Lightning Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma I Will Always Love You (Whitney Houston song) Mercury Atlas 6 History of nuclear weapons Hard water USS Yorktown (CV-5) Transgender Gar Bacon Intelligent design Orgasm Seabird Wheel of Fortune Sexual intercourse Shrimp farm Boeing 747 Tarantula Red Squirrel Concrete Gender identity Short Sunderland Pornographic actor
