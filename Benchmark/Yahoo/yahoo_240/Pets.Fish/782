bleached fish tank rock and filter details can be skipped if you like question is at the bottom i bleached my holey rock and a used filter that had algae all over it i read later that i might have used to much bleach i say about a cup in only gallons and it soaked for about hours instead of minutes i then soaked it in dechlorinator i then rinsed it off again really well finally i let it dry completely next i put the rock and filter into a bucket of really hot water not boiling water just high temp and now plan to soak in dechlorinator again my question in short is there anyway i can make sure this rock and filter is safe from the bleach before adding them to my tank i don't want to wait weeks if you thoroughly boil the rock after bleaching and then let it air dry over night it will be safe for your fish if you take the rock and soak it in water with a dechlorinator the rock will also absorb the dechlorinator neutralizing the bleach nosoop u for more on aquarium maintenance check out the link in my profile Water purification Brewery Marine aquarium Menstrual cup Sewage treatment Coffee Thermal power station Dishwasher Dry cleaning Aquarium Ethidium bromide Tofu Dairy The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Coral reef Reef tank Fossil fuel power plant Sea-Monkey E85 Autonomous building Decaffeination Rebreather Fire fighting Dishwashing Agar plate Wood pulp Hydroponics Axolotl Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Carbon dioxide Swimming pool Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Technicolor Kosher foods Soy milk Fishing Rice Sulfuric acid Solar power Cuisine of Brazil Sugar beet Dialysis Motor oil Hummingbird Timeline of alternative rock Idli Cantonese cuisine Manicure Bong Sodium hypochlorite Cruising (maritime) Laundry detergent Quinoa Rum Fish farming Polychlorinated biphenyl Haggis Hydrogen peroxide Risotto Tea Steam engine USS Yorktown (CV-5) Ammonia Nirvana (band) Wine making Illegal drug trade Menstrual cycle Beer Sento Space Shuttle program Fire extinguisher Sugarcane Dead Sea Koi Hydrogen economy Common bean Car washing techniques Sake Goldfish Tillandsia Survival skills Composting toilet USS Tunny (SS-282) Nuclear power Filter (optics) Homebrewing Angling STS-57 Mercury Atlas 6 Jewish cuisine MTV2 Bleach (manga) Russian cuisine Pump Western blot Instant coffee Leather Chlorination Yerba mate
