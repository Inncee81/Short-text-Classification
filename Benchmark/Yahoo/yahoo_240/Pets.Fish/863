ok set up for a gourami and neons i have a gal standard with corycats and snail but i really want dwarf gourami and neons not bad zoo but you don't really even have to go that far just consider your tank depth and length for fish of this nature i'd say zoo is right on about the gourami max might be four inches three is a good safe esitmate and having only shouldn't be a problem neons should be schooled and go for instead of five there isn't really any issues in populations right now i have a baby arowana five baby clown loaches three spot gourami oapline gourmi female pearl gourami zebra danios and a male betta in my i moved out my work tank took up too much space and noone is dying or having any fights of course this isn't going to be a long term set up my baby arowana is still too small to go with the group in my and he will be moved the clown loaches of course will move when bigger they are only inches now the gourami and betta really don't fight but if aggression sets in the gourami go play with the arowana in the lol so sometimes you can have overcrowding but as long as you have proper filtration aquaclear for mine and realize the compatibility you can do it in this set up your fish are not going to really fight though just keep an eye on that dwarf with the neons and you are not going to run out of space none of these fish are massive waste producers either so best of luck with them sounds great you can get better help and service at fishless cycling com or just use the link on my profile jv Dwarf gourami Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Gourami Kissing gourami Danio Perciformes Clown loach Hard disk Zebra Danio Timeline of alternative rock Marine aquarium Sea-Monkey USS Tunny (SS-282) Timon and Pumbaa Loach Hamster Shaggy dog story Quotation mark Tank Rail terminology Pearl Danio Sewage treatment Television Laser Sheryl Crow Equine conformation Red Dwarf The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Floppy disk Ostrich Poker jargon Fluorescent lamp Nuclear power Punk ideology Space Shuttle external tank Dishwasher Galactic Civilizations AFI 100 Years series Elephant RISC Drill bit Bristol Zoo Timeline of fictional future events Intelligent design RuneScape quests Incandescent light bulb Kender Animals in space Supernova Shark Clown Horse Hip hop collaborations Neon Genesis Evangelion Samus Aran Star Destroyer Dry cleaning Terminal ballistics Aquarium The Tracey Ullman Show shorts Insane Clown Posse USS Yorktown (CV-5) Domestication USS Nautilus (SS-168) Rebreather RuneScape slang and terminology Hydrogen economy Laws of cricket Neon tetra Quicksort RuneScape locations Sandworm (Dune) Stellar evolution Biodiesel Audio tape length and thickness American lobster Who Framed Roger Rabbit Helium Theodicy Tigon Social rule Hall & Oates Max Martin The Miracles Platypus Brewery The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Theory of conduct Irrigation Second Battle of the Atlantic The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Lion Advance Wars: Dual Strike B-47 Stratojet Pitaten USS Hoel (DD-533) Pierson's Puppeteer Warrior (World of Warcraft) Lighting
