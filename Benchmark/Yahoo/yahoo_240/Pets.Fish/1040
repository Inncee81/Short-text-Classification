water changes with discus i've had my discus tank up and running for about months now i was told by breeders and other discus experts to do weekly water changers i have a gallon tank so i am taking gallons out each week to me this seems like quite a bit wouldn't it start a new cycle each time i do a water change i have a fluval filter and packages of the biomax balls so is this why it doesn't start a cycle each time i've had fishtanks for about years now but until recently i've never did any water changes or knew much if anything about water cycles could somebody help me out on this also since the biomax balls carry all of the beneficial bacteria wouldn't it make sense to never replace them with new ones fluval recommends changing it once every months staggering the replacements is this just a way for them to make money i don't see why i should replace it thanks for any help i'm probably overthinking on this one its just that i spent last night on discus and they will be arriving tuesday morning i'd hate to loose that much on these fish so early in the game for something stupid that i didn't ask doing water changes has little affect on the bacteria once the tank has cycled the bacteria live in the filter media in this case your bioballs and attached to the gravel there's very little of the cycling bacteria that would be in the water you do need to remove the ammonia and nitrite if the tank is cycling and the nitrate if it's finished though all of these can be toxic to fish if the levels are high enough it's just that for nitrate it takes a lot more to be harmful it is a plant fertilizer though so removing and replacing of the water keeps it from fertilizing any algae in the tank the replacement water also contains some minerals calcium magnesium sodium that are used by the fish and any aquarium plants so doing a water change replenishes these the basis of cycling is bacteria that use the ammonia that your fish produce as a part of their wastes as their energy source since ammonia is toxic to your fish in relatively small amounts this is a good thing by using it for their energy they convert it to nitrite which is also toxic a second group of bacteria uses the nitrite as an energy source and they convert the nitrite to nitrate which the fish can live in in larger amounts unfortunately there aren't tank bacteria that use the nitrate but live plants will use some the rest need to be reduced through water changes you're correct that the bioballs are one of the areas where the bacteria live but these also collect a lot of debris from fish poo plant leaves and maybe some food that gets caught in the intake overflow these will decompose and become a source of ammonia themselves so this is what you want to clean you can rinse them in a clean container of tank water or dechlorinated water and reuse the same ones so partly they do make money if you follow their directions to the letter you can also reuse filter pads in hang on filters as well even though the directions on those packages tell you to replace them Eutrophication Biogeochemical cycle Fish farming Bacteria Hydrogen economy Ammonia Aquarium Cyanide Water purification Biodiesel Carnivorous plant Hydrogen sulfide Brewery Ecology Energy development Nitrogen cycle Nutrient Nuclear power Carbon dioxide Autonomous building Milk Sulfur Dairy Iron Nitrogen Photosynthesis Soil pH Discus (fish) Chlorophyta Dry cleaning Uranium Water Nutrition Fossil fuel power plant Mercury (element) Hard water Soil life Explosive material Dietary fiber Biochemistry Waste management Sodium hypochlorite Ammonium nitrate Aluminium Cocaine Future energy development Fertilizer E85 Dishwasher Alcohol fuel Omega-3 fatty acid Natural gas Ocean thermal energy conversion Hamster Textile manufacturing Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Ozone hole Nuclear reactor Toyota Prius Environmental concerns with electricity generation Dead Sea Water pollution Thermal depolymerization E number Carburetor Sea-Monkey Disinfection Urine Tofu Reef tank Cell (biology) Thermal power station Sulfuric acid Potassium nitrate Sodium nitrite Algae Houseplant Fire fighting Cellular respiration Vitamin C Krill Polychlorinated biphenyl Sterilization (microbiology) Sun Domestic rabbit Plankton Transformer Cannabis cultivation Desert
