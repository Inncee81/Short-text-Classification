i have a red tail cat fish and i already know how big he's going to get what i really need to know from someone that has experience with this particular fish is how often do i have to feed it he's already about inches long and i prefer to feed him shrimp or goldfish if i feed him until he doesn't want anymore do i feed him again the next day or should i feed him until he's full every other day he's now eating goldfish at feeding time once a day i really need some advice from someone who's not guessing but has experience feeding a red tail until he's full is probably not a good idea small daily feedings or a slightly larger feeding every other day will suffice as a top predator they will over eat at a moments notice one or two goldfish a day is plenty you might also try some crickets or crayfish for variety i hope you have plans for a very large aquarium in your future also i'd advise moving the fish into the larger quarters while you can still net him when one of these bruisers gets to be ' long they become very hard to handle and can deal a nasty cut with their saw like pectoral fins they will also tear up a regular aquarium net before you can move them and nets that will hold them the game fishing kind are likely to damage the fish you only have of rapid growth to address these issues so some planing is in order tropical fish hobbyist didn't include them on their list of tank busters for nothing Goldfish Gar Aquarium Sea-Monkey Fishing Koi Clownfish Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Goby Poker jargon Stingray Zebra Danio Crayfish Fauna of Australia Unreal Coral reef Krill Oceanic Whitetip Shark Antarctic krill Kissing gourami Orca Shark Tetrapod Freshwater angelfish Shrimp farm Parrotfish Equine conformation Organic farming Halfbeak Bat Spider Batoidea Discus (fish) Moult Volleyball Aquarium (album) Terminal ballistics Filefish Muskellunge Grunion Seabird Octopus Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Salmon Model aircraft Fish farming El-Fish Murray Cod Marine aquarium Fancy rat CPU cache Garfield Hamster Oarfish Guinea pig Textile manufacturing Sonic Adventure Cuisine of Denmark RuneScape quests Goldeen Tarantula Cuttlefish Biological pest control Humpback Whale Brine shrimp Finding Nemo Fish Radio controlled airplane Thresher Shark Internal ballistics The Strangerhood Fast bowling Antenna (radio) Whaling Boeing 747 Whale shark Flyingfish Seine (fishing) Lake Burley Griffin Sushi Predation Ichthyosaur Firearm Breastfeeding Game programming Leopard Tilapia Domestic rabbit Europe Bengali cuisine Danio American lobster Dog agility Whale Cable television Marathon (computer game) Nile crocodile
