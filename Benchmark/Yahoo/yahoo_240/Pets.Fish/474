beta fish question how is it that these fish can survive in such small containers with no filtration etc i go to the pet store and they're all just sitting in these tiny plastic cups how is this possible wow it never occurred to me that they breathe like us lol that's so neat it's simply for convenience in pet stores say you have male bettas for sale and since they're territorial they can't be kept in a tank together it would be terribly impractical to have each one in his own gallon heated and filtered tank especially since bettas are popular and sell fast however there are many myths floating around about bettas and how they like to be in tiny bowls and are perfect at room temp ect it's not true this all started because during the dry season the rice paddies betta live in sometimes dry up however this does not mean they're living in puddles or muddy footprints some even live in slow moving streams although everyone seems so eager to provide them with a tiny living space so they don't get scared no one seems to eager to provide them with a heater so the don't get cold bettas naturally live in water around f lifespans in bowls and vases is around a few months to yrs lifespan in a proper home is yr to see for yourself what they really live in take a look here http www brents com organization vacationimages v photos baliimages images rice paddy view from jpg Aquarium Marine aquarium Coffee Hamster Tea Brewery Bong Rice Dwarf gourami Sewage treatment Cannabis cultivation Goldfish Thermal power station Autonomous building Portable stove E85 Sake Japanese tea ceremony Fish farming Dairy Axolotl Temperature Drill bit Japanese toilet Milk Sea-Monkey Reef tank Tilapia Tofu HVAC Hydrogen economy Ice cream Frog Solar power Fossil fuel power plant Mars Exploration Rover Sauna Digital photography Apollo 13 Food preservation Stereoscopy Renewable energy Fire fighting Flood geology Tlingit Noah's Ark Glass Cigarette Alcohol fuel Fire extinguisher Kitchen Fishing Samovar Rum Ramen Cat Menstrual cup Loudspeaker Commodore 64 Drowning Operation Barbarossa Sega Dreamcast Shrimp farm Fancy rat Irrigation Dragon boat Gaia Online Solar eclipse Sushi Water heater Laserdisc Drainage Compost Basement Kylie Minogue Phase (matter) Floppy disk Water purification Glossary of firefighting equipment Filling station Rail terminology Dry cleaning Biodiesel Dishwasher The Late Show with David Letterman Rice University Cuisine of Brazil Solar panel Bonsai ITunes Compact audio cassette Gmail Customs and etiquette of Japan Tank RISC Radioisotope thermoelectric generator
