are goldfish ok living alone i have one goldfish which is about inches and a litre tank and i don't know whether to get another goldfish to keep it company i have a filter and air pump in the tank so their should be enough oxygen for another fish would it be best to keep the goldfish alone p s i can't get a bigger tank and am keeping water quality at the highest my goldfish has been living in a slightly smaller tank for five years when it was about inches and seemed to be happy the new tank looks asif the fish has loads of space and i heard that goldfish only grew to the size of their tank your goldfish will be fine alone and in fact that's the best case for him at the present he will quickly out grow your tank and is pushing the limit at already any other fish added to the tank would result in over crowding and constant problems mm Goldfish Aquarium Thermal power station E85 Sewage treatment Carburetor Brewery Sea-Monkey Tank locomotive Hydrogen economy Glossary of firefighting equipment Dairy Lake Burley Griffin Autonomous building Carbon dioxide Space Shuttle external tank Water purification Tank Hydroponics Explosive material Fish farming Samuel Goldwyn Marine aquarium Apollo 13 Fire fighting Gas metal arc welding Concrete PID controller B-47 Stratojet Firearm Dam Scuba set Color Energy development Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Discus (fish) Internal ballistics Gasoline Shrimp farm Laserdisc Flush toilet Dry cleaning Rocket fuel Rebreather STS-114 Water garden Glossary of firefighting terms Vacuum Solar power Space Shuttle program Rolling-element bearing Floppy disk Gramophone record Terran (StarCraft) Gar Diesel engine Space shuttle main engine Koi Wood Hydraulic machinery Reef tank Hawker Hurricane Weight training Welding RISC Hydrogen vehicle Snorkel F-16 Fighting Falcon Zerg Tire Atari 8-bit family IAR 80 Engine displacement Hard disk Novelty (locomotive) PNG Diving cylinder Stock car (rail) Harley-Davidson Shell (projectile) Biodiesel Digital photography Depleted uranium Apollo Command/Service Module Elis Prefecture Water pollution Hash table Fossil fuel power plant Paramount Pictures Saturn V Anti-aircraft warfare Photosynthesis Phase-locked loop Decompression sickness MS-06 Zaku II Think tank Messerschmitt Bf 109 Torpedo Jet engine
