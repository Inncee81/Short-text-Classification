beginner with fish tank help i just got a new gallon fish tank and it came with chocolate albino algea suckers and i was just wondering what would be some good fish to get that would all get along and some helpful tips on everything from feeding to cleaning thanx first read up on cycling your tank you will kill fish if you don't cycle it read up on that by searching it on google or reading this article http www cichlid forum com articles fishless cycling php next it's all up to your taste about sticking your tank don't get something of everything most fish prefer larger groups of their own species corydoras catfish are amusing and very active bottom level fish they help clean food that falls to the bottom but should be fed sinking bottomfeeder pellets they should be in groups of or more they are sensitive to nitrate buildup and salt in their water tetras are also a common choice as there are many colors and shapes to choose from and the shoal well they are also very hardy fish that will tolerate a lot of conditions from temperature swings and ammonia spikes to different food they are mostly mid level to surface dwellers and prefer groups of or more feeding should be by level fish and amount eaten higher level fish should be fed floating food like common tropical flakes so as to not compete with bottom dwellers and bottom level fish should be fed sinking foods like bottom dweller pellets for the same reason it may take you a bit but carefully monitor how much the fish eat in the span of or minutes and adjust the amount you give them accordingly a group of or cory catfish will need one sinking bottom dweller pellet a day for example but if they compete with other aquiarium denizens like apple snails there may need to be one in the morning and another at night to feed everyone evenly cleaning aquariums is actually easy if you keep a good 'cleanup crew' usually snails three apple snails will keep a gallon tank fairly sparkling with you only needing to do a water change every week don't overstock your tank is another vital tip a rule of thumb is one inch of fish per gallon and one gallon per snail make sure that you know a fish's environmental and social needs before you add it some fish need live plants to use as hiding places others will tear up live plants and harrass your other fish and to top all this off get a gallon tank fill it with cycled tank water this is your hospital and quarrentine tank always quarrentine any new fish you get for at least weeks in this tank and if one of your fish gets sick you can move it to this smaller tank it is a lot easier to treat a disease or parasite in a hospital tank than it is to treat all of your fish in your main tank good luck and welcome to fishkeeping Marine aquarium Fish farming Tilapia Corydoras Goldfish Hamster Sea-Monkey Brewery Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Shrimp farm Discus (fish) Carburetor Fishing Carnivorous plant Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Shark Thermal power station Guinea pig Eutrophication Water Breastfeeding Dairy Electrophysiology Water (molecule) Domestic rabbit Ecology Gar Coffee Fugu Dog Chocolate Hydroponics Malaria Fancy rat Bong Dry cleaning Axolotl Orca Alcohol fuel Carbon dioxide Hydrogen economy Tooth Clownfish Toyota Prius Anorexia nervosa Bottlenose Dolphin Earthworm Fire fighting Fish Omega-3 fatty acid Water purification Fossil fuel power plant Strap-on dildo Myxobolus cerebralis Biodiesel Ocean thermal energy conversion Houseplant Salmon USS Tunny (SS-282) Livestock Apple Nuclear reactor RuneScape quests Krill USS Yorktown (CV-5) Zebra Danio Hard disk Octopus Soil life Spider Dog agility Fecal incontinence Atlantic herring E85 Coral reef Trophic level Organic farming Schistosomiasis Gypsy moth Hypoglycemia Breakfast Iron Anchor Japanese tea ceremony Vitamin C Snail Anopheles Microeconomics Mattress Freshwater angelfish
