frustrated with my tank question about molly hi i am trying hard to establish a freshwater tank i've had it for two weeks and already a guppy died the ammonia had spiked i think that is why i still have a male molly i can't seem to contol the ammonia i have done percent water changes for the last three days also i have reduced feeling him to once a day still the ammonia is at or i am trying to establish the good bacteria through cycling but with all these water changes i wonder if it is doing more harm i am at a loss i have a young daughter who is stressing over the death of the other wish and i really want to make the tank fine for the molly the molly has been acting differetly sometimes swimming at the top and then resting on the bottom near the gravel way less active what's wrong help tank you thank you everyone for your expertise and advise here are some details i would like to add again thank you jon v yes i have been vacuuming the gravel while doing the water changes i think that is the only thing that has reduced the ammonia at all i tested my tap water and it came up negative for ammonia thank you for offering your email i may need to i will let you know shelly my ph is high hard water tikitili thanks for info on prime also i did not know you can cycle the tank w o fish this is what i did after posting last i went and added a dose of aquarium salt i heard mollys like this also i added an ammonia filter to my regular filter i wonder of this will be counter productive please email me with any other additional advise as i soo appriciate it i will let you know how it goes chen chen you've been doing the right thing treating this with water changes chemical treatments are not the answer here that should be used as an emergency and last resort if you've been doing the changes and cutting down the feedings to a bare minimum but still getting reading this high two things come to mind here when you are doing your changes are you vaccuming the gravel as well if there is a build up of waste materials sitting in the substrate and you only change out the water those waste materials are still decomposing and emitting ammonia into your water if you have not been doing so every water change do a thorough cleaning in your substrate to eliminate excess waste second possibility is that there is an ammonia source already present in your tap water your tap water maybe excessively high in chloramines which is a binded cholorine and ammonia run an ammonia test on your tap water to rule that out email me if you still have high readings a third possible final option the tester is bad giving you false readings if it has a lot expiration date check that as well you may need to just get a new test kit for superior service and a service group dedicated to your help you can go to fishless cycling com or just use the link on my profile jv Marine aquarium Sewage treatment Ammonia Water purification Eutrophication Fish farming Hydrogen economy Aquarium Brewery Asthma Nitrogen Sea-Monkey Diseases of the honeybee Water (molecule) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma E85 Autonomous building Cocaine Sodium hypochlorite Biodiesel Iron Water Aluminium Biochemistry Hydrogen peroxide Solar cell Motor oil Bong Ultraviolet Scientology beliefs and practices Plame affair Refrigerator Nutrition Acne Dishwasher Energy development Alternative biochemistry Haloalkane Carburetor Gmail Waste management Solar power Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Diving Chronic fatigue syndrome Shrimp farm Urine Google Electrophysiology Fertilizer Fossil fuel power plant Coffee Titanium Ocean thermal energy conversion Appeal Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Chlorophyta Cyanide Avalanche Thimerosal Nuclear fallout Fugu HIV test Ecology Fire fighting Software testing Industrial wastewater treatment Light-emitting diode Psoriasis Natural deduction Hypoglycemia Sun Town gas Origin of life XML Non-medical use of dextromethorphan Hard water Carbon dioxide Advanced Squad Leader Glucocorticoid Cancer Corrosion Hydrogen sulfide CPU cache Transformer Dry cleaning Bacteria Motility Radiation hardening Nuclear weapon design
