how can i defeat ich i have had numerous fish that have died from ich i mean don't get me wrong i take great care of my fish and several have grown to be over a foot long but ich is usually the way that these fish die i have ich medicine and stress coat that i use and it helps the symptoms but it doesn't ever go away i've only ever had one fish that's died of old age she was anyway can you reccomend any stronger medicines that i can have on hand i agree go with the heat salt method whenever possible the meds are very stressful for the fish like mentioned stress is the big factor in bringing ich on ich is always present in the tank but it's an opportunistic host so when the fish gets stressed it moves in best thing you can do is to prevent it be sure to do frequent water changes at least once a week about of the water needs to be changed be sure to vacuum the gravel substrate and decorations good as well ich hangs out in there don't overstock the tank overcrowding causes stress don't overfeed that will need to poor water quality when you add new water make sure it's close to the same temp as the tank water temperature fluctuations will stress the fish as well some fish are sensitive to salt and the ich meds loaches plecos some cat fish tetras any scaleless fish first you'll want to slowly raise the tank temperature to about f for salt dosage about tablespoon per us gallons but mix it first in a bucket of water to dissolve it and it slowly as well ich is only killed when it's in it's free swimming state so it's not technically killed when it's on the fish and falls off you also need to be sure to treat for at least weeks to effectively kill it that's usually where people go wrong they don't treat it long enough the increase in the temperature will increase the ich life cycle thus making them get to the free swimming state quicker stress coat doesn't do anything so save your money and do buy it anymore here's a couple of good links that explain ich and different ways to treat it http www peteducation com article cfm cls cat articleid http en wikipedia org wiki ichthyophthirius Brewery Corrosion Discus (fish) Sewage treatment Psoriasis Aquarium Ich Shark Fish farming Sea-Monkey Bipolar disorder Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Common cold German grammar Ceramics Biodiesel Insulin Houseplant Glass Theory of conduct Dairy Nutrition Clinical depression Lake Abortion Water (molecule) Rebreather Anorexia nervosa Water purification Migraine Carbon dioxide Hydrogen economy Fire fighting Urinary incontinence Atherosclerosis Decompression sickness Poker jargon Dead Sea Prostate cancer Marine aquarium Cancer Asthma Desert Heat Gross domestic product Dishwasher Microeconomics Chronic fatigue syndrome Thermal power station Tilapia Aluminium Tocopherol Bread Fancy rat Hypertension Global warming Water Drowning Capitalism Characters in the Smurfs Gypsy moth Extreme Programming Infantilism Axolotl Sento Siphon Tetrapod Carburetor Antidepressant Vitamin C Baldness Medicine Casting Pottery Hydrochloric acid Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Hydroponics E85 Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Password Osteoarthritis Suicide methods Sodium chloride Heartworm Sword making Cannabis (drug)
