how can gold fish live without food my mom has a pound and she quits feeding the fish near winter and then turns off the pump they sit their and float around not eating anything for the whole winter how can they survive for like months without food and in the freezing water i also heard a story of a women who would freeze her fish every time she went on a business meeting then when she got back she would unfreeze them and they would still be living i was told this at the pet shop so i think it's an accurate story first your mom's fish when the water gets cold the fish are the same temp as the water and just go into a state of semi hibernation we can't do that here because it's too cold but many parts of the country can overwinter carp with no problem many of our northern fish do exactly the same thing there are usually enough insects around until the water freezes over for them to eat for quite a while and they also will munch off algae in the pond how specifically you overwinter carp varies considerably from region to region the second story is totally made up when you freeze a fish its heart stops and it dies it cannot be resuscitated someone was pulling someone's leg Koi Goldfish Carp Antarctic krill Fish farming Salmon Frog Lake Burley Griffin Fishing Fugu Bird migration Shrimp farm Winter Deluge (mythology) Tilapia Aquarium One Piece minor characters Aquaculture Freezing Terri Schiavo Sea ice Hypothermia Taboo food and drink Garfield Shaggy dog story Treehouse of Horror V Sea-Monkey Great Lakes Neopets Gray Wolf Myxobolus cerebralis Shark Common carp Carbon dioxide Inuit Fisheries in Hong Kong Kodocha Zebra Danio Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Acorn Krill Marine aquarium Philip J.
