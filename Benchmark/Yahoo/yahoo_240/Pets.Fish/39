is my fish tank overcrowded i have a l tank and young kissing gourami in it with a black skirt widow tetra and also a young black sailfin molly or a common hybrid between a black molly and a sailfin molly and yes i know my kissing gourami will outgrow its tank but i am planning to try and move it to a larger one when it becomes bigger but for now since it is still small i am planning to keep it there well for the time being is my fish tank overcrowded thank u however my fish dont seem incompatible they r actually going very well they never fight or attack eachother well maybe once they fought over a piece of flake food but other then that which only happened once they get along very well and my molly is still very small too probably about or cm head to tail o and my balck widow skirt tetra isn't small its actually pretty big compared to the pet sores one hehe maybe or cm well my molly did have a partner but it would always attack it and bite its fins so that it wouldn't be able to eat and would have to always hide it eventually died and no this is not coz of courtship behaviour it was totally different i would say unless your gourami is over inches that you are fine for now once it's that size it will need to move up to a bigger tank as you well know already mm Sailfin Molly Kissing gourami Dwarf gourami Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Discus (fish) Gourami Shark Goldfish Hamster YuYu Hakusho Perciformes Tank Princess Zelda Halfbeak Spider Tank classification Sea-Monkey Floppy disk Ron Weasley Clownfish MS-06 Zaku II Fancy rat Marine aquarium Sea serpent Whale Final Fantasy IX Puma Fish anatomy Battle of Berlin Dolphin Kodocha American lobster Sonic Adventure Crayfish Equine conformation RuneScape quests Knots Landing Trish Stratus American Alligator Octopus Sin City House Mouse SS Division Totenkopf Weasley family Scale model Tetra Pak Cuttlefish Characiformes Panthera hybrid Gar Cardinal tetra Lanternfish SS Division (motorised) Wiking Piccolo Junior Saga Clown loach Bengali cuisine Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends Axolotl German Sixth Army Neon tetra Noreen Greenwald Minor Harry Potter Beasts European Kingfisher Tigon Ewoks: The Battle for Endor Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Whaling Ecco the Dolphin Zebra Danio Animal communication Weekly World News Tasmanian Devil Stryker Goby Chicken Platypus Alaga__sia Fin Whale Hydrogen economy AGX-04 Gerbera Tetra Ranma __ characters Garfield Shen Gong Wu Squirrel Lisa Marie Varon Kate Bush Herring Koi StarCraft Secret Missions Polychrotidae Erich von Manstein StarCraft: Uprising Erwin Rommel IBM PC compatible Timeline of alternative rock The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures
