sharks florida clear water hi when i was i want to florida and went to clear water beach there was like big things in the sea like a block shape and you were only alloud to swim between those lines i think they had nets attached to them under water aswell were they there so that people dont swim out to far and the life gards can keep a better eye on you or to stop sharks swimming in if it is to stop sharks are they usually in that area i live in the u k and recently a great white shark has been spotted a few times by cornwall so recently they have been playing the movie jaws on the t v which has reminded me to ask this question thanks for your answers x sharks can swin anywhere there is water the markers you describe are to let swimmers know not to swim beyond them for safety reasons sharks are all over the place in florida but it really isn't anything to worry about too much since they are not really aggressive towards people if people truly knew the number of sharks in the water no one would ever go to the beach the lifeguards will warn you if there are sharks in the area Shark Jaws (film) Swimming Swimming pool Great White Shark Lifeguard Diving Dolphin Oceanic Whitetip Shark Tag Basking Shark Ecco the Dolphin Kitesurfing Personal flotation device Jaws 2 Great White (film) Drowning Surfing Jumping the shark USS Sea Dog (SS-401) Rip current Megalodon Episodes of Lost (Season 2) USS Indianapolis (CA-35) Plesiosaur Card Sharks Whale shark Shark Tale Aquaman Giant squid Sperm Whale Paintball Orca Stingray Flag Adult Swim Orlando, Florida Camp Lazlo USS Tigrone (SS-419) Triathlon Backstroke Bull shark Finding Nemo Hammerhead shark Naval operations in the Dardanelles Campaign Diving suit Naval mine USS Picuda (SS-382) Jackass: The Movie The Strangerhood Mass noun Jennifer Lopez Seine (fishing) Epistemology Johnny Weissmuller Australian salmon History of swimming 2005 English cricket season Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Storm surge Volleyball Speedo Mosasaur Treehouse of Horror XI ECHL Krill Bocas del Toro Province Capital punishment Blacktip Reef Shark Fish Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an USS Whale (SS-239) Railway signalling Mercury 4 Water polo Phaedo Singlish Arab-Israeli conflict Everglades National Park Trilobite Tuatara Speedo (suit style) Shark Bay, Western Australia Sandbar shark Happy Tree Friends Broward County, Florida Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Diving locations Palm Beach County, Florida Amusement park 2000 Australian Grand Prix The Beach Breaststroke USS Seadragon (SS-194) The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Creatures in Bionicle Pittwater Council Ultimate (sport)
