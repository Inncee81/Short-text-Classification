such a sense of accomplishment this is a comment finally finally i got my frogs and they are happily living in the tank we had to go to petstores to find them but finally petsmart actually had the frogs in stock i took them home floated them for minutes and then netted them and put them in my crystal clear tank once i saw them swimming around in that tank i felt so accomplished i have been observing them for a while and decided to name one of them animato its italian for lively animated and the other one i named dolce which is italian for sweet or sweetly both names are musical terms hah congratulations on your new pet getting it and setting it up for your frogs may feel like an accomplishment but in fact you have just started keeping them alive for a year or more now that is an accomplishment enjoy Sea-Monkey Musical terminology Shaggy dog story Rebreather Meta-reference Mercury Atlas 6 Battle of Kursk Family Guy Norway national football team Frog Sant Thakar Singh Characters of Naruto African clawed frog Sunset Boulevard (1950 film) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Happiness Final Fantasy XI Final Fantasy: Unlimited SS Andrea Doria W.I.T.C.H.
