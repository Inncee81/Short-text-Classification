my friend put goldfish in a gallon bowl help i know it is completely terrible that is so mean for the poor fish her dad said get atleast fish but he know nothing about fish help what should i tell her she won't listen to me the first thing you need to tell her is that the fish are going to die if you keep them in the bowl they need water that is filtered and has air moving around the second thing you need to tell her is that you need one gallon of water for every one inch of fish so if all of her fish are one inches then she would need four gallons also she needs to take into consideration that these fish will grow although if they remain in a bowl they won't have time to grow since they will most likely die so if they are goldfish and each fish is supposed to grow to be three inches then she should accomodate for four inch fish or inches of fish so she would need gallons of water if she were to buy a gallon tank and put a filter and heater in there kept around degrees farenheit she should also get an air stone which will keep the water filled with oxygen her fish should be fine in a gallon as long as she doesn't have too many decorations in it Goldfish Aquarium Marine aquarium Autonomous building Fossil fuel power plant Flush toilet Fish farming Brewery E85 American Dad!
