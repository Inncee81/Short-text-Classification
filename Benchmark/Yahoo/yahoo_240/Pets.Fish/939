easy freshwater fish i have an eclispe gallon tank what would be an easy species to maintain that won't grow too big i had a goldfish and ended up giving it to a friend with a pond it really got big and is doing very well if you go to a specialty shop you will have more options to answer the question though we really need to know the ph and hardness of the water in your tank that is a key determinant in deciding what fish are best suited to yuor aquariums conditions and all of that said if by easy you mean i don t want to take care of these fish nothing will do well but as long as you keep up with partial water changes regularly once a month is typical and don't overfeed you should do well with the following suggestions assuming that you are about neutral or slightly acidic in ph and your water is only slightly hard here are my suggestions for the bottom how about a rubber lipped pleco do not get a common pleco they get huge but the rubber lip varieites tend to be smaller and will help out with any algae that builds up and it will you might also try some amano shrimp they are cool little critters that also eat algae midwater how about some harlequin rasboras and leopard danios the latter are not as common as the typical zebra danios but in my opinion are prettier fish female bettas might also work well my favorite small tank fish has to be the rummy nosed tetra i have some in one of my tanks that have been there for almost five years cardinal tetras are pretty fish but can be a little delicate if the conditions aren't right they like the ph a little on the low side but provide the right conditions and they will thrive for the top water how about hatchet fish also white cloud mountain minnows are almost indestructable and will even over winter in outdoor ponds in some parts of the country if your water is hard with a higher ph then go with livebearers like platties swordtails or guppies although personally i think guppies should be in a tank by themselves there are a thousand choices really those are just a few suggestions any reliable local fish store not a chain should be able to recommend easy fish appropriate for your tank best advice i can give is find a good fish store bring a water sample with you for them to test for ph and hardness and let them help you pick out the right fish for your conditions note that i said a good fish store some are not so good with sick fish and lousy advice Aquarium Marine aquarium Discus (fish) Zebra Danio Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Shrimp farm Tilapia Goldfish Live-bearing aquarium fish Fish farming Fish Water (molecule) Gar White Cloud Mountain Minnow Sea-Monkey Lake E85 Koi Neon tetra Autonomous building Biodiesel Algae Reef tank Cardinal tetra Hypoglycemia Prostate cancer Ecology Halfbeak Guppy Thermal power station Clownfish Coral reef Tank Hydrogen economy Illegal drug trade Carbon dioxide Coffee Dead Sea Mattress Sailfin Molly Crayfish Species Fugu Anchor Fishing Diatom Carp Houseplant RuneScape quests Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Tofu Ozone depletion Veganism Kissing gourami Sewage treatment Solar power Cruising (maritime) Leopard Theory of conduct Shawangunk Ridge Floppy disk Nile crocodile Violin Animals in space Gramophone record Drill bit Stomach cancer Expert system Goby Thermoregulation Dog Poker jargon Bladderwort Yacht Ozone hole Strap-on dildo Fossil fuel power plant Omega-3 fatty acid Diving suit Fish and chips Aquaculture Saxophone Skateboarding trick Toyota Prius Bong Cyanide Knife Paragliding Cloud Shark Hash table
