why is my guppy acting like this i have guppies i was watching them before i went to bed last night i noticed that when of my guppy swam close to the other one the other one curved his body and started to jerk what does that mean i hope i am making sence are they both males if so they might be fighting or play fighting mine will often do a similar sort of thing it starts like this one male guppy will chase the other around for a while then the first will turn and face the second and they will hover or swim facing each other for a bit then one will dart forward to the side of one trying to nip its fin the other will bend its body into a curve to try to protect its fin and pull it out of reach and either jerk away quickly or swim around to try to nip the other guppy's fin either they will swim around in a little circle for a minute both with their bodies bent trying to nip each others' fins or one will give up and turn around and swim away and the chase will resume it's usually more play fighting than serious as none of my guppies have ever had seriously nipped fins or injuries and they do it all the time they are just very aggressive boys don't worry if they clamp their tails while they are in fight mode either it's not a sign of illness or stress they are just protecting their beautiful tails from being nipped if one is a male and one is a female they should not behave like this mating behavior is shown by the male guppy chasing the female and poking his nose at her gravid spot the dark spot just behind the curve of her belly they will mate by him rolling under her with his gonopodium pointy anal fin extended this is very quick and rarely actually seen you usually just see the male chasing the female around and poking at her gravid spot and sometimes flashing extending his gonopodium Aerial (dance move) Cat Diving Bottlenose Dolphin Platypus Professional wrestling holds Skateboarding trick Equine conformation Dog Unreal Puma American lobster Orgasm Poker jargon Breaststroke Glossary of ballet terms Professional wrestling throws Atlantic herring Suplex Front crawl Swingout Shark Dog training The Legend of Zelda series enemies Drowning Professional wrestling attacks Welding Parachuting Cheetah Elephant Fish anatomy Shaggy dog story Nile crocodile Dolphin USS Thresher (SS-200) Frogman Motility Electrophysiology Spider Anatomical terms of location Boxing USS Trigger (SS-237) Swimming House Mouse Orca Conker's Bad Fur Day B-47 Stratojet Xenomorph Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program Whale behaviour Spanking Snake Tag Gesture Humpback Whale Nip/Tuck Eye Milton H.
