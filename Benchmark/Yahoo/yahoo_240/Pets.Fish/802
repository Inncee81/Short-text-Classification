i received a betta as a gift it is in a container that is about gallon is that large enough for one betta i read they don't need oxygen to survive it has stones a nice plant it also has some stone like thing that it can swim thru how often do i clean the container i always feel sorry for those poor things that you see in the stores that are in those tiny square things this little guy seems happy but i read about them kept in larger aquariums with the filter system all i don't want to get into all that but i want the little guy to be happy healthy too any suggestions i also read that it is not good for them to be in the vases with the peace lily plant in it first of all bettas do need oxygen to survive but they don't need it pumped into the water to dissolve they breathe air from the surface which is why their containers should never be airtight although they should have lids as bettas are terrific jumpers for a one gallon tank you must clean it at least every or days one gallon of water accumulates waste very quickly so you have to be diligent about this he will be happy in gallon of water as long as you change the water frequently enough it's understandable if you don't want a huge tank with filtration it's difficult to explain this without getting into details about the whole nitrogen cycle but basically filters should only go in tanks that have been cycled trying to cycle a gallon tank will only throw things off balance because of the small amount of water so i would actually advise against filtering such a small tank however discipline when it comes to water changes is a must another important thing is heating bettas come from tropical climates and require a steady temperature in the high s fahrenheit the only way to ensure this is via a heater you can get junior heaters for gallon tanks so technically bettas do not need those large aquariums with elaborate filtration systems he will be happy in gallon unfiltered as long as you keep his water clean and heated however he will be happier in a larger tank maybe gallons and it'll also be less work for you less water changes so maybe you can consider that and you're right about the betta in a vase setup it is a torture device for them Marine aquarium Brewery Sewage treatment Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Fossil fuel power plant Autonomous building Fish farming Bong Dry cleaning Carburetor Solar power Reef tank Carbon dioxide Ocean thermal energy conversion Water purification Hard disk Apollo 13 Thermal power station Hydrogen economy Ecology Water Alcohol fuel Energy development Sun Biodiesel Sea-Monkey Renewable energy Diesel engine HVAC Hydroponics Rebreather Dwarf gourami Fire fighting Swimming pool Nuclear power Cannabis cultivation Pebble bed reactor Carnivorous plant Nuclear reactor E85 Diving Siphon Decompression sickness Dairy Transformer Environmental concerns with electricity generation Stirling engine Eutrophication Dishwasher Oxygen sensor Japanese tea ceremony Ozone depletion Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Fire extinguisher Air conditioning Thermostat Portable stove Gasoline Gas metal arc welding Sterilization (microbiology) Motor oil Kidney Sauna Fusion power Glossary of firefighting terms Turbocharger Gas compressor Carbon dioxide sink Fuel injection Theory of conduct Power station Jet engine Cold fusion Three Mile Island Vacuum tube Global warming and agriculture Entropy Wind power Ecology of Hong Kong Drowning Furnace Planetary habitability Nuclear fallout Earthworm Internal combustion engine Lung Vermicompost Glossary of firefighting equipment Biogeochemical cycle Welding Liquid breathing
