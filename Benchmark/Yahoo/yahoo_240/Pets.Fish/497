is the cycle from ammonia to nitrite to nitrate in a fish tank any different than what happens in a bowl just wondering if the pattern of a spike in ammonia then in nitrite and finally to nitrate happens in a bowl as well as a tank or is there something different about a tank that makes it more dangerous than a bowl if it is very different how can i ensure that my fish is safe without a water test kit he was a rescue fish and it was all i could do to afford the tank my mom insists that all the water testing isnt that necessary that usually goldfish do just fine and just watch him but i dont know if the bowl is large enough and you only do partial water changes you should see the same pattern unfortunately most bowls don't have a large water volume or a filter so you need to do frequent water changes they also don't have much area for gravel and since the gravel and filter media are where the bacteria live you usually never get a full cycle before the tank needs to be cleaned again so except for right after a water change there's almost always ammonia and or nitrite present so it's actually the tank that's safer since there's more area for gravel and you should only need to do partial water changes addition one way you can use to tell if the ammonia or nitrite is getting too high is to watch the behavior of your fish they may begin by gasping for air at the surface of the water even though you provide a filter or aeration in the tank they'll do this all the time not just when you're near the tank and show the same behavior by begging for food they may also sit at the bottom become lethargic and lose their appetite if you see these signs a water change may be in order see these links for assitional signs of ammonia and nitrite poisoning http freshaquarium about com cs disease p ammoniapoison htm http freshaquarium about com cs disease p nitritepoison htm Marine aquarium Sewage treatment Biogeochemical cycle Eutrophication Sodium nitrite Aquarium Hydrogen sulfide Ammonia Fish farming Goldfish Dry cleaning Nitrogen Autonomous building Bong Brewery Water Carburetor Shrimp farm Rebreather Cyanide Sea-Monkey Japanese tea ceremony Nitric acid Motorcycle Nitrogen cycle Curing Dairy Amyl nitrite Fossil fuel power plant E85 Thermal power station Hydrogen economy Agricultural wastewater treatment Airport Sterilization (microbiology) Ocean thermal energy conversion Diving cylinder Bacteria Water purification RuneScape quests Water (molecule) Soil pH Explosive material Ultraviolet Tank Biodiesel Refrigerator Flush toilet Fire fighting Axolotl Carbon dioxide Food preservation Foodborne illness Nitrous oxide Plankton Cocaine Fast bowling Anorexia nervosa Chopsticks Slow sand filter bed Ice core Bayesian inference Hydroponics Cellular respiration CANDU reactor E number Town gas Glacier Nutrient Ecology Glossary of wildland fire terms Koi Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Duesberg hypothesis Swimming Nuclear power Potassium nitrate Electrophysiology Diving Ammonium nitrate Soil life Desert Cannabis cultivation Septic tank Fountain Sun Origin of life Ecco the Dolphin Swimming pool Domestic rabbit Carnivorous plant Polarization Drainage Factory farming Fugu Earth's atmosphere Atlantic herring Nuclear fallout Copper First Battle of the Atlantic
