betta feeding i just bought a male betta for my daughter the people at petsmart told me that i should only feed it one or two grains of the betta food every two or three days since bettas have a problem with obesity the food itself says to feed every day my daughter is already horribly attached to her fish and i would hate myself if something happened to it can anyone with betta experience knowledge give me a little insight thank you i do have him in a tank with a filter and live plants i've had fish before just not this particular breed i know he won't live forever but i want to give him the best and longest life possible a betta's stomach is about as big as his eyeball you can give him little grains of betta food daily or every other day he'll eat as much as you feed him though so if you overfeed he will a get chubby and b excess nutrients will pass through him and foul the water a few things you should know if you really want to keep your betta as healthy and happy as possible for as long as possible you should get him at least a gallon tank with a filter and heater with thermostat he will be healthiest in water that stays stable at a temp somewhere between and degrees fahrenheit get into a habit of regular partial water changes every week using a gravel vac to clean a portion of the tank's gravel each time and be sure to remember to condition the new water and have it the same temp as the water in the tank as drastic temperature changes stress the fish and make him more susceptible to disease a tank is superior to a bowl for a lot of reasons first it's impossible to keep the water in a bowl at a stable temp there are no small tank or bowl heaters with thermostats just heaters that will raise the temp degrees from ambient which means if your house is degrees the betta will be and if your house goes up to on a hot day the betta will be not so good also bowls and smaller tanks don't really cycle that is they don't develop the biological filter the bacteria colonies that keep wastes from building up and making the water toxic you have to change too much of the water for a true cycle that means wastes build up rapidly and the water can get pretty toxic long before it looks bad so definitely at least a gallon tank is the minimum a betta needs for a healthy life and then be prepared the betta is the hamster of the aquatic pet they do not live very long years is usually the best you can hope for i've heard of people who say they've had them longer but that's unusual i think part of the problem is that they're awfully inbred breeders inbreed constantly to get those flashy tails and colors so i think they come with some built in health issues Marine aquarium Hamster Sewage treatment Diseases of the honeybee Domestic rabbit Ecology Goldfish Dairy Eutrophication Shrimp farm Dog Water Nutrition Thermal power station Cat Fish farming Discus (fish) Vitamin C Carnivorous plant Coffee Livestock House Mouse Raw food diet Brewery Solar power Factory farming Fugu Sea-Monkey Biodiesel Chicken Guinea pig HVAC Obesity Apollo 13 Energy development Myxobolus cerebralis Krill Foodborne illness Alcohol fuel Fossil fuel power plant Agriculture Axolotl Carburetor Tilapia Tobacco smoking Breastfeeding Health insurance Hard water Veganism Vegetarianism Dry cleaning Tocopherol Stomach cancer Nuclear power Dam Hydrogen sulfide Sorghum Hydrogen economy Water (molecule) Refrigerator Folic acid Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Reef tank Kashrut Carbon dioxide Organic food Hydroponics Fish Honeybee Dieting Animal testing Gray Wolf Chronic fatigue syndrome Plant breeding Equine conformation Rebreather Insulin Water purification Ozone depletion Koi Fancy rat Green Revolution Pet skunk Chopsticks Sexual reproduction Tooth enamel Welding Menstrual cycle Plutonium
