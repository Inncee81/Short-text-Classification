do betas need special food i have seen things like beta bites and beta chemicals in the pet stores are these just gimmicky items geared towards the ignorent consumer or do betas actually need to be eating special beta bites and be doused in chemicals in order to maintain health i keep my beta in a gallon tank with a couple crabs and a snail the tank has some conditioning salt added at water changes about a table spoon for the gallons of water in the tank i dont mind buying special food and chemicals for the beta because i want its living conditions to be as good as possable but i dont want to be a sucker and buy things i dont need either your betta does need special betta food mainly because he is a carnivore and requires a high protein diet unlike that of most other tropical fish some bettas will tolerate regular tropical fish flakes but only the real betta foods like bloodworms or betta bites hikari bio gold pellets provide him with the nutritional value he needs however you are completely right in saying that most of the betta medication betta housing and betta water conditioner products out there are complete gimmicks bettas have been increasing in popularity as pets but the individual fish are very cheap so pet stores try to reap a profit off the associated items instead for betta medication it's usually just regular medication that has been heavily diluted melafix and bettafix are great examples bettafix is just melafix watered down and i do believe it's quite a bit more expensive for betta housing pet stores take advantage of the betta's hardiness and sell things like pretty betta bowls that hold a fraction of the amount of water your betta would really thrive in the peace lily in a vase setup is a prime example it sells for a lot of money looks very nice but is a torture device for bettas as for betta water conditioner and betta salt and other so called necessary products it's the same stuff that's in all the other bottles just sold for a higher price the pet stores are targeting those new betta owners who don't know much about betta care there are quite a lot of them nowadays and think to themselves hmm i don't know which water conditioner to get better get this specialised betta one just to be safe you get the idea Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Hamster Microeconomics Marine aquarium Organic food Nutrition Fish farming Hydrogen economy Plastic Fugu Dieting Healthy eating Shrimp farm Sewage treatment Brewery Uranium Rice Japanese tea ceremony Sears Holdings Corporation Fancy rat Vegetarianism Veganism Breastfeeding Health insurance RuneScape skills Carnivorous plant Gross domestic product MapleStory Illegal drug trade Publicly funded medicine Coffee Alcohol fuel Insulin Trademark Milk MMORPG Biodiesel E85 Tilapia Diabetes mellitus Ecology Guild Wars Tocopherol Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Energy development Mosquito Final Fantasy XI Tax Sugar Solar power Pharmaceutical company Ferret Pet skunk Protein Tofu Kosher foods Inventory Raw food diet Dairy Dwarf gourami Famine Nuclear reactor Hypoglycemia Chocolate Food preservation Vitamin C Fish and chips Life insurance Hydroponics Neopets Ice cream Discus (fish) Shark Surplus value Environmental vegetarianism Gaia Online Capitalism Inflation Edible salt Insurance Atkins Nutritional Approach Food RuneScape Sea-Monkey Taxation in the United States Supply and demand Economy of the United States
