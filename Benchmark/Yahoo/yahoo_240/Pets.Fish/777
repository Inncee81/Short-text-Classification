how do i know if my aquarium has cycled i wanted to do a fishless cycling of my gal aquarium so i had filled it up connected my airpumps filters and increased the water temp to degrees i also dechlorinated the water with big al's dechorinator formula i have been dropping fish flakes in twice a day but i hadn't bought any water testing kit until yesterday when i tested the water after days of dropping in fish food the ammonia was and the nitrite was and the nitrate was and the ph was this morning before work i dropped in frozen shrimp because i'm not sure if it's possible for my readings to be zero because my aquarium is cycled or if it's because i haven't kick started the cycling process yet how is the best way to determine this without adding ammonia drops to the water what would you suggest i do i started adding fish food right away after filling it with water about days now do you think shrimp is enough to cycle a gallon tank it's not cycled you'll need to test it every few days but your ammonia will spike first then that will drop and your nitrites will spike then that'll drop and nitrates will show up when it's done cycling ammonia and nitrites will read ppm and you'll have nitrates showing you probably didn't add enough flake food to the tank i'm guessing the shrimp way is easier i'd recommend taking the shrimp put them in a mesh filter media bag buy at the pet store in the filter media section or a pair of pantyhose nylons with the foot leg cut off put the shrimp in that and knot it shut and drop it in the tank that'll keep the shrimp together as opposed to clouding up your tank and making a mess let it rot and eventually that'll put out ammonia the whole process takes about weeks to complete don't do any water changes during this time because there's no fish in there no need to just top off any water that evaporates and monitor those levels when it is done cycling remove the shrimp do a water change to get your nitrates under ppm and add your fish slowly soon after that and you can drop your temperature down i don't believe that has much affect on the cycle process put it to f or whatever temp the fish you plan on keeping prefer Marine aquarium Sewage treatment Ammonia Eutrophication Cyanide Fish farming Sea-Monkey Fishing Carburetor Goldfish Shrimp farm Thermal power station Hydrogen sulfide Ammonium nitrate Water Hydroponics Autonomous building Mattress Brewery Cannabis cultivation Refrigerator Cocaine Clownfish Dairy Ozone depletion Fossil fuel power plant Discus (fish) Internal ballistics Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Ocean thermal energy conversion Temperature Biodiesel Explosive material Ice core E85 Illegal drug trade Biogeochemical cycle Textile manufacturing Carbon dioxide Ozone hole Hydrogen economy Rebreather Antarctic krill Tilapia Axolotl Nitric acid Hard water Coffee Dry cleaning Krill Earth's atmosphere Reef tank Tofu Extreme Programming Food preservation Diseases of the honeybee Shaggy dog story Potassium nitrate Moon Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Oplan Bojinka Fish Electrophysiology Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Fire fighting Menstrual cycle Soil pH StarCraft: Uprising Poker jargon Ham Tank Nuclear power Hard disk Climate change Aluminium Mercury Atlas 6 Wheel of Fortune Motor oil Sun Bong Angling Thermoregulation Tooth enamel Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster PID controller Solar variation Gas mantle Sonar Water purification Paragliding Toyota Prius Laserdisc
