fish seems to be dying i have feeder goldfish for over two years one is slightly larger than the other and seems to have always had a few health problems but usually bounces back with time this time he really looks bad and seems to be suffering he is twisting and twirling around in the tank and has been face down tail up in the gravel since last night he is still using his gills but it looks like the end is there something i can or should do to ease his passing the most humane way to euthanize goldfish or any other pet fish is to use oil of clove it's usually available at any health food vitamin store just ask as sometimes they keep it behind the counter i paid for my last bottle clove oil when added to water anesthesizes the fish and puts them to sleep here are the directions put your sick dying fish in a gallon bucket pail or jar filled with clean dechlorinated water usually water from their tank and or pond take a small jar with a lid and fill halfway with water add to this small jar about drops of the clove oil put the lid on the small jar and shake vigorously you want the oil to mix with the water as much as possible this is what you call emulsifying the oil once the clove oil is mixed extremely well open the small jar and pour the water oil mixture into the the bucket pail with the fish gently stir so the oil water mixture is completely mixed with the water but don't scare the fish the fish will slowly fall asleep and gill activity will cease after about minutes go check on your fish watch it for at least minutes to make sure the gill movements are completely still that the fish has in fact died this procedure is recommended by vets and humane societies in fact some vets use this method to do surgery on expensive fish such as koi of course they use less drops and when these anesthesized fish are placed back in fresh water no clove oil they usually recover from their slumber quickly people say to kill their fish by other means but all those other ways bring needless pain and fear to those tiny fishey lives freezing slow freezing causes ice crystals to form in their bodies they are extremely painful to the fish especially if it was happening in the dark of a freezer would you want to go through that putting them into rubbing alcohol yes it kills them instantly but the alcohol burns their gills so much it's liks someone pouring rubbing alcohol down your nose and throat burns all the way down needless pain for these little critters of god cutting their heads off don't you all remember the french guillotine they banned it for its inhumanity for a reason squashing them how would you like to be squashed being flushed does flushing really kill them immediatly maybe yes maybe no it does put them in a terrible environment in the deepest dark just think how you would like to be flushed down a toilet suddenly plunged into ice cold water whirled and sucked downward into darkness not knowing where you were gonna end up then plunging into acidic water a sewage system filled with who knows what rats excrement you can't breathe you can't see the last few minutes of your life are utter agony utter turmoil you don't know what you did wrong you honored your god for years with loyalty and this is how they reward you as you slowly suffocate to death in the innards of some city's sewer system shame on those who flush live fish down toilets shame on you do the humane thing use clove oil to treat your fishy friends to a humane death ken Sewage treatment Cat Blood (computer game) Breastfeeding Tea Bong Water Poker jargon Ice cream Autonomous building Sento Cocaine Sin City Carbon dioxide Carburetor Shaggy dog story Tlingit Urinary incontinence Dairy Sea-Monkey Flush toilet Japanese toilet Brewery Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Amber Spyglass Capital punishment Food preservation Guinea pig Fecal incontinence Coffee Fish farming Polychlorinated biphenyl Naruto jutsu Fancy rat Ecco the Dolphin Fire fighting Suicide methods Siphon Mayonnaise E85 Fire extinguisher Conspiracy (TNG episode) Thermal power station Ferret Prostate cancer Kain (Legacy of Kain) Toilet humour Hamster Drill bit Happy Tree Friends Acne Rebreather RuneScape quests Sake The Shining (film) Marine aquarium Tocopherol Hydrogen peroxide Simone Weil Toilet Wine Professional wrestling throws Drowning Internal ballistics Shark Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Kosher foods Beer Kashrut Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Immortality Menstrual cup Tattoo Sulfuric acid Aquarium Axolotl Sleep Yoga Sutras of Patanjali First aid Plastic Traumatic brain injury Glossary of climbing terms YuYu Hakusho Angel Sanctuary Methamphetamine Diving Peanut butter Water (molecule) Pneumonia Futurama (TV series - season 5) Whaling CPU cache
