considering selling mark avon i am i am looking for a good job to make a little extra money i love the idea of working at home and i love makeup so this seems like my ideal job but i have a few questions and i can't seem to find the answers on their website so if there are any reps i would greatly appreciate your help ok so there is a start up fee what do you get because that is one weeks allowance lol and do i have to buy products in advance and hope they sell and if they don't do i lose money or do i order them as i need them also i have lots of friends in different states i would love to sell to but i saw something about having to deliver the orders is it not a possibility to mail them or have them mailed and one last thing can i sell on ebay or on a website thanks in advance for any help thank you but i don't think that arbonne is for me fist of all it is waaay to overpriced for me to believe i can sell it to my teenage friends lol and as i stated i am only so i don't exactly have a resume to send in so i think i'll stick with considering mark but thanks again well i use to sell avon for about months they give you a few brochures to start you out with samples and usually a little gift i am and thought avon would be a good thing for me but it got too overwhelming if you plan on only selling part time then you have to keep in mind that you pay for your brochures usually samples and that is per campaign weeks long now im not too familiar with mark but i am assuming it is pretty much the same thing i would try it out and take advantage of the breaks they give you during your first couple of campaigns if you dont like it you can quit and you can mail the products to your friends the only problem is pigger items can add up i sell on ebay and you are not sappose to sell on ebay i never bought products that i did not know i was going to sell so you dont get stuck with a bunch of stuff another thing about ebay is that you will ne lucky if you make half of what you would get from selling to people around you mark is more expensive so it may be a little harder to sell but if you sell to people in your age group and know a lot of people i think it will work out for you good luck hopefully everything works out for you arbonne is soooo expensive and for older people their products are like on average vs with avon you will get stuck in a bad situation of u go through arbonne plus idk if u can be and work through their business since you cant sell on ebay restrictions and you can get in trouble advertise on myspace personal web site facebook make business cards if your bday is not that much further i would suggest waiting and selling with avon directly hopefully i helped you out Internet fraud Social rule Advance fee fraud Bulk vending Neopets Wal-Mart Theory of conduct Poker jargon Unemployment Electronic commerce EastEnders Nine Inch Nails The Apprentice 2 Extreme Programming Amazon.com RuneScape quests Jennifer Lopez Dot-com 2000 Australian Grand Prix The Amazing Race Microeconomics Quarashi Network effect Avenue Q Facebook (website) Mutual fund RuneScape cheats Time Out of Mind Mail fraud Web traffic Surveillance Spice Girls April Fool's Day FairTax Pitaten Shen Gong Wu EverQuest Make money fast Craps Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Blonde on Blonde Advertising Best Buy Meat Loaf The nature of God in Western theology Little Britain MoveOn Married... with Children Cruising (maritime) Animal Crossing Final Fantasy XI Star Trek Customizable Card Game Externality Carl Barks MapleStory Apple Macintosh GED Gross domestic product Scientology beliefs and practices Sampling (music) Value added tax Arianne United States Postal Service Betting (poker) Socrates Ty Cobb $ale of the Century IBM PC compatible RuneScape economy Theodore Kaczynski Pretty Good Privacy New Coke NeXT Great Teacher Onizuka Illegal drug trade Leeds United F.C.
