ebay seller dilemma should i just give a refund i had something listed on ebay a few days ago someone bought it with buy it now option on sunday evening however i had to leave town on saturday due to a family emergency and i don't think i can get back for days so i can't ship out the merchandise for awhile should i just give a refund he paid thru paypal right away will i still have to pay fees associated with that for ebay and paypal i'm a new seller to ebay so i'm not too familiar with paypal and refunds and the buyer is a new member with feed back so i don't know how he'll react to the whole thing or understand what i am trying to do or how to get the refund back once his paypal is credited any advice omg the same thing happened to me i had to leave town suddenly due to a family emergency while my auction still had more days and the buyer used buy it now i said to myself what am i going to do because i have positive feedback and didn't want to get any negative what i did was tell the buyer the truth as to why the shipping would be delayed and offered to give him of his purchase price back to his paypal account if he was willing to wait he wasn't happy but understood my situation if you really want to avoid negative feedback my suggestion to you would to tell the buyer the truth and offer him her what i did or give the buyer their refund plus an additional dollars for the inconvience to the buyer many e bayers are very understanding but being that you are both new to the ebay experience i would tell him her the truth and give your buyer some sort of a price break option to avoid negative feeback especially if you plan to use ebay more often in the future hope this helps jackie PayPal Internet fraud Dot-com Auction Microeconomics Electronic commerce Short selling Stock Arbitrage Option Taxation in the United States Something Awful Liberty Dollar Call option Mortgage Topps Wal-Mart Neopets Economics Stock market Contract Enron Corporation Live 8 Something Awful Forums Put option Margin (finance) Philatelic investment Predatory lending Derivative (finance) Reputation management Bulk vending MMORPG Otakon ITunes Music Store Phishing Amazon.com Real estate broker Billboard Hot 100 Product (business) Advance fee fraud ROM image Gold as an investment EFTPOS UK Singles Chart Dividend Nine Inch Nails Insurance Health insurance Limp Bizkit Hire purchase Illegal drug trade Extreme Programming The Star Wars Holiday Special Mozilla Firefox New York Stock Exchange Gross domestic product Security (finance) Online auction business model 2005 United States Grand Prix London Congestion Charge MapleStory Monopsony Day trading Happiness CBS Deflation (economics) Commodity Marketing Islamic banking Tax Traumatic incident reduction Skype Autograph Inventory Calvin and Hobbes African American Vernacular English Trading Places Feedback Reverse auction She Loves You Poker jargon Conveyancing Costco Philosophical skepticism Option style Gold standard Wheel of Fortune Progressive tax EastEnders
