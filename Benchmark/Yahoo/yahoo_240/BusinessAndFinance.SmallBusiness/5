dog bakery business my friend and i want to start our own dog bakery business we have already chosen a tentative name and have come up with lots of ideas for the types of treats we would make we also have some possible recipes and we found some good dog themed cookie cutters to use we've even started working on a logo does anyone have any advice about getting this business off the ground advice on any aspect of the business would be appreciated why on earth do you think i'm not old enough for your information i'm going to be turning in a week and even if i wasn't your answer is completely useless gerald ynot means well but avoid score u get what you pay for baking these cookies and asking local groomers small ones to put them on their counter and pay you if someone buys them is a great way to start if you do this make sure there is ordering information on your packaging something as simple as a logo and a website would work if you have or get a website to plug a great opportunity for pr would be to take some down to the pound for free and get the associated press involved their number is listed and if they do the story all local media outlets can run a little story on you and finally to keep money coming in while youre growing your business and financing it i'd suggest leaving a price list and a sample treat with your neighbors or even somebody elses neighbors as the business grows you can contact businesses with the same target market ie pooper scoopers and ask them to leave a doorhanger on their customers houses when they visit either in exchange for sending business back to them or set up a referral program sorry the answer was so long good luck to you Economics Extreme Programming Bread Neopets Donald Rumsfeld Girl Scout cookies Microeconomics Mutual fund Wheel of Fortune Piccolo Junior Saga Contract Dog training Monopoly (game) Windows 2000 Plame affair Retailer The Apprentice 2 Money Marketing Microsoft United Kingdom corporation tax Cuisine of Denmark Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Sears Holdings Corporation Incarnations of Immortality Supply and demand Surveillance Google Home Box Office Gross domestic product Cookie Dog agility Monetary policy HTTP cookie $ale of the Century Investment bank Asian financial crisis Deflation (economics) Philosophy of business Advertising Arbitrage Keynesian economics Craps Illegal drug trade Capital accumulation Bond Shaggy dog story Animal Crossing Wal-Mart Web analytics Avenue Q Great Depression Search engine optimization Management System/36 Copy protection Interest Stock Computer virus Supply-side economics Cooperative Price discrimination Gold standard The Lovely Bones Spyware April Fool's Day CPU design Mozilla Firefox J Sainsbury Mortgage McKee Foods Corporation Tenshinhan FairTax Game show Sicilian Expedition Hospitality service Fast bowling Sam Walton Pound sterling Business GSM services Charles Goodyear American Football League Modem Copyleft Option 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Information Services Procurement Library Ashton-Tate Musical Instrument Digital Interface Legal research EastEnders Economy of the United States
