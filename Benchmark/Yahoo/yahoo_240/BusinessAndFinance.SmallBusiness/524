i need a company name for a welding business me and my husband are trying to start a business of our own and i am having a hard time coming up with a company name that i like if any one has any ideas it would be greatly appreciated whats your last name is it something catchy you can base something off of that for example lets say your last name is johnson you could be johnson inc johnson metals johnson industries or you can base it off something like a shortened last name jonco inc jonco metals etc or maybe even initials work sometimes you can use your maiden names too j s welding another good tactic is to look at competitors and other welding parties and steal similar names emulation is the key to sucess look at microsoft for example everything they do is copied off of another company's sucess with a subpar heavy advertised product and for the love of god don't have a corny name like wields r us that is very unprofessional nobody will subcontract work out to you with a name like that in fact i would suggest trying to sound as professional as possible i know the metal fabrication company i worked with always contracted private certified aluminum welders for some of their work i doubt they went to people with cheesy names Welding Microsoft Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Arc welding Fabrication (metal) Gas tungsten arc welding Microsoft Windows Heavy metal music Aluminium Shielded metal arc welding Metallurgy Common criticisms of Microsoft Floppy disk MS-DOS Therion (band) Brazing Trusted computing Sword making Weldability Iron Maiden Windows 2000 Metalworking Knife Grill Tokusatsu Insurance Alcoa Halo (video game series) Sweatshop Natural Selection (computer game) Black Sabbath FLCL Homebuilt aircraft Def Leppard Stainless steel The Apprentice 2 Windows XP Doom metal Death metal The Kinks Video game music Power metal Natural monopoly Mac OS X Judas Priest Grunge music Procter & Gamble Relationship marketing Xbox T-34 SCO-Linux controversies Pioneer Zephyr Apple Computer Helium Trademark Coca-Cola MSX AC/DC Stardock Industrial engineering Dot-com Hardcore punk Kitsch Heinkel He 112 Acronym and initialism Spring operating system X Window System Titanium Douglas Adams Authorship of the Pauline epistles Eastern span replacement of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Digital Equipment Corporation Welding power supply Plame affair Laser beam welding Intellectual property Investment bank Killian documents Douglas DC-8 Metal music Deck (ship) Corrosion Tungsten Oxyacetylene Commodore 64 Electronic Arts IBM Bruce Dickinson Plasma arc welding Fear, uncertainty and doubt IBM PC compatible Star Trek Customizable Card Game Final Fantasy XI Roxette ISO 9000 History of Microsoft Windows Diablo II: Lord of Destruction MP3 Atari ST
