husband not including me in new business legalities implications my husband may be aquiring a business that he is currently working for the loan to purchase the business would be all inclusive with the business so it's no out of pocket expense for us it is a very complicated type of business that deals with legal stuff that i don't know much about he doesn't seem to like the idea of including me on the documents or making me a owner of the corporation he seems to think that i need to work there and we both know that we shouldn't work together what are the financial implications and legalities for further down the road if he owns this corporation i assume it would mean that he owns of the shares but where does that leave me as his spouse what if something happens to him what if the business goes under ect i do not think there are any major problems with him not including you in the family business he should draw up a document with an attorney to have a beneficiary who will receive x percentage of what's been saved this could include you children family or anyone he wants to give his saved money to if something were to happen to him this should be kept by the attorney with copies kept by both of you in several states a marriage is sharing so even though he can choose not to share his business the shares of stock would be shared between you meaning if you were to divorce you could theoretically ask to receive percent share this totally depends on the state in which you reside after my aunt divorced my uncle he was entitled to percent of her retirement that she had saved so even if his business is in his name only you would be sharing the income as husband and wife if the business goes under this will reflect on your credit just as much as it will his he should definitely file a will to make sure you are covered if something should occur and also where this would leave the business as well i unfortunately do not have a law degree but i know that in many states what is one spouses the other one has a part in i'm just not sure how a divorce would affect things if you are left off of owning the company if you both owned the business then it would likely be sold and the profit would be divided between you if you do not have a share in it he will still likely be required to pay you a portion of the profits Insurance Divorce Taxation in the United States Stock Marriage Social Security (United States) Capitalism Life insurance Credit card Corporation Mutual fund Intellectual property Capital accumulation Concurrent estate Annuity FairTax Citigroup Bank Dividend Enron Corporation Trust (Law) USA Rupert Murdoch Mergers and acquisitions Tax Islamic banking Wal-Mart Security (finance) British Royal Family Surplus value Bond Cooperative Anarchism and capitalism Gross domestic product SCO-Linux controversies Common-law marriage Finance Family Corporate finance Short selling Same-sex marriage Privatization Flat tax Deflation (economics) Child support Warren Buffett Corporate governance Temasek Holdings Progressive tax Trust (Law) non-USA Financial services Polyamory Keynesian economics Same-sex marriage in Canada Inflation Public domain Labor theory of value Copyright Amendments to the Constitution of Ireland Plame affair Mortgage Wells Fargo Trademark Asian financial crisis Economy of Russia Amway Common criticisms of Microsoft Oil-for-Food Programme Eliot Spitzer Theory of conduct Digital rights management Supply and demand Donald Trump Karl Rove Arbitrage Royal Dutch Shell Bruce Johnson No-fault divorce Attorney at Law Money Federal Reserve Algerian Family Code Alimony Wealth Free trade Debt Great Depression Ownership
