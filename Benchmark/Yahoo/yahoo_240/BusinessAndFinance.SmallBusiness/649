to my customers i created a myspace page i have friends on my page but no orders how can i get online and sell this stuff anyone know about marketing and such for this type of business i even posted on craigslist i just found a new site i posted on gohuman i created all these pages and they took time and alot of work and i got nothing can someone help me i am constanly looking online of how i can do better with this i am really looking for customers to order online but ether way would be great help see my page www myspace com avon i did mary kay for several years and have several friends doing similar home based sales there are a couple of things that pop out when it comes to getting customers the net is a great way for people to find you and contact you for some home based sales though it isn't always the best way to accumulate sales most of the companies like avon will see online to anyone wihout needing to use a rep as a way into the system so what you may want to do is start a rewards program for your customers you can make up small cards on your home printer and for each purchase of so many dollars they get a stamp after making a certain number of stamps they can either get a small product for free or a discount on the next purchase keep track of all this for tax reasons if they order online they get one extra stamp each time this will provide incentive for using your website also if avon's company site does allow customers to attribute the sale to specific reps be sure all you customers have the needed id or information include it on the back of your books mary kay reps are expected to be appropriately dressed and made up for any situation where they could encounter a new customer basically any time we left the house in was ingrained that we always carry cards catalogs or the latest sale flyers and some small sample my group leader told us to leave cards and give them out to everyone waitresses the girl at the pharmacy the woman we spoke to inline at the grocery store if anyone commented on our makeup scent or skin we would mention the product we used and offer a sample it seems a bit pushy but let me tell you it worked i got more orders that way especially for things like lotions and hair care products find your niche a lot of the most successful reps work with certain groups at first if you're a stay at home mom who knows other stay at home mom's do a spa day using any of the appropriate products be sure to have a disply set up of any products good for kids such as sun tan lotion bug repellant child friendly shampoos if you work in an office pass out brochures and include a note on the desk freshen up pack deoderant face powder hand lotion etc work out what would best suit your workplace design the set and price it i had a very unusual niche drag queens i lived in an area with a large gay community and these guys loved having someone come to them and teach them about skin care and makeup i made a killing every time they ordered the point is use the contacts you have to build up the group you can really market yourself to that will lead into an ever wider circle of orders spouse shopping services are really helpful many spouses want to get thier sweeties some of your products but have no idea what their wives may order or how to get it around every female oriented holiday send letters out to the spouses reminding them that you would be more than happy to help them put together fabulous gift baskets now to do this you really need to keep track of what your regular customers order but it can be worth it the big trick is exsposure hang catalogs on every house on your street and another two streets in your neighborhood switch streets every so often but always put a catalog on the door of anyone who even contacted you a sign on your front yard if allowed by your hoa and one of those lovely magnet signs for your care are inexspensive ways to let folks know you're out there if you have kids in school see if you can come up with a fundraiser to do with them set up display tables and bring along any items youhave stocked for immediate sale to any holiday bazaars church sales or local fleamarkets the more you do to get known the more people you will reach good luck ps one other thing you may want to consider moving your page to a place like yahoo or even purchasing a site of your own someplace it is not exspensive the problem with myspace is twofold one you have to register to access the pages which many customers simply won't want to do and the other is the reputation of the site my bet is you are putting off a fair number of people because of it Sears Holdings Corporation Electronic commerce Wal-Mart Tesco Poker jargon Loyalty program FairTax Best Buy United States
