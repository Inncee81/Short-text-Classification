should i be not happy my one friend is a slacker when we work i ask him to do a favor and then i get stuck doing it because he had to do something else i don't think he's taking advantage of me but i always give him rides while were out and we hang out and get along good but when it comes to work he'll never do the job and i think it will be a pain for him in the real world however he's a nice guy and i like him as a person but as a worker man he sucks after tonight doing his job for me and dosen't get why i'm semi mad at him well not mad just not happy at all should i be not happy about this situation ps none of the managers even see this even when they watch them work there kind of dumb to realize it i just hope to leave this place soon you should talk to your friend if he'd be actually listen tell him how you feel and let him know that it's not okay and it upsets you which it should because you end up doing more work than he does when it should be equal if this is the same friend that won't chip in for gas then you definitely need to confront him and tell him everything that's bothering you if he's a real friend he'll listen and try to help out more at work and stuff hope this helps good luck em Grandview, U.S.A.
