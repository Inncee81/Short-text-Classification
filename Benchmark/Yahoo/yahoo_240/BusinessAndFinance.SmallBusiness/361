how can i start my own buisness in photography im start learning now practice research and play with ideas when i was your age i wanted to start a business also at that time i never could have imagined that there was so much information out there so many things to learn build up your passion for what you want to do and be patient despite your limited opportunities now in the meantime while you're practicing and learning try to do small scale operations i've never done photography but depending on what you do i'm sure you can find something to offer the general idea is to consider what need someone else has and how you can apply your skills to help with that need considering you'll have no room for an advertising budget use word of mouth or flyers to advertise tell people what you're offering show them examples of what you have done the more you do the more you have to show and the more likely they'll see something they like don't be shy about it and don't be afraid to have people say they aren't interested you never know who might say they are consider making your own free website using simple templates and some creativity a lot of people will find it convenient to be able to see your photography portfolio online sorry i can't offer more specific ideas but i simply don't know enough about what you're doing good luck with your business Theory of conduct Microeconomics Copyleft Advertising Milton H.
