i am trying to open an adult store for women and have questions i am a retail manager my father brothers and one sister have all opened businesses of every type so i have experience in retail and an experienced group of people who know about most everything about opening a business the only thing we are not fully knowledgable about is the legal aspects of opening an adult store in my area so far we've found out that the government in my area has made it pretty much impossible to open this type of store here the way they did it was they assigned a particular zone for anything adult commercial but this zone is very small and in the middle of nowhere or in a swamp i know i need to talk to a lawyer but i dont have enough money for that only enough for opening the store any ideas on how i can fight this on a very low budget i would sell online zoning gets very complicated if you don't have the money have you thought of doing adult parties for women and going to them so they can pay you for coming to their house and sell toys there at least you would save money on buying a place and then when you are financially ready you can buy a better building and pay a lawyer to work out the legal language Electronic commerce Corporation Wal-Mart Infantilism Divorce Monetary policy Retailer Publishing Microeconomics Citigroup Contract Copyleft Keynesian economics Economics Investment bank Anime Bank Commodore International Mortgage Motion picture rating system Business RuneScape locations The Sims FairTax Child sexuality Philatelic investment The Apprentice 2 Personal finance Tesco Leasing Cigarette MMORPG Cooperative Construction Annuity Gross domestic product Insurance Economy of Russia U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Internet fraud Sears Holdings Corporation Day trading Make money fast Division of labour Great Depression Unemployment Mastertronic Credit card History of intersex surgery American individualist anarchism Supermarket Inflation Money supply 2005 trial of Michael Jackson RuneScape economy Microsoft Inventory Illegal drug trade Fry's Electronics Security (finance) Islamic banking Steve Jobs Charles Goodyear Indian Railways Animal Crossing Eaton's Mutual fund Avenue Q Finance Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act EverQuest Sam Walton Badly Drawn Kitties Human Housing cooperative Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Urban sprawl Amway Prostitution Video game controversy Video game crash of 1983 Unreformed House of Commons Scouting Pyramid scheme Enron Corporation United Kingdom corporation tax Woodward's Capitalism Fat Man and Little Boy (Simpsons) For Better or For Worse Marvel Comics Target Corporation Court system of Canada RuneScape cheats Estoppel Auction Aldi Transsexuality Vivian Solon
