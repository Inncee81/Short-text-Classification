ebay money order question ok i want to buy a item off ebay and i am goin to pay by money order what i want to know is how does the seller know where to ship the item and how would u use the money order to buy it ebay automatically sends an email to the seller and buyer stating the item has been sold and shows names addresses make sure the seller accepts money orders if the auction doesn't state this and you're not sure ask the seller i know a lot of people will recommend paypal me being one of them but i realize some buyers like yourself have your reasons for not doing so and that's ok there are a lot of sellers that refuse to use paypal too the best way to tell if a seller is honest is to check their feedback if the comments have legitimate complaints and an unusually high amount of negative feedback then keep looking always trust your intuition if something smells fishy make sure you buy from someone within your country so if the transaction goes sour you have more legal grounds to get your money back take into consideration the total cost final sale and shipping to see if it's in line with what you're willing to spend before bidding make sure you read the product description thoroughly before buying so you understand exactly what you're getting how the seller ships when they ship and how much shipping is going to cost if you have questions about the item contact the seller to see what their response time is like if they don't bother responding at all then you'll have a harder time getting hold of them if something goes wrong contact the seller before bidding to make sure they accept money orders if it doesn't already say that in the auction when you send a money order try to do it within hours because it can still take up to a week for it to get to the seller then it'll take another days before you get the item delivered if you are unable to do that send a courtesy email to the seller and let them know when you do plan on sending it so they don't get upset and file an unpaid item report on you after days so don't bid on something you need right away keep in mind that you don't have the buyer protection with money orders that you do with electronic transactions kind of a given but i still had to throw that in anyway because electronic transactions are much easier to trace i have almost a thousand positive feedback between being a buyer and seller and i can tell you that sellers have a harder time with honest buyers than the other way around i've never had a problem buying but boy can i tell you stuff about selling if you heed my advice above you'll do fine and you'll be glad to find another way to feed your hobbies good luck Advance fee fraud Microeconomics Supply and demand PayPal Auction Electronic commerce Capitalism Bulk vending Contract Short selling Live 8 Phishing Mutual fund Surveillance Neopets Something Awful Arbitrage Theory of conduct Oil-for-Food Programme Illegal drug trade Futures contract Surplus value Plame affair The Apprentice 2 Mortgage Tax Real estate broker Inventory E-mail spam RuneScape cheats E-mail Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act MMORPG Wal-Mart Derivative (finance) Liberty Dollar Life insurance Warranty Economics Domain Name System Online auction business model Final Fantasy XI Amazon.com FairTax Hyperinflation Spam Prevention Early Warning System Social rule Price discrimination Option Advertising Usury Something Awful Forums Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Stock Mail fraud Best Buy United States Postal Service ITunes Music Store 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Enron Corporation Extreme Programming Spam (electronic) Call option Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Ra (board game) Dot-com Hard disk Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Day trading Commodity Labor theory of value ROM image Financial markets Insurance Gross domestic product On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Mergers and acquisitions Insider trading Nicomachean Ethics Stopping e-mail abuse Business-to-consumer electronic commerce Scientology beliefs and practices Privatization Network effect Credit card Conveyancing Publishing Copyright infringement of software Public domain MapleStory Sales Hire purchase
