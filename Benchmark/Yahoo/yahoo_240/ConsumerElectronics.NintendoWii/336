what wii game should i get i am toying between wario ware smooth moves and zelda twilight princess twilight princess by far it's a great adventure game the graphics are pretty good nice handling with the wii remote if you do buy the game don't save in the big cannon room you'll know what i'm talking about when you get there if you haven't already read about it though i suggest you get that game unless you like doing mini games until you get bored which really isn't that fun o so twilight princess all the way it's a good adventure and an interesting twist in the story line The Legend of Zelda series Wario Princess Zelda Game Boy Advance Nintendo The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess Link (Legend of Zelda) The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker Super Mario 64 DS The Legend of Zelda series characters The Legend of Zelda series enemies Wario Land 4 The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time places Legend of Zelda series songs The Twilight Zone The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening Nintendo Power Aladdin (1992 film) Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Nintendo GameCube Super Mario 64 The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Theory of conduct Koji Kondo The Legend of Zelda Kender Interactive fiction Expanded Universe (Star Wars) Supergirl The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time characters Master Sword True Crime: Streets of LA Computer and video games Kodocha Ganon Disney's California Adventure BS Zelda: Kodai no Sekiban The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker characters Mario series enemies Dean Koontz Mario WarioWare: Touched!
