is the wii's internet browser better than the ps 's i'm not too big a fan of the ps browser it's too frustrating trying to input letters what about you ughh honestly the wii is really frustrating to input letters too it's super slow because the keyboard is spread out through the entire screen and the sensor isn't quite as keen as it should be so it takes a while to get everything in there other than that the picture is great and the speed is good at my house but i guess that would depend on your isp also i really like the fact that the favorites are conveniently located at the bottom of the screen and are easy to get to if you have certain sites you always go to it's perfect hope this helps Mouse (computing) Password Cangjie method Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Danger Hiptop Sega Dreamcast World Wide Web Computer Brainfuck Tribes 2 Keyboard layout Dance Dance Revolution Unicode Internet Explorer Cross site scripting International Phonetic Alphabet PlayStation Portable GunBound GIF X Window System Computer and video game genres Digital photography Beatmania IIDX Cascading Style Sheets Theory of conduct Game programmer Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Spyware Prank flash Copy protection Internet privacy Manual transmission Opera (web browser) Arabic alphabet Screenshot Pump It Up Sega Saturn Bubble Bobble DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution Macromedia Flash Star Destroyer In The Groove (game) AutoComplete Super Nintendo Entertainment System HTML editor Starsiege: Tribes Favicon Internet service provider Law of value Spam (electronic) Unicode and HTML Screenplay Prolog User interface Logo programming language Fast bowling Machinima Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Color CPU cache Computer accessibility Blue screen of death DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution Broadband Internet access Electronic amplifier The Internet Movie Database Uniform Resource Locator Commodore BASIC Drifting (motorsport) Forth programming language Game show DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Internet troll Halting problem Computer keyboard Internet Netscape Communications Corporation Nintendo DS Netscape Navigator Final Fantasy Function (mathematics) Browser wars Emacs Windows XP Stereoscopy Speech recognition Bulgarian language XForms Hangul Chicago White Sox Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis RuneScape cheats Dave Matthews Band MySpace Konami Code Dvorak Simplified Keyboard E-mail Columbia Pictures Jumpstart 3rd Grade
