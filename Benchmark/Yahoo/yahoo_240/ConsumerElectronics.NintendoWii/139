ds web browser im about to get the web browser tomorrow and im just wondering can you get banned from a site like right now im using my computer and my ip is banned from a site to connect to the internet from a ds you need to wirelessly connect to do this you probably already have a router installed so that devices can access your home network as with all other devices on the home network that you have the ds will have the same ip address as any of the other devices so if your computer whose ip address has been banned from a certain site your ds will also be banned from using it if both devices recieve their internet from the same isp in the same house connected to the same wireless network hope this helps Denial-of-service attack Wi-Fi Router Network address translation Windows XP Internet privacy Internet service provider Wireless access point Wireless LAN USB flash drive Proxy server Spyware Web browser Wireless Bluetooth Internet Computer America Online IP address Wireless Application Protocol Netscape Navigator Prodigy (ISP) Server History of the Internet Telegraphy Cisco Systems Opera (web browser) Password PlayStation Portable Domain Name System Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Transmission Control Protocol E-mail spam Local area network MAC address Universal Plug and Play Kazaa Distributed computing Stopping e-mail abuse Uniform Resource Locator GameFAQs Web application HTTP cookie Universal Serial Bus Broadband Internet access Common Unix Printing System Microbrowser Novell NetWare Firewall (networking) Power line communication Windows Server 2003 Website HomePNA Macromedia Flash Internet security Ethernet CompuServe Digital Subscriber Line Web design Wireless network X Window System MSN TV Internet protocol suite Internet Group Management Protocol Comparison of web browsers Internet censorship in mainland China Danger Hiptop Web hosting AirPort Internet Explorer General Packet Radio Service Uploading and downloading Streaming media Mouse (computing) Linux Tor (anonymity network) E-mail IPv4 Netscape Communications Corporation World Wide Web History of Microsoft Windows File system Email authentication Pop-up ad Grid computing Communications protocol Hyperlink Open mail relay Browser wars Routing Virtual hosting Wireless mesh network BT Group plc Usenet Modem Malware Computer surveillance Videoconferencing BlackBerry
