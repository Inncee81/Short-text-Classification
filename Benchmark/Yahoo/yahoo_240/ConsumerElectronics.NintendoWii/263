why do people think that the wii only has little kid games the wii has games like resident evil scarface the godfather farcry call of duty prince of persia red steel medal of honor metroid mortal kombat super smash bros and those are the ones off the top of my head i am sure there are others sure most of the games are family friendly but not all of them thank you many people think that all nintendo systems are kiddy systems why first let's look at nintendo itself that company is probably the best when it comes to making great games to support their systems but all the games they make for their systems are kiddy the marios the yoshis the super smash bros wii sports yes nintendo did make metroid prime but that still is seen by many to be not that much of a violent game and more of a year old i hate the world type of game don't get me wrong there are many parents and adults that enjoy playing mario and yoshi and mario kart and super smash bros but they need some games that quench their thirst for some great violent rated m games they made over games for the gamecube and less than were rated m and over were rated e the n only saw games and only less than were rated m yes the n saw some great violent games like goldeneye and perfect dark but those years and the company that made those games are long gone secondly nintendo have major licensing issues yes they are better than sony when it comes down to licensing and exclusives but they still need a lot of work the wii will never see a gta iv or the darkness or devil may cry because their a bit snooty and because of it they lose quality games although the wii is racking up more sales than the ps and the wii has been sold out for almost a year in the long run wii will rank nd place in sales at then end of this war nintendo hasn't been first since the super nintendo and they are praying and hoping of getting back on top one last time before they end up like sega making games for systems instead of making systems themselves it would be heartbreaking playing super mario bros th anniversary on the playstation and xbox but i personally think that there are some great adult games for the wii many people are lazy now days and they don't research things before buying they just see some commercial and buy it but research would show them that out of the games available for purchase at local video game outlets that of them are rated m of them are rated t and are rated e but above all there are some rated e and t games that adults can enjoy too and even some of the t game are aimed for adults more than kids and teens here are the best rated e t m games available for purchase on the wii that adults can will enjoy alien syndrome big brain academy wii degree bigs the blazing angels squadrons of wwii call of duty driver parallel lines excite truck godfather the heatseeker legend of zelda the twilight princess madden nfl madden nfl coming mario strikers charged medal of honor vanguard metal slug anthology metroid prime corruption coming mortal kombat armageddon need for speed carbon pirates of the caribbean at world's end prince of persia rival swords red steel resident evil scarface splinter cell double agent ssx blur super paper mario tiger woods pga tour tiger woods pga tour coming transformers trauma center second opinion ultimate duck hunting coming wii play wii sports there i listed games that adults will enjoy divided by is of the wii games are good games for adults note that i didn't list far cry because it sucks is that enough for ya Super Mario 64 Nintendo Entertainment System Video game music Wario Rare (video game company) Super Nintendo Entertainment System Koji Kondo Nintendo Revolution PlayStation 2 Link (Legend of Zelda) Yoshi Intelligent Systems Video game controversy Super Mario Bros. television series Super Mario 128 Metroid series The Legend of Zelda series Toad (Nintendo) Super Smash Bros.
