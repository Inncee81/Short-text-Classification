i'm just getting into magic the gathering and have some deck name questions i was wondering what defines decks that fall into the categories of tron and pickles i may be a bit off on some of the names but here is what i remember tron either urzatron or izzetron were basically decks based off of having playsets of urza's lands in them urza's mine power plant and tower and using the mana generated to put out either large creatures or deals tons of damage pickles a deck built around brine elemental and vesuvan shapeshifter where you made it so your opponent doesn't get an untap phase really interesting deck basically you get teh brine elemental into play and morph unmorph the shapeshifter every turn Urza's Saga Urza's Destiny Urza's Legacy Ice Age (Magic: The Gathering) Onslaught (Magic: The Gathering) Yu-Gi-Oh!
