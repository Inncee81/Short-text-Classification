do u know any do u know any card games like i already know of spoons slap jack eypgipian rats war and all that but i wanna know a fun card game my best friend and i play michigan rummy whenever we get the chance it is a little long and you have to meet certain rules to complete a hand i don't know if it has any other names as i only know it as michigan rummy it works very similar to regular rummy in its matching and drawing discarding however you may only take the top card and if it is not your turn you must buy it by taking it and one from the draw pile the first round is hands as follows groups minimum of the same face value i e qqq runs minimum of the same suit in succession i e a of spades group run these hands are dealt cards the second round is dealt cards each hand hands groups groups and run runs and group runs no discard like gin on the last hand with no discard all cards must be used to complete the hand otherwise the final card must be discarded each player can play from the other players piles by adding the next card in order but not until they have also started piles the object is to get all cards out of your hand the lowest score is the winner any cards held in the hand when someone goes out are counted as points by face value all face cards and aces are counted as you must discard to complete the hand except on the no discard final hand and after every draw if you have four or more players you will need two decks no jokers this one has been alot of fun for us and i have taught it to some of my family members and it is one that we have played for years good luck and have fun with it Canasta President (game) Mahjong Poker jargon Mao (game) Draw poker Card game Crazy Eights Cribbage Stud poker Dominoes Sheepshead Betting (poker) Skat Contract bridge Suit (cards) Spades UNO (game) Euchre Big Two Blackjack Oh Hell Piquet ROOK Playing card Community card poker 500 (card game) Card Sharks Texas hold 'em Ra (board game) Magic: The Gathering Cheating in poker Finesse Trick-taking game Omaha hold 'em The Joker's Wild Battle City (Yu-Gi-Oh!)
