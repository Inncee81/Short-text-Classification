is golftec really worth the money this is the place inside the golfsmith stores where they give you golf lessons using machines and computers teaching pros but it's really expensive and i'm wondering if it's worth it i took about lessons and scored a couple freebies along the way from golftec and it made all the difference i was really struggling before the lessons and was faced with a decision to get better or stop playing i was shooting in the range i had been playing for about years and was getting worse my naturally ability and lack of fundamentals ran their course i needed professional help after about months of lessons and serious practice i shot in the s for the next couple of seasons and even broke once on a par my handicap dropped to it's been about three years now since my lessons and my playing time and practice time is significantly less and i'm still shooting in the range my handicap is for me the was well worth it i never knew anything about golf fundamentals before and now i know a little something all that practice time and lessons and drills gave me the ability to figure my swing out now i have some fundamentals i can fall back on whenever things get out of whack before i put band aids on top of band aids without knowing what the problem with my swing was those quick fixes never lasted and eventually compiled to make things worse if you can afford it i highly recommend golftec if you do it i also recommend buying a couple pracitice irons maybe iron iron because you'll be beating them up hard that way you can keep your game set in tact get something with a similar feel and same type of shaft more great things about golftec were i could do the lessons during the off season i live in colorado so even during the winter i could still practice outside in my back yard where i built a practice net and bought a used practice mat there's no wasted time at goftec you show up you strap on the sensors and away you go all the equipment is set up and ready to go a minute lesson is minutes i had a lesson with a crappy teaching pro at a golf course and he was dicking around with all these cameras and equipment and it took minutes just to get the stuff set up waste of my time there are excellent teaching pros out there but this guy was a chump you can view your lessons online they give you drills to work on to mold your swing rather than change your swing to match somebody elses key here is that they mold your swing get ready to get better what's golftec's slogan bring your passion and we'll teach you the rest i have no affiliation with golftec whatsoever i just went through their process and am happy i did Golf New York Giants Babe Ruth Volleyball Microeconomics Digital photography Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Cincinnati Bengals Tennis Professional wrestling match types 1957 World Series Infantilism Go (board game) ELO rating system Golf glossary Golf club (equipment) Professional wrestling holds Second Battle of the Atlantic Strap-on dildo Tiger Woods Japanese tea ceremony Floppy disk Windows XP Perl Casting Fast bowling Professional wrestling throws Java programming language Aerial (dance move) Textile manufacturing Brian Close American football Kurt Angle Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Ice hockey Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers The Amazing Race Super Bowl XXVII Drill bit Enron Corporation Unreal Equine conformation Videocon Tri-Series 2005-06 Past teachings of Prem Rawat Apple Macintosh Swingout Carolina Panthers GunZ The Duel Computer and video game genres Ty Cobb Crash test dummy IBM PC compatible San Francisco 49ers Baseball Visual Basic Hard disk Shawn Michaels Professional wrestling A Course In Miracles Anchor Heinkel He 112 Comparison of 21st century fighter aircraft Archery New York Knicks The Big Break Hulk Hogan Norway national football team Ravi Shastri Snowboarding Education in the United States Squash (sport) Timpani Windows Vista Paintball Software engineering Football (soccer) American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Bretton Woods system Bj__rn Borg Denis Law Laws of cricket Pete Sampras Professional wrestling aerial techniques Apple Computer Oscilloscope Shotgun M60 machine gun History of Test cricket (1884 to 1889) Poker jargon Sailing
