driver shafts is light or heavy better i am looking at drivers and am wondering what is better in terms of weight for a driver shaft i have seen as low as grams diamana shaft on a nike sasquatch and then steels shafts are like i know graphite is better than steel so does that mean the lighter the better i am wondering for distance mostly it all depends on the clubhead you can get a driver that has a lighter shaft but heavier head or a heavier shaft with a lighter head it all has do do with how much whip you get you will get more distance with a lighter shaft but you will also probably spray more shots as a lighter shaft will have a higher torque Golf club (equipment) Wind turbine Turbocharger Bicycle Golf Manual transmission Electric motor Space elevator Screw Front wheel drive Car handling Motorcycle Truck Transmission (mechanics) Thermal power station Knife M16 (rifle) Diesel engine Carbine Assault rifle Tank Ford FE engine Farthing (coin) Jet engine Continuously variable transmission Sport utility vehicle Four wheel drive Nuclear fission Shotgun Transformer Wankel engine Helicopter Ammunition Internal combustion engine Battery electric vehicle Dart (missile) Terminal ballistics Personal rapid transit Torque converter Nuclear fusion Bicycle frame Chevrolet Corvette Saab H engine Goaltender Fuel efficiency Rear wheel drive Collapse of the World Trade Center Machine gun Dodge Neon Passenger car Internal ballistics Mazda Wankel engine Rolling-element bearing Bass guitar Rapid transit Nuclear weapon design Cracking (chemistry) Titanium Railgun Iron Steam engine Hydrogen economy Drawing Mark VIII (tank) Pebble bed reactor Planetary orbit Ice axe Panzer I Classical order Highland games T-64 MG42 Tiger I Balance shaft Propeller Fusion power Hand grenade Fly fishing Pioneer Zephyr Auto racing Light rail Medium machine gun Project Orion Honda Prelude Anti-aircraft warfare Gas metal arc welding Drag racing Firearm English longbow Atomic mass Radioisotope thermoelectric generator TGV Binoculars Wheelbase Aircraft Driver's license Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution Crash test dummy Armour
