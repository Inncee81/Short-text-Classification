my bird bit me ok so i've had this bird for about months and he's probably a little less than a year old he is a green and yellow parakeet i had him out today and he randomly bit my finger he has never done this before and i don't know why he did it he was just sitting on my finger and i put my other finger up for him to step up but instead he bit it then a couple minutes later he was on my finger and he started biting the back of my hand i wasn't antagonizing him at all he was just sitting there and chomp this wasn't just a little nibble either it was definitly a bite now i know that there might not be a specific reason for this but i thought i'd ask anyway but what i really want to know is how i can teach him not to do this after he bit me i told him no but there wasn't really a reaction then i put him back in his cage what else can i do to help him learn not to do this thanks he's a young bird he's just exploring my conure uses her beak to pull herself onto my finger sometimes and that's harder than what i would call a nibble but she isn't doing it to hurt me she's using it like a branch i don't mind i just tell her be gentle and she's starting to get it but when your bird shows frustration and you make a mistake and then he bites you grab his beak if possible between your thumb and pointer finger knuckle and you say no firmly then put him in his cage for time out birds are actually pretty intelligent even budgies are smarter than a cat or dog so they can actually understand time out so putting him in his cage for minutes over time will help with the firm grab of the beak and the verbal no when he play bites young birds do this to test limits and explore tell him be gentle and rmeove your finger let him nibble on you to preen you and test you out but when he starts to get harder tell him be easy if he doens't listen and he bites harder grab his beak tell him no and time out after awhile he'll catch on you gotta start discipline right away so you prevent older birds from biting babies usually don't hurt as bad Milton H.
