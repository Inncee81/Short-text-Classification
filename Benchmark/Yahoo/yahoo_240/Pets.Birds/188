how can you tell when your budgie's beak is getting too long either on the top or on the bottom we already had to have our girl's beak tooled on the bottom once now the bottom's fine but the top is growing we have changed her diet we have a wooden stick a pumice stone and many plastic toys already in her cage i forgot there is also a mineral cuttle stone in the cage and btw sometimes beaks do grow abnormally the vet told us that it is genetic in birds such as ours ok depending on the diet and what you changed the diet from to what it is now it takes some time for this to go stop the over growth of the beak and nails or if it was caught in time i will do my best to explain what is going on this is not a genetic disorder but more of the diet what caused this to happen was the high fat diet it was being fed seeds do this it's the first sign of fatty liver disease the liver can not process the high fat diet so it throws it back into the body cavity which is why you see the fatty tumors over growth of the beak and nails and the thickening of the beak and nails another thing humans maintain the body temp of birds so the high fat diet is not needed which is why outside birds don't have the fat tumors they use up the excess fat for winter storage we also don't give birds the necessary exercise they need to get rid of the excess fat from the diet humans feed them if indeed fatty liver disease is gotten in time it can be reversed depending on a few factors how long the bird had the disease how old the bird is and what diet you are now feeding it what exercise the bird is now getting all of these things factor into the birds life now it can take months up to years to reverse the disease email me with specifics good luck Nutrition Chicken Omega-3 fatty acid Diabetes mellitus Obesity Milk Prostate cancer Fancy rat Cirrhosis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Weight training Coronary heart disease Growth hormone Vitamin Glycogen storage disease type I Alcoholism Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hamster Hypercholesterolemia Insulin Garfield Atkins Nutritional Approach Dieting Kidney Folic acid Ferret Colorectal cancer Hepatitis Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Anorexia nervosa Stomach cancer Urinary incontinence Protein-energy malnutrition Human height Coeliac disease Breastfeeding Cardiovascular disease Puberty Vitamin D Tocopherol Anemia Stroke Acorn Capercaillie Factory farming Growth hormone treatment Hypertension Trans fat Bird migration Crohn's disease Guinea pig Acne Rheumatoid arthritis Exercise Senescence Homer Simpson Hedgehog Osteoporosis Egg (food) Fatty acid Tobacco smoking Agriculture Cystic fibrosis Domestic rabbit Bird Traumatic brain injury Ovarian cancer Glucocorticoid Calorie restriction Chronic fatigue syndrome Polycystic ovary syndrome Bodybuilding Autism Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Medicine Glucokinase Genetic disorder Mesothelioma Sewage treatment Fecal incontinence Seabird Bottlenose Dolphin Hepatocellular carcinoma Dog Foie gras
