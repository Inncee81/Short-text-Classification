my bird gus gus i have a year old cockateil named gus gus and he is not very friendly i have had him for about months now and i got him from my mom she had him for about months and she got him from her friends who didn't really spend time with him my mom got him out and talked to him alot and my hubby and i have tons of interaction with him and talk to him and get him out like everyday we clipped his flight wings but when we go to get him out of his cange he bites us and he will not let us touch him to pet him when we try to pet him he flies off and i am afraid he will hurt himself i don't know why he is so afraid he will not sit on our finger what can i do to get him to trust us and overcome his fears and to be nicer to us and stop biting us please help you just have to be patient start by putting your hands on his cage not in it but not above him they dont like to be towered above after he gets used to you having your hand on his cage place it in nhis age but not near him eventually he will not be as afraid of your hand then you can try to gently pet him on his tummy or beak he may try to bite but they sometimes do this to test how sturdy and trusty your hand is or just to taste your fingers you can try to grab him gently and hold him out of the cage hold on to him firmly but gently and talk to him in a soothing voice do not raise your voice at him if he bites beucase birds learn to do things the more they get a reaction from you so if y ou yell he will learn this gets your attention and keep repeating the action when you take him back to his cage place him on top of the cage instead of in it and maybe close the doors so he feels he can be outside the cage safely just remember they take lots of attention and noise and toys they are very territorial so dont be suprised when he thinks of his cage as his home and doesnt want you in it just keep doing what you are doing and dont give up on him d Milton H.
