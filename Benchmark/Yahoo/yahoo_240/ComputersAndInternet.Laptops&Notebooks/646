my computer labtop has shortcircuted what do i do i accidentally spilt a half a glass of milk on my keyboard and in seconds my labtop shortcircuted what should i do is my labtop gone forever i tried to reboot it after drying the keyboards surface but then it just shuts down after like seconds i'm so sorry to me spills are the most heart breaking of computer accidents the good news is that while the computer may not run chances are all of your files and programs are probably still safely stored on your hard drive you can always transfer that drive to a new computer first and foremost don't try to turn your computer on again until a you've checked your warranty and coverage plans b you have cleaned as much of the milk residue as you can away both on and inside the computer c you're certain the computer is completely dry and clean if you paid for a laptop protection plan check that for spill coverage there are some plans that offer replacement for accidental damage of this sort if you don't have spill coverage but you're still under warranty then your laptop manufacturer may do the cleaning and repairing for you for a fee chances are they'll take your hard drive out of your laptop and put it in a refurbished machine and give that to you in that case you may be without your laptop for several weeks if your computer is past warranty and isn't covered for spill damage then it's up to you to break out the screwdriver open it up clean it up and resuscitate it as best as you can milk is a particularly nasty substance to have on a computer because it contains natural sugars that can soften and become corrosive when the computer heats up and that could cause further electrical shorts to occur plus if you don't get that all cleaned up it's going to spoil smelly nasty therefore you need to clean every last bit of milk off of the metal connections on your motherboard when cleaning the computer don't use any soaps or other cleaning solvents only use water or the tiniest touch of rubbing alcohol and a clean cloth that doesn't leave any flakes or residue behind and make sure you allow the computer several hours to dry before trying to power it on again if you power the laptop up and anything seems wrong or it starts beeping pull the battery immediately to cut the power i don't want to get your hopes up too high but there is a chance that your poor computer will survive its dairy dip it depends where the milk spilled how much of the milk came in contact with connections on the mother board and how well you clean it up before you let any more electricity and heat near it if the milk landed right on your laptop keyboard then the keyboard might have collected most of the milk and guided it out to the edges of the computer preventing it from leaking into too many places on the heart of your motherboard replacing a laptop keyboard is certainly easier and more affordable than replacing the whole thing best of luck and happy cleaning gl Dairy Laptop Universal Serial Bus Soldering Hard disk Floppy disk Fecal incontinence Printed circuit board Drill bit Incandescent light bulb Thermal power station Apple Computer IBM PC compatible Screw Mars Exploration Rover Computer forensics IPod Battery electric vehicle IBM PC Breastfeeding Redundant array of independent disks Milk Tire Coffee Toyota Prius Haloalkane Social rule Personal computer Solar power Sulfuric acid Energy development Welding Dry cleaning Textile manufacturing Tooth Oscilloscope Corrosion Upholstery Seismic retrofit Windows XP Chernobyl accident Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Computer virus Internal ballistics Spark plug Equine conformation Friction Wind turbine Plastic Sento Vacuum tube Carburetor IBook Mattress Hybrid vehicle Naval mine Atari ST Condom Violin Gas metal arc welding Fossil fuel power plant Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Menstrual cup Amiga Tattoo Poker jargon Alcohol fuel Fire fighting Stroke Motor oil Transistor Bicycle lighting USB flash drive Capacitor plague Overclocking Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Windows 2000 Hemp Pebble bed reactor Carbon dioxide Heinkel He 100 Trademark Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Paint Circuit design Warranty Surveillance
