laptop vs pc which is better i've been looking at computers lately and am unsure whether or not to buy a pc or a laptop i'll need it for school but other than that i'm not a big gamer although i want to be able to watch and burn movies and music and i do have an extensive picture library on my current computer what are some of the pros and cons of both would a laptop be better for a student or not really will a pc last longer than a laptop regarding durability it all depends on how you use it are you violent and impulsive and the duration of usage if its long and you abuse them like hitting the keyboards and stuff naturally they dont last very long and what you intend it to use for daily editting of photos studies etc or just lounging around with ur notebook pros of a desktop more versatile in terms of changing hardware can void the warranty or diy a computer yourself and change hardwares according to your needs capable of computing speeds unimaginable on notebooks yet cons of desktop not compact not travel friendly pros of notebook very light between kg only much more compact can use any where you like cons of notebook hardly able to upgrade anything besides ram and hard disks which are still rather expensive computing power are much more inferior compared to a decent desktop overheating issue may occur because of their slim design short battery life they usually say on the flyers etc that they last for up to hours but usually they dont even last half of that unless you set the cpu speed to the lowest and lowest brightness level of the lcd screen if its for school and u require a notebook frequently then by all means get a notebook consider a mac if ur gonna do video photo editting and since you aren't a big gamer the more you should get a notebook since they are also capable of watching dvds burning of data etc etc have fun choosing IBM PC compatible Apple Macintosh PowerBook Windows XP Hard disk Computer IBook PlayStation Portable IMac Windows Vista Personal computer Desktop computer Mouse (computing) Floppy disk Digital photography History of Microsoft Windows Universal Serial Bus IPod PowerPC Atari 8-bit family Desknote Atari ST Television Radeon Handheld game console Computer and video games Computer hardware Redundant array of independent disks Linux 64-bit Amiga Computer virus Windows 2000 PlayStation 2 Microprocessor ATI Technologies Pentium M Central processing unit MAME Liquid crystal display Musical Instrument Digital Interface PlayStation 3 QuickTime Wi-Fi CPU design DVD Apple II family TRS-80 Amstrad CPC Power Macintosh G3 System 7 (Macintosh) High-definition television Acorn Archimedes Xbox 360 Pentium 4 Commodore 128 Blu-ray Disc Game Boy Advance Computer bus Sega Dreamcast Sun Microsystems History of computer and video games Sharp Zaurus Bicycle lighting AmigaOS Microsoft Windows CPU cache Screenshot Knoppix X Window System Mac mini Apple IIGS USB flash drive National Weather Service Overclocking Mach kernel Bluetooth Copy protection Sega Saturn Java programming language Embedded system Atari 2600 IBM PC Xbox Emulator Super Nintendo Entertainment System Wearable computer
