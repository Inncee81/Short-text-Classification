apple or dell i'm getting a laptop when i leave for college next year and i was wondering which brand i should go for i've used windows on dell computers all my life but those cool mac vs pc commercials caught my attention i'm sick of windows always screwing my computer up and thought macs look cooler i don't play any games besides occasionally sims but instead spend most of my time doing school papers and presentations and uploading and editing pictures and going on aim and the internet with this backround information which would you recommend for me and if you suggest apple is a macbook pro worth it for me and can someone explain how getting the internet works for laptops sorry for this very very long question i appreciate it alot though oh and i'd like to add that my very influential older brother is strongly swaying me away from macs because they suck and they're only good for art majors but are they still fun to use because that's what is most important to me entertaining yet good for school work well i would say get a macbook it's powerful sturdy has good service and repair is compatible with everything if you get windows and linux it also comes with a free nano if you by it with the student discount you can also get office for it but you should instead download neooffice for free same basic idea but at no cost if you want something that is more commercial there is also apple's iwork suite what you should do is find an apple store near you then you can test at every mac that apple sells and see if os x is right for you a mac genius can also tell you anything you need to know also if you want you can get sims for the mac at aspyr com or the apple store Apple Computer Apple Macintosh IPod ITunes Microsoft Office IBM PC compatible Laptop Wi-Fi WordPerfect Windows XP Online music store HyperCard Commodore 64 Apple II family The Sims WebObjects QuickTime MP3 Timeline of computing 1990-forward X Window System Mozilla Firefox Microsoft Radeon IMac Amiga Computer virus PowerBook Microprocessor The Sims 2 Gmail Windows Vista ITunes Music Store OpenOffice.org Pretty Good Privacy Microsoft Windows NeXT Sun Microsystems Digital rights management Operating system Floppy disk Linux kernel MSN Messenger System 7 (Macintosh) Commodore International Windows 2000 TRS-80 Digital audio workstation AOL Instant Messenger The Sims 2: University USB flash drive IBook IPhoto Podcasting Computer MAME Emacs Unicode Mac OS X v10.4 Apple Intel transition StarOffice BitTorrent Hewlett-Packard Java programming language Computer workstation Mandriva Linux Mac OS 9 RISC Game programming History of computer and video games Session Initiation Protocol Perl File Allocation Table Personal computer Digital audio player Bluetooth History of the graphical user interface LiveCD FireWire Electronic Arts Spyware PNG Advertising Atari 8-bit family Wine (software) Blu-ray Disc AppleWorks
