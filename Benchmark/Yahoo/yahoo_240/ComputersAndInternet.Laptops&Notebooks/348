i need some opinions i have and i'm about to go to college i take a music class that teach you how to play alto saxophone and i'm gonna buy a used alto sax which is around i also want to buy a laptop should i use to buy a laptop and ask my parents to buy the alto sax and should i buy mac or pc or should i buy the alto sax and ask my parents some more money to buy a laptop by the way my parents keep my and they don't like me involve with music they thought i'm gonna choose music as my major for college i love to be a musician but i'm not take music as my major i know musicians don't make a lot of money but i just love to play i take nurse as my major anyway i can use both pc and mac if i buy a cheap pc then i'm afraid that i won't able to use it for long time you would be the best judge to know what your parents are going to say about the extra money for one or the other if they are not happy that you are taking a music course i would most likely buy the alto sax and ask them if they will supplement your left over amount for a new computer or watch the sales and also most computer companies will give an educational discount to students what are you most familiar with a mac or pc you definitely do not need to add learning to use a new computer system to your already heavy work load for college check that out also good luck and get ready to study hard Saxophone Mac OS X Apple Macintosh Clarinet Mutual fund IBM PC compatible Tenor saxophone Computer King Crimson Surveillance Betting (poker) Poker jargon Hewlett-Packard Hard disk Steve Jobs Big band Microprocessor Pet Sounds IBook Student loan Education in Germany The Sims 2: University Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution Brian Jones (musician) Monopoly (game) Education in the United States Education Windows XP PLATO Cruising (maritime) Education in Romania Street-Legal Mouse (computing) Baritone saxophone Humphrey Bogart Current teachings of Prem Rawat Rich Mullins MMORPG Dave Brubeck NeXT The Amazing Race Bond Fleetwood Mac PowerBook $ale of the Century Health insurance Mac OS history Marching band Arbitrage Donovan Education in the People's Republic of China Transposing instrument Ashton-Tate The Ashlee Simpson Show Craps MTV Community college Theory of conduct File system Education in Portugal Scholarship IPod Baseball Stars Caulfield Grammar School Mad Money Best Buy Apple Intel transition Digital photography Chesapeake and Ohio Railway Commodore International Anthony Braxton Bebop Black Tie White Noise Mahjong Price discrimination Homeschooling Internet fraud Advance fee fraud Credit card Mergers and acquisitions Press Your Luck Microeconomics Retailer Winning Streak The Catcher in the Rye Final Fantasy XI Sun Microsystems No Child Left Behind Act University of Massachusetts Amherst Library (computer science) Friends Suzuki method Education in Australia Education in Taiwan ITunes Music Store Charlie Parker
