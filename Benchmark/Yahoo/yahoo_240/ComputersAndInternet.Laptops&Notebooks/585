windows vista i was at circuit city the other day and i noticed the prices of computers with windows vista dropped alot i was wondering is it worth it to get one because i also know alot of things aren't yet compatible with vista yet should i wait oh and yes im talking about a laptop okay fact is of the software that is out there will never be compatable with vista and the same can be said for of devices i would not get a laptop right now if i were you unless i ordered one customed with windows xp the fact is laptops designed for vista have graphics that run in directx which is nice and shiny but will never accept any windows before vista so you can't even install xp on a vista laptop microsoft found a nice way to stick it to everyone this time if you're wanting a laptop don't wait xp is becoming a thing of the past because microsoft is forcing contracts on all the big computer companies they've even tried with mine but i won't be bought out at the price their offering me you may still be able to have a custom dell built for you with xp on it but you may have to check on ebay if that is not enough for you try finding a local computer shop and asking them if they can custom laptops for you best of luck IBM PC compatible Windows Vista Windows XP Microsoft Windows Laptop Mac OS X Apple Macintosh DirectX ATI Technologies History of Microsoft Windows OpenGL Sun Microsystems Windows API Radeon Xbox Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Personal computer PowerBook Windows 2000 USB flash drive Xbox 360 Microprocessor IPod Wintel Mouse (computing) Apple Computer Commodore International Floppy disk Timeline of computing 1990-forward PowerPC Game programming Atari 8-bit family Hard disk Common criticisms of Microsoft Atari ST History of the graphical user interface GeForce 4 MS-DOS NVIDIA Universal Serial Bus Supercomputer Hewlett-Packard History of computing hardware (1960s-present) X Window System Wi-Fi Internet Explorer Computer bus PlayStation 3 AmigaOS Computer Apple Intel transition OS/2 Amiga Computer and video games Mac OS X v10.4 Commodore 64 Windows Presentation Foundation Bluetooth Pocket PC WindowBlinds Network effect CPU design Mozilla Firefox Game programmer MIPS architecture First-sale doctrine Booting System/36 Copy protection United States v.
