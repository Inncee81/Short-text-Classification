my laptop is difficult to type on what do i do hi i will type this question without any editing so you can se what the laptop does as i type on my laptop sometimes it doesnseem to register the keys that i push i don't know if there is an option to perhaps adjust the sensitivity setting of my keyboard or what buti sem to have to edit all of my sentences and fil in the keys that it didn't seem to register wen i yped it as you can see from what i typed above i'm editing my typing now there are missing letters that i did type they just didn't seem to register for some reason might anyone have a suggestion unfortunately the design of some notebooks allows your hand to graze over the touchpad for the mouse causing it to pick up the mouse movement and sometimes sacrifice the key stroke the other possibility is that either something is under the keys causing them to not to make the proper contact when pressed get a can of compressed air wal mart sells these in the computer section and blow it in short bursts along each row of keys finally there could be something corrupted in the keyboard driver this part assumes you are using windows xp click on start and then right click on my computer select properties then select the hardware tab and select device manager once in device manager click on the next to keyboards likely there will be only one option but if there is more than one select the one for you keyboard and right click on it click on uninstall then reboot your computer as the computer restarts it will recognize the keyboard and reinstall the driver but hopefully this time it won't be corrupted Mouse (computing) Laptop Windows 2000 Windows XP IBM PC compatible Universal Serial Bus Blue screen of death Computer keyboard Dvorak Simplified Keyboard Unicode Enigma machine Atari 8-bit family IPod Booting Microsoft Windows Floppy disk Hard disk Screenshot IMac Control-Alt-Delete Touchpad CPU cache Atari ST Bluetooth Windows Vista Apple typography X Window System Computer Amstrad CPC Password Object Desktop Game controller Typewriter Musical Instrument Digital Interface TRS-80 Color Computer Virtual memory Device driver Personal computer History of Microsoft Windows TRS-80 Microsoft Control Panel (Windows) Gmail BIOS Jumpstart 3rd Grade Sinclair ZX81 International Phonetic Alphabet Desktop computer Computer and video games Game programmer Minesweeper (computer game) Public-key cryptography Manual transmission Microprocessor Function key Computer and video game genres HTTP cookie Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Architecture of Windows 2000 IBM PC keyboard Control character Carpal tunnel syndrome Bass guitar 64-bit IBM PC Debugging Vim (text editor) Xerox Star Domestic AC power plugs and sockets System/36 Option key Fitts' law Common Unix Printing System Embedded system Stenotype Copy protection Amiga OS/2 MIPS architecture Apple Computer Stardock Kernel (computer science) WordStar CPU design
