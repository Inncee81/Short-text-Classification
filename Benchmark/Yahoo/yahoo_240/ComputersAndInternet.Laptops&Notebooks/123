should i get a sony viao or dell laptop i am currently planning on buying a laptop for the upcoming school year and i was just wondering which would be better for me to get a sony or dell laptop i think sony's are a bit more expensive and i want to get a laptop that will do all the basic things i need and play video games if possible as well i was just wondering if anyone knows what i should get my budget is around at the most and i would also like to know which laptop has the longest battery life thanks a lot everyone reasons to buy a dell laptop i love trying to figure out if i am a home office or a small business what if i am a large business run from my home yikes i want to own technology that is at least months out of date it makes me feel safe i think the world moves too fast so i sure don't want my computer to move fast too i love a web site that requires seven pages of ordering to see my final price i have nothing but time on my hands i enjoy having to fill out reams of paperwork to get the money i overpaid back in a rebate check there is nothing like the feeling you get when you have loaned of your money to a corporate giant for three months interest free paying so much extra for a laptop helps me to feel as if i have contributed to the economy i appreciate how hard i have to look around the dell site just to see if the laptop has a usb port dell must figure that this weeds out the idiots from the rest of us if i cant figure out were your specifications page is then i am too dumb to own a dell laptop to begin with keep that page buried the strong will find it i like the fact that my technical support and customer service is redirected to the other side of the world i like promoting a global economy great idea selling my on site warranty service to the lowest bidder in my neighborhood i think it is very nice you find work for the hardware technicians in my area that are not good enough to find work on their own in addition i like having this person in my house seeing all my other great toys maybe he can set the clock on my vcr for me dell does not give me a free carry case good idea that is also why i bought a car without rust proofing or bumpers i appreciate the fact dell feels i only need free technical support for one year why would i want lifetime free support you think i am an idiot or something if i need help after one year well then i deserve to pay for it everyone wants a hot laptop but this is ridiculous dell laptop burst into flame http www redherring com article aspx a hed laptop fire brings flashpoint anyways sony is much better than dell performance wise any day of the year if your budget is then i feel you can still manage to find a vaio talking about the battery get a cell li ion battery instead of the usual that should make it stay longer cheers Windows XP Laptop PowerBook PlayStation 3 Bluetooth IBM PC compatible PlayStation 2 PlayStation Portable Universal Serial Bus ATI Technologies IPod Nintendo Atari ST Microeconomics Best Buy Apple Computer Hard disk Apple Macintosh Timeline of computing 1990-forward Poker jargon Xbox 360 PowerPC Sun Microsystems Computer Wi-Fi Internet fraud IBook Xbox Lithium ion battery Internet W.
