which is a better processor for a laptop and which is a better display for a laptop which is better processor amd turiontm x dual core processor tl amd turiontm x dual core processor tl amd turiontm x dual core processor tl which is a better display high resolution or anti glare the tl is the better processor have you considered the intel core duos they are better performers for displays higher resolution can often be a draw back if you do not have a discrete video card in the system for example most laptops have an igp card one that is integrated with the system and shares the cpu for drawing pictures a discrete video card has a gpu for drawing pictures and frees the cpu to do other things thereby speeding up performance of video editing viewing and games if you get an igp then get a lower resolution screen the anti glare is nice but hardly needed unless you are in an outdoor environment or a place with lots of lights it certainly makes the screen look nicer if color depth is important lots of movie viewing then the anti glare is good i find a good screen size is about x or slightly better good luck ATI Technologies Microprocessor Laptop NVIDIA IBM PC compatible Pentium 4 PC Engine Central processing unit CPU cache GeForce 6 Series PlayStation Portable RISC AMD Dual-core Radeon Cyrix PlayStation 3 CPU design Mac OS X v10.4 PowerBook Athlon Windows Vista Windows XP PowerPC 64-bit Opteron Overclocking History of Microsoft Windows VIA Technologies AMD64 Mac OS X Xbox 360 Athlon 64 Atari ST Computer workstation Apple Macintosh MIPS architecture Nintendo Revolution ThinkPad Embedded system VIA C3 Digital Intel High-definition television TurboGrafx 16 Apple Intel transition PC motherboard Computer bus PR rating Celeron Sega Dreamcast Linux kernel Sega Saturn Amstrad CPC Digital photography Apple II family Pentium M Personal computer Xeon Sun Microsystems IA-32 PlayStation 2 Nintendo DS Handheld game console Atari 8-bit family Extreme Programming Nintendo 64 Commodore 64 Graphics card TRS-80 Stream processing AMD 5x86 Zilog Z80 Transmeta Pentium TurboDuo Sprite (computer graphics) Windows 2000 Silicon Graphics Athlon 64 X2 Apple IIGS Front side bus Oscilloscope NForce4 GeForce 4 CPU electrical consumption ZX Spectrum SIMD
