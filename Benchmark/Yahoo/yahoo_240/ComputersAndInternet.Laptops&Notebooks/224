laptop batteries what's the life span how can i extend it i just bought my laptop a week ago brnad new hp and i'm disappointed with the battery life i can maybe get minutes out of it before it craps out i'm not doing anything heavy duty with it what can i do to extend the active time and are there more efficient longer lasting batteries available for purchase hp should have bigger batteries available for purchase in my experience when you buy a laptop unless you tell them differently they'll ship the machine with the small battery pack if you want the bigger one you have to tell them specifically it might also depend on what you consider to be heavy duty as far as power usage is concerned spinning a drive is a heavy duty task so if you're doing something like watching a dvd the batteries won't last as long even so minutes sounds like it's on the short side as battery lifespans go if hp says their laptop batteries are supposed to last longer say something like hours maybe you should ask them about the battery life you're getting as well as about buying a bigger battery you might have a warranty issue to attend to as well as a purchase to make good luck to you and hope all goes well Laptop IBM PC compatible IPod IBook Atari ST Overclocking Lithium ion battery PlayStation Portable Battery electric vehicle PowerBook Toyota Prius Bicycle lighting Apple Macintosh Heinkel He 100 Television commercial USS Tunny (SS-282) Radioisotope thermoelectric generator Craps Incandescent light bulb Hard disk Digital photography Windows XP ZGMF-1017 GINN Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Hybrid vehicle Warranty Television Gramophone record PowerBook G3 Desktop computer Liquid crystal display Heinkel He 112 USS Ammen (DD-527) Sears Holdings Corporation USS Vincennes (CA-44) National Weather Service USS New Jersey (BB-62) Airsoft Xbox 360 Norwegian Campaign Electric vehicle USS Wichita (CA-45) Energy development 8 mm video format Second Battle of the Atlantic Universal Serial Bus Floppy disk Game Boy Advance SP DVD Oasis (band) USS Washington (BB-56) Alan Arnett McLeod Amiga USS Twining (DD-540) Cruising (maritime) USS Uhlmann (DD-687) USS Thompson (DD-627) Macintosh Portable USS Yorktown (CV-10) USS Zane (DD-337) Personal computer PowerPC USS Waller (DD-466) USS Threadfin (SS-410) AlphaSmart Equine conformation Submarine ThinkPad Electric boat Immortality Torpedo USS Wasp (CV-7) Internal combustion engine Solar power Annuity USS Toledo (CA-133) USS The Sullivans (DD-537) USS West Virginia (BB-48) Redundant array of independent disks Internal ballistics Computer forensics World Championship Wrestling USS Alfred A.
