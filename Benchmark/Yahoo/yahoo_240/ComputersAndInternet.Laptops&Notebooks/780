lappy cd dvd drive problem this lappy is almost years old but for the most part still works good i just got it another stick of ram running at about gig anyhow the cd dvd drive worked fine until just recently i notice dvds skipping and the noises its making are pretty loud when a dvd or cd enters i burned a dvd with some foles on it to put from my desktop to this lappy and when i try to use it on the lappy it sticks on preparing to copy then errors and says it cant i tested the disc on my desktop its fine so is my drive shot or is it something else oh i have another lappy same model that has a broken screen but everything esle on it is fine i could switch out the cd drives the problem is im kind of scared to ive never been in side a lappy other than for ram and a hard drive desktops is anothr astory oh umm it reads the disc is there i can see whats on it it just wont copy and the dvds will start they just skip very high chances that you need to replace the drive like you said it's an old laptop maybe due to heavy usage the optical already burnt out Hard disk Laptop IPod IBM PC compatible Desktop computer Floppy disk Windows XP Gramophone record Sega Dreamcast PowerBook IMac USB flash drive PlayStation 2 Knoppix Commodore 64 Compact disc DualDisc Modchip Oscilloscope PowerBook G4 IBook ZX Spectrum MiniDisc Computer virus Apple Computer Computer hardware X Window System Teen Girl Squad Personal computer Linux Nintendo GameCube Commodore 1541 Amstrad CPC Blu-ray Disc Xbox 360 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Apple Macintosh History of Microsoft Windows Mouse (computing) Windows 2000 DVD-RAM Atari ST Copy protection Laserdisc Jet engine Power Macintosh G3 Windows Vista Pretty Good Privacy Computer Oasis (band) CD-ROM Television Digital photography Object Desktop Apple II family PlayStation Portable Embedded system Acorn Archimedes Mac mini Mach kernel EMac Atari 8-bit family Judas Priest CD recorder Movie projector Sound recording Nine Inch Nails Stereoscopy Apollo Guidance Computer Data General Nova Overclocking Homestar Runner Apple IIGS Nintendo 64 PowerPC ThinkPad 24 Hours of Le Mans Commodore 128 Macintosh Finder DVD-R High-definition television PlayStation 3 Cleveland Browns CD-R Mixtape The Star Wars Holiday Special Bicycle lighting Kaypro STS-61 Enterprise content management Roxette The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (TV series) Anamorphic widescreen Copy Control Extreme Programming CPU design Microsoft Windows King Crimson Sound Blaster
