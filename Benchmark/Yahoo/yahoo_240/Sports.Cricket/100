how do you measure the speed someone is bowling a cricket ball i would like to see how fast i bowl a cricket ball but i don't have a clue of how to do it can somebody please help well it's difficult you can get someone with a stopwatch waiting for the ball to pass them at the crease but it's difficult to be accurate time the release of the ball to the crease then use spee distance time much easier is to go to a cricket net run by your local county side who have speed guns or other measuring equipment they often let you use the nets during or after games for a small fee and you could ask them they also do this for free at games sometimes on a strip off the pitch keep your eye out if youre at a game such as a twenty twenty or a test match good luck Cricket Fast bowling Batting (cricket) Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 No ball Cricket pitch Umpire (cricket) History of Test cricket (1890 to 1900) Fielding (cricket) Bowling strategy (cricket) Test cricket History of Test cricket (to 1883) Indoor cricket 2005 English cricket season Brian Close Sydney Riot of 1879 Types of bowlers in cricket Australian cricket team Batsman History of cricket Yorker Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Run (cricket) Dismissal (cricket) Ravi Shastri Cricket ball West Indian cricket team Short form cricket W.
