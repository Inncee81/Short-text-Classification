zimbabwean cricket team two part question here part don't you reckon it would be a good idea adding zimbabwe to the icc intercontinental cup asap it would be a good way to see exactly how strong the zimbabwean team is in comparison to the associates also the icc could put up the th test status spot for the overall winner thus giving even more incentive to the zimbabweans irish scots and canadians to put their best squads out not like canada leaving arguably their best player in john davison out lets face facts nothing short of zimbabwe bringing the flower brothers andy blignaut and heath streak out of retirement would bring zimbabwe back to the level of whipping boys of test cricket i feel that the icc intercontinental cup is one of the most important fixtures in the whole cricketing world allowing us to see the very best the rest of the world has to offer part also could you imagine the rest of the world having a test cricket team who would be in your best xi the idea about the th test spot very controversial but a very enterprising idea unfortunately due to internal politics in the icc it'd never work zimbabwe needs to bring back the players you have mentioned above to be competitive but how competitive they'd be is an question which can not be answered anyway most of those guys were first internationally heard during the wc in oz nz that's years ago think the best has gone out of them now the best zimbabwe can do is to make do with what they have maybe participate in south africa's domestic cricket tournament as an invitee hopefully develop from there no easy ways here no serious idea about the the rest of the world guys so can't put a team in place by the way some time back the world xi had a torrid time taking on the aussies what makes you think that a world xi of associate nations will be a trouble to a major test nation bar few if you want to be diplomatic the windies bangladesh etc West Indian cricket team Test cricket History of cricket Videocon Tri-Series 2005-06 2005 ICC Trophy International Cricket Council 2003 Cricket World Cup One-day International English cricket team Zimbabwe Cricket Australian cricket team ICC Super Series 2005 2005 English cricket season Ravi Shastri International cricket in 2005-06 2005 ICC Intercontinental Cup New Zealand cricket team in Zimbabwe in 2005-06 First-class cricket Canadian cricket team Cricket World Cup 1982 ICC Trophy 2005 Afro-Asian Cup 1986 ICC Trophy 2007 Cricket World Cup Australian national cricket captains One-day cricket 1990 ICC Trophy History of Test cricket (1884 to 1889) Brian Close Andy Flower John Davison Tatenda Taibu Playoff International structure of cricket History of Test cricket (1890 to 1900) 1999 Cricket World Cup August 2005 in sports Sport in Ireland Irish cricket team Norway national football team Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Indian Oil Cup 2005 June 2005 in sports Bangladeshi cricket team May 2005 in sports Rugby union Batting (cricket) Football (soccer) FIFA September 2004 in sports England national rugby union team April 2005 in sports Kevin Pietersen Sri Lankan national cricket captains Zimbabwe Rahul Dravid Hampshire County Cricket Club Sachin Tendulkar Timeline of cricket Football World Cup Bermudian cricket team South African cricket team The Ashes New Zealand cricket team Andrew Flintoff 1979 ICC Trophy History of Test cricket (to 1883) FA Cup History of rugby union 1996 Cricket World Cup ELO rating system Indoor cricket United Arab Emirates cricket team Abdul Razzaq European/South American Cup Commonwealth of Nations United States cricket team Quizbowl Ice hockey Indian national cricket captains National Hockey League All-Star Game 2005 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand Table tennis Zimbabwe parliamentary elections, 2005 November 2004 in sports Roger Federer Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Imran Khan Australian rules football January 2005 in sports Operation Murambatsvina Umpire (cricket)
