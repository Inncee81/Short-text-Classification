what do you say about decision of umpire for giving ganguly out i think ball was first touched the bat and then pad sourav ganguly is my favourite though not the player of my country but i am praying for his bright future he is the right player and right captain i dont know how an international umpire can give out twice which can be easily spotted that was really ridiculous some felt he couldn't play the bouncer others swore that he was god on the off side some laughed at his lack of athleticism others took immense pride in his ability to galvanise a side sourav ganguly's ability to polarise opinion led to one of the most fascinating dramas in indian cricket yet nobody can dispute that he was india's most successful test captain forging a winning unit from a bunch of talented but directionless individuals and nobody can argue about him being one of the greatest one day batsmen of all time despite being a batsman who combined grace with surgical precision in his strokeplay his career had spluttered to a standstill before being resurrected by a scintillating hundred on debut at lord's in later that year he was promoted to the top of the order in odis and along with sachin tendulkar formed one of the most destructive opening pairs in history when he took over the captaincy after the match fixing exposes in he quickly proved to be a tough intuitive and uncompromising leader under his stewardship india started winning test matches away and put together a splendid streak that took them all the way to the world cup final in later that year in australia an unexpected and incandescent hundred at brisbane set the tone for the series steve waugh's last where india fought the world's best team to a standstill victory in pakistan turned him into a cult figure but instead of being a springboard for greater things it was the peak of a slippery slope English cricket team 2003 Cricket World Cup Indian Oil Cup 2005 World Cricket Tsunami Appeal Indian national cricket captains Cricket Test cricket Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Adam Gilchrist One-day International Indian cricket team in Zimbabwe in 2005-06 The Ashes International cricket in 2005 Pakistani cricket team History of Test cricket (to 1883) Batting (cricket) Border-Gavaskar Trophy Kapil Dev History of Test cricket (1884 to 1889) Brian Close Glenn McGrath Laws of cricket Melbourne Cricket Ground ICC Super Series 2005 Imran Khan Sydney Riot of 1879 History of Test cricket (1890 to 1900) 2005 Afro-Asian Cup 1996 Cricket World Cup History of cricket Fielding (cricket) Michael Vaughan Dennis Lillee Batsman One-day cricket Javed Miandad Batting average Tied Test Mahendra Singh Dhoni English national cricket captains Brian Lara Captain (cricket) Muttiah Muralitharan Sunil Gavaskar Norway national football team Wilfred Rhodes Andrew Strauss John McEnroe Saeed Anwar Australian national cricket captains Ian Botham W.
