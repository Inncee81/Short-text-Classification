i spit out of disgust on this guy's confederate flag on his car was i way out of line well iobviously it's pretty rude but i intended it to be rude i thought he deserved it his car also had confederate flags painted on his car and he was wearing them on his tshirt and hat i mean what was this guy trying to prove i know i know they say that the flag isn't always associated with racism and that it can just be a symbol of traditional values or outlaw culture but that's obviously just a cover for modern day racism billed as an almost patriotically fervent un political correctness to the point that it almost becomes fetishistic so anyway this guy made my blood boil i wanted to confront him face to face but he we were in the post office and i didn't want to make a scene so instead on the way out i spat on the flag on his car i know this was rude but do you think it was justified would you have done the same thing yourself or would you sympathize with my action even if you wouldn't go that far yourself or was i way way out of line seeing some of the responses so far i think i need to make a point that some people seem to have missed this is not a first amendment rights issue here i have no problem with the racist sharing his views i'm not trying to silence him i'm merely expressing my opinion of his values just as he's entitled to freedom of speech i am entitled to freedom to judge his speech and disagree with it i didn't rip it down i spat on it it is a temporary sign of disapproval but it is not vandolism well at least you realize that it was rude of you to do that but i don't think you were really out of line to do something like that i wouldn't go that far if i were there i'd just glare at him and make sure he saw me and maybe talk intentionally loud to a friend so he can overhear us rag on him but you were not way out of line however i'd like to say that fetishes rock and that i don't appreciate you associating fetishism with racism in any way Freedom of speech Racism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Nazism EastEnders Theodicy Patriotism Martin Luther King, Jr. American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Hate speech Originalism Zell Miller Separation of church and state Arab-Israeli conflict Homophobia Plame affair Cindy Sheehan French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools One Tree Hill (TV series) Philosophical skepticism Rick Santorum Richard Littlejohn Liberalism W.
