rule breakers should i ignore it and my safety up until recently i was not intimidated by others always spoke my mind in any situation this rarely led to confrontation as my size and presence as i've been told many times discouraged that as i get older i'm finding it less desirable to be so bold but i still feel anger and or frustration when in certain situations how should i handle this i will be posting several questions about different situations help please i really need to hear your knowledgeble suggestions what should i do in this situation at our private small community pool with my preteen girls several adults around years old are drinking alcohol in bottles getting louder and more vulgar by the minute pool rules clearly posted nearby no alcohol or bottles allowed in park area i feel angry uncomfortable disrespected and embarrassed as a law abiding adult seeing other adults directly dissing the rules in front of my kids i do agree that we do mellow out a bit as we get older in a situation like the one you described i would just walk up to the group and ask them to drink somewhere else if it's a private community pool then the group would have to belong to the community or at least be with someone from the community that person is responsible for their conduct be polite but not wimpy don't threaten them and don't back down they could see you have children with you and you are looking out for your own children if they still don't understand your request and you don't recognize any of them go back home and call the police people living in the community agree to the same rule so they should know better by doing this you're giving your children a valuable lesson stand up for what's right and be firm in your conviction Social rule Transactional analysis Theory of conduct Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Milton H.
