does everyone talk about others behind there back doesnt' it seem like even the people you think you know the best you always find out there saying something about you behind your back my mom always taught me to never say anything about anyone that you wouldn't say right in front of there face and i still use that advice to this day but it makes me upset when i find out someone has said something aweful about me that isn't true but why woudlnt' they say it to my face why are people so two faced it's so aweful do you do this talk about others the minute they leave there's a difference between talking about people behind their backs and talking about them in a mean way behind their backs from my own experience i'd say almost everyone talks about other people human beings are social animals and we are all interested in others who they are what they do wher they come from this type of chit chat makes the world of people go around and keeps the wheels of social interraction oiled however the second type of behaviour where people gossip in a mean way and tell secrets or outright lies about others is thankfully not quite as common the problem is for the affected person it can seem like everyone is doing it in fact it is a form of bullying and sad to say one that girls and women participate in to a great extent although males are not immune to it for many people it is also something they leave behind as they mature and grow up and relise how hurtful such behaviour can be there's not much that can be done against a whispering campaign except to stand tall and proud and do not participate yourself including responding to things you hear if someone tells you that x said so and so that person is part of the chain break the chain by saying 'goodness hasn't x got anything to talk about except me i didn't know my life was so interesting to her ' then change the subject to the latest book or movie in this way you show towo things you are way too mature to get involved in these little kid games and you could care less what x says regardless of what you hear about others don't pass on anything mean unless you hear something an adult should know then definitely tell someone and if you hear a nasty rumour about someone turn it around by saying really i heard she was really nice and a good artist dancer tennis player whatever that way you are helping someone else out and also showing people who are mean mouthed that you are not part of their circle of intimidation once you do you might be surprised to discover just how small that circle is step outside the box and live your own life and you will be free of their hurt good luck and best wishes Social rule Shaggy dog story Theory of conduct God Emperor of Dune The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe One Tree Hill (TV series) Plame affair Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Death Gate Cycle Jumpstart 3rd Grade Hearing impairment Kodocha About a Boy Humphrey Bogart Milton H.
