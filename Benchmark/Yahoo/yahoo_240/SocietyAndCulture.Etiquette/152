what is the most appropriate way for me to express my disgust my daddy is forcing me against my will to go to a boarding school for teens that need attitude adjustments i was reflecting upon the past year and let's just call a spade a spade here i was disgusted with the education provided by our local public school system in texas over the past few years the problems included mediocre sem literate teachers trailer trash school administrators overweight students decrepit facilities and non creative and physically abusive disciplinary methods i often reminded my principal that i was not opposed to suing but he laughed at me spit up his tobacco and then would call drawl my daddy to pick my spoiled ss up and take me home and deal with me this is the kind of arrogance i find to be extremely offensive i have told my daddy i'd like to call the school office and express my disgust but daddy told me to leave these poor people alone and not to be a pain in the ss or he will return the favor should i call them anyways texas' schools board of education give them a call voice your concerns http rds yahoo com ylt a geu bkt tgcjsaoyhxnyoa ylu x odmte mdi bjq bhnlywnzcgrwb mdmgrjb xva fjmgr dglka y mdbfodeebanxuze sig k o mk exp http a www tea state tx us sboe http rds yahoo com ylt a geu bkt tgcjsaoshxnyoa ylu x odmte n zhmdztbhnlywnzcgrwb mdmqrjb xva fjmgr dglka y mdbfodeebanxuze sig f ka ec exp http a www tea state tx us Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Boston Public Education in Japan Brown v.
