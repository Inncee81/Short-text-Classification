what do i say when someone asks me how much something is i was always taught that how much you spend and how much you make per year should never be flaunted but lately i've noticed people asking me how much everything is and i have no idea what to say i don't want to make them feel like i'm better or worse than them so i just come up with an excuse not to tell them how much it is which usually is really lame when i say something like i don't think it's polite to talk about i think i sound like i'm stuck up and i think that i'm better than them what is a polite way to tell them it's none of their business or do you think it really doesn't matter and i should just come out and tell them look at them like they have two heads really this works asking people how much they paid for something is downright rude give 'em the stare down really Theory of conduct Social rule Kender Shaggy dog story The nature of God in Western theology Miss Saigon Milton H.
