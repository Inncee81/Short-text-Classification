don't you hate it when the waitress seats you near crying whining kids i'm a mom i would never take my kids to a nice restaurant at night if they couldn't behave family restaurants are fair game why would i waste my money and ruin everyone else's dinner also if i pay for a babysitter to have peace and quiet with my husband why should i have to eat my dinner listening to little joey antagonize his sister anyone else agree hey yourmoms for the record i'm not nasty in a restaurant to people who bring good kids or bad kids i'm complaining here instead so back off if it costs me for two meals and we don't drink it's not a family restaurant the napkins are certainly cloth and the plates aren't plastic by family restaurants are fair game i just meant that i'd never complain if there were kids acting crazy at a restaurant like bob evens or fazoli's yes my husband and i taught our children at a young age that they were to have at home manners and in public manners they were told that when we were out in public if they couldn't behave we would leave whatever it was we doing immediately and go home we told them we didn't care if we were dining out at the movies shopping for them etc it made no difference we also told them that when we got home they would have time out and take away their privileges they only tested us once in a restaurant when they were real little or years old and we held true to our word they never misbehaved in public again they are now grown and are just starting out with their own children and they have assured us that they too will have home and public manners as for others' children if they are rowdy and running around we simply ask to be seated somewhere else if that is not possible we either speak to the manager or to the parents directly but we are also very quick to tell other parents on our way out how well behaved their children are Humphrey Bogart Calvin and Hobbes Friends Shaggy dog story Knots Landing The Apprentice 2 The Life and Times of Juniper Lee The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Ron and Fez 1957 World Series Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Bart Sells His Soul Restaurant Theory of conduct Recurring South Park characters The Fairly OddParents 10 Things I Hate About You Mojave people One Tree Hill (TV series) Futurama (TV series - season 5) Customs and etiquette of Japan The Human Stain Stewie Griffin Little Britain Kitchen Cuisine of Denmark Eddie Guerrero Doug Pitaten 613 mitzvot Time Out of Mind Hey Arnold!
