what do you do about a present you can't use a friend of mine gave me some nice perfume as a birthday gift the problem is i'm allergic to most perfumes i apologized and explained that i can't use perfume she took it well but i still feel bad should i have just accepted it and not said anything she would have found out sooner or later about my allergy and i was afraid that would make it worse if i didn't tell her and she found out later you did the right thing if she is a close friend because as you say she will find out that you couldn't have used it if she is just a casual acquaintance you would just thank her graciously well you should thank her graciously no matter what and quietly return it pass it on or dispose of it later Shaggy dog story Justification (theology) One Tree Hill (TV series) Angel One (TNG episode) Humphrey Bogart God Emperor of Dune Theory of conduct Social rule Kasparov versus The World Free will Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Socrates Symbiosis (TNG episode) Perfume Allergy Scientology beliefs and practices Birthday The Smoking Room Missouri Compromise The writing of Principia Mathematica DNA__ Honey and Clover Pok__mon Live!
