how politely invite friends to dinner but tell them they will have to pay for their own meals read more my girls are year and weeks apart every year we throw one large family friends party at our house on a day that falls between our girls birthdays on each girl s actual birthday we do a small scale day catered to them with immediate family this year my daughter wants to go to chuck e cheese how do we invite grandparents and her closest cousins parents to come hang out and have fun but make it clear that if they come they will need to pay for their own food drinks game tokens i'm not being cheep i just can't afford to throw huge dinner party usually around people come and two small parties every year grandparents and sister brother in law their kids come i learned the hard way last year i was stuck with the bill at chuck e cheese for plus the large party costs on top of it i'm not made of money how is the most polite way to tell immediate family they are welcome to come join but pay their own way thanks in advance this is a verbal invite last minute since her birthday is next week i don't want to pay for anyone since in another weeks i will be hosting the family friends party at my house feeding them dinner and giving treat bags my daughter wants grandma grandpa and aunt uncle cousins to be part of her special day last year we did the same verbal invitation and i thought everyone would understand they were on their own but instead they all ordered what they wanted and never pitched in when the bill came i think a nice way to say this essentially without saying it is to use the phrase dutch saying this works fold it gets the point across it says that this practice is not only socially pertinent but widespread Family Hey Arnold!
