i am a waitress ane one thing i have trouble with is how to tell a guest to control their child help as a mother i'm compelled to answer sometimes it is not easy to control a child in public some kids are good in public some are not some children act out in public to get attention why who knows it just happens more than likely the child is like that at home then there are some parents who let their child be like that you can never tell maybe they have a disorder or condition that makes them act out you have to take in account that it's not entirely the parents fault my middle son for example is autisic it is a neurological disorder it is something i cannot control for instance i was at a resturant with my child and family and he cried and yelled because he didn't want to sit down i was about in tears there's nothing i could have done i tried giving him toys crayons and paper nothing worked until the food came then he calmed down i'm sure those parents you speak of was embarrassed and upset talk to your boss ask him what you should do don't just take it into your own hands you very well could have an angry parent in your face and without a job Friends Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Asperger syndrome Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Little Britain Rain Man The Critic Kodocha Breastfeeding Social rule Milton H.
