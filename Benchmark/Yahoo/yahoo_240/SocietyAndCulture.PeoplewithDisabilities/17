do you ever feel like 'damaged goods' a year ago i became permanently disabiled and it has hindered me from working or ever having a relationship again whenever i start feeling i have no purpose anymore i tell myself i have to create new purposes for myself now but to reflect on how i once was and how i am now always makes me feel a little down how do you get past these blues you will go through a grieving process its only natural because you have suffered a loss after a year you should be recovering from the grief over your loss its the same as grieving the death of someone because you did lose someone yourself after my accident i would sit at the table looking out my window and think i will never climb another mountain i will never get up on a beautiful morning like this and go running again i will never go skiing again everyone has a job and i dont etc i felt very isolated very lonely very alone and forgotten i felt as if i would spend the rest of my life looking out the window watching people with lives while i had none i was a type a personality before my accident my husband walked out on me and the kids i didnt go out with anyone for years but during that time i was reinventing myself coming to grips with who i was now finding my way in a new world you will always have memories of the things you did and part of you will always feel a little sad always think i wish i could go running but thats okay too as long as your focus doesnt become what you cant do and not what you can do you have to learn to acknowledge yah that was good its sad i cant do that anymore but i have good memories memories are for looking back on and thinking it was a good time they arent supposed to be where we live our day to day lives i still feel sad when i think of my fiance who was killed i wish he was still alive but thats the past i focus on the memories of the good times together not on the fact that he isnt here anymore because thats life some of us suffer losses they hurt we treasure the memories thank god we did have the change to do the things we did love the people who came into our lives and we file them back into our memory box and look at what we can do today i had my kids and they kept me busy all the time one thing i could do was be an asst coach for minor baseball my son's team that was my recreation for those years i had to force myself to get out and do things swimming i went horse back riding on a very slow old horse i couldnt handle the high powered fiesty ones anymore because of my upper body injury my son would say mom you cant climb anymore but lets go hiking you go as far as you can and we will go ahead for a little ways sit down here wait for us here is your water your sun screen see you in about minutes my hiking was is about five minutes of walking and i have to sit down but i can feel the peace of being there appreciate the beauty of nature i am out where i used to be and want to be you learn to appreciate small steps i could say whats the point but just being out and part of their lives and breathing the fresh air is better than sitting at home doing nothing it feels good sometimes i cry because i cant go on and climb even a hill but its still worth it after awhile you stop crying i remember one day he brought a friend out to the house who had a motorcycle and announced i was going for a ride he told his friend to get it up to about kph on the highway it was fun i couldnt handle a bike because of my disability but it was fun for me you do what you can of what you used to do and you learn its better than nothing and after awhile you start to enjoy life on a smaller scale you learn to seize the day carpe diem i was on the island saw a tall ship and decided right there i was going sailing on it you learn not to think about it do it another time i was never an impulsive person before my accident but that day i talked to the guy who had the ship plunked down and went sailing for four hours it was amazing after my accident i lost all but three of my friends the rest just faded away because i couldnt do things with them anymore so i know how hard it is you dont say what your disability is or how severe it is maybe god shut the door maybe he only opened the window a tiny crack but you have to think of things you can do and you have to make yourself do them dont rush into a relationship this time is for you and about you you need to get to know the new you and come to grips with that learn to like the new person you are who you are is inside you in your heart all the other things were stuff you did but the real you is still there and you have to find that person love that person and find ways to get that person out into the world again the really important thing is dont let yourself get so down that you start to make bad choices and allow people to take advantage of you because you arent caring for yourself and loving yourself make a plan for the next day to get yourself out and or doing something it takes more planning but you can do it you have to do it you can drown in self pity and grief or you can swim with the current and become a survivor you wont be the same person but you are still a person ask yourself today what do you need what do you want and make it happen for you carpe diem Shaggy dog story The Amber Spyglass Jon Secada Scenes from a Memory About a
