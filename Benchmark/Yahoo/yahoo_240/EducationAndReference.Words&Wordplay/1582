scriptwriting what is a beat i have been reading through some sample scripts lately and i have found the word beat being used in parenthesis between dialogue from characters now i have heard that it is mean to signify a pause but then in the same script i see the writer use pause in parenthesis as well is there a difference between the two like for example jim i'm tired a beat you should get some rest too jane i'm fine she pauses but if you really want me to leave is there any difference between either one they are essentially the same thing in the context above it appears that the second line after the beat continues the same thought while pause has her stop her train of thought reconsider and then go in a different direction in any event the use of beats and pauses in dialogue is considered archaic and shouldn't be used in a spec script doing so tells the actor that he should stand there and do nothing and actors hate to be told how they should act just write the dialogue and let the actors figure for themselves how to say it of course there are ways to imply pauses for example the above dialogue could have been written like this jim i'm tired jim yawns jim you should get some rest too jane i'm fine jim starts to stand then passes out at jane's feet he snores loudly jane but if you really want me to leave here the dialogue is broken up by action a pause is implied but the actors are happy because they are given something to do rather than stand around waiting for their next line it makes the scene more interesting hope this helps Internet slang RuneScape slang and terminology Web Ontology Language TLA Les Savy Fav LOL (Internet slang) Battlefield 2 Lag Unified Modeling Language SonicStage Military slang Acronym and initialism CORBA Fuck Taekwondo Belldandy Carl's Jr. Leet Camel David Firth Gansu Urd (Oh My Goddess!)
