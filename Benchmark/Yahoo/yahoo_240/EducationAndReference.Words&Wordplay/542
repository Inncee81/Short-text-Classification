why does the name william have an abbreviation wm there's no rd for richard or sn for steven why does willaim have an abbreviation i did a bit of searching and came upon this it was quite common to abbreviate common names like william wm and john jn as well as many other words commonly repeated in documents and letters names were very commonly abbreviated and not always the same way this list shows charles written variously as cha chal chars cha chl chle chles and chls so it's not as though the abbreviations were always standard diminutives of full names often become given names but not necessarily because of misread abbreviations i've met a few beckys and amys whose full names were not rebecca or amelia for instance hope this helps you Abbreviation Crossword Acronym and initialism Binomial nomenclature TLA Vanity Fair X American and British English differences Chinese character Medical prescription Collation Apostrophe (mark) Names of numbers in English Lisp programming language Roman numerals Suffix (name) Common Lisp Roman naming convention Diacritic William Shakespeare Japanese name Blackletter Amelia Earhart Case citation Code name Numeral system Shorthand Byte Sixty-second United States Congress Esperanto orthography Taken Decibel Hangul Infantilism Scheme programming language Common Era Rulers of Auvergne Exponentiation Master's degree Laws of Form California State Route 4 Declaration of Independence (United States) Slovak language Emacs Sudoku Playing card Set RS-232 SHA hash functions Gundam Printf Given name Chemical element MacArthur Foundation The Inside Internet slang Diminutive Metasyntactic variable Academy Award for Film Editing Pointer Bit Sonata form English plural Kanji Documentary hypothesis Autograph Grand Illusion Concentration World Wide Web Capitalization Hiberno-English Sixty-third United States Congress Katakana Vowel length ER (TV series) Tempo Endianness Mantra Name mangling Kingsley Amis Associative array Anno Domini Cross site scripting Eyeglass prescription Forth programming language Full House Academy Award for Directing Radical (Chinese character) Zoids Emmerdale Cast List Snooker Manuscript Canadian Broadcasting Corporation Markup language Portmanteau Ligature (typography) Killian documents Sugo Tetragrammaton
