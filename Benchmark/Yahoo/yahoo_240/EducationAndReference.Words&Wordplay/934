how do you use who and whom correctly what is the difference between them is there a rule i didn't read the other answers so sorry if this is redundant but whom is used when it is the object who is used when it is the subject if you don't know what that means don't worry about it the subject is self explanatory but i'll explain it anyway it is the subject of the sentence it is usually the thing in the sentence that is doing an action or is being described subjects are in caps below the dog went to the store he is awesome the girl gave her book to the boy so if it is the subject you use who for example who went to the store who is awesome who gave her book to the boy if it is the object like boy is in that last sentence you use whom the girl gave the book to whom to whom should she give the book a good and easy way to help you remember also is by trying ot answer the question with either he or him if it is he use who if it is him use whom you can remember because both him and whom end with an m so if it is then you use who went to the concert he went to the concert i should ask whom i will ask him and so on notice it is not who should i ask this is technically incorrect but obviously we all talk like this so it is perfectly fine don't worry about it but in formal writing these are the rules i hope i was helpful without being confusing Buster Keaton Night (book) Xenomorph Leet Silent Hill Australian English Lee "Scratch" Perry Tambourine Hangul The Vile Village Dog Whale Bass guitar Charades Umlaut Tuatha D__ Danann Mbira Comedy film Intelligent design French language Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Marshall Mathers LP Unity Church Silence Lex Luthor Blackfoot music Video game music Ken Nordine Phonics Music Double bass The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap Inch Owl Emo MAD Magazine Irish mythology David Wise Shit Timpani Roxy Music Definition of music Marble Madness Phoneme Lebor Gab__la __renn Tina Turner Cetacea Silent E Factory farming Music of Galicia, Cantabria and Asturias The Dark Knight Returns Shakers Silent letter Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Selling out The One With the Thumb Harrow School Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven) Altitude sickness The Jazz Singer Thief (computer game) Conducting Silent film Hebrew language Bossa nova Chopsticks George Carlin Spelling reform Tentacle (Half-Life) A Canticle for Leibowitz Reefer Madness Modernism Acoustic guitar Professor X Sperm Whale Punk rock Silent protagonist Clarinet Ney Recorder 10 Things I Hate About You Mass (liturgy) New Zealand English H Culture of Japan Dub music KMFDM Mage: The Ascension Rhyme Gladiator Lightsaber Cinerama Hearing (sense) Johann Wolfgang von Goethe Robert Schumann Middle-earth Wheel of Fortune Ska Grunge music Harp
