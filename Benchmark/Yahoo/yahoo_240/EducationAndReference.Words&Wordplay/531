what happened to spelling and grammar no one can spell or create a cognitive sentence these days what's with the bad spelling these days and the grammar is just bad some questions here i can't even understand because of it any ideas i'm not sure it has changed that much to be honest i think there have always been people who couldn't put a good sentence together to save their life the difference now is that the internet allows people who can't write to put their words into the public conciousness in the old days only people who could write well would ever be read because you had to be published for numerous people to read your work i've had the opportunity to read many personal letters written between common uneducated people from one hundred to three hundred years ago and let me tell you the average grammar in those letters isn't much better than what you find on the internet we think people one hundred years ago wrote better because we only ever read the best writings of the time but there were some real abominations then as well as long as there has been grammar it has been used poorly Spanish language Finnish language Theory of conduct English grammar Singlish American and British English differences German language Dutch language Indian English Scientology beliefs and practices Tetragrammaton Danish language Esperanto grammar Esperanto as an international language Hebrew language Literacy Leet Spanish verbs Arabic grammar Arabic alphabet Non-native pronunciations of English Slovak language Vietnamese language Linguistics Dyslexia Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Hiberno-English Arabic language Education Classical Chinese Amiga Power Finnish grammar Korean language Ethics Noah Webster Hangul Philosophy of language Philosophical Investigations Spelling reform Persian language Spoken Finnish Translation Hong Kong English Tamil language Transformational grammar Marshall McLuhan Second language acquisition Chinese language Afrikaans Chinese grammar Lojban Grammatical aspect Socrates New Zealand English House of Leaves English verbs Natural semantic metalanguage Wolof language Indonesian language Chinese character Hindi Hungarian language English spelling Names of numbers in English R__maji Whose Line Is It Anyway?
