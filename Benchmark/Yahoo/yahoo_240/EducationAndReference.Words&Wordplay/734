does this sentence make since i feel like most of my friends are becoming so distant from me i feel like is not wrong as stated previously in colloquial speech i've heard this many times by native speakers such as myself in casual conversation and there's never been a question of its meaning i feel as if is a synonym for one of its meanings the one used in the question though so may be used this way in casual speech very does seem better unless the speaker is placing emphasis on how distant the friends have become instead of the fact that they are becoming distant at all the wording is a bit awkward towards the end of the sentence and i would tend to agree that becoming so distant from me would sound better as distancing themselves from me however distancing themselves from me implies that the speaker's friends are consciously making the decision to stay away physically and or emotionally whereas becoming so distant from me can mean the speaker does not know whether the friends are doing this intentionally or not perhaps it is circumstances beyond anyone's control such as busy schedules Contemporary culture of South Korea Hiberno-English The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy My Sassy Girl MSN Messenger Profanity Spanish dialects and varieties Macbeth Iki (aesthetic ideal) Cyndi Lauper W.I.T.C.H.
