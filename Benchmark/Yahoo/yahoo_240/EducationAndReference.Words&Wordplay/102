go if you wish to answer please post your intent so i won't close on you ouch actually i don t know if i can use all of the lines you provided but i wanted to share a story anyway one of these lines reminded me of it thank god you didn't close at about o clock on morning of september my wife sarah began complaining of cramping in her abdomen that radiated toward her back it was the second time she d had that feeling in the last minutes she was due on september nine months pregnant oh great i said jokingly right when we re about to go to bed sarah replied with a half smile as if to say i can t help it i went upstairs and grabbed the stopwatch which was apparently still running since the false alarm we had earlier in the week i can t figure out how to reset it we ll just have to time the next one did you read the dang directions she snapped nevermind i got it wait strike that i just began another lap i pressed two more buttons there we go are you still having a contraction she shook her hand side to side as she exhaled a few seconds go by okay it s done i began the timer the last two were estimated to be at fifteen minutes apart we wait both of us with the same expression of fear excitement and worry on our face seven minutes later she has another contraction oh my god this is it seven minutes i can t believe it i mean no doubt he s ready to come out but i m going to bring the stuff out to the car do you need some water should i bring the tennis balls my bathing suit how about the pilates ball all this is stuff was recommended during our childbirth class as items that might come in handy during delivery ignoring the fact that it was recommended for natural delivery and she was planning on getting an epidural the next contraction didn t come for ten minutes and for the next hour they fluxuated between and minutes she decided she should get some rest i was too excited for rest so i went outside and looked at the stars the sky was very clear as i gazed up i saw two satellites pass overhead and the red streak of a meteor an hour later i went up to our room and curled up in bed she had filled out the rest of the steno pad we used to keep track of the contractions it s about am we both laid quietly in bed hoping to catch some sleep before it was time to leave after minutes she breaks the silence are you awake yes i answered i can t stop smiling the next thing i remember sarah is shaking my shoulder they ve been minutes apart for the past hour what i exclaimed that s more than the legal limit you should ve woken me it was am i stumble drunkenly out of bed brush my teeth call labor delivery give them the heads up slip on my shoes grab a quick bite to eat hee haw and away we go i remember the drive there better than anything it was cool crisp the sun was rising there was a blue tint to the air can we listen to music she asked what what did you marry me for i am your singer i proclaimed which i punctuate with happy birthday in a operatic baritone voice happy birthday dear jackson happy birthday to yoooooou she rolls her eyes at me as she scrolls through the ipod menu hits play and sets the white rectangular hunk on the dashboard still in lounge singer mode thank you very much i will be your labor coach so if you have any questions i point my finger gun at her and click my tongue twice i was seriously lacking sleep little did i know it was hours and minutes later at am on sunday september that jackson was delivered by c section hrs and minutes after contractions first started hours since either of us had a full nights sleep he was crying but it sounded more like screaming the nurse michelle who had become very familiar with us throughout the day brought him over to us held him near sarah's face for a few seconds and took him away again things got fuzzy from there i remember wheeling him toward a processing area where he was going to be weighed measured certified as having been born and fitted with an electronic bracelet my mother was waiting by the nurses station just outside the processing area she came up to the cart and looked at him in awe can i hold him she asked is it okay to hold him i haven't even gotten to hold him yet and neither has sarah i knew sarah didn't want anybody to hold him before her except me yes by all means replied one of the nurses regrettably i don't remember actually holding him then but i know i did we finished the trip to the processing area when michelle took him to get his weight the wednesday prior when we were at the hospital because we thought sarah's water had broken the doctor did an ultrasound and gave us an estimate of his weight the estimate was about pounds the estimate was a surprise to us both since we are both smaller in stature michelle put him on the digital scale and i watched the numbers on the digital readout skip up to back down to the ounces skipped around for a bit and finally settled on a number pounds ounces michelle announced holy crap oh my god seriously what the heck jackson you're such a big guy oh my god shortly after that sarah came lumbering in on a gurney but she was out of it not only was she all doped up on anaesthesia and pain killers but she had been up for hours the baby was placed on her belly and she tried breastfeeding him that went ok minutes later we were in the room we'd stay in for the next days no lights except one over jackson's head nurses were getting sarah situated in her bed and jackson just stared right in the direction of our voices during the commotion no expression on his face he just stared he stared even after the nurses left but it was am and sarah and i were both too tired to safely pick up the baby we'd waited months to hold it was a heartbreaking decision to make but we had to ask the nurse to take him to the nursery for the night once the last strand of our newborn son's hair had disappeared from view we slept this story continues up to this moment so i think i'll just stop there
