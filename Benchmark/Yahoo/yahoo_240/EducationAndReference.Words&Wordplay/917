why are there interstate highways in hawaii ask the rambler interstates in hawaii are we crazy the rambler is often asked how hawaii can have interstate highways when the roads clearly don't connect two states the question is often followed by the observation that just in case the rambler hadn't noticed hawaii doesn't share a border with any other state and is in fact miles away the blank indicates that people asking the question don't know how many miles away but they're pretty sure it's a far piece actually hawaii is miles from san francisco so it would take a structure the length of i to bridge the gap by road let's face it interstate means existing between or including different states so interstates in hawaii must be if nothing else a linguistic inconsistency why is it that people suddenly become linguists when it comes to interstates in hawaii okay okay here's the scoop for the most part the interstate system is a connected network of highways bound by the canadian and mexican borders the gulf of mexico and the atlantic and pacific oceans however hawaii has several interstate routes that are not connected to the rest of the system but are nevertheless part of it hawaii's interstate routes were an outgrowth of the statehood movement that culminated on march when president dwight d eisenhower signed legislation making hawaii a state that same year section of the federal aid highway act of directed the secretary of commerce where the u s bureau of public roads bpr was located at the time to study the need for interstate routes in alaska and hawaii after identifying possible routes the bpr evaluated them according to the same criteria applied during a expansion of the interstate system national defense system integration the value of the route as a connector between centers of population and industry service to industry fishing agriculture mining and forestry as measured by the value of products or by traffic data and population on that basis the bpr's january report to congress recommended a mile interstate network in hawaii the report recommended against designating interstate mileage in alaska the hawaii omnibus act which president eisenhower signed on july removed the limitation in federal aid highway law that the interstate system be designated only within the continental united states and provided for the regular apportionment of interstate construction ic funds to the state on august the bpr designated three routes identified as h h and h photo of hawaii's designated three routes identified as h h and h on november the federal highway administration approved the state's request for a fourth route a mile section of moanalua freeway state route that had been upgraded to interstate standards without interstate construction funds it was assigned the temporary number h a but was numbered h on december the hawaii department of transportation has chosen not to display the number on the route the rambler thinks the decision to designate interstate routes in hawaii may become clearer by adding that the interstate system is more than just a series of connected highways it is also a design concept with highways designed to handle high volumes of traffic safely and efficiently at freeway speeds moreover the interstate system is not limited to routes passing through two or more states many interstates such as circumferentials beltways and spurs are confined to one state although hawaii's interstate highways are not connected to those in the continental united states they are built to interstate standards the fact that they carry an h number rather than an i number differentiates them from the connected system of interstate routes on the continental united states update the hawaii department of transportation completed h in with the dedication ceremony held on december controversy followed the highway from start to finish but h emerged as one the most beautiful segments of the interstate system the completion of h in h has emerged as one of the most beautiful segments of the interstate system the rambler didn't want to mention it but alaska and puerto rico also have interstate highways under title united states code section the bpr fhwa designated four routes totaling miles of interstate highways in alaska puerto rico's three interstate highways total miles unlike the mileage in hawaii the mileage in alaska and puerto rico is exempt from meeting interstate design standards section c b ii states that these routes shall be designed in accordance with such geometric and construction standards as are adequate for current and probable future traffic demands and the needs of the locality of the highway alaska's interstate highways are designated a a a and a while puerto rico's routes are designated pri pri and pri 13 (number) Chinese astrology Solitaire Card game ZGMF-X12 Gundam Astray Out Frame 12 (number) Flag of the United States 4 (number) Psalms
