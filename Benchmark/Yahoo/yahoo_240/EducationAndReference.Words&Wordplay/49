specifically ya okay now i'll get to it today at pm the greatest episode in the history of tv was on it was entitled matt's love story although i have seen it several times it still brings me to the brink of no not that but it does bring me to the brink of the cut off zone separating sanity and insanity i was totally poised i had a brand new tape in the vcr i closed my curtains so the light from outside would not dance across the screen also i wanted nobody to know i was home if anyone had knocked on my door i would not have answered the show began i was laying on the couch victor french whose acting is top notch was just about to shoot matt bang down went matt he is eventully rescued by the luckiest actress that ever lived michael learned she nurses matt back to health and soon learns he has amnesia now this is very interesting matt behaves totally different with her than he ever behaved with miss kitty he is frisky sexy dear gawd he is sexy and very suggestive and romantic

falling in love at each commercial i would end the taping and run back to my computer room then after a few minutes of long commercials i would run back to the couch usually in a new york second well just before the big kissing scene was to take place i was typing madly at my keyboard this time the commercial break was tiny i heard the love music begin i screamed and ran down the hall run faster i yelled to myself i ran so fast that i slipped on a rug in the hall somehow i managed not to fall i knew the big scene was moments away the back of the couch was facing me i had no idea where the remote was i knew that time was of the essence ohhhhh did i tell you there is a small table at the back of the couch and remember i currently go to the physical therapy office twice a week it must

screamed out as i live alone it is unlikely that it could be anywhere other than where i had left it minutes earlier success i clicked on the vcr the taping resumed and then the electricity went out i sat there stunned i feel my ulcer growing i cried as i pleaded to god to please turn the power back on i hit the button all was well thank god by the time matt joined his love interest in the bedroom i was in hormone heaven i smiled like a fool as he quietly joined her for a night of love making when the show was over i lay there hugging a pillow which may never regain it's original form the
