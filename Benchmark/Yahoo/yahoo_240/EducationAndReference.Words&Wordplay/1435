missionary i am old and do not know many terms used by today's kid though i feel i'm still over the net i often find that word and guess that mmay be a position of having sex in my age i should not worry over them as that will be of no help to me still out of academic interest i want to know what it is state that or better still provide link to any picture of that missionary is a 'position' is sexual intercourse face to face woman on the bottom this term was originally used in hawaii when the 'missionaries' went and found the people there doing it 'from behind' with the woman on all fours and the man kneeling behind they said to do it 'the proper way' face to face which the pacific islanders called 'missionary sex' and i'm 'old' too but i read that when i read james a michener's hawaii in the early s so it's really not a 'youthful term' and it may be that to today's young people 'missionary' means something 'completely different' possibly refering to the actual 'people' who do missionary work for various religious groups i'd like to 'know' what the 'kids today' think 'missionary' means too Westminster Abbey Westminster York Minster City of Westminster Monastery Town Gothic architecture City status in the United Kingdom Cathedral London Westminster System State funeral Cirencester Westminster Cathedral Apse Romanesque architecture Westminster School Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 7 William Dugdale Religion in the United Kingdom Canadian House of Commons Palace of Westminster Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom Westminster Confession of Faith Presbyterianism Abbey Cathedral architecture Surrey British House of Commons Lincoln Cathedral St Paul's Cathedral Parliament of the United Kingdom Glasgow Cabinet Throne Saint Denis Basilica York Royal Assent Henry III of England Statute of Westminster 1931 West Indies Federation Diet of Japan Prime Minister Constitution Cities of London and Westminster (constituency) Abbot Reading, Berkshire Henry Purcell George II of Great Britain Anglican Church of Canada Gothic Revival architecture Sinn F__in Architecture of the United Kingdom Independent school (UK) George Peabody Coventry George Gilbert Scott Southwell Minster Richard III of England Coronation of the British monarch Christopher Wren Canterbury Cathedral Peterborough Cathedral Edward the Confessor Norman architecture Roman Catholic Church Reims Government Canada City of London Christian Ripon John Blow Fountains Abbey Roman Emperor Governor-General of Australia Home Office Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon Government of Australia Westminster tube station Palace of Whitehall Member of Parliament King Edward's Chair St Martin-in-the-Fields Church of Scotland Charles, Prince of Wales Canterbury 10 Downing Street Matthew Prior Giles Gilbert Scott Durham University Lay brother Order of the Bath The Blitz Door Charles James Fox
