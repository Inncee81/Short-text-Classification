why did j k rowling end the deathly hallows with 'all was well ' i loved the epilogue as far as the last sentence though it seems a bit anti climactic but i changed it because i wanted a more when i came to write it i wanted a very concrete statement that harry won and that the scar although it's still there it's now just a scar and i wanted to say it's over it's done and maybe a tiny bit of that was to say to people no voldemort's not rising again we're not going to have part two harry's job is done so that's why i changed it meredith vieira to all is well and you knew when you came up with that line that was it j k rowling it just felt i felt a kind of sigh and that's that felt right and i really wanted harry to have some peace Lord Voldemort Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Harry Potter: Book Seven Harry Potter Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter J.
