flip flops question i have size feet and i am pretty tall ' ' and it is so hard to wear flip flops they are so cute but my feet are so big they look like flippers or something what color would make my feet look smaller i have also noticed that the tanner your feet are the smaller they look is that true they're not that big and since you're taller it is not so out of proportion i would stay away from bright colors and anything flashy or metallic so as not to draw attention down to your feet try brown and black or even nudes you can also try to wear the smallest size you can you might be able to just fit into a size or sandal so that you don't have excess shoe area hanging off the back or front making feet appear larger since it is a sandal you don't have to worry about them being too tight or anything i wear a size but i always buy flip flops and open shoes in a or to make feet look smaller of course you should just embrace your flippers as you say they're probably not as bad as you think as for tanning making them smaller it is the same thing as wearing black to look slimmer darker color just tricks the eye into thinking something is smaller reflects light less Poker jargon Shoe Equine conformation Paul Is Dead Aerial (dance move) Physical attractiveness Footwear Shen Gong Wu Horse Skateboarding trick High-heeled shoe Dragon Booster Floppy disk Sock Undergarment Flip-flop Mattress The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Color Marching band Leopard Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hip hop collaborations Color theory Dog Hat Irish dance Wood Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Horseshoe Sunglasses Customs and etiquette of Japan Calvin and Hobbes Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Stereoscopy Punt (boat) Diving CPU cache View camera Volleyball Black Diamond Knife Human skin color Upholstery Strap-on dildo Scale model Lighting Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Nudity Rigging Cyndi Lauper Professional wrestling slang Rugby union positions Cannabis cultivation Skateboarding Paintball Combine (Half-Life 2) Pantyhose 2000 Australian Grand Prix Computer animation Battlebots Samuel Goldwyn Sunlight My Life as a Teenage Robot Shaggy dog story Garfield Pinball Tanning MS-06 Zaku II Netsuke Australian words Beagle Violin U.S. Electoral College Car handling Drawing Leggings Gas metal arc welding Tokusatsu Leather Tire New York Giants Mario Bomberman Conan the Barbarian Crocodilia Motorcycle Penguin Satchel Paige Aluminium Ninja Skinhead Washington Monument Phoebe Buffay's songs Iris (anatomy) Kimono John Hancock Tower
