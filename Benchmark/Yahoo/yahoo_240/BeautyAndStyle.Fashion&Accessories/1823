does anyone knows of a software to try on clothes trying on clothing in stores is very annoying for me as well as for a lot of men so i wonder if there is any software available in which you input your dimensions and you can try on clothes and color combinations any advice thanks in advance no there isn't the closest thing to that is something similar for hair i don't even try clothes on i just know my size and get what i like in my size on occasion i will try jeans on before i buy them but for everything else i just assume my size will fit me but if you need to try your clothes on just try them on you'll get your moneys worth that way and all it requires is some effort Suit (clothes) Kimono Kylie Minogue Goatse.cx Spice Girls Rod Stewart Pantyhose Skinhead Kilt Oasis (band) Jennifer Lopez The Beatles' influence Billie Jean Shirt The Warriors TLC Britney Spears Shorts Trousers Journey (band) The Smiths Red Hot Chili Peppers The Amazing Race Undergarment Mario Marching band Bob Jones University Alice Cooper All My Children Dragon Booster HyperText Transfer Protocol Aerial (dance move) Resident Evil 4 U2 (band) Empire Burlesque Married... with Children Destiny's Child Bringing It All Back Home Love and Theft Takeshi's Castle Duran Duran Meat Loaf Little Britain Blink-182 Great Teacher Onizuka Resident Evil (video game) Representational State Transfer Invader Zim Garfield Humphrey Bogart Hall & Oates Billboard Hot 100 Equine conformation Leon S.
