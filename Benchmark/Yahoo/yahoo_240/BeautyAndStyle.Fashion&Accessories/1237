how to shrink a black t shirt i just got a black t shirt that i ordered online and i got the smallest size i could which is a medium however it fits a little big and i want to shrink it in the wash i know if i wash it in hot water and dry it in the dryer at a hot temperature it will shrink but i don't want it to fade any ideas on how to shrink this shirt without fading it you can ask a clerk at the dry cleaners if there is some way to shrink it without using liquids which will make the design fade otherwise go to a tailer which can re seam it to make it slightly thinner and more fitting it is not that hard actually or you can see if there is another way to buy from another store with another size Dry cleaning Diving suit Upholstery Leather Washing machine Thermal power station Textile manufacturing Carbon dioxide Dishwasher Surface-mount technology Water Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Sugar beet Sand casting Sento Tire Titanium Mattress Menstrual cup Rocket fuel Vacuum cleaner Tea Yerba mate Pottery Instant coffee Clothing Sulfuric acid Fast bowling Charcoal Potassium Laundry detergent Vacuum Mario Solar power Linen Nuclear power Cookware and bakeware Hot air balloon Hard disk Tofu Air conditioning The Warriors Overclocking Coffee Gilding Plastic Soap bubble Champagne (beverage) Spark plug Ironing Agar plate Hamster Social aspects of clothing Brewery Electronic commerce Coriander Dorset Vertisol Coal Incandescent light bulb Polymer clay Stellar evolution Japanese tea ceremony Energy development Transformer Typewriter Temperature Rifle Glass Digital photography RISC Scarborough Fair Black pepper Nuclear fusion Fujian tea ceremony Ammonia USB flash drive Glacier Dress shirt Dairy Tempera Dot-com Geography of Bolivia David Beckham Sodium Paint Pebble bed reactor Ice resurfacer Wood Horse Billboard Hot 100 Jet engine Fiberglass Overkill (band) Liquid crystal Powder metallurgy Steam engine Surveillance PNG
