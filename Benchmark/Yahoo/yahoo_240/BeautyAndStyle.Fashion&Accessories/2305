what do people have against ae a f aero hco here's an example last year i hung out w the same four people everyday and they just made fun of the stores saying that only gay ppl shop there but this year i went to ae and they have cute sweaters and stuff i think that people don't like it because a they can't afford it b they think that that is only were we shop so what's the problem i love ae nd aero but it's probably because the stuff is kind of girly and preppy and they think theyre to cool to wear preppy stuff but smart preppy girls don't care and express their style anyway so stick up for yourself and who cares what they think it's your clothes not theirs good luck Billiards Japanese tea ceremony Abercrombie & Fitch Co.
