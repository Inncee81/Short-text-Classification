styles right now i feel that right now the girls with the really thin legs but bigger tummys have it made almost every top is flowy or babydoll or tunics you know and that works for them and then with the whole skinny jean thing made for them as well i love all those trends too but they dont work as well for my body ive got a flat stomach and athletic legs so the babydolls look unnecessary for me and the skinny jjeans arent as nice on me maybe trends will change soon hey i'm the same way and i just wear some nice boot cut jeans and everyone thinks their cute and even though i don't need to wear babydoll tops i bought one anyway and now i love them they are so incredibly comfy and cute and girly Good Morning, Vietnam Bob Jones University Web server Hulk Hogan HyperText Transfer Protocol Uniform Resource Locator Red Dwarf characters Pitaten Great Teacher Onizuka Preppy Knots Landing Common Unix Printing System Raffles Girls' School (Secondary) Sub-Zero Ren and Stimpy HTTP cookie Belldandy Star Wars: Galaxies Columbus, Ohio Atomic Kitten Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword The Ashlee Simpson Show Queer Eye for the Straight Guy Guy (Final Fight) Totally Spies!
