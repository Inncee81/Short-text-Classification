is there a way wear goggles in the pool and not look really dorky or maybe goggles that are fashionable i hate wearing goggles but my eyes are really sensitive i dont mind wearing goggles by myself but with friends i feel like a loser so if you know goggles that are decent look please tell hi there ask your self these questions what looks less cool wearing the goggles or having red eyes for hours afterwards how 'real' are these friends if you feel a dork in front of them my advice wear them to stop your eyes getting irritated and just act like you don't care most of the time people only notice things when you make a big deal about it yourself life is to short to worry about little things like this The Ashlee Simpson Show Diving Goggles Social rule Jennifer Lopez Nerd Snoopy Smoke-screen Cyberspace Kodocha The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog Dragon Booster Avenue Q Sex and the City Sauna Rei Ayanami Calvin and Hobbes Totally Spies!
