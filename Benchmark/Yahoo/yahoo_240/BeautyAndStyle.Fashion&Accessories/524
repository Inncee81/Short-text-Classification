what do you think of the boxer biref style men's swimsuits sort of like the ones craig wears in the bond film i am not necessarily concerned with trying to attract women etc with my swimsuit i am married i just don't like the loose fitting shorts because they float all around you in the water and you get air bubbles in them when you jump in etc loosing fitting clothes just aren't that comfortable in the water to imagine if you are a woman think of swimming in a skirt in any case like most americans i think the speedo brief looks silly i am not one of those people who is all uptight up about the male body i just think they look like tighty whities so i am wondering what you think fashion wise of the boxer brief style swimsuit as an alternative to the speedo briefs or those huge or even less huge shorts oh and btw i am not old fat excessively hairy bald sporting gold chains european etc i'm hwp have an faily athletic build thanks fashion wise they are a bit of an older style but if you have the body and are willing to do it go for it they will always look sexy on a man with confidence Speedo (suit style) Swimsuit Undergarment Swimming Speedo Briefs Swimming pool Sauna Diving G-string Clothing History of swimming Boxer shorts Skirt and dress Jeans Baldness Shoe Hair Diving suit Gender role Barbie Great Britain at the 2004 Summer Olympics Kilt Brassiere Tightlacing Karen McDougal Victorian fashion Summer Olympic Games Sin City Sexual attraction China at the 2004 Summer Olympics Toilet Triathlon Nudity Pantyhose Figure skating Trousers Buttocks Sento Jesuit College Preparatory School Little Britain High-heeled shoe Social aspects of clothing Equine conformation Cross-dressing Boxing Coat (clothing) Sex and the City YMCA South Africa at the 2004 Summer Olympics Headgear Buckingham Palace Shorts Corset Physical attractiveness One Piece minor characters Decompression sickness Bicycle Napoleon Dynamite Beard Victorian dress reform Flapper Michael Phelps Skinhead Austin Powers Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Joke Table tennis Gay slang James Bond Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue Weight training The Apprentice 2 Sari Carbon dioxide Golf Sport rowing Volleyball Aikido Sports timeline Canada at the 2004 Summer Olympics Transgender Protein Stewie Griffin Morecambe and Wise Haircut Athletics Suit (clothes) Drowning Brigham Young University Strap-on dildo Sharron Davies Genericized trademark Condom Turkey at the 2004 Summer Olympics Grunge music Domestic rabbit Beavis and Butt-head Tire Leggings
