should i yes or no question ok should i get colored contacts my eyes are light emerald and i want to make them bright emerald i have light ish brown hair with some really skinny blond highlights my mom said if i can pay for them i can and i can so should i get them or keep my eyes the same and im my eyes arent really that light but i love that green is a unique color and i want to show it and yes i know i have to have my moms permission and she said i could we just need to talk it over a litte more but i was just wondering if it would look good i would do it if i were you i think that the darker green color would look really good on you with the way that you described the way that you looked if you can pay for it and if your mom says that she thinks it would be okay i would go ahead and go for it but if it ends up that you can't get them your eye color sounds really pretty pick what you think would look best on you try to imagine yourself with either color and pick which one you like best hope this helps Eye color The Contender (television series) Hair color Sunglasses Dragon Booster The Ashlee Simpson Show Red hair Chaos Emerald Green Super Sonic The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Light-emitting diode My Little Pony Paul Is Dead Mnemonic Emerald City Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog Sonic the Hedgehog Pok__mon Emerald Negima Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water Color The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Totally Spies!
