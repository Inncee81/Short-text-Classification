where do you draw the line between being gothic and being appropriately dressed for work in case i phrased that wrong i wear black dk colors all the time and people at work are giving me a hard time making remarks like this is a business office you'd better be careful i don't understand what's wrong since i usually go to work in dress pants and nice fitted shirts it just so happens that about of the time i'm all in black with the exception of certain jobs that have required uniforms is it right for an employer to get mad because you won't wear pretty spring and summer colors if you don't have a uniform then the emploeyr can't tell you how to dress it's not like you're dressing inappropriately you're just wearing dark colours i don't think it's right at all they can't impose a personality on you HyperText Transfer Protocol Web server Uniform Resource Locator Proxy server World Wide Web Ajax (programming) HTTP cookie Teen Girl Squad Mod python Wget Google Web Accelerator Cross site scripting Computer-generated imagery CPAN Phishing Squid cache Java Servlet Server-side scripting Apparent magnitude Damn Small Linux Uniform Resource Identifier Common Gateway Interface Representational State Transfer Slashdot trolling phenomena Common Unix Printing System Website What's Happening!!
