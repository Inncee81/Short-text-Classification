would you use generic brand clothes why also is there anythign bad about name branding clothes i don't know anyone that doesn't have at least some generic clothes everyone picks up a shirt or something at walmart and has a pair of shoes from payless now that having been said you get what you pay for shoes are the exception there's nothing worse than a pair of cheap shoes that hurt and fall apart i think people should pay for quality not designer shoes there's a difference between quality excessively expensive and dirt cheap clothes most of my better clothes may come from department stores or from new york company or something but i hit up target ross cato and sometimes wal mart especially the george line for lots of stuff you know i'm just an average person i couldn't imagine paying more than about for a pair of jeans and to me that is high usually i can get pair of pants for new york co old navy etc however extremely cheap clothes fade really fast and the buttons and stuff fall off quickly there have been studies done to test a fruit of the loom t shirt with for example a tommy hilfiger shirt and they were both of equal quality i have a friend that works in a textile labratory a manufacturer can produce a single pair of jeans for about so what is the need to sell that pair for i can put that money somewhere else like buying a bra from victoria secret or buying a vanity fair bra they're both great bras offering great support and comfort but the vs bra will cost you times the amount of the other bra of equal quality all in alll go for whatever floats your boat but a penny saved is a penny earned Wal-Mart Social aspects of clothing Clothing Berkshire Hathaway Inflation Undergarment Sears Holdings Corporation Gramophone record Tommy Hilfiger Brassiere Professional wrestling slang Gross domestic product Mutual fund Nike, Inc.
