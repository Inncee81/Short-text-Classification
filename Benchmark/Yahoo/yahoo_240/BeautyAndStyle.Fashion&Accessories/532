my mom told me that sometimes guy cashiers take longer to bag a girl's purchase so he can look at her more lol i know it doesn't make sense but i forgot how she said it it made sense that way but anyways is that true because once whe i was at hollister the guy took forever to bag my clothes after i paid lol yea probably a lot of guys do things slower to be able to check out the girl or talk to her a little he was also probably giving u a chance to check him out guys will take long baging stuff so u will look up and see him dont get all freaked out about it though its not like sexual abusion or anything theres nothing really wrong with him checking u out as long as he wasnt making any nasty gestures or asking any perverted questions hope i helped Little Britain Social rule Spice Girls Recurring South Park characters Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Laura Schlessinger Full Metal Panic?
