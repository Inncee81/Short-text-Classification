can a crossdresser ever get use to wearing pantyhose i have been crossdressing for over a year now usually i would wear thigh high stockings with certain dresses and skirts recently i started wearing control top pantyhose instead i really find them uncomfortable but they do stay up better than stockings i was wondering girls will ever i get use to wearing pantyhose or will they always feel uncomfortable you will probably get used to wearing them if you wear them often but my best suggestion is that you get a size larger than you have been getting they will still bind but not as tightly so they will not be as uncomfortable Pantyhose Stocking Cross-dressing Undergarment Skirt and dress Brassiere Ranma __ characters Okashina Okashi Trousers History of corsets Strap-on dildo Gothic Lolita Tightlacing Leggings Gender role Prostate cancer Equine conformation Transgender Corset Kilt Avenue Q Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Manhunt (video game) Suit (clothes) Singapore Police Force Policing in the United Kingdom Diamond Casual Shorts The Drew Carey Show Hijab French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Crinoline Sailing Wig (hair) Clothing Skinhead Tights Milton H.
