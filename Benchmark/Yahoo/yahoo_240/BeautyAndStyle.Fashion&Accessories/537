i need your opinion on a piercing i am thinking of getting the upper cartiledge of my ear pierced i have a very low tolerance for pain so i wanted to get ideas and opinions also if you have one can you give me an idea of what i would need to do to take care of it thanks is gun or needle better i have gotten both tops of my ears done twice my left ear was punched twice in one day which i do not recomend i have low pain tolerance as well but it is really not that much worse than getting your lobes pierced the ear will be tender and sore for longer as it is healing so try as best as possible to avoid sleeping on that side as for taking care of it it is the same as for lobes get the cleaning solution and use it at least twice a day ex when you wake up and before you go to bed turn the post regularly and don't remove it for at least six weeks talk to the tech doing the piercing for any other suggestions i would suggest having it done by someone who has been doing it a while rather than a newbie at a mall store good luck there's really nothing to it Prostate cancer Earring Mattress Ear piercing instrument Stomach cancer Social rule Traumatic brain injury Psoriasis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Breastfeeding Tattoo Ear Knife Humphrey Bogart Medical prescription Theory of conduct Chronic fatigue syndrome Hypnosis Hip fracture Shaggy dog story Common cold Prince Albert piercing Marathon (sport) Milton H.
