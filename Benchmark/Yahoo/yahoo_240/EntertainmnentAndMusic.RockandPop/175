i went to the projeckt revolution wit my sis now the only songs i love is rock whats happening i'm going to try to take a stab at it since my main forte is rock depending on your age and your previous music background rock may be something that you need to fill in a void or spot in your life alot of rock these days depicts a problem or situaion in life usually along the lines of love and home life teen angst was a big topic a couple years ago so in that aspect you may be using the lyrics and their message to help feel connected with what you are facing in life another view could be the fashion and portrayed lifestyles of the rock star and their fans i have a show planned for the end of this month for example and its nice to go out and have my adenaline pumped and release that energy finally the last thing i can think of is that rock is just awesome to listen to it has hard chords and strong vocals and it makes your blood flow you may have been just caught up in the excitement i saw linkin park a couple years ago myself and it was an awesome show hope this helped i know of a few bands myself if you ever want to dig deeper Grunge music A Day in the Life Red Hot Chili Peppers Rock (music) Linkin Park The Jam Time Out of Mind Pop punk ABBA Blood on the Tracks Blur Music of the United Kingdom (1950s and 60s) American Pie (song) Good Charlotte Music genre Nu metal Hip hop music U2 (band) I Want to Hold Your Hand Gothic rock Green Day Aerosmith Blink-182 Steely Dan The Ashlee Simpson Show Queens of the Stone Age Meteora (album) Opportunity rover Nine Inch Nails Death rock Heavy metal music Therion (band) Pearl Jam Timeline of trends in music (2000-present) The Who The Beach Boys Scenes from a Memory Van Halen Quarashi Roxette Judas Priest Jethro Tull (band) Tanya Donelly Bringing It All Back Home Blues John Frusciante The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars Love and Theft Sonic Youth Queen (band) Still Not Getting Any...
