in your own words how would define high availability as it applies to mission critical applications high availabilty generally is implemented with redundancy for example an application can be running on a cluster of servers if any one of the servers goes down the remaining servers in the cluster take over and the user does not notice raid arrays are generally used with ha clusters so that if a drive goes bad the other drives in the array take over and the user does not notice networks and firewalls can be configured with redundant network paths so that if a single network component goes down the user does not notice many high availability solutions also keep statistics as to how long it took for a particular task to complete or fail or for a network connection to occur or fail these systems determine the fastest route to the fastest server and use that route server to perform the task by default the server network connection that fails is slower so it never gets picked this type of solution also does automatic load balancing because that fastest path is always used and the least used resource is generally faster Education in the United States Education in the People's Republic of China Community college Graduate school Second language acquisition German language Jewish studies Education in Hong Kong Perl SQL Literacy PLATO MySQL Otterbein College Supply and demand Managed learning environment Microsoft SQL Server Speed reading Education in Singapore GED Scientology beliefs and practices English language Education Past teachings of Prem Rawat Lisp programming language Education in Malaysia Education in Portugal Bah__'__ Faith and Education Philosophy Athabasca University Education in Australia Microsoft Access Open University (Netherlands) University of Pretoria Education in India Reiki Game programmer Victor Cousin Distance education Deconstruction Kwantlen University College Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act MDAC Study abroad Adult education Database Air Education and Training Command American and British English differences American University Rudolf Hermann Lotze Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Seneca College Esperanto as an international language Medical school Higher education in Japan Heidelberg College Tuition University of Massachusetts Amherst Alternative medicine Philosophy of language Insurance Cross site scripting Anti-intellectualism College Requirements analysis Trinity College, Dublin George Lakoff Thread (computer science) Oracle database Guide for the Perplexed Open access Advanced Placement Program Education in Romania York University Postmodernism Web design Current teachings of Prem Rawat Secondary education in Japan Object database Education in Albania XML Cooperative education Simplified Chinese character Second Amendment to the United States Constitution Finnish language Robert Hutchins Microsoft Logic Database management system Connecticut College Caulfield Grammar School University of Bristol Education in France University of Houston Hungarian language Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity IB Diploma Programme Cantonese (linguistics)
