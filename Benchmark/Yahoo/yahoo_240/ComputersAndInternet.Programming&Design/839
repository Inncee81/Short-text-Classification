making a webpage how to center my images my banner works great i have it centered where it needs to be when i browse it on i e it stays in the middle rather than the far left or right i am using the dreamweaver program but with my buttons i am having trouble do i create a layer and then a table and then add the image or how is it suppose to be i am trying to make all my buttons fit in the middle just like the logo but it is not happening what am i doing wrong help do not use tables tables are for tabular data not layouts center center is not a valid tag and is depreciated an ancient method so do not use that if you have your image such as img src images foo gif width height alt image in the html then use a stylesheet external and then do this img margin auto simple as that no need for ancient and monolithic code techniques needless tables and depreciated code and it is a lot less time consuming are you using these images in a menu if so you can do this ul id menu li a href page html img src foo gif width height alt button a li li a href page html img src foo gif width height alt button a li li a href page html img src foo gif width height alt button a li ul i would also suggest everyone that answered this question check out this link simplify your lives and your coding http www w org style examples center BitTorrent PHP Ajax (programming) Web page Web hosting HyperText Transfer Protocol CPAN Apache HTTP Server Internet pornography Perl Warez World Wide Web Wikimedia Commons Internet GameFAQs File sharing YTMND Uploading and downloading Gmail EMule Debian PHP-Nuke Vlog Kazaa Flickr Web server Mind transfer TikiWiki Friendster Object-SQL mapping File Transfer Protocol Second Life Uniform Resource Locator PNG Internet censorship in mainland China XMLHTTP XSL Transformations Commodore 64 Representational State Transfer Regular expression Spyware ICalendar HTML Proxy server LAMP (software bundle) Cross site scripting JSON Facebook (website) Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing Website ImageMagick Typo3 Favicon Aspect-oriented programming Phishing Macromedia Flash Differentiated services Common Unix Printing System TOC protocol Blog Scalable Vector Graphics General Packet Radio Service DCPlusPlus Download.com Streaming media Comment Web traffic GIMP Wget Forth programming language ASCII art DeviantART TeX Furcadia MSN Groups ROM hacking MySQL Web application Managed learning environment Java programming language Cascading Style Sheets Image Web design Topsite ROM image Thumbnail gallery post Netlabel Adobe Photoshop Sun Microsystems FAQ Domain name Garbage collection (computer science) MySpace Software engineering Windows API Global Positioning System Minesweeper (computer game) OpenBSD Opera (web browser)
