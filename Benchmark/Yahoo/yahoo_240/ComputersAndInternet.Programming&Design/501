is there a simple way of getting exchange public contacts into a net application this is such basic powerful functionality i'm sure it must have been done before but much as i search on google i can't find anything that works i've tried half a dozen obscure workarounds to achieve this not one of them has worked all i get is error messages from deep inside the mail api and googling them simply leads to dead ends so if anyone out there knows how to simply get a list of public exchange contacts into a net application i'd love to hear from you thanks for the csv suggestion it may be the only way but i'd prefer to have the list updated every time the application starts the reason being the user of the application isn't well versed in outlook and i don't want them having to update stuff whenever a person joins or leaves the company which is quite frequent here you can use ado to query exchange server's store for its public contacts through exchange's built in ole db driver and use it to add modify delete contacts too http msdn microsoft com en us library ms aspx i know the link above references sql server but you can use the basic concepts to connect from a net app using the system data oledb namespace Favicon Web page GIF JPEG PNG Web browser PlayStation Portable ImageMagick Mozilla Application Suite Internet Explorer Image file formats Mozilla Firefox Adobe Photoshop Portable Document Format Scalable Vector Graphics HTML Filename extension File Transfer Protocol BitTorrent XHTML Unicode Macromedia Flash HTML element Konqueror Windows Picture and Fax Viewer Pixel art Cascading Style Sheets Social Democratic Party (Portugal) Gallery of sovereign state coats of arms Web design Lossless data compression Internet pornography Bulletin board system Icon (computing) Opera (web browser) Uploading and downloading World Wide Web JPEG 2000 SWF ASCII art Gmail Macintosh Finder MNG Wiki AmigaOS Internet Explorer for Mac Uniform Resource Locator Comparison of web browsers Cross site scripting XML Robots Exclusion Standard Graphics VRML Comparison of layout engines (graphics) Gallery of flags based on British ensigns Web analytics EMule Ebook Browser wars Mouse (computing) File format Flags of non-sovereign nations CompuServe ITunes RSS (file format) Pixel Gallery of flags by design KHTML Screenshot Flickr Web hosting Common Unix Printing System Netscape Navigator ROM hacking JavaScript Unicode and HTML Comparison of media players MySpace XForms Debian Apostrophe (mark) Netscape Browser Dither Website Ico (video game) Pipeline (Unix) Hyperlink AOL Instant Messenger Kazaa Captain Sega Dreamcast PlayStation 2 Trusted computing Caldas da Rainha Mac OS X Microbrowser Wallpaper group Blogger Representational State Transfer Data compression
