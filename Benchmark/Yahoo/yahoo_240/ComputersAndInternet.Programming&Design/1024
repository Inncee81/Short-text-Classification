dpi of an image i want to print one of my artworks but i've heard it's best to have an image at dpi my jpg version of the image is at dpi how do i convert it to dpi i also have the psd version of my artwork i already have photoshop that's why i said i have the psd version of the artwork image sizing is a fairly common feature in any image editor photoshop any version would do the trick but as you say the package is rather expensive especially if all you need it for is to set the dpi of a few images gimp is a graphic image manipulation program that can do just about everything that photoshop can do and this includes resetting the dpi of the image http www gimp org windows that is the link for the windows version if you are working on mac or linux then go to the downloads area and get the appropriate version another package is imagemagick imagemagick is a software library that focuses on converting resizing and editing images as a programmer you would be much more excited about it but for your needs the binary windows installation comes with an image editor which will allow you to re size and alter the dpi settings of the image download and install the dynamic at bits per pixel first one on the list for the windows versions http www imagemagick org script binary releases php dpi is dots per inch so when you change the dpi from or to the images size on your screen is going to change quite a bit also using dpi images is going to make the mspublisher files much larger i would not be surprised if a meg project suddenly became a or meg project note both of those image packages are free open source projects hope this will help cheers HyperText Transfer Protocol Cross site scripting Stopping e-mail abuse SAML Phishing HTML element Gmail Uniform Resource Locator Search engine optimization HTML MIME Web page E-mail spam Common Unix Printing System Web browser Password RuneScape cheats Spamdexing Spam (electronic) World Wide Web PHP Proxy server Website Web server Character encodings in HTML Digest access authentication XML Unicode and HTML JavaServer Pages Independent Media Center Web design GameFAQs Internet fraud Computer virus Uniform Resource Identifier Simple Mail Transfer Protocol AutoComplete Wget HTTP cookie Representational State Transfer E-mail Hello world program Unicode Google bomb File format Web traffic Mozilla Application Suite Blue screen of death XHTML Neopets Ebook Transmission Control Protocol Slashdot subculture Lotus Notes Spyware REBOL Mozilla Firefox Domain Name System Whois Denial-of-service attack America Online City of Heroes Web crawler Perl Animal Crossing Malware Steganography LaTeX Google search Python programming language Captcha Open Directory Project Buffer overflow Internet Message Access Protocol AmigaOS Netscape Navigator Unicode and e-mail Wiki ICalendar Base64 Logo programming language Metaphor 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines The Best Page in the Universe Mydoom Combat Mission (computer game series)
