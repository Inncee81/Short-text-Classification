what is the difference between a binarywriter and a streamwriter as much information as you can provide would be very much appreciated also my ultimate goal is to be able to save an object a very simple object what kind of writer do i need to do that the key top serializing an entire class model is the binaryformatter class found in the runtimeserialization formatters binary namespace note the entire name of the namespace does not display properly in this answers editor answers editor truncates the name due to the series of dots used you must look up the full name of the namespace and make the appropriate changes basically the class's serialize method stores each member variable of the specified object in turn a a binary image of its data in memory when a member variable is in fact a non value member it stores an image of each member variable of that owned object and so on until the entire object model has been persisted for it to do this every class in the object model must be marked with the serializable attribute the result is a binary file of data that can be used to reconstruct the object model let's say that you are closing a form frmmyform that has used a instance instanceof myclass which is an instance of a class called myclass to serialize the class instance called instanceof myclass private sub frmmyform closing first mark the class as serializable with the class attribute marker serializable serializable myclass 'class members 'class properties 'class methods end class dim filename as string c data bin yourclass dat dim str as new io filestream filename io filemode create dim b as new runtime serialization formatters binary binaryformatter b serialize str instanceof myclass end sub 'sub frmmyrform closing to de serialize the object when your re load frmyourform private sub frmmyform load dim filename as string c data bin yourclass dat 'declare an instance of your class dim newinstanceof myclass as myclass if io file exists filename then dim str as new io filestream filename io filemode open dim b as new runtime serialization formaters binary binaryformatter 'cast the resulting objet to the correct type to complete the de serialization process newinstanceof myclass ctype b deserialize str instanceof myclass str close end if end sub Uniform Resource Locator Gmail Phishing Computer Software engineering Cross site scripting World Wide Web Website Dog agility RuneScape cheats PHP Monopoly (game) Digital photography E-mail spam GameFAQs Ajax (programming) Surveillance Hamster Internet forum System/36 Lighting Domain Name System Monetary policy Atari 8-bit family CDC 6600 IPod BASIC programming language Supply and demand Option Autonomous building Pretty Good Privacy Fancy rat SAML Mac OS X Domestic rabbit Hong Kong International Airport The Apprentice 2 USB flash drive Cat Commodore 64 America Online Solar cell Sears Holdings Corporation Internet fraud Web design Sega Saturn Circuit design Password Shau Kei Wan Magic: The Gathering Oscilloscope HTML Solar power Wal-Mart Web crawler Web page Mortgage Ecco the Dolphin History of the Internet Apple Macintosh Border Collie CPU design The Standard REBOL Poker jargon Taikyoku shogi Tai shogi PLATO Ryanair XML Dairy Dog Secure Shell Textbook HyperText Transfer Protocol Hyperinflation Everything2 Gross domestic product The Best Page in the Universe Greyhound racing Stopping e-mail abuse Nintendo Jack Russell Terrier Health insurance System/34 LiveJournal Ra (board game) Federal Reserve Gold as an investment TRS-80 Apache HTTP Server Education in the United States Internet phenomenon Central processing unit
