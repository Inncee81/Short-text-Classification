in excel i have columns type apple or orange date size i need the median size by day for each fruit i am making a spreadsheet that is rather complicated so i will simplify the example say i get many crate shipments per day of either apples or oranges and each is weighed when it comes in column a contains a string of text identifying the type of fruit apple or orange column b contains the date of shipment column c contains the weight of the crate now i am proposing that on tuesdays my apple crates are coming in light and on wed and fri the orange crates are too heavy i have a large data set which updates frequently so sorting the cells by type would not work but i can add columns i want to get the median weight of all crates that came in on a tues and contain apples meet two criteria i can get median of all apple crates using median if a a apples c c and hitting ctrl shift enter i added a column d as weekday column b to give for mon etc can i add an additional bool say column a apples and column d sure median if a a apples if d d c c ctrl shift enter to input as with your formula good luck Gmail Cross site scripting HTML element Web page GameFAQs Hyperlink XML Spyware Web analytics SAML Bookmarklet Neopets Ajax (programming) Java programming language Wiki Web browser Stopping e-mail abuse Mozilla Firefox TikiWiki Trusted computing JavaScript AOL Instant Messenger Cascading Style Sheets Markup language Magic cookie BitTorrent Fritz-chip Internet privacy Cookie PNG Exception handling Netscape Navigator HTML Document Type Definition Unicode Windows XP MySQL Web application Uniform Resource Identifier World Wide Web Representational State Transfer Internet forum Google search Novell NetWare Medical prescription Google ALGOL 68 IPv4 Cache Enterprise content management Uniform Resource Locator Online shop FAQ XForms Macromedia Flash Library catalog Client-side scripting Associative array Girl Scout cookies Single sign-on Portable Document Format Emacs Wireless Application Protocol Browser wars Typeface Comparison of web browsers Halting problem Unicode and HTML Computer accessibility Favicon Aspect-oriented programming Knoppix Google Web Accelerator HyperText Transfer Protocol Document Object Model Radar Off By One Buffalo Bills PHP-Nuke Internet Explorer Apache HTTP Server Captcha Malware Malignant melanoma Philippine peso Mozilla Application Suite APL programming language Common Gateway Interface Patent NetCaptor Blue screen of death Control flow USA PATRIOT Act The Internet Movie Database American Football League Object-oriented programming
