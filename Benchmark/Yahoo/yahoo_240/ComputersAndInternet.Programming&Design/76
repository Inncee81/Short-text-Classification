how to create front and back on one page am using exel please help when you go to file print from the menu there should be a button to the right next to the printer drop down list that's labeled properties click on that button and the printer's properties dialog will appear the layout of that dialog will be different for each printer model so i can only describe in general rather than specific terms but what you want to look for is a checkbox that's labeled duplex if your printer supports duplex printing then it will print on both sides of the paper mark that checkbox and click ok then print your document it depends on the features of your printer how much manual intervention you have to do some printers support automatic duplexing printing on both sides where other printers typically inkjet printers or printers meant for home use will print one side first then you must remove the paper turn it over and put it back into the paper feed before it prints the other side your printer software will prompt you if your printer does not support duplexing then you can do it manually by first printing off the odd pages turning over your paper and rearranging the order so the first page is on top then printing off the even pages Inkjet printer Laser printer Computer printer Typewriter WYSIWYG Dot matrix printer Portable Document Format Mouse (computing) Konica Minolta Windows XP Atari 8-bit family IPod Medical prescription PostScript Hello world program Markup language Control character Apple typography System 7 (Macintosh) Mozilla Firefox Mac OS X v10.4 Printed circuit board Mac OS X Danger Hiptop ZX Spectrum Macromedia Flash Photocopying Digital photography Embedded system Gmail Ethernet Fischer Random Chess Xerox Star Macintosh Finder AmigaOS AppleScript Object Desktop Perl Search engine optimization Bluetooth Fax Slide rule Dots per inch Cascading Style Sheets M16 (rifle) Screenshot Class (computer science) Universal Serial Bus Visual Basic System/36 Killian documents Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Printing press Esperanto orthography Opera (web browser) Typeface Xerox Palm OS Nintendo GameCube TeX Microsoft Windows Publishing Ebook Comparison of web browsers TGV C plus plus PHP Cocoa (API) 2D computer graphics Floppy disk Typesetting ITunes OpenDocument System/34 Apple Macintosh Color management Newline Minesweeper (computer game) GNU Free Documentation License Windows Vista Podcasting Manual transmission Software architecture Thermal printer Uniform Resource Locator Printer Control Language Bookbinding Photography Windows 2000 GDI Unicode AppleTalk On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences
