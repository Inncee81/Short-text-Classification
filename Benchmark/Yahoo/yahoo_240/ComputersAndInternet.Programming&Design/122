whats the best way to incorporate msacess and mysql designed a database that has or so records in a table that are being hosted on line and this information is being fed into a ms access database with cool user interfaces etc with obdc links etc it works ok and is reasonably fast in the map mouse clicking part but when i do more of a refined search for information it crashes and stops is it common practice to fill and empty a temporary msaccess db table with mysql data in this situation and run search queries off that while its updated or do can you query live data from msql with ms access very quickly and i'm doing it wrong thanks in advance you shouldn't need a temporary table to do a search if you have a table defined in access that is linked to a table in mysql you should just search the access table creating a temp table will use a lot of resources HTTP cookie BitTorrent Apache HTTP Server Website Electronic commerce Streaming media HyperText Transfer Protocol Web hosting Uniform Resource Locator Windows Server 2003 JavaServer Pages Flickr Session Initiation Protocol Proxy server Server Web browser WebSphere Web server Windows XP Sun Microsystems Thin client Internet Lotus Notes Jakarta Tomcat MMORPG Apple Computer Windows 2000 Video game developer GameSpot Transport Layer Security Web crawler Internet fraud Web service WebDAV Computer Netscape Communications Corporation Network address translation User agent Wget Google Web Accelerator Real Time Streaming Protocol Peer-to-peer Squid cache World Wide Web E-mail spam Video game crash of 1983 MSN Messenger Freenet Virtual hosting Etisalat Webmail ROM image I2P Storage area network Internet pornography Representational State Transfer Application server Secure Shell File system IBM PC compatible XML Microsoft History of Microsoft Windows File Transfer Protocol Google PlayStation 3 Common Unix Printing System Web traffic Care Bears Gnutella Spyware Cross site scripting Network-attached storage Files-11 Denial-of-service attack Warez Nintendo GameCube Active Directory Sequent Computer Systems Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Ajax (programming) IPlanet Opera (web browser) Internet Information Services Transmission Control Protocol Port numbers IBM PC The Great Race (Care Bears) Base64 Mainframe computer Yahoo!
