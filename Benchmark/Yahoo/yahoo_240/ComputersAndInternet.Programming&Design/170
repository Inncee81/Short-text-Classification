what is the latest programming language i need to make a written assingment on latest programming language who it'sdeveloper anyone know about it in broad strokes programming languages divide into programming paradigms and a classification by intended domain of use paradigms include procedural programming object oriented programming functional programming and logic programming some languages are hybrids of paradigms or multi paradigmatic an assembly language is not so much a paradigm as a direct model of an underlying machine architecture by purpose programming languages might be considered general purpose system programming languages scripting languages domain specific languages or concurrent distributed languages or a combination of these generations of programing languages the history of computer development is often referred to in reference to the different generations of computing devices each generation of computer is characterized by a major technological development that fundamentally changed the way computers operate resulting in increasingly smaller cheaper more powerful and more efficient and reliable devices read about each generation and the developments that led to the current devices that we use today first generation vacuum tubes the first computers used vacuum tubes for circuitry and magnetic drums for memory and were often enormous taking up entire rooms they were very expensive to operate and in addition to using a great deal of electricity generated a lot of heat which was often the cause of malfunctions first generation computers relied on machine language to perform operations and they could only solve one problem at a time input was based on punched cards and paper tape and output was displayed on printouts the univac and eniac computers are examples of first generation computing devices the univac was the first commercial computer delivered to a business client the u s census bureau in second generation transistors transistors replaced vacuum tubes and ushered in the second generation of computers the transistor was invented in but did not see widespread use in computers until the late s the transistor was far superior to the vacuum tube allowing computers to become smaller faster cheaper more energy efficient and more reliable than their first generation predecessors though the transistor still generated a great deal of heat that subjected the computer to damage it was a vast improvement over the vacuum tube second generation computers still relied on punched cards for input and printouts for output second generation computers moved from cryptic binary machine language to symbolic or assembly languages which allowed programmers to specify instructions in words high level programming languages were also being developed at this time such as early versions of cobol and fortran these were also the first computers that stored their instructions in their memory which moved from a magnetic drum to magnetic core technology the first computers of this generation were developed for the atomic energy industry third generation integrated circuits the development of the integrated circuit was the hallmark of the third generation of computers transistors were miniaturized and placed on silicon chips called semiconductors which drastically increased the speed and efficiency of computers instead of punched cards and printouts users interacted with third generation computers through keyboards and monitors and interfaced with an operating system which allowed the device to run many different applications at one time with a central program that monitored the memory computers for the first time became accessible to a mass audience because they were smaller and cheaper than their predecessors fourth generation present microprocessors the microprocessor brought the fourth generation of computers as thousands of integrated circuits were built onto a single silicon chip what in the first generation filled an entire room could now fit in the palm of the hand the intel chip developed in located all the components of the computer from the central processing unit and memory to input output controls on a single chip in ibm introduced its first computer for the home user and in apple introduced the macintosh microprocessors also moved out of the realm of desktop computers and into many areas of life as more and more everyday products began to use microprocessors as these small computers became more powerful they could be linked together to form networks which eventually led to the development of the internet fourth generation computers also saw the development of guis the mouse and handheld devices fifth generation present and beyond artificial intelligence fifth generation computing devices based on artificial intelligence are still in development though there are some applications such as voice recognition that are being used today the use of parallel processing and superconductors is helping to make artificial intelligence a reality quantum computation and molecular and nanotechnology will radically change the face of computers in years to come the goal of fifth generation computing is to develop devices that respond to natural language input and are capable of learning and self organization hope this will solve
