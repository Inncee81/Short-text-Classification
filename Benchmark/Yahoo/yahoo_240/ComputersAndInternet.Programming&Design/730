how do i apply a transparent background in paint shop pro its driving me mad i have a logo and i just want to get rid of the white square around it so just keeping the text and logo i know there must be a straightforward way to do it can anyone help i'm using jasc paint shop pro i believe yes thats really helpful thanks i'm actually getting somewhere but i do think that the quality looks a bit dodgy when i save it as a gif is there a way of just extracting the text so in effect there is no background at all currently the only image format options that support transparent backgrounds are gif or png files due to the myriad of browsers being used and the smaller file size i'd recommend saving your image as a gif it is one of the most commonly used image files to save a psp file with a transparent background as a transparent gif in paint shop pro use the gif optimizer file export gif optimizer click on the transparency tab and select 'existing image or layer transparency' click 'ok' name and save your transparent gif edit yes the quality does diminish in many images because gifs are limited to display in only colors sorry if i misunderstood your original question i hope i am correctly thinking that you want to remove a current background from your image see if any of these 'removing background' tutorials written for psp and earlier willl help you http www jaychantell com pspbackground htm http www snowgirldesigns com bgrtut html http graphicssoft about com od paintshoppro l blremovebackg htm http www hypergurl com unwanted html http www bingoware com cutouts here's a tutorial about how to create an image and export as a transparent png in psp http www ehow com how make png paintshop html note web browsers older than internet explorer do not support alpha channel transparency good luck Visual Basic Visual Basic .NET BASIC programming language C Sharp Object-oriented programming Microsoft .NET C plus plus Thread (computer science) JScript .NET JavaScript Extreme Programming Lisp programming language Game programmer Esperanto as an international language Component Object Model HyperCard Ajax (programming) Python programming language Regular expression Java platform Volleyball ASP.NET C programming language Microsoft Excel Programming language Backgammon Eiffel programming language AS/400 Aspect-oriented programming XML Second language acquisition Virtual machine Widget toolkit Neuro-linguistic programming Philosophy of language Forth programming language PHP Ada programming language ZX Spectrum Sun Microsystems Obfuscated code Embedded system GIMP Toolkit Comment Non-native pronunciations of English OpenOffice.org Turing machine OpenGL Gross domestic product History of science Control flow Dyslexia Language ALGOL 68 Standard Widget Toolkit Microsoft Visual Studio .NET Exception handling G__del's incompleteness theorem Cognitive science Computer programming Symbian OS Shogi Compiler Packages in Java Scripting language String (computer science) Objective-C AmigaOS Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Aikido Byte-code Java (island) Hexadecimal Hello world program Biblical inerrancy Windows 2000 Atari 8-bit family Microsoft Visual Studio Lie Hungarian language LaTeX German language John Titor Expert system OS/2 Linked list Japanese language Emacs French language Game programming Depreciation 0 (number) Windows Vista JADE programming language Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition ITunes X Window System
