vb need to make new controls at run time that have events i am making a quotefalls word game and need to make up to text boxes at runtime i need one event handler for all of them and i need to be able to easily iterate through all of them i was thinking in terms of an array of text boxes but maybe that won't work i read in a quote from a text file and then i need to create the grid that the letters will eventually go in for each letter in the quote if you look here http msdn microsoft com en us library kxt a vs aspx you will see everything i am talking about toward the bottom of the page except how to deal with a ton of replicated controls when defining the textbox assign its index to to do this right click on the text box in the design mode for the form to show the textbox property window where you change it's size name etc the index property defaults to nothing change it to this will create the control array the event handler will get passed the index of the control that caused the event to fire you simply have to create the th element in the array as a prototype then you can load the other instances of the textbox at run time and assign their top and left properties to place them im the appropriate place setting the default properties for the th element will set the default for the rest of the controls loaded for example dim top as integer dim left as integer dim width as integer dim height as integer height txtletter height width txtletter width top txtletter top for i to if i mod then top top height left txtletter left width end if load txtletter i left left width txtletter i top top txtletter i left left next i Microsoft FrontPage Website Web page Nvu Web browser Web template HTML MSNBC Web hosting Microsoft Office Good Morning America Browser wars Macromedia Dreamweaver Microsoft CNBC Windows NT 4.0 Search engine optimization FrontPageMag.com Weekend Update (sketch) USS Santee (CVE-29) KIRO-TV Something Awful USS Anzio (CVE-57) Linspire WCCO WTOG Server Message Block WBZ-TV Whose Line Is It Anyway?
