how to start a rap career i'am and have decided that i want to create my own music but the only thing is is that i dont know how to start off or anything but i plan on going to college for my masters in music don't listen to the other it doesn't matter if you are white as long as you keep your lyrics relevant to your life and your perspective if i was you i would try and team up with a producer if you know any or you could produce your own songs then just start trying to do shows and sell mixtapes and try and get signed also try and listen to other rap artists and find out what makes them appealing but don't copy them use their strengths and create an individual persona Mixtape Kanye West Rapping Ja Rule Quarashi The Emancipation of Mimi 50 Cent Kylie Minogue Hip hop culture Usher (entertainer) TLC Chamillionaire Gangsta rap Fort Minor Hip hop music Missy Elliott Remix Record producer Jennifer Lopez Alternative hip hop Sampling (music) Dr. Dre Estelle (singer) Benzino Punk ideology Music genre Eminem OutKast Hip hop rivalries Roxette Spice Girls Nas (rapper) Beastie Boys British hip hop Song Gothic metal BoA Real Love (song) Garth Brooks M.O.P Music of Louisiana Bohemian Rhapsody N.W.A Red Hot Chili Peppers Grammy Awards of 2005 Juggalo Reggaeton Philosophy of language The Game (rapper) Adult contemporary music Roy Orbison I Want to Hold Your Hand Grammy Award Sant Mat Mary J.
