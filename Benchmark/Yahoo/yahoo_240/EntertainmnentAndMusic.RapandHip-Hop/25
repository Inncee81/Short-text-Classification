akon has out done him self this year agree even the trouble with that underage girl she does not look and its her fault she was in a older place opinions i agree about the girl it was her the parents' and the security's fault the security didnt spot the fake id i think thats how she got in and she and the parents were both irresponsible but i dont think she got into any trouble akon did but akon was also married so he was also at fault there really its everyones fault lol but i think akon compensated a bit with his single ' sorry blame it on me' but thats akon all his songs are apologies for doing something wrong which proves he does a lot of wrong i liked 'smack that' that 'my love' j t and timbaland and numb encore remain my favourite rap collaborations also eminem is my idol figuratively in the end i like akon but not his character but i respect him for trying to revive the slightly faded thug pimp music which was is fronted by cent eminem kanye west etc nice question shame Hip hop collaborations Hip hop rivalries Single certification Usher (entertainer) Jay-Z The Game (rapper) Dr. Dre The Emancipation of Mimi Najwa Karam Encore (album) The Notorious B.I.G.
