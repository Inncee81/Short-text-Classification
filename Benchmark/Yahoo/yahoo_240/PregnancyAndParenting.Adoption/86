special name for birth mom what do you say when you refer to your childs birth mother do you call her by her first name our adoption is semi open birth mom has visited once in a year and a half and may visit again so far we have referred to her as her first name but that seems so cold and impersonal for such a special lady she's not an aunty and she's not mom what have other adoptive parents done he's months old he'll always know he was chosen he'll always know who his birthmom is even though we don't see her often just wondering what he should call her i'm a birthmom and i go by sarah we had an open adoption but i don't visit although i really appreciate that you are trying to be thoughtful of your birthmom's feelings i am totally comfortable with sarah i think that's the most appropriate you're right on about not being aunty that's awful and not mom either i'd go with her first name if you're comfortable asking why not just ask the birthmom hope this helps Adoption Thai royal and noble titles Kodocha Transsexuality Yoko Ono Angelina Jolie AFI 100 Years series Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom Charmed Laura Schlessinger Mother Breastfeeding Futurama (TV series - season 2) Anne of Great Britain Cindy Sheehan British nationality law The Fairly OddParents The Secret of NIMH Grandview, U.S.A.
