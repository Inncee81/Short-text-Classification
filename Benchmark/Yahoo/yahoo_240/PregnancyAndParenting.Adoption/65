i am thinking of foster care my kids have grown and i still need to mother go for it we have biological sons internationally adopted daughters we became foster parents a couple of years ago i'm so glad we did right now we have a year old girl with us who is a delight she'll likely be with us through the end of the school year in may we've had kids from years to years with us so far we've not had a single bad experience you can do long term foster care what most folks think of when they think of foster care you can also do emergency respite care in that case a child might stay one night with you or a week or two for respite it's when foster families need a break could be for a night or weekend or when they go on vacation can't take the foster child with them this could be for a couple weeks but probably less than that emergency care is when social services calls you for example says we have a year old girl who was removed from the home we're trying to locate other family members or a longer term placement but could she stay with you for a couple nights while we find those folks emergency respite is good for people who either typically have busy lives or their schedule isn't the most predictable you're making a short term commitment which is ideal for some folks we generally do emergency respite but we were giving emergency care to the y o who is with us right now we fell in love with each other so we told the social worker we'd like her to stay with us longer unless that wasn't what was best for her so our emergency care went into longer term foster care definitely go for it if your schedule is pretty predictable not a lot of out of state town trips or whatever consider doing long term if you can't do long term for some reason definitely consider going for emergency or respite here's a list of the foster care state agencies broken down by state so you can find out who to contact once you call them they can help you get started on your journey http library adoption com resources and information foster care specialists by state article html generally there will be classes you will attend amazing information is given in these classes they're very valuable you'll be fingerprinted have back ground and child abuse and neglect checks done there'll be paperwork to fill out a home visit by a social worker don't be stressed about this they're just making sure that your home family will be a safe and healthy place for a child they're not checking to see if you live up to martha stewart's standards oh i should add that the social worker will give you information on a child's background behavioral issues etc and you can ask questions about their behavior and stuff too you can say no to any placement if you're not comfortable bringing that child into your home for some reason it's an awesome feeling to bring kids into your home who need nurturing love guidance and stability Laura Schlessinger Infantilism Foster care About a Boy Transsexuality Strategic management Divorce One Tree Hill (TV series) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Narcissism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Kodocha Clinical depression Education in the People's Republic of China Social work The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Health insurance Theory of conduct Domestic violence Fathers' rights Poker jargon World Wide Web Marilyn Monroe Dissociative identity disorder Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Catcher in the Rye Pitaten Good Times Feral child The Ashlee Simpson Show Hikikomori Family Extreme Programming The Critic Science Stolen Generation Prostate cancer Abortion debate Borderline personality disorder Humphrey Bogart Gender role Economics Publicly funded medicine Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Friends Children of God Terri Schiavo Education Charmed Vivian Solon Social rule John the Baptist Child sexuality Cross site scripting Ethics Education in the United States Polyamory Breastfeeding Homemaker Culture The Amber Spyglass Wolfrider CPU cache Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Cliff Richard Insurance Marriage Cruising (maritime) Controlled Substances Act Soap opera Tourism American Red Cross Melanie Wilkes Destiny's Child The Shining (film) Sexual orientation Palliative care Transactional analysis Same-sex marriage Education in Germany Homeschooling Samantha Smith Community emergency response team Plame affair Constitution of Ireland Nature versus nurture Childlove movement Dog agility Jon Secada Mojave people
