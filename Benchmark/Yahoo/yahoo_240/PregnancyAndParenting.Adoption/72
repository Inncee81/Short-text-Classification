prospective fosterer adopter i plan someday to foster adopt i was looking over the child profiles on my state's website and i noticed that all of the children had some sort of psychological problem intermittent explosive disorder reactive attachment disorder add etc i understand that any child especially one who has spent any considerable amount of time in the system would have at least some trust issues i am wondering however if it is at all possible to find a normal child i have already dealt with too many medical issues with myself and family to rehash that again what is normal now a days i adopted crack addicted children the doctors didn't even give a chance to live they were months and yrs old they are now and have been straight a students all thru school we gave them a lot of love and support no meds we were very against the meds even though the docs and social workers wanted us to when they threw fits we held them close to us and used warm showers with all our clothes on and held them with us the water just trinkled but it calmed them in a way i never saw before one day my son was real upset i said what can i do to help you honey he was three he said i just need a warm shower so then i knew all the comfort and love worked we have a pool now they grew up to really enjoy the water and take long baths and showers to this day to relax don't be afraid to take a child with some problems if you have the love to give it was a hard yrs in the begining a real challage but we didn't give up and when you look at it in a different way i didn't go thru labor or pregnancy with them so i guess that was gods way of making me work for my wonderful children we sit down and talk a lot sit and do homework with them it really is all about the time you put into your children birth or adopted you have a good heart i pray things work out for you i spent many a nights rocking the children to sleep and watching them sleep they have a clean bill of health doctors now are doing studies and writing a book about the methods we used they said we are the most successfull story of crack addicted children they have ever experienced Childbirth Urinary incontinence Autism Sauna Theory of conduct Medicine EastEnders Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Shaggy dog story Adoption Insomnia Procrastination Social rule Pitaten Chronic fatigue syndrome Charles Darwin's illness Diving Combat stress reaction Sento Clinical depression Unemployment Drug addiction Prostate cancer Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Jon Secada Milton H.
