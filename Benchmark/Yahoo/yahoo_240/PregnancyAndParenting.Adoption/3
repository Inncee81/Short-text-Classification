i want to adopt my friend's baby it would be with the hope that she would be able to adopt the baby back at some point but i know there are no guarantees my problem is that my boyfriend is not happy at all about the idea i'm not asking him to adopt her we know it is a girl with me but to just support me with this decision it would be an independent open adoption the baby's mother would be able to see her when ever she wanted she could take her to family events or trips i want the baby to know who her real mother is but that she would now have two families that love her i have a year old myself by my ex husband and i want her to have a sibling and with the way things are between my bf and i he doesn't want kids of his own or not until he is in his s to s then i won't be having another baby for at least years another friend of mine says to go for it because she would want me to be able to do that for her if it was her situation but another says to not do it my bf loves my daughter that i have now as his own and he is a great father figure to her she calls him daddy and his parents love her as their own grandchild my problem with him right now is that he has the attitude that is she was able to have sex then she should be able to live with the consequences she wants to keep the baby but her living situation doesn't allow for it that is why i want to take care of the baby for her until she can and if it turns out that she can't then i am fully aware that i would be responsible for this child and i would love and raise her as my own no matter what were to happen are you planning on marrying your boyfriend since your daughter calls him daddy i would say and hope its pretty serious between you two and i guess you have a relationship like a married couple if so then this is a decision you both need to agree on you don't want this to tear you apart since your daughter calls him daddy it would hurt her alot maybe you could just help her long enough for her to get a place to live and keep the baby herself maybe a couple of months if she wants the baby then i wouldnt get my heart set on keeping her b c it sounds like she just needs some help and will want the baby back can they both just live with you till she can get on her feet Infantilism Knots Landing Friends Jon Secada Adoption Kodocha One Tree Hill (TV series) One Life to Live Neighbours Fathers' rights Sex and the City Theory of conduct Everwood Humphrey Bogart Pitaten Polyamory The Fairly OddParents About a Boy Hollyoaks Charmed Family Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sunset Beach (soap opera) Boston Public Baby Blues Sharon Tate Laura Schlessinger Transactional analysis Great Teacher Onizuka History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Sheryl Crow Situation comedy Saved by the Bell Marriage Divorce Will & Grace Smallville (Season 4) Domestic violence Characters of Lost Abortion debate The Lovely Bones Melanie Wilkes Days of our Lives Paradox Avenue Q Little Britain Miss Saigon Jam (TV series) Mystique (comics) Kimi Finster Cool (song) Care Bears Breastfeeding The Critic Marilyn Monroe For Better or For Worse Social rule Guiding Light Jean Grey Alois Hitler The Golden Girls Father Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Badly Drawn Kitties T'Pol The Ashlee Simpson Show Theodicy T.A.T.u.
