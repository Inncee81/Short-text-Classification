who do you think willl win the champions league arsenal liverpool barcelona who sorry wrong section im new sorry ill delete the q sorry again that's a tough question i believe that there are about ten teams capable of winning the uefa champions league manchester united haven't won the european cup for quite a while now years and i believe that they are due a win they are a great team one of the best in the world but their european record is pretty poor inter milan are one of those under rated teams they were great in the serie a least season despite the competiton being poor and they said that they will have a good crack at it this year barcelona had a bad campain last year where they bowed out to liverpool in the second reound and they will be dertimend to make that up ac milan and real madrid are both great teams with fantastic european records real madrid change their maanger far too often and i dont belive that they are the team that they once were however i wouldn't rule them out no team has succssefully defended the european ciup before but ac milan have a chance arsenal have a slim chance of winning the title so i believe that they will be dertimend to win the champions league the same goes for the chelsea in order to be considered as one of the best teams in the world and to get more fans they need to win the champions league and boss jose will be under extreme pressure to do so liverpool are a cup team but i doubt that they will be able to reach the final three times in four years but i wouldnt rule them out Alex Ferguson Newcastle United F.C. 2004-05 in English football Futebol Clube do Porto Everton F.C.
