do we have any martin truex jr fans martin truex is looking pretty good on the track i think he knows or his crew cheif just about where to run on the track he seems pretty disciplined and his car sure reminds me of earnhardt i'm really diggin' on the fact that mark martin has a chance to mentor this guy i saw martin running right behind truex just like in the old days when martin would be running behind the car that looked so cool and the car looks cool out in front i think next year will even be more fun do you think truex will win another race this season im an earnhardt fan but your right about turex and yes if he keeps driving the way he has been i think we'll see him in victory lane again this season mark martin will be a great influence on truex he's old school he can teach truex a lot drive for free the Martin Truex Jr. Dale Earnhardt, Jr. Roush Racing Dale Earnhardt Dale Earnhardt, Inc.
