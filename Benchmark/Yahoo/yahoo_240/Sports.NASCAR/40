doesn't the racing community care about the local tracks with the answers i was given to the question why so many saturday night races in cup i felt the need to ask this question i agree racing under the lights is awesome but you can go to your local track on saturday night and see some awesome races and support the next generation of drivers in the mean time the only thing nascar cares about local tracks id the sponsor fee for letting you use there name at your track i don't think nascar run enough saturday night races in the season to really hurt the local tracks and plus their tv audience is dropping due to the antics in the front office i know our local track isn't a nascar money sucking track and we were sold out last weekend and the weekend before that too it use to be a nascar track but they dropped them when they seen what they were really about in there pocket your saturday night races other than bristol and it maybe there too but the night races came about because of the heat of sitting and driving in the south during the heat of the day that is why talladega races were moved also spring and fall Ernie Irvan NASCAR Dale Earnhardt, Jr. Talladega Superspeedway Bristol Motor Speedway NASCAR Realignment Darlington Raceway Tony Stewart Stock car racing Hendrick Motorsports Roush Racing Terry Labonte Drag racing Richard Childress Racing Evernham Motorsports Busch Series NEXTEL Cup Auto racing Formula One Chip Ganassi Racing Greg Sacks Indianapolis 500 NASCAR Thunder 2004 Craftsman Truck Series Geoff Bodine Saturday Night Live Penske Racing Formula One racing Sterling Marlin Jeff Gordon Bobby Hamilton Kevin Harvick New Hampshire International Speedway Morgan-McClure Motorsports Kyle Busch Powerbomb Ayrton Senna MB2/MBV Motorsports Bill Elliott Martin Truex Jr. Tim Richmond Jimmie Johnson Have I Got News For You Bill Davis Racing Sim racing Mark Martin (NASCAR) Brett Bodine NASCAR Video Games Rusty Wallace Dover International Speedway NASCAR Rookie of the Year Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Grand Prix Legends Riverside International Raceway Richard Petty Bobby Allison Indianapolis Motor Speedway Dirt track racing Rich Bickle Darrell Waltrip May 2005 in sports Adam Petty Restrictor plates Casey Atwood Professional wrestling throws Matt Kenseth Atlanta Motor Speedway Tobacco advertising Joe Gibbs Racing Weekend Update (sketch) Nashville Superspeedway The Adventures of Pete & Pete Bobby Hillin, Jr. Jeff Green (NASCAR) Major League Baseball television contracts Plymouth Superbird Alan Kulwicki Mike Alfonso California Speedway Robby Gordon Safety car Bon Jovi Elliott Sadler Friends Carburetor Rosa Parks Las Vegas Motor Speedway Pocono Raceway Texas Motor Speedway Dale Earnhardt, Inc.
