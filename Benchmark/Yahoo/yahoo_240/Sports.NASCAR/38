who thinks that of races is a small i my self say that is more than the season that is effected how can you consider that as being a small percentage if nascar feels the need to run saturday night races they should consider running them in march early april then again in october the local tracks some of them don't start until april and are finished by the end of september and how to the answer that yes nascar cares because many local track have weekly nascar sanctioned races how does that prove they care i am still trying to figure out what these tracks get from nascar by running there series all i see is the tracks charging twice the amount of money and paying the least amount how can be small it's over half i don't think nascar even considers this in their decisions it's outside their realm of caring unfortunately go jr NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Craftsman Truck Series Stock car racing Auto racing Bristol Motor Speedway Ernie Irvan Watkins Glen International NASCAR Realignment Tony Stewart Penske Racing Roush Racing Joe Gibbs Kyle Busch NASCAR Rookie of the Year Dale Earnhardt, Jr. Kevin Harvick Drag racing Rich Bickle Geoff Bodine New Hampshire International Speedway Busch Series Sterling Marlin Nashville Superspeedway Formula One racing Billboard Hot 100 Indianapolis Motor Speedway Jimmie Johnson Darlington Raceway Herb Thomas Talladega Superspeedway Greg Sacks Martin Truex Jr. The Amazing Race Dale Earnhardt Lake Speed Formula One Carl Edwards Terry Labonte Hendrick Motorsports International Motor Sports Association Chip Ganassi Racing Casey Atwood Matt Kenseth Jeff Green (NASCAR) Lowe's Motor Speedway Daytona International Speedway Blackjack Mark Martin (NASCAR) Bobby Hamilton Indianapolis 500 NASCAR Video Games California Speedway Ayrton Senna Ashton Lewis Fox Broadcasting Company Dan Gurney May 2005 in sports Sim racing Evernham Motorsports Richard Petty Indy Racing League Grand-Am Jamie McMurray Yu-Gi-Oh!
