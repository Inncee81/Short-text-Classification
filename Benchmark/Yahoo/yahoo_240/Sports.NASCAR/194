why are nascar shirts and hats so tacky seriously have you seen these shirts and hats they're always so gawdy and tacky they just look awful i'm a nascar fan but i wouldn't be caught dead in public wearing one of my drivers shirts loud logos and designs all over them it's just ugly why don't retailers try to simplify the designs to sell more merchandise there are some out there that aren't so loud and tacky i've got a plain red t shirt with the number logo on it and that's it and my brother has a tony stewart shirt that just has the and tony's signature on it i agree though i've seen a lot of overly loud t shirts with logos and things everywhere across them i'd never wear them give me a simple fan shirt anyday Gucci Abercrombie & Fitch Co.
