with all the nascar teams merging what's gonna happen when they all merge into one huge team i know it can't happen because of nascars limit rule but what if its not a bad thing if some of theses smaller teams merge but face it the big teams have more money than the smaller ones more money means better equipment and better cars week in and week out so this is a good thing for the smaller teams because they will get better cars i think this should make nascar more competitive i like mikey but look at him when he was with dei he had good cars every week now that he is on his own he cant even make a race but as a whole i think this is a good thing for nascar NASCAR Dale Earnhardt Major professional sports league Dale Earnhardt, Inc.
