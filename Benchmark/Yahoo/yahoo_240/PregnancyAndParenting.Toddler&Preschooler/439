parents what do you think of my discipline method just the other day we wrote down a discipline plan for our just turned year old he's overall a well behaved child and we would like to keep it that way we do have our bad days though i tend to be pretty lienent and permissive that's just my parenting style i guess anyway looking for feedback from experienced parents or whomever cares to answer what do people think about this what's missing anything that won't work save yelling 'no' for dangerous activities instead of saying 'no' or 'don't ' show or tell the correct way to do something or simply distract with something else three strikes meaning that he gets two warnings to stop a behavior and on the third he gets the object of misuse taken away reward for good behavior verbally or with hugs etc be consistent about what is and is not acceptable behavior not strict enough any suggestions thanks pardon my spelling errors my checker never works on here brilliant love it also conside the idea of house rules pick three rules and stick them on the fridge leave them there choose really important things that are simple mine are no hitting or hurting others we listen to each other no arguing after mummy says enough is enough but at the same time don't be afraid to show controlled anger if something really inappropriate occurs not anger which belittles the child but anger which is a firm absolutely disapproving emotion mostly because kids do need to understand that humans have a range of emotions and when a child sees that an adult can be angry and still not lose their cool still be respectful and not throw a tantrum then they understand better how to handle their own anger it's a principle of modelling anger management because all kids do experience anger and rage and they need to see safe productive ways of handling and directing those negative emotions good luck oh and i agree that there should not be three strikes it's like saying someone can get in a free hit you know in life we often do not get three strikes if i hit someone i won't be given three chances i'll be charged and prosecuted serious misbehaviour should be given its consequence immediately on the first occasion after two or three occurrences cheers Theory of conduct Domestic violence Transactional analysis Extreme Programming Social psychology Traumatic incident reduction Spanking Motivation Narcissism Second language acquisition Economics Sexual orientation Autism Goodness and value theory Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Internet troll Theodicy Electrophysiology Dog training Anger management Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Asperger syndrome Milton H.
