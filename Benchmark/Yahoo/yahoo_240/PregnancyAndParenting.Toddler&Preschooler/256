parents please respond if you've had this problem too i just want to know how worried should i be and if any other parents out there have this problem and did it change what did you do to change the problem my son just turned years old and will only go to the potty if you tell him too but won't pee or boo boo on his own i tried putting little boy underwear on him but he would just go right in them he can sing one of his cartoon theme songs word for word and has an excellent memory but speaks like this can i have some juice instead he says mommy juicy i want to watch shrek instead he says shrek mommy yes i read to him and have been trying to potty train him for almost a year now he also knows all his numbers colors and can read recognize some smaller words cat mommy daddy his name dog hat etc i would appreciate any helpful suggestions please keep sarcasm to yourself thanks he used to not even want to feed himself at all or eat things that are too hard his doctor suggest to me to take him to a therapist to help him with this problem i just decided to keep working with him instead and now he feeds himself just fine and eats some hard things i think he was afraid of choking but i've taught him to chew his foods for a while before swallowing i'm not against therapy at all but i would rather try to help my son accomplish these hurdles myself first before giving up on him i think it is a year old thing my daughter did it when she was and now my son is doing it too instead of asking for a snack he will say nacky a drink is rinky and so on i know he knows how to say things properly because he does it all the time at grandma and grandpa's house i too read to my children and we play word games all the time on long car rides so it is not from a lack of trying either just let it run it's course and occasionally remind him what the proper way is but don't force it my daughter lost intrest in the baby talk around to years old i am sure my son will do the same expecially once he starts his play group in the fall and is around other kids his age more as for the potty training just keep reminding him and he will get it with time my son was a pain in the hind end to train then it seemed like all of a sudden one day it clicked in his brain and he has been going every since good luck Milton H.
