yo points and whines to get something his mother gets him everything he wants but never asks him to tell her what he wants so he doesnt talk his mom doesnt give him to change and he doesnt need to at home at our daycare we are trying to get him use his words and that whining is unacceptable that he has to ask politely to now i know it will take time for him understand this new concept we brought it up to his mom and she said that he's just a baby he's should we be working with him even if his mom doesnt see that it's a problem what a crazy women she is i think you should still work with him to encourage him to speak thats a normal thing you do at a daycare centre so it doesn't need permission from mum but you could give her some information on language development to show her that children of this age are very capable of speaking if she realises that her child is behind others in his development she might take it more seriously it will be very rewarding to you if you are able to help the child start talking and very helpful for the child too if you can find something he is really interested in this can help him to want to speak because he'll want to talk about it hope this helps some good luck Laura Schlessinger Kodocha Social rule About a Boy Thai royal and noble titles Day care The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Infantilism Atomic Kitten Baby talk Eric Cartman RuneScape quests Pitaten Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pok__mon Live!
