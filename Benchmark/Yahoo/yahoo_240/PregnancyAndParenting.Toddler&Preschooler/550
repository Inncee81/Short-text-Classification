how can i get my month old to fall asleep by herself okay well my daughter is mth old my husband daughter myself all moved to our new home about mnths ago in the process of moving we gave away our full size bed to make way for a queen size one bein that we just moved and spent all possible spending money on furniture we were left having to buy a bed for our daughter and for ourselves she is fairly advanced we decided to just up her into a twin size bed and her crib broke so her grandmother my mom said she would by a bed for my daughter she finally bought one for her wks ago but before then she was sleeping on our air mattress with us we didn't have a problem with this until she started having difficulty sleeping when we weren't in the room with her it got to the point where we had to lay with her for her to doze off then we had to stay there for an extra min to make sure she was deep asleep now we decided that until we get our new mattress she can sleep with us but we needed her to fall asleep on her own yesterday was out first night trying it sadly we closed her in a room with a nightlight i tucked her explained to her that she needed to go night night and she cried for two hours when we finally went up to our room she had tucked herself back into bed and was fast asleep but as soon as i came in she woke up and started complaining for us to get into bed i was told that i could also put a television in her room play barney or baby einsteins while muted and just let her doze off to it but my husband and i are a little speptical in putting a tv in her room so she can sleep bad idea it is not a bad thing to put a tv in your child's room my two boys share a room and have a tv in it using a tv to get her to fall asleep is not a bad idea but if this does not work then your just going to have to let her cry herself to sleep this will break your heart but she will be ok i went through this with my oldest son he started sleeping in my bed the day he came home from the hospital i tried and tried when he got older to get him in his room i laid down until he was out and left this did not always work and i still felt like i wasn't doing it right my son was four before i got him to sleep by his self and i will not make that mistake again my second child slept by his self from day one and i have had no problem with him i hope this helps you good luck and be strong Shaggy dog story EastEnders 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Pitaten The Shining (film) The Amber Spyglass Episodes of Lost (Season 1) W.I.T.C.H.
