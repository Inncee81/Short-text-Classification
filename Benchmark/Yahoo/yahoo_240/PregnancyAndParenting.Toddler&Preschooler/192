my dream is to open my own home daycare but i have a few questions i am years old and going to college for my associates in early childhood education i have been working at a childcare center for years now since i was and old enough to work i love children and since i was a child myself i have always wanted to open my own home daycare center i do not own a home yet i still live with my parents and my fiance and i are actually going to be purchasing a condo at first rather than a house when i finally do have a house i will immediately begin filling out the applications to recieve my licence for my own home daycare i realizse that in the state of connecticut i can have a max of kids including my own chidren when i have them i also know that only of those children can be under age i know that when they come out to inspect my house the house should be prepared and ready to open with toys on the shelf and all my question is comming more details i ran out of room there will be a very wide range of ages infants years old i wish i didnt have to accept children any older than like or it seems funny to me to mix both infants with and year olds but in my state i legally can not turn somebody away based on that my question is about toys becuase of the wide age ranges should i only keep toys on the shelves that are for ages months and up i ask this becuase at my job the toddlers are not alloud to play with the preschoolers toys of course i would never leave a child espically months old unattended and i would never leave anything with obvious small parts on the floor but large legos for example are not age labled for a month old but i cant see a month old getting hurt with a large lego basically i would deff use common sense but are the standards as strict in a home daycare as in a center ok in ca things are different im sure but in regards to pace its pretty universal they will want them to be semi seperated infants and toddlers and children so toys should be accordingly designated i would say have shelves with different age groups try to keep them as safe to all but maybe have more of a chest for the older childrens item to prevent the babies from getting in toys are definetley going to be hard call pace ask for them to send you info get the rating scale they sell it at many book stores try lakeshore or any of the school supply warehouses the standards are much lower however they are significantly harder to apply beings as this is your home tht will be brand new to you as well as the fact hat you loose your privacy and you have to keep books rotated with the seasons and holidays but be careful with holidays in respect to each childs personal religion etc get the rating books review them and take it all in before you dive face first into it i wanted to do the same thing but i realized you can spend more than you make and if things arent worded specifically thats a whole nother bunch of drama and stress good luck Day care Child Lego Kindergarten EastEnders Education in the United States Japanese tea ceremony Autism Expanded Universe (Star Wars) Glossary of partner dance terms Education in Germany Laura Schlessinger Full House Early childhood education Adoption Breastfeeding Care Bears Generation Y United Kingdom corporation tax The Sims Kimberly-Clark Corporation Wal-Mart Hard disk Sesame Street O scale Motion picture rating system One Tree Hill (TV series) Scientology beliefs and practices Education The Star Wars Holiday Special The Brady Bunch Pump It Up Education in the People's Republic of China Transsexuality Montessori method GED Rugrats Swimming pool Lionel Corporation Codename: Kids Next Door Casting The Giver Divorce Narcissism Intelligence quotient Organic food Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Windows XP Sento IBM PC compatible Monopoly (game) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Friends RFID Kitchen Teletubbies Ethics Driver's license Psychoanalysis Unemployment A Course In Miracles Our Gang Bicycle lighting Infant baptism Patent Alois Hitler Kodocha Fundamentalism Toy Child sexuality Education in Taiwan Public-key cryptography Spanking Married... with Children Customs and etiquette of Japan Dog agility Extreme Programming Pretty Good Privacy Same-sex marriage Gold standard Hillary Rodham Clinton Airsoft $ale of the Century My Little Pony The Sims 2 Nintendo Atari ST Funny Farm (comic) Inventory Childcare Jet engine M16 (rifle)
