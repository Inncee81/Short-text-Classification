why do you think toddlers and kids in general are all about pushing boundries i just posted a q about a day trial my year old and i had where she was trying to see what she could get away with lol shaking my head stubborn one she is and i'm all about consistancy and not giving in wonder where she got that stubborn streak so why do you think kids especially toddlers are consumed with pushing to see how far they can stretch the rules children push boundaries because they are testing to see how far they can go this is a normal part of development for all children some parents get angry and think children are being disrespectful and react to it by punishing them negatively if parents were to look at this kind of behavior as a normal part of childhood development they would be able to maintain control and help the child make better choices children don't know or aren't born knowing what is acceptable behavior or boundaries so we have to tell them what to do rather than telling them what not to do when you tell a child what not to do you are giving her negative attention plus telling them what not to do doesn't tell them what to do an example of this and try it your self and you'll see the difference in behavior is when your child is running in the house rather than saying don't run you can tell them what to do you can say walk automatically you'll see the the child walk its ok if you repeat yourself if the child is testing boundaries she'll continue to run then you can say would you like me to hold your hand and walk or would you like to walk on your own children under the age of six are searching to be autonomous they want to do it on their own this is why choices that you set up work so well with young children they are so eager to make their own choices it makes them feel big another popular phrase used by parents is your mean or rude these phrases only judge making the child feel bad or defensive its not helpful its hurtful instead it doesn't tell the child what to do instead you can say you can give her the doll in her hand the doll is for playing the doll is not a ball lets go outside and play catch the ball it all depends on the situation and its important that adults and teachers are there to see what happens when children make the wrong choice so that the teacher or parent can guide the child to problemsolve children are not stubborn they are persistent and it's a good thing that means that the child doesn't give up very easily this is part of a childs temperment it's important not to label your child as stubborn or tell anyone else that your child is stuborn because it gives her a negative image teachers should never label a child as stubborn as well instead you can say my child very persistent this says that she doesn't give up very eaisily this is not a bad quality the label stubborn is negative understanding your childs temperment is essential part of guiding your child positively there are lots of good books that explain temperment in children good luck Social rule Theory of conduct Fast bowling Transactional analysis Infantilism Autism Nicomachean Ethics Milton H.
