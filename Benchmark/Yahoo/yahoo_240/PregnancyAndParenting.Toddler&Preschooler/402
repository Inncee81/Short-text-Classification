my son just turned two years old and i'm trying really hard to get him potty trained not having so much luck he knows he's supposed to tell me when he has to go but he wants to go sit on the pot after he ruins his diaper any tips or tricks i just potty trained my son and daughter and i used the potty stool http www thepottystool com i started by just setting it at the toilet my kids immediately climbed up on the stool and discovered that they could safely use the toilet this got them very interested in using the toilet and they were potty trained very quickly it really helps boys to pee standing up so they can see what is happening and connect the sensations with the potty stool i like that i don't have to double the steps of potty training by training them first in a potty and then training them to stop using a potty and not dumping and cleaning a potty each time is great the best thing is that kids use it for years i hope this helps you Toilet Fecal incontinence Toilet humour Toilet training Aerial (dance move) Elimination communication Urination Kimberly-Clark Corporation Urinary incontinence Japanese toilet Jackass: The Movie Shaggy dog story Sento Infantilism Diaper Parenting Dog training Feral child Four square Double bass Volleyball Ultimate Muscle Toilet paper Uniform Resource Locator Humphrey Bogart The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Rugrats Skateboarding trick Social rule SpongeBob SquarePants Vegeta The Body (Short Story) Sin City Violin Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Bristol Grammar School AFI 100 Years series Stomach cancer Captain Underpants Recess (TV series) HyperText Transfer Protocol Paragliding Shit El Chavo del Ocho Married... with Children Qur'an desecration controversy of 2005 Glossary of climbing terms Kimi Finster Phishing StarCraft: Uprising Dairy Milton H.
