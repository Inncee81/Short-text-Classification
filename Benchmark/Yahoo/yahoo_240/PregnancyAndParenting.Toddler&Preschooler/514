my month old wont look me in my eye when i put him in my face but if i ask him where are my i eye he looks at me and says eyes or i he wants me to pick him up he says up and holds his arms up a looks at me should i be worried about autism because he wont look at me close up my sister said he just wants you out of he face or that could be intimadating him but what do you think i never said i was yelling i just tell him to look at mommy i dont yell at my son for any reason i don't think it sounds like autism if he is looking at you and requesting up then it sounds okay does he have a 'social smile ' in other words does he laugh and smile at things can you play little games with him and sing songs and have him laugh and look at you in the eye does he look you in the eye at other times when you are just playing and having fun and laughing if he does then i don't think it's autism some children just look away when a face gets a little close try backing up just a bit and see if that helps autism has a lot of characteristics besides lack of eye contact like the loss or lack of language i think your child is probably just fine Autism Social rule Asperger syndrome Autism rights movement She Loves You The Ashlee Simpson Show Hall & Oates Highway 61 Revisited Time Out of Mind Avenue Q Autistic community Autistic spectrum Spidey Super Stories Controversies in autism Piccolo Junior Saga Unreal Three Stooges Shaggy dog story President (game) Neurodiversity Squidward Tentacles I Want to Hold Your Hand I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Treehouse of Horror V Milton H.
