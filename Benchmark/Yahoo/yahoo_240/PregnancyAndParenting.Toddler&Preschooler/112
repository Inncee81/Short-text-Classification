when should i potty train my son andrew is months old hides when he poos goes in the bathroom with my hubs and myself and knows what we are doing flushes the toilet for us but is still wetting at nite my philosophy is if they know what it means to use the bathroom like hiding when they poo or telling you he has in his diaper then it is time to start it is a training process obviously it may be a struggle but if they know what the toilet is for and they recognize their own bodily functions in use then it is time Toilet Toilet humour Japanese toilet Diaper Toilet training Elimination communication Urinary incontinence Toilet paper Washroom Shit Euphemism Parenting Conker's Bad Fur Day Urination Flush toilet Qur'an desecration controversy of 2005 Thomas Crapper Married... with Children Infantilism Captain Underpants Bedwetting Bathroom Genericized trademark Fecal incontinence Urinal Salad Fingers Siphon Sea water Plumbing fixture Composting toilet Alaskan Bush Toilet-related injury Menstrual cup Hard water Ron and Fez The Shining (film) Squat toilet Sin City Greywater Feces Dragon boat Kate Vaiden Friends Water RISC Tamagotchi Joke Feral child Dormitory Campsite Bidet Artificial neural network Zhu Rongji Dutch Schultz Jennings Randolph Lake Copenhagen interpretation Tanning Plucky Duck IRT Flushing Line Basement Viterbi algorithm Urban legend New York City Subway nomenclature Singapore Monkey Hamster Nickname Son Gohan Money CDC 6600 Sewer Condom Kitchen Ang Mo Kio E-meter Strathspey Railway Housebreaking EIA-708 Philippine English David Bohm Saw II Prince (artist) Viz (comic) Crate training Sexual fetishism Blood Simple Cognitive science Lake District The Illuminatus!
