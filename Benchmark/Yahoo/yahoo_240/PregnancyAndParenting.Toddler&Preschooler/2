what is a good bedtime for kids and younger i am a stay at home mom and my husband likes to keep the kids up till pm even though they can sleep in as late as they want they don't in fact they seem less likely to sleep in i would like to know what others deem appropriate we put our yr olds to bed at pm every night sometimes they go to sleep earlier depending on how they are acting sometimes they go to bed early if they seem overly tired i think is good because then if they wake up early which they do then i know they still got a good night's sleep plus it gives us more down time at the end of the night to get together as parents and relax Sleep Insomnia Daylight saving time Avenue Q Mattress Sleep debt The Fairly OddParents The Marshall Mathers LP Blankets (graphic novel) EastEnders Co-sleeping 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Jet lag Child sexuality Knots Landing Delayed sleep phase syndrome The Tracey Ullman Show shorts The Adventures of Pete & Pete The Shining (film) Up at the Villa Sleeping Murder Ewoks: The Battle for Endor Futurama (TV series - season 2) Urinary incontinence Bart chalkboard gags Humphrey Bogart Laura Schlessinger Apollo 8 Baby Blues Shaggy dog story Customs and etiquette of Japan Our Gang Social rule Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Phoebe Buffay's songs The Catcher in the Rye Sleeping with the Enemy (1991 film) Dean Martin About a Boy Out-of-body experience The Big Sleep Cindy Sheehan Skinny Dip The Subtle Knife Treehouse of Horror V Breath of Fire III Bruxism Teacher's Pet (Disney) Kurt Cobain Sleeping with the Enemy (Simpsons episode) Compton Wynyates Trapped in the Closet Futurama (TV series - season 5) Cliff Richard A Milhouse Divided Little Nemo Survivor (novel) Dong Xian Passenger car My Family (television) Siesta The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction Lucid dreaming Diazepam Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare Sharia Gemini 7 Honey and Clover Grandview, U.S.A.
