parents of autistic children what do you think is the cause i am having my st baby in mos and hear so much about autism in your opinion is it caused by something preventable or just something that some kids get it's scary to hear so much about it but no one can agree on why it happens i wouldn't love my baby less but i don't think it's unusual to think about something mysterious that could affect his quality of life geez why are people so touchy i wish i knew i have three kids my middle one is mildly autistic has pdd nos we've done extensive testing taken family histories and in my case at least i do think its a fluke just one of those things that happens like a child being born with a birthmark etc i honestly don't believe its caused by vaccines if that is the case why weren't my other kids affected i also don't think its something you can prevent the only thing i tell everyone is if you have any doubts or concerns have your child evaluated by a developmental pediatrician or neurologist immediately the earlier a child is diagnosed and start therapy the better they will do trust your instinct even if your pediatrician or everybody around you tell you oh all kids develop differently etc get the evaluation better be safe than sorry anyways i wish you all the best with your new baby when it arrives Autism Controversies in autism Autistic community Asperger syndrome Thimerosal Autism epidemic Pervasive developmental disorder Neurodiversity Ethical challenges to autism treatment Mark Geier Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Generation Rescue Autistic spectrum Autistic enterocolitis Conditions comorbid to autism spectrum disorders Androgen insensitivity syndrome Vaccine Bernard Rimland Cancer Safe Minds Medicine Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Terri Schiavo Sudden infant death syndrome Vaccine controversy Allergy Cephalic disorder Breastfeeding Pneumonia Philosophical skepticism Anti-psychiatry Autistic culture AIDS Andrew Wakefield Childbirth Multiple sclerosis Neurotypical MMR vaccine Cytomegalovirus Facilitated communication Rabies Gifted A-CHAMP Epistemology Stroke Pediatrics Prostate cancer Theory of conduct Transsexuality Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cerebral palsy Polyamory Autistic savant Hearing impairment Dyslexia Infantilism Refrigerator mother Controversies about functioning labels in the autism spectrum Medical analysis of circumcision Aphasia Generation Y Bovine spongiform encephalopathy The Marshall Mathers LP Obsessive-compulsive disorder Terri Schiavo timeline Psychoanalysis Mental retardation Jon Secada Decompression sickness Alzheimer's disease Homeland Security Act Gaucher's disease Fathers' rights Herpes simplex virus Adult attention-deficit disorder Friends Dissociative identity disorder Smallpox Abortion debate Speculation of famous people who might have autism Lyme disease Traumatic brain injury Hypoglycemia Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Ex-gay Adverse effect (medicine) Gamera vs. Jiger Measles Humphrey Bogart Intelligence quotient Paget's disease of bone Tuberculosis Ontological argument Turner syndrome Urinary incontinence Tocopherol Rain Man
