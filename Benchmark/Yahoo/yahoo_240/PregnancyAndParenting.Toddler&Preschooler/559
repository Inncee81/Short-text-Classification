should i be worried i have a year old daughter who is obsessed with anything masculine she only has boys around to play with so i suppose it's no wonder that she only likes to play with cars and such not dolls she also likes to wear boy clothes and sometimes says that she's not a girl but is a boy i have allowed her to wear some boy pajamas but not everyday clothes she is very active and has played t ball soccer football karate and basketball in fact basketball was her first word she is very good at sports has been riding a bike without training wheels since she was three and excels in most everything my husband insists that she is just a tomboy and will grow out of it there are times that she wants to wear dresses but those times are becoming few and far between i'm wondering if anyone else has had experience with this when should i be worried thanks i think that it is great that she can hold her own with the boys i have boys and little girl who is also and let me tell you she can hang in there right with em lol my daughter likes cars karate soccer etc but she also enjoys her barbies and dresses i would probably feel a little sad if she wouldn't let me dress her up and paint her nails just because she's my only little girl she has her time being a tomboy but we also make time to do girly things together like dress up tea party's and such i wouldn't be so worried about this right now she is only and this is probably just a phase i have a cousin that was raised by a single father and i remember as a young child watching her dressed in overalls helping her dad work on lawnmowers and cars with greese all over her head to toe lol she loved doing all the boy things and now she is beautiful woman with a husband and a little girl of her own my opinion is as long as she is happy and healthy then let let her be who she want's to be you only get one childhood if she would rather throw a football around or play in the mud then let her Tomboy Kodocha Sport Ranma __ characters Comanche Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Barbie Infantilism Friends Marilyn Monroe Little Britain EastEnders Pitaten Trailer Park Boys Shaggy dog story Sin City Urusei Yatsura Australian rules football Humphrey Bogart Characters in the Smurfs Kim Possible Azumanga Daioh Ghastly's Ghastly Comic Totally Spies!
