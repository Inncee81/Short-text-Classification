why aren't modern playgrounds built in the shade my four year old loves to go to the playground but it's summer and i've discovered that most playgrounds have no shade whatsoever here we are in a beautiful park with huge beautiful shade trees all around us and in a flat treeless area out of range of any shade whatsoever sits some plastic and metal playground equipment on a bed of wood chips not even the parent benches have shade most of the time they're hard metal uncomfortable and blazing hot after ten o'clock in the morning i know there must be a good reason for this probably some silly liability issue but i can't imagine what it would be how would it increase the park's liability to build the playground in range of the shade trees any ideas money it's cheaper and faster to clear out the trees and pull in the playground equipment my dad has been in the construction business for years i asked him once about residential subdivisions being totally cleared of any tree before construction begins why couldn't they leave some big old trees and build around them i understand not leaving all but some he said it was much more time on the clock for the designers architects engineers to come up with a safe and aesthetically pleasing plan and time consuming for the crew to put together something that had be built around an existing structure our town has some great playgrounds with canopies on them and on that recycled rubber flooring that's got a spring to it rally your fellow parents to city hall and get one of these built shade http www shadesystemsinc com gallery htm floor http www floorscore com playground Plastic Landmarks of Hoboken, New Jersey Seismic retrofit Architecture New Urbanism Tag Drill bit Paintball Dundas Square Drag racing Lechaina Ludwig Mies van der Rohe Whitton, London Garfield Chatsworth House Sento Yosemite National Park Deforestation B-47 Stratojet Passenger car Sewage treatment Computer Sundial Atari 8-bit family Wood carving Naval mine Parliament House, Canberra Shaggy dog story Pebble bed reactor Mouse (computing) Fountain Central processing unit Baseball Crime prevention through environmental design Sugar Land, Texas Solar power Application-specific integrated circuit Cerritos, California Heinkel He 100 Wood W.
