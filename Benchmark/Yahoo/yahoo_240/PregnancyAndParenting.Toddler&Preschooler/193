my yr will pee on the toilet but refuses to poop it has been mos how do i get her to poop on the potty she has been peeing on the toilet for the longest time we don't put her in diapers anymore we use pull ups for long road trips and at night during naps and during the day she wears underwear she can get on the toilet all by herself and wipe and flush she can pull her own panties down and everything but she refuses to poop on the potty we have tried all we know including punishment from toys tv books everything she will only poop on the toilet very occasionally in the almost year she has been trained she has pooped on the toilet maybe times it is really frustrating and we just would like to know how to change it i don't like to spank my child and we even tried that a couple times i felt terrible and felt it wasn't the right way to do it this was recently so it wasn't like the spanking made her not want to do it also it wasn't even a hard spanking it was a pat on the bottom we were told that had worked for some kids but not for us i am years old and have been working at a childcare center since i was i also have brothers and a sister ages and im also in my third year of school for a degree in early childhood ed pooping on the potty is one of the hardest things to get a child to do i was currently given a head teaching job at the daycare i work at for a group of year olds years old is when the children begin pre school however one of the requirements for leaving the toddler group is to be potty trained there is a little girl who has been going pp on the potty since she was litterally she turned two and her parents tried potty training and it worked she did great but she still wont poop on the potty my brothers never pooped on the potty either he would wait until somebody put a diaper on him my mom didnt rush him and in time he did it on his own in most cases this is normal i dont know if children feel embarased my brother used to hide in the corner when he'd poop one thing is that punishment usually doesnt work all children grow and develope at different speeds and your three year old is simply not ready for this task she will be though dont worry too much also taking away toys and tv espically books you shouldnt take books away from a child punishment can turn the whole expierence into a bad one which could possibly make the process even longer please know that i'm not repremanding you at all or trying to teach you how to raise your children in most cases taking away toys or tv would probably be effective these are some things you can try reward for going potty even just pee at my work when a child goes on the toilet they get a sticker one mother had a great idea which was a 'treasure box' she filled a box with lots of goodies fruit snack packs big stickers like at the doctors office mini packs of m m's little bracelets and rings and whenever her daughter went pee pee on the potty she would let her pick a prize from the treasure box i know it sounds like a bribe but its actually positive reinforcement but perhaps you can pick out a bigger toy than whats in the treasure box something not too big maybe just a barbie or a doll and tell her that when she goes poop on the potty she gets the big prize you can also get so many books and videos dvd's about it if you go to your local library into the childrens section tell the librarian that your having trouble potty training you dont have to get into details and that you were wondering if they had any books or movies for kids she should direct you to where they are good luck Toilet humour Rugrats Pitaten Parenting Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Infantilism Kimberly-Clark Corporation Kimi Finster Kodocha Humphrey Bogart The Inside The Fairly OddParents Diaper Spanking EastEnders The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Urinary incontinence Poker jargon Social rule The Adventures of Pete & Pete Professional wrestling match types Doug Toilet training Atomic Kitten Jackass: The Movie Shaggy dog story The Family from One End Street Futurama (TV series - season 2) Housebreaking Fecal incontinence Baby Blues Toilet The Contender (television series) The Star Wars Holiday Special Japanese toilet Calvin and Hobbes One Piece minor characters Great Teacher Onizuka SpongeBob SquarePants Sin City Ranma __ characters The Sims Rocko's Modern Life Milton H.
