how do you explain water conservation to a two and a half year old we live on an island where most of our home's water supply comes from recovered rainwater our little girl who is two and half learning to use the potty and loves playing with water would wash her hands times a day if we'd let her and she wants to run the water forever is there any way to get the point across to her or is she just not developmentally ready at this age to use water sparingly talk about the fish and the fact that if we waste water fish won't have it i would also get a book about fish swimmy is a good one and talk about other animals that rely on water it worked for our son also you may want to still keep an eye on her can you fill a tub of water just for her to keep outside and cover it so she has a tub with water to play in we did this when we lived in an apartment and kept it on the balcony Dishwasher Japanese mythology Casting Have I Got News For You Eye Avenue Q Animal Crossing Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water Derbyshire lead mining history Anne Murray Textile manufacturing Kodocha Laundry A Tale of a Tub 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake Kahoolawe G-Man (Half-Life) Water (molecule) Marine aquarium Washing machine Elis Prefecture Priesthood (Mormonism) Water Dishwashing Shark The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll 1957 World Series Grunion Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?
