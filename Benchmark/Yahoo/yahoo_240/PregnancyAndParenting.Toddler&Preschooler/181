what is the ideal sleep schedule for a month old my month old daughter sleeps for about hours every day she sleeps at about pm am every night and wakes up at about am every morning then she sleeps again at about am and wakes up at about pm then she sleeps for about hour at about pm our pediatrician keeps saying that it varies from child to child but we have a feeling that it might be less for someone of her age our daughter weighs lb and she is not gaining much weight either she is a very active kid additionally we have a feeling that this sleep schedule might be contibuting to it as well any suggestion on her sleep schedule as well as ways to gain some weight might be helpful my month old has been on a regular sleep schedule since he was about or months old i followed the plan in the book babywise and have been so pleased though i know all babies are different and some may just not require as much sleep my little guy is a good sleeper he goes to bed at night around and wakes up around though i don't ever get him until he is just content to talk and play this is a good sign your child is well rested they should never wake up crying or fussy if they do that means they have not slept enough and you should not consider the nap over he does still take a morning nap if we are home he has cut it down to about an hour between or his afternoon nap is from about or if he has missed his morning nap it may last until sometimes i know it sounds crazy but i have found it to be true every time the earlier they go to bed at night the longer and better they sleep plus the better they are at napping sleep breeds sleep don't worry about the weight from the weight chart my doctor gave me a lb month old is close to the th percentile which is not of concern my month old weighs about pounds he just went through a big growth spurt before months and then totally reversed and i couldn't get him to eat a quarter of what he was eating before i think with him it is teething issues that can disrupt eating and sleeping for quite awhile also babies grow more when they sleep than when they are awake so the two are connected i would suggest working on getting your little one to bed much earlier and i would guess that would help immensely on her sleeping habits my little one stayed up until after two nights in a row last week but still woke at the same time in the morning was extra cranky and had a hard time getting back into nap mode it will take you awhile to adjust the schedule but stick with it and you will be fine you should strive for at least hours of sleep at night there will i'm sure be crying at first but after about days of sticking to your guns your little one will catch on good luck Sleep Insomnia Daylight saving time Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Urinary incontinence Siesta Humphrey Bogart Shaggy dog story Mattress Narcolepsy Apollo 8 Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Bodybuilding Jon Secada Fertility awareness Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 March The Shining (film) Avenue Q The Contender (television series) Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Ron and Fez Cat The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Good Morning, Vietnam Blonde on Blonde Spirit rover timeline for 2004 April Futurama (TV series - season 5) Ty Cobb Puberty Delayed sleep phase syndrome Lucid dreaming Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Social rule Attack on Pearl Harbor Adjustable gastric band Kodocha Oasis (band) Cliff Richard AFI 100 Years series Knots Landing House of M Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Slow Train Coming The Catcher in the Rye Guinea pig Phoebe Buffay's songs Grandview, U.S.A.
