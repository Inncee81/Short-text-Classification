considering starting a small home daycare i am currently a sahm with a month old son i would love to continue to stay here but we really need a little extra money so i was considering taking in one or two children to watch during the work week i live in an apartment in the dallas fort worth area and would buy toys games educational material to keep them occupied as well as taking them to the park swimming etc i love kids and i know my son would love having someone to hang out with instead of being stuck with me all day haha now i need to know what the technicalities are concerning licensing and taxes i would definitely get first aid and cpr certified prior to taking anyone in but do i have to be registered as a home daycare all info advice appreciated thanks my ex husband owned a day care so i had to become familiar with regulations related to centers and home care there is a huge liability associated with home day care yes you must be registered and licensed and don't forget the insurance you can get your pants sued off if anything happens in your home once you discover the labor and expense associated with daycare you may reconsider the one or two children you may want to take the babysitter route if you're gonna watch the kids of friends and family but if you expect to get clients from the general public you have a bit of work in front of you regarding the proper paperwork household inspection etc i wish you the very best Day care Nurse Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Insurance Health insurance Social work SCO-Linux controversies Wal-Mart First aid Publicly funded medicine American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Dissociative identity disorder Monopoly (game) Dallas, Texas About a Boy Prostitution in Germany Attorney at Law George Michael Education in Japan Economy of the United States Dallas Fort Worth Metroplex Accountancy Tax Actuary Warren Buffett EastEnders Midwifery Children of a Lesser Clod Surveillance Nuclear power 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Oasis (band) Article One of the United States Constitution Queen (band) Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Barrister Television in the United States Lawyer Value added tax Security (finance) Meat Loaf Personal finance Canadian Pacific Railway Nintendo Baby Blues Krusty the Clown Oplan Bojinka Married... with Children Life insurance Infantilism German car number plates Shaggy dog story Corporation Emergency Medical Services Childcare Marriage Swimming pool The Adventures of Pete & Pete United Artists Friends Intellectual property Delta Air Lines Capitalism Avenue Q Nursing Medical prescription Russian joke MMORPG Freddy Fender Estoppel True Crime: Streets of LA Jeopardy!
