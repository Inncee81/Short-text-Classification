what are your opinions on little girls wearing make up like a year old with real make up or the kid stuff do you find it disturbing occasionally i would allow a little girl to put on lip gloss for dress up but not on a regular basis a little one doesn't need makeup to enhance her beauty but they sometimes want to be like mommy and have a little gloss on their lips that would be all i would ever allow sunscreen for their tender skin and maybe some chapstick to prevent sunburned lips but nothing else is necessary they grow up fast enough and don't need to push it further Cosmetics Sunscreen Sunburn Lip balm Puberty Lipstick Skateboarding trick Tattoo Sunlight The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy KaBlam!
