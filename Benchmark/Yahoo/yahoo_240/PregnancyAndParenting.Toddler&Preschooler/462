potty training questions ok i have questions about potty training my son just turned and i have no idea when to begin potty training i would like to start now but he doesn't talk so it's not going to be easy what are the signs that he will show of being interested in potty training do you have any tips or advice on potty training i put him on the potty before he gets a bath but he hasn't peed while on it yet when he does i will make a big deal about it to encourage him to keep doing it just get a little potty and every time you go to the bathroom sit him on the potty while you sit on yours talk to him about peeing and pooping tell him mommy is pooping can you poop to make sure to use these words often when changing his diapers if you are uncomfortable with your child being in the bathroom with you then do not use this method since he will pick up on your tension and think something is wrong i started maya this way at months not taking off her clothes just letting her sit while i sat until she asked to take down her diaper and pants and there was never any pressure no tears and no stress it was easy as pie she also couldn't talk well when we started but i didn't let that bother me there are other ways for him to tell you and you will know when he needs to go it needs to be a process and go slow let him take the lead in mast things also the first time he actually 'goes' in the potty cheer him and show him what he did but do not go to wild since chances are he will have no clue how he did it but if he knows it made you happy then he will try to do it again this helps him develop those muscles and get to know this part of his body without you 'hovering' since you will be busy with 'business' of your own also let it be a process do not expect him to be trained in a month or even two this will cause disappointment for you and him just be relaxed and laid back maya took until months to be daytrained and even then i put a pull up on her when going out of the house but i have not bought pull ups since she turned we have a couple in case she asks but she never does anymore Toilet humour Urination Fecal incontinence Aerial (dance move) The Inside Shaggy dog story Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Toilet training Theory of conduct Avenue Q Garfield Jackass: The Movie Japanese toilet Infantilism Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Buttocks Sento Diaper Dog training The Ashlee Simpson Show Toilet 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Elimination communication Slow Train Coming Kodocha Jam (TV series) Friends Parenting Crate training Wheel of Fortune God Emperor of Dune Humphrey Bogart Diving Equine conformation Big Brother (USA TV series) John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Textile manufacturing Norway national football team Pitaten Joke The Smoking Room Babe Ruth Traumatic incident reduction Combat stress reaction Extreme Programming Knots Landing Tai Chi Chuan Little Britain Professional wrestling holds Condom Time Out of Mind Coming of Age (TNG episode) The Amber Spyglass Sin City Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Identity and change Swingout 2000 Australian Grand Prix Piccolo Junior Saga Moe Szyslak Grandview, U.S.A.
