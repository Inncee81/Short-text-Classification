at what age should i separate my kids into own beds room do you own twins boy girl twins or irish twins like myself my kids are months apart in age they slept in their own rooms until this recent move in late april may they are yrs old boy and girl they refuse to sleep in separate rooms much less diff beds they sleep in a double bed and since they actually hate touching ea other i have the bed turned so that they sleep in it horizontally so it is wider and shorter but since kids they don't notice the length and have a body long pillow down the middle so they won't bump into one another cos they hate that however they won't sleep alone no matter what i try is this weird and at what age do you think i should 'make' them sleep alone i mean they see mommy n daddy sleep together so it has to be hard on their brains to understand why they have to sleep alone parents of siblings only respond or will get a thumbs down omg i only now reread question and saw i typed 'own' twins omg not what i meant please don't osterize me i meant 'have' wow thanks for sooo many great answers and responses have made my husband esp feel better he slept in same bed w his brother for years and has of them so this was really his 'concern' i know an old friend that lived in subsidised housing and had many kids and she wasn't allowed to let boys sleep in same room as girls etc but yet lived virtually free those who dont have that have to make kids share rooms however i live well off it is just mine want to share anyway to one who asked what 'irish twins' are it is when having siblings or less months apart common in ireland catholics ideally in the same year say had a baby jan rd and birthed another baby anyways this is going to be hard to choose best answer lol that's kind of funny because that's the first thing i noticed own hehe i wouldn't have ostrasized you just teased a little lol well in my opinion i think it is probably appropriate until they notice a difference and become uncomfortable i gave my son and daughter baths together until they started asking questions about eachother ect i think there is nothing wrong with it at this age especially as they are comforted by eachother's company i like to encourage closeness anyway Friends Milton H.
