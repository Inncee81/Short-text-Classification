othopedic infant shoes for club foot my child has club foot and we have this special metal brace with shoes attached for my child and i was wondering if there was some place online where parents trade shoes or sell them for lesser money than retail my child has outgrown his and i'd gladly trade sell his old shoes for ones that are his size now if there is a site that does offers this beacuse the shoes cost over dollars and i know he will keep outgrowing them and i'll keep having to get newer ones later on so does anyone know of a site or anything similar that might help thanks in advance im sorry yes he already has had surgery and has a doctor but the brace is required for after surgery your insurance should cover any orthotics he needs because it has to do with a birth defect the physical therapist should be able to steer you in the right direction another source is the pediatrics social worker who saw your family at the hospital where he had the operation most states have agencies that provide funding for children whose family do not have the means to pay for health care in california it's ccs california childrens' services National Health Service Insurance Medicine Publicly funded medicine Nurse Health insurance Podiatrist Pediatrics Wal-Mart History of intersex surgery Medicare (United States) Medicare (Canada) Health care in the United States Dentistry Down syndrome Physical therapy Breastfeeding Physician Health maintenance organization Intersex surgery Palliative care Prostate cancer Tax Adoption Transsexuality Orthopedic surgery Growth hormone treatment American Medical Association General practitioner Medical malpractice Economy of the United States Sears Holdings Corporation Childbirth Bioethics of neonatal circumcision Bill Frist Life insurance Nike, Inc.
