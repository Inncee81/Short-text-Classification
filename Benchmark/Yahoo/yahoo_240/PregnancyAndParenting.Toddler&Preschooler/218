how do i get the kids i babysit to listen to me i am years old and just started babysitting about year ago for these two girls who are and they seem pretty easy to handle at first they just watch tv but the problem is whenever i talk to them or ask them a question they pretend like im not even there i even say threaten them if they dont answer obviously this is a problem when i have to get them to go to bed since they dont listen to me i turn off the tv and say its time for bed most of the time they run into their parents room and lock the door and start watching tv in there its not like i just let them to that i yell at them and tell them if they dont come out i will call their mother then they finally come out but it takes me forever to get them to go to bed then when they are finally in bed at least one of them always comes out and says they are scared what do i do to get them to listen to me i am pretty strict with them but whenever i yell at them for not listening to me they cry and i mean screaming kind of cry and tell me that they are going to call their mom and tell them i am being mean to them when i used to baby sit i was put into almost the same situation i would bring a stuffed animal or candy or something for them then i would tell them if they were good i would leave the gifts for their mom to give them in the morning sometimes when i was short on cash i would tell them if they listened i would bring a cool game to play next time i babysat if none of that helped i would say alright i guess i'm going to have to go for a walk by myself or something else that they would want to do you could always talk to your mom or dad they might have some suggestions About a Boy Shaggy dog story Calvin and Hobbes Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Fairly OddParents Grandview, U.S.A.
