has anyone's child actually been expelled from preschool for potty accidents my son is years old and has been pretty much potty trained for a few months wears a diaper at night only he starts preschool next week and the school requires all children to be fully potty trained they said that they understand kids sometimes have accidents and that's why we'll need to provide extra clothing just in case my son always knows when he has to go and will go on his own to the potty though sometimes he has accidents from waiting too long what has your experience been with preschools that require children to be potty trained before enrolling how many accidents are too many do the teachers ever remind the children to go to the potty my friends who have children who go to this school say not to worry but i can't help it of course i'll be asking the teachers these same questions at orientation but i'd like to know what other people's experiences have been thanks so much regards mari relax the only reason your child would be expelled from any great daycare and obviously you picked a great one or else you wouldn't part with your child is because they are too agressive and endanger other children every daycare i've worked at with or observed i used to work for the state has a schedule with at least potty times built into it through out the day if not many more plus the children are free to tell the teacher when they need to go usually before and after nap and around snack or meal times the whole class will have a chance to go its great because it also teaches kids to wait in line to respect others etc like you said kids do have accidents and you should provide extra clothes and undies for such situations but in my experience unless a child was not fully trained before daycare of is having major issues that they can't deal with i e parents are fighting at home so child regresses kids continue to be potty trained at school and do well good luck Day care Kimberly-Clark Corporation Kindergarten Education in the United States Education in the People's Republic of China Diaper Parenting Infantilism Education in Japan Education in Taiwan Education in Germany McMartin preschool Montessori method Social rule Urinary incontinence Elimination communication Early childhood education Martial art The Fairly OddParents Education in Romania Teacher Education About a Boy Recess (TV series) No Child Left Behind Act Daylight saving time Dissociative identity disorder Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Housebreaking Japanese tea ceremony Kodocha Education in Albania French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Tripartite System The Catcher in the Rye School choice Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Separation of church and state in the United States The Contender (television series) Education in Hong Kong Hikikomori College Reiki The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Education in Portugal Education in France Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Education in Australia The Karate Kid, Part III Aikido Crate training Danish Folkeskole Education Transsexuality Humphrey Bogart Boarding school Laura Schlessinger Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus The Bash Street Kids Hillary Rodham Clinton Dog training Culture of the United States Charter school Professor RuneScape Brown v.
