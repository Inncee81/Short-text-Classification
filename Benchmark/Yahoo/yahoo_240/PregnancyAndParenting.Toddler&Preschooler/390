older sibling and a new baby my son is very very excited for the arrival of his new baby sister but i am wondering about how he is going to react once she is here he just turned not a spoiled child and listens very well i was wondering if there is anything i can do to ease him into the idea of sharing mommy and daddy i have heard to make him feel like he is helping with the baby ie feeding getting the baby dressed any other suggestions to make this transition as smooth as possible with the least amount of jealousy and resentment it sounds like he is pretty much ready for her to show up and looking forward to it not sure there is much else you can do to prepare but i would say once she is here don't make him 'second fiddle' to her you will likely have a lot of people coming by to ooh and aah over the new baby that might make him feel left out make sure to plan some special time for the two of you without the little sister in tow if possible so he is getting just as much attention one thing i always do when visiting friends with a new baby is to make sure to bring a gift for both the baby and the sibling it's easy at that age to feel left out hope your friends and relatives do the same for your little guy good luck and congrats ps forgot to mention a friend of mine who had a son about the same age as yours put a sign up on the lawn that said josiah has a new little brother when the baby arrived he felt totally special that his name was on such a large marquee in front of their house and everyone who came by shook josiah's hand and congratulated him before even looking at the baby josiah's job was to hand everyone chocolate cigars Shaggy dog story Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an AFI 100 Years series Jon Secada Friends EastEnders Knots Landing Avenue Q The Ashlee Simpson Show Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Jam (TV series) Piccolo Junior Saga Ayyavazhi mythology Marie Antoinette Sharon Tate Treehouse of Horror IX The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Mojave people Good Morning, Vietnam Customs and etiquette of Japan Pitaten The Apprentice 2 Guiding Light Grumpy's Three Wishes The Contender (television series) Melanie Wilkes Charmed Blood on the Tracks Characters in the Smurfs The Dalek Invasion of Earth Fred Phelps Rent (musical) Time Out of Mind Care Bears The Jazz Singer Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword About a Boy Continuation War Breastfeeding The Star Wars Holiday Special I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Pok__mon Live!
