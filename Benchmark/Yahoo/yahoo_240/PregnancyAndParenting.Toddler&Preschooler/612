pushchair question i'd like people's recommendations for a lightweight small medium folding pushchair i'm after one that my daughter months can sit up in as she likes to look around and hates lying back and relaxing so ideally it needs a bar across the front i have a quinny buzz but want something less bulky and easier to use to take with me in the car any ideas would be great i have a graco citisport plus not sure if you can still get them as i did hear they had been discontinued but i think you can still get them on ebay it is very lightweight folds down quite small and is very easy to get in and out of the car it still allows you to lie the back down a bit for sleeping if you need which i know some lightweight pushchairs don't do it has a bar across the front and a good amount of storage underneath if you need it my toddler also likes to sit forward and see everything going on and he loves his lightweight pushchair especially being able to hold onto the bar we got the pushchair when he was months old he's now months old and it's still going strong Baby transport Professional wrestling holds Sport rowing Equine conformation Bicycle Shaggy dog story Knife Textile manufacturing Recumbent bicycle Horizontal bar Mario Kart 64 Kimberly-Clark Corporation Anchor Porsche 911 Avenue Q Aerial (dance move) Paragliding Menstrual cup Disneyland Professional wrestling throws Mountain bike Romulus and Remus Floppy disk Swimming pool American and British English differences Azaria Chamberlain disappearance Wind turbine Blood Simple Ford Mustang Time Out of Mind Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Mixed martial arts Crate training Sail-plan Dog training Knots Landing Boxing Ron and Fez USB flash drive Columbine High School massacre Breastfeeding Palace of Westminster Unreal Airbag Passenger car Theory of conduct Mojave people IPod 2000 Australian Grand Prix Landau (car) Advertising Strap-on dildo Teletubbies Judiciary of Hong Kong M60 machine gun Urinary incontinence MRE Arbitrage MP3 Dodge Charger The Sims The Legend of Zelda series enemies Mattress EastEnders Chevrolet Corvair Kitchen Sin City Car body style Mars Exploration Rover International Phonetic Alphabet M16 (rifle) Car classification Sharon Tate Loudspeaker Good Morning, Vietnam Fecal incontinence Acura Integra (North America) Car safety Station wagon Paul Is Dead Japanese tea ceremony Backstroke The Shining (film) Barrister Kayak Transformer RuneScape quests Social rule One Tree Hill (TV series) Table tennis Toyota MR2 Extreme Programming Late Night with Conan O'Brien She Loves You Front crawl Embouchure Lauren Bacall Bong Punt (boat)
