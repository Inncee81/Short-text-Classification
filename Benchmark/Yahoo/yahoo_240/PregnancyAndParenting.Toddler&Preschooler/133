how do you get a year old girl to come back inside without her throwing a fit i babysit a year old girl and she is so sweet and we like to go outside and play but whenever it gets too hot and we need to go back inside she throws a fit how can i get her to want to go back inside ok you will get many answers about this but i strongly believe in this we are the adults and they are the children we are in charge and should behave as so at all times firstly warn her that you will be taking her inside in mins then after mins ask her nicely explain that it is time to go in and that you do not want her to get cold as it will not be nice for her then ask her again but with a very firm tone and tell her to come in if she then wont physically pick her up and bring her inside then completely ignore her tantrum for as long as humanly possible keep doing this over and over again she will eventually realise that you are in charge and will bring in her regardless of her behaviour it will work you just give it time Kain (Legacy of Kain) Piccolo Junior Saga Transactional analysis Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Son Goku (Dragon Ball) The Amber Spyglass Sin City Black hole Microeconomics Tag The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time characters The Subtle Knife The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Shawn Michaels Billboard Hot 100 Predestination paradox Plasma (physics) Escape from New York 1987 World Series The Hobbit Conker's Bad Fur Day Father's Day (Doctor Who) The Fairly OddParents The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Colony in Space The Inside The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Donald Davidson (philosopher) Ocean's Twelve Child abuse Tofu The Empty Child Theory of conduct The Apprentice 2 Bad Wolf Samurai Deeper Kyo Joke EastEnders My Sassy Girl Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Minutes Child sexual abuse Pitaten Avenue Q Characters in the Smurfs Prisoner's dilemma The Contender (television series) Johnny 5 One Ring Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Poker jargon Jam (TV series) Code: Lyoko Jumpstart 3rd Grade Highway 61 Revisited Autism The Parting of the Ways Shinn Asuka Biff Tannen Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Entropy Infantilism The Keeper of Traken Sant Thakar Singh Monstrous Regiment (novel) Altruism W.I.T.C.H.
