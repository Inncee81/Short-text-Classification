my years old likes to hit or struck people when he has a temper tantrum what should i do in return my husband always hits back which didn't help much you cannot teach a child not to hit by hitting them just the same as you cannot mend a broken tap by breaking it or you can't teach someone to stop eating junk food by serving them junk food it is impossible of course your child is hitting people when he is angry isn't that precisely what he sees his father doing hitting him when he is angry with him he is doing what the most important man in his life his major role model is doing of course you have to make your house and your family a no hitting world no one can hit that's the rules that adults in the real world live by isn't it then that's the rules you must be teaching your child if i as an adult woman hit people at work when i disagreed with them you know what would happen to me i'd be charged and possibly arrested allowing kids to hit in anger is setting them up to fail in life when you son hits remove him instantly this is going to really test your abilities as parent you have to put him in his room and leave him there until he is ready to talk about it if he hits again you have to make sure he knows with absolute certainty what will happen that you will start removing his possessions from him one at a time until he has no toys left no clothes apart from the absolute basics no movies nothing this will only work if everyone in the house agrees and supports it if your husband keeps hitting your child your child will never stop hitting others good luck and i really recommend you get some parenting resources like parenting books from your local library find a plan that works stick with it and know that you are doing the best for your child Kodocha Pitaten Theory of conduct The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe One Tree Hill (TV series) Piccolo Junior Saga Avenue Q Knots Landing About a Boy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Friends Tenshinhan Divorce Escape from New York Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Spanking Baseball Characters of Naruto The Amber Spyglass God Emperor of Dune Fiddler on the Roof Rocko's Modern Life Poker jargon Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Child abuse The Shining (film) Ron Weasley Fathers' rights Justification (theology) Jean Grey The Jeffersons (South Park) Infantilism Family Original sin M16 (rifle) 1957 World Series Humphrey Bogart Autism Donald Neilson Second language acquisition Domestic violence Invader Zim Sin City Heinkel He 112 Transactional analysis Hulk (comics) Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Jackass: The Movie Static Shock Marriage Rich Mullins 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Ewoks: The Battle for Endor John F.
