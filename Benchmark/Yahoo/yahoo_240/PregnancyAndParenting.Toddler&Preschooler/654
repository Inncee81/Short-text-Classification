my year old is displaying this odd behaviour help my little boy has picked up the 'f' word from the chav brats next door they don't play together but we can hear them shouting and swearing in their garden which means i have to whisk him inside everytime they come out anyway i explained to him that it is a very bad word that he must not say it and he seemed to understand but now he keeps coming up to me in tears saying 'mummy i said f ' we could be sitting playing together and he will tell me he has said it but in truth he hasn't becuause i have been sitting with him that whole time and he hasn't said a word the only way i can explain it is that it's as if he is hearing himself say it in his head and then he is telling me he has said it it sounds bizarre i know but he is getting very distressed about it i keep punishing him each time he says it but it's not working it seems a bit pointless when he isn't actually doing it to be naughty it's like he keeps thinking it and feels guilty for doing so and telling me about it i would appreciate any advice from other parents on this i feel like i am constantly telling him off all day for this it seems to come no matter what we are doing seems to come up i will try the ignoring thing today and change the subject when he does it and see what happens thanks for your help sometimes it's hard to see a solution for yourself when you're so close to the problem i feel terrible for telling him off now im going to give him a big hug and say sorry to my little angel thank you all so much what most of you have said makes a lot of sense i will put it to good use xx by the way when i say punishment i just mean the naughty step i never smack my little boy something similar to this happened with a friend's child if he's crying and feeling so tough on himself for saying thinking this your constant telling him off could be causing him to develop a little self asteem problem or by telling him off every time for this and punnishing him he may have decided that this is a good way to get attention from his mother therefore he keeps it up this does not mean you dont provide him with enough attention and love just that he adores your company and will do anything for more of it tell him the other children are bad boys he's a good boy and that's why you love him be effectionate and spend extra time together at this point where he seems to be having a strange problem try devoting more time to him and praising him alot more you may see an improved difference in his strange behavior dont punnish him and get irritated over him saying a bad word it'll only imflame the situation especially if like i said he does it for attention from his mother you give him that attention he'll seek more and use his method bad word more often definitly continue to keep him away from those brats Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Theory of conduct Milton H.
