i have a year old son who is kind of shy how can i do to change that fact you cant change his personality but there are a few things that can help socialise him introducing him to other playmates his age and perhaps sending him to preschool or a centre that offers activities for young children like gymnastics or art this will help him get used to socialising with children also because this is what i found as a child my parents because i was quiet would often talk for me and i ended up getting too used to this try to give your child as many opportunies to speak for himself and maybe if he has trouble start him off and give him prompts but encourage him and praise him when he expresses himself even at home make it okay to be quiet but at the same time gently encourage him to meet other children and express himself through words even if he remains shy the rest of his life if has adequate conversational and social skills then he will be able to cope Education in the People's Republic of China Social rule Autism Property (ownership right) Kodocha Education in the United States Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Aesthetic Realism Education in Taiwan Alcoholics Anonymous Rudolf Steiner Sant Thakar Singh A Course In Miracles Dyslexia Jiddu Krishnamurti Hillary Rodham Clinton Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Traumatic incident reduction Baby Blues Humphrey Bogart Adoption Kender Montessori method Playmate Transactional analysis Homeschooling Autism rights movement Breastfeeding Socialization Past teachings of Prem Rawat Jacob Child sexual abuse Ludwig Wittgenstein Religious Society of Friends The Human Stain Grief Hikikomori Religious conversion Suzuki method Franklin (television series) Latin Early childhood education Percy Bysshe Shelley Yelena Davydova Mental retardation Hearing impairment Lou Gehrig Scenes from a Memory My Parents are Aliens Playboy (magazine) Milton H.
