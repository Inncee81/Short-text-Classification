how do you keep a crib sheet on the mattress when the child keeps pulling it off my month old pulls her crib sheet off just about every time she is in the crib then she gets upset and doesn't want to sleep right on the mattress but will when she gets tired any suggestions thank you they make elastic straps for just this thing you can usually find them at linens and things and bed bath and beyond or stores like that if you cannot find them make them yourself and attach them with velcro another possibility is to put a second sheet on the bottom side of the mattress so that the sides overlap that might make it harder for her to get it off if your sheets are older they may not be designed to fit the newer thicker mattresses maybe she is ready for a bed with a rail Mattress Sudden infant death syndrome Strap-on dildo Bed (furniture) Vacuum mattress Undergarment Textile manufacturing Cryptanalysis of the Enigma Shoe Berth Cascading Style Sheets Casualty lifting Brewery Flax Coir Textile manufacturing terminology De Lorean DMC-12 Drill bit Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) M16 (rifle) Pickup truck Bedbug Velcro Basic English Changeroom Paper size Plastic Windows XP Futon View camera Tent Tire Bicycle frame Urinary incontinence Carol Burnett Massage The Fairly OddParents Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Passenger car Equine conformation Avenue Q Social rule Waterbed Glossary of nautical terms Necktie The Critic Linen Archery Ultra Gemini 9A M4 Carbine Krag-J__rgensen Bombe Elastic Seismic retrofit Fecal incontinence Straw-bale construction Apollo Command/Service Module Floppy disk Mechanical advantage Knitting Boom (sailing) Professional wrestling match types Little Girl Lost (The Twilight Zone) SpongeBob SquarePants USS William B.
