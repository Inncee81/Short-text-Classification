my son won't sleep in his room ok my son who is yrs old will not go to sleep in his room at night he never had a problem with this before he loved being in his room by himself now all of a sudden about a week or two ago he started crying and saying that he wanted to sleep in our room because he was scared of the monster so we took down all of the decorations that were hanging on the wall and even patched up two small little holes on the ceiling because he said that he was scared of it but he still will not sleep in there he has two night lights in his room and i even leave the door open with the hall light on but that isn't working i don't know what else to do we did start potty training him at about the same time this started to happen so i don't know if this is associated with it or just a coincidence has anyone ever gone through this and if so how did you overcome his fear please no rude or mean answers my husband and i do work full time but it has been that way since my kids were born and we both make it a point to be with them when we get home from work we eat dinner together and go on evening walks everyday i do let him sleep in our room if he is really really upset and put him in his own bed in the middle of the night but i don't want to make this a habit i have a three year old who was terrified to sleep in his own room for some odd reason we don't let him sleep with us but we did explain to him that there is no such thing as monsters then my wife and i started to do a monster check before bed every night it was just part of the routine we'd go through everything and kind of make a game of it so after that he wasn't as scared we also got a cd of disney songs since he loves the movies and we play them for him and let him fall asleep to them they're happy and cheerful and that really helped sometimes when he got really terrified my wife or i would lay down with him until he was almost asleep also you may want to check and see if there's anything else frightening in the room there was a tree outside my son's window and when it was windy the branches would bang against the window and scare him to death we took care of that good luck he will grow out of it The Amber Spyglass The Time Machine The Shining (film) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Silent Night, Deadly Night Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Humphrey Bogart Avenue Q The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie The Catcher in the Rye Kitchen EastEnders Miss Saigon The Subtle Knife The Star Wars Holiday Special Jumpstart 3rd Grade Insomnia The Smoking Room The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Characters in the Smurfs Out-of-body experience Friends Knots Landing Jam (TV series) Pitaten Milton H.
