expecting baby how do i deal with jealousy i have a year old and expecting in a month i don't know how i'm gonna deal with the jealousy factor especially since it's already present with her dad she is very protective of her time with me and sometimes doesn't like it when he and i are talking or he has something she thinks is mine we've done everything we can think of to help with how clingy she is but nothing has worked and with the new baby coming that is the only thing i'm stressed and worried about any ideas i just dealth with the same thing brought my son home from the hospital weeks ago and my yr old slapped me and went into the babys room and pulled everything off the shelves and started crying whenever he looked at his brother he got over it after a few days but i found that making them feel usefull really helps letting them help with the baby etc i try to spend as much time with my yr old as possible while the baby is asleep playdoh cooking etc and he seems settled and fine dont change the routine of the yr old if possible my days are pretty all over the place but everynight we still make time for him to have a long play in the bath and a story before bed Shaggy dog story Grandview, U.S.A.
