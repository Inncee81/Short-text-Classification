could use some advice i just had paternity done and i am suppose to find out soon if i am the father of a year old girl that i didn't know about until last aug i would like to get visitation rights so i can get to know her if she is proven to be my daughter but at the same time i don't want her to get scared of me cause she has never seen me and doesn't know who i am i could really use some of your opinions or advice i think its great you want to know this little girl should she turn out to be your daughter every child deserves parents whether they live together or not i think you should take it slow at first see if mum will agree to meet at a park and spend a few saturdays getting to know her if she responds well step it up a notch to spending time at the park without mummy for an hour then you pick her up and take her somewhere then its overnight visits as she is older and better able to cope if you can help her make the adjustment over a mth period by the time she is she should be ready and willing to stay with her daddy without her mummy around her mum needs to help in this transition phase though because if she is being hostile towards you then it won't work and daughter will pick up on it and not want to be around you don't insist on just finding out shes yours and then demanding that every weekend she spend with you she needs stability and a transition phase so she doesn't feel scared but rather secure safe and loved it might be hard at first and but if you explain to the mother this sort of scenario i think she would agree as you are putting in time and effort to get to know her before spending time nights alone with her the mother is also going to feel that her daughter is in a safe and secure place with you trust is going to be a major hurdle but i'm sure you'll do fine good luck and well done for making the decision to be a part of her life About a Boy Sin City Little Britain Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Avenue Q Maison Ikkoku Social rule Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Saturday Night Live Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Theory of conduct Humphrey Bogart Fathers' rights movement in the UK Mina Mongoose 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Yoko Ono W.I.T.C.H.
