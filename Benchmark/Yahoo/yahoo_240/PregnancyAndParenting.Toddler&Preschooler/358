what are some signs that my daughter months needs her hearing checked i have a dr appt in a few weeks so please refrain from that line only respond if you are informed about this subject and not something that is copied and pasted off the internet she does respond to me when i call and when something gets dropped its mostly because of her speech is really muffled my friend said that her son acted the same as my daughter then she took him to get his hearing checked and they had to put tubes in his ears so now i am like how did i not know so i made a dr appt to get her hearing checked and feel so bad not thinking her speech could be cause of hearing problems you've done the right thing if your daughter's speech is delayed less than words or it seems mushy or garbled or unclear having her hearing checked is the first step if her hearing test is normal and her speech does not improve have her assessed by a speech pathologist not a therapist who specializes in young children you will get a report that specifies what stage her language is at from a developmental standpoint and a recommendation for further action for example you might find that she understands at a two year old level but speaks at a month old level this suggests delay due to hearing problems or oral motor problems if she is understanding and speaking at a one year old level then it may be a more global problem if necesary a developmental pediatrician is the next step to rule out autism and other developmental delays this takes time nine months from first screening to speech pathologist to developmental pediatrician for us to get a diagnosis of autism for our son and your daughter's problems may resolve naturally but it's better to get things started and stop them than to wait and be on longer waiting lists later if you are in ontario you should take your daughter to a first words screening clinic they have them in malls and community centers on a regular basis and this will get her on some waiting lists for funded speech therapy but for quickest results you need to go to a private speech pathologist i'm not sure if you have an appointment for a hearing assessment or just a doctor's appointment you can call clinics yourself and set up a hearing screening which is faster our speech pathologist found us a clinic we could see in a week rather that the six months we'd been told shop around good luck you're the best advocate your child has don't let anyone tell you not to worry and wait and see is well meaning but bad advice early intervention can do no harm oh i forgot get copies of every report your child has you may need to request this in writing but you have the right to a copy of anything to do with your daughter's health hope this helps Prostate cancer Asperger syndrome Controversies in autism Medicine Terri Schiavo Stuttering Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Autism rights movement Clinical depression Traumatic brain injury Stomach cancer Stroke Multiple sclerosis Hearing impairment Alcoholics Anonymous Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Cancer Breast cancer Aphasia Autism epidemic Dyslexia Psychoanalysis Physical therapy Chronic fatigue syndrome Scientology beliefs and practices Breastfeeding Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders CPU cache Tocopherol Hypoglycemia Information Technology Infrastructure Library Sensory Integration Dysfunction Childbirth Asthma Social rule Child sexuality Urinary incontinence Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Colorectal cancer Alzheimer's disease Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Medical analysis of circumcision Hormone replacement therapy (trans) AIDS Androgen insensitivity syndrome Mental retardation Thimerosal Freedom of speech Growth hormone treatment Reparative therapy Canadian Senate Pervasive developmental disorder Folic acid Phimosis HIV Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis Domain Name System Transsexuality Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Ethical challenges to autism treatment Psychosis Obsessive-compulsive disorder First Amendment to the United States Constitution Hypnosis Religious Society of Friends Ben Johnson (athlete) Radiation therapy Dyspraxia Puberty Psychiatry Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Pregnancy CPU design HIV test Bipolar disorder Cytomegalovirus Terri Schiavo timeline Past teachings of Prem Rawat Anorexia nervosa Singlish Pediatrics Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Infantilism Second language acquisition Alternative medicine Mesothelioma Pathology Expert system Physician Coeliac disease National Institutes of Health Chiropractic
