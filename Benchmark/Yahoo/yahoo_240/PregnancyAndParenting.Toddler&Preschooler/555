should i add people to daycare pick up list my ex husband wants to add people to the daycare pickup list when i asked him who he wanted to add he indicated that he wants to add his mother and his girlfriend his mother has suffered from manic depression for over years i remember him telling me stories of his mother getting upset with him in the car and driving the car saying see mommy drive the car see mommy drive the car faster as she would speed down the road how can i protect my daughter and not be offensive to my ex i have never met his girlfriend and only learned that she existed a few months ago through court proceedings even though they have been dating for almost a year is it reasonable to request that i meet his girlfriend and that he provide me with complete contact information before approving of her picking up my daughter should i do a background check my daughter is months old my ex and i share legal and physical custody he was not around the first months of my daughters life so the daycare provider's contract is with me who cares if you offend him it's unreasonable to expect you to be comfortable with a mentally ill person or stranger picking up your child certainly you have the right to meet and talk with anyone who may watch your child at any time including the girlfriend joint custody means joint decisions on important issues who your child is allowed to leave daycare with is an important issue Divorce EastEnders Day care Dissociative identity disorder Driver's license One Tree Hill (TV series) Maria Hertogh riots Probation officer Fathers' rights The Human Stain Sin City Knots Landing Vivian Solon Shaggy dog story Plame affair Involuntary commitment Child custody Rain Man About a Boy Mojave people Mental Health Act 1983 Speed limit Medical record Friends Days of our Lives National Kidney Foundation Singapore Abortion debate Transsexuality Clinical depression Domestic violence Polyamory Miranda warning Polygamy Bipolar disorder Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Motion picture rating system Terri Schiavo Surveillance God Emperor of Dune Sharon Tate Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Appeal Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Sant Thakar Singh George Costanza Children of God Taxicab Murder Abortion in the United States History of As the World Turns (2000-present) St. Elmo's Fire (film) The Contender (television series) Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Estoppel Kodocha Elk Grove Unified School District v.
