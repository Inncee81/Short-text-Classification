will the hospital allow my toddler to be there with me i'm scheduled for a cesarean in days i have a month old daughter who recently caught lice from a babysitter's house who failed to let me know she was having this problem since that was my planned babysitting option for my daughter while i was in the hospital with my newborn son i now don't have a babysitter i refuse to take her to that house of lice after this week of hell i've been through trying to get rid of the nasty bugs will they allow her to spend most of the day with me and my husband at the hospital my only plan we thought of was to have her spend most of the day with us in the hospital and for my husband to take her home during the night to rest and play and stuff he doesn't like the idea of leaving me alone at night in the hospital but my daughter's health is more important to me besides i'll have my newborn son to keep me company i wanted to ask just in case anyone else had experience with this will the hospital allow my daughter to be there daily to that first answerer i asked on here because that saves me from having to call the hospital and wait for a long time for an answer i asked for anyone who had experience with this for advice if you don't don't answer the question as for having family to watch her the babysitter was grandma who can't control the traffic in her house and hasn't been honest with me about it at all so i can't trust her any other family i have lives hours away lol so i'm kinda in a bind with that i thought about her getting pretty restless there so we're going to try to have lots for her to do hopefully it'll occupy her for most of it we've been in the hospital before where she was strapped down to the bed with rsv so hopefully she'll be happy she isn't on the hospital bed this time thank you for your answers as long as the baby's healthy and your daughter doesn't run wild she should be fine but from experience she will probably get restless after a few hours and will be hard to deal with my sister went through the same thing so her husband rented a hotel room next to the hospital do you have family that can help with her i would get a backup plan incase they don't let her or if she gets tired and cranky good luck with everything and congrats EastEnders Theory of conduct Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Social rule Knots Landing Avenue Q The Lovely Bones Breastfeeding Baby Blues Day care Calvin and Hobbes The Fairly OddParents Fiddler on the Roof The Catcher in the Rye Little Britain The Ashlee Simpson Show 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Soap opera Donald Rumsfeld Neighbours Pitaten Babe Ruth Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Irna Phillips About a Boy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Grandview, U.S.A.
