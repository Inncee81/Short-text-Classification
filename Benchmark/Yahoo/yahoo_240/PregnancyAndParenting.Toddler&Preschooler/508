how to motivate my years old girl to play she is always depend on me she will play if i am playing with her she will draw if i am seating near to her she will seat near to me in playground and she will watch tv all the time that i am waching and it doest matter what is that she doesnt whant to do anything herself she has brother y who is always can find somthing to play with and he wants her to paly with him but she is still so bored what can i do i cant seat ner to her and play with her all the time and i don t what her to tawch tv help it is not that she will cry without me she is very friendly but she doesn't whatn't to do things byherself my daughter was similar i think a good way to ease her into playing more without you right there is to slowly stop actually playing with her and ease into just being right there and then ease into being nearby and then ease into just being in the room etc for instance my kids are pretty good at doing their homework by themselves but they are much better at doing it on their own when i am right there with them in the room doing something else but being with them i am usually in the kitchen cleaning or cooking and they sit at the kitchen table they can ask me questions but i'm sort of busy but not too busy i'm not looking over their shoulder but i'm nearby if she will draw when you are sitting near her try sitting just a little further away and see what happens if she needs you to be drawing with her try starting out drawing with her and then stop and stay there and see if she will continue drawing even though you have stopped it's a process of getting her to slowly not care that you aren't participating quite as much and slowly she will be able and willing to do more and more as you do less and less Kitchen Shaggy dog story Theory of conduct Humphrey Bogart Aerial (dance move) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Baroque chess The Amber Spyglass Silent Night, Deadly Night EastEnders Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Ben Johnson (athlete) Milton H.
