what is up with my yr old she used to go right to bed with a kiss and good night then suddenly she is having night terrors i think waking up screaming those finally stopped but now she refuses to go to bed at all and will stay up to pm midnight most nights she doesn't even seem tired which is what surprises me the most anybody have a similiar story and what did you do to fix it my oldest son just went through that after my husband left and what we had to do was just send him to bed at the same time every night and make it a routine eat dinner at was bath and by he was in bed it was hard the first few nights because he screamed and cried but when he got up we just put him back in bed and said see it is dark outside so it is time to go night night after about week we would say it is time for dinner and then it is time for a bath and as soon as his jammies were on he would grab his blankie and say night night go to bed and we would take him in a nd plop him down in bed and he was off to sleep kids that age push their boundaries to know where they stand and they are starting to have realization of time so a routine that is the same every night helps them know what will happen next which is very important to them for feeling secure Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story The Shining (film) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Rais massacre The Tracey Ullman Show shorts Aerial (dance move) Futurama (TV series - season 5) Miss Saigon Sin City Odyssey Trapped in the Closet Episodes of Lost (Season 2) The Amber Spyglass Grandview, U.S.A.
