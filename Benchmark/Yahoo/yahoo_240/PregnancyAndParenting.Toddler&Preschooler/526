how do i get my year old to stop wetting the bed at night and in the daytime i have children is about to be next month in september and i have a newborn who is three weeks old i have been giving my oldest daughter attention but not as much since the new baby has arrived because of the demand for some reason though ever since the baby has been home my year old has been wetting the bed at night and in the day time she does wet the bed sometimes but this is beyond she has wet up all her clothes and when i ask her why she just stares at me i get her up in the middle of the night she still wets the bed limit her liquid intake by i even make sure she feels important and a part of this new change by letting her help me i set time aside for her and if she doesn't wet herself i give her a treat but somehow she keeps on doing it i have tried everthing asking her whats wrong i dont know what elese it could be or how i can change this situation any suggestions sounds like you're doing everything you can to stop the bedwetting perhaps it's a temporary thing because of the baby could be she's trying to get your attention even though you're doing the right thing by making her a part of things the clue is that it started when the baby came home my guess is that it's temporary i know you have a lot to do and you need your rest but somebody needs to get her up at night this shouldn't last long best wishes and congratulations on your newborn Urinary incontinence Breastfeeding Kimberly-Clark Corporation Bedwetting Social rule Theory of conduct EastEnders Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Avenue Q Jon Secada Dog training Pyramid (game show) Infant Shaggy dog story Childbirth The Apprentice 2 Milton H.
