do you find yourself comparing your twins abilities even though you know that you shouldn't for example i have month old twin boys twin a started saying words much earlier than than twin b but now twin b has a much better grasp of language he speaks in sentences and he seems to pick up new vocabularly very well whereas twin a rarely uses any kind of sentence and often communicates by nonverbal yelling and pointing i know both are normal for their age group and i know how to work with twin a to improve his skills but sometimes i still compare them and worry about him all the time i have twin year olds we always compare them we have one who started talking a lot sooner as well he is also the more dominant personality so it seems the other twin just naturally let his brother speak for him i'm sure eventually they'll even out but it's natural to compare them we worried when they were younger but now it's not such a big deal Autism Milton H.
