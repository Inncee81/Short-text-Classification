so im gonna be a mommy to an month old for one week please give me advice on anything you can im nervous but dont want to admit it to my sis so im telling her im ready i do not understand you are going to babysit your sister's child for a week that is not being a mommy hardly but anyway months is a fun age they are curious about everything they are learning to be independent but at the same time must still rely on an adult a lot of hands on activities are a necessity they should not be long however as the attention span of a child that age can be rather short back yard sprinkler play bubbles balloons watch carefully balloons are all a hit how about sidewalk chalk refrigerator magnets chunky puzzles books that you can read to him or her blocks puppets etc will be fun and entertaining have your sister leave a list of what the child likes and does not like as far as food fears animals etc and what not what is the routine it will be important to stick to the routine as closely as possible as it will probably be upsetting enough for the child to be away from his her parents for a week it will also help you determine why the child is cranky if you realize that it is almost nap time for instance what are the child's favorite toys are there any allergies or health issues what are emergency contact numbers pediatrician poison control etc you need written documentation authorizing you to consent for medical care int he case of an emergency have your sister ask her pediatrician about this ahead of time it is very important and in the case of an emergency it will be too late to worry about it then just have fun as i said children are very fun at that age but watch over him or her carefully because they are also prone to getting into everything i wish you the best edited to add the first answerer covered some issues that i did not think of certainly if you are watching this child in your home you need to take the answerer's advice and make sure your home is baby safe i automatically assumed that you would be in the child's home as it would be more comfortable for the child also music my children love music and at that age they loved to dance Breastfeeding EastEnders Autism Childbirth Kodocha Pediatrics Jennifer Lopez Novel Asperger syndrome Spidey Super Stories The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Medicine Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder GED Sesame Street Allergy Friends Garfield The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Controversies in autism Dog training Children of God Pet skunk Avenue Q Humphrey Bogart Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Dog Spice Girls Franklin (television series) Britney Spears Pitaten Hamster Calvin and Hobbes Futurama (TV series - season 4) Infantilism Melanie Wilkes Phimosis Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Rain Man C programming language A Series of Unfortunate Events Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Joke Shaggy dog story Crossword Billiards Dinosaurs (TV series) The Lovely Bones Roswell UFO incident Python programming language Child sexuality Comanche Roxette Ben Johnson (athlete) Wheel of Fortune Team Fortress Classic Charmed Futurama (TV series - season 5) Gwen Stefani Condom Charles Darwin's illness A Course In Miracles Whose Line Is It Anyway?
