is it safe to take an month old to a swimming pool to swim with a life jacket fitted to him and i have first aid and also was a lifeguard only taugh teen adult lessons no longer certified though i think it's great to take young kids in the pool at that age they're going to learn to splash around and get used to the water and maybe even put their faces in i agree with all the others i would definitely stay with him and within reach at all times i would forego the lifejacket though if you are actively swimming with him he won't need it without it he will be able to splash around and play more freely greatly increasing the chance that he'll enjoy the water also he'll learn about his body's natural bouyancy which will help get him ready for learning to swim also if he thinks he can swim because of his life jacket he might go running into the water sometime without it when you aren't close by thinking he can swim Personal flotation device Drowning Diving Lifeguard Swimming pool Breaststroke Swimming Tag Diving suit Triathlon History of swimming Scuba set Cartoon Network Adult Swim Shark Boy Scouts of America Backstroke Fountain Splash pad Butterfly stroke Kitesurfing Infantilism Mojave people Final Fantasy: Unlimited Urban beach Bathing Bottlenose Dolphin Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Platypus Aerial (dance move) Frogman YMCA Front crawl Kender Jeans Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man Beavis and Butt-head Baptism Sport Futurama (TV series - season 5) German commando frogmen Body piercing Sauna USS William B.
