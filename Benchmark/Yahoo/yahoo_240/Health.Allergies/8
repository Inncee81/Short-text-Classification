flea problems okay out cats had fleas and now there everywher in my house my mom bought a fogger and did the downstairs twice they are still there she also did the upstairs and then she spayered the house with this flea killer help what do u do also i have about flea bites on my left foot and ankle and on my right if i get to many bites can it kill me or do anything harmful to me look into diatamaceous earth de it is a natural earth product created from pulverized fossilized crustaceans as a powder it acts like billions of tiny tiny little razorblades that slash the flesh of fleas and other pests so that they dehydrate and die this is not a poison and is totally non toxic and safe to pets and humans because it is not a poison there is no way for fleas to build up an immunity so it can be used as frequently and for as long as needed some exterminators can put this stuff down for you but you can do it yourself you will want to take precautions when spreading it to be sure that children and pets are not around and to be sure and protect your eyes and do not inhale the powder because it can be irritating to the nose and eyes until the dust settles you probably should wear a long sleeved shirt and maybe even gloves for the same reason it's a good idea to shampoo your carpet before spreading this stuff because it settles into the nap of the carpet and is effective for months to a years but only if you don't shampoo the carpet once it is down you can also spread de outside you can safely use it on hardwood floors and floor tiles use it in the attic and if you have a basement use it there too it does kill spiders and roaches you should be able to find de at any feed store it's been awhile since i priced it at that time it cost between cents to per pound at some feedstores you will only be able to purchase it in pound pkgs at others you can buy it from bulk and purchase anything from a few ounces to as many pounds as you can carry this is an extremely fine powder so a little goes a long way Cat Shampoo Drill bit Carbon dioxide Flea Hamster Illegal drug trade Tobacco Stairway Sento Beetle Technetium Animal testing Domestic rabbit Air pollution Pet skunk Carpet Minor Harry Potter Beasts Depleted uranium Sesshomaru Asbestos RuneScape weapons Mosquito Guinea pig Diatomaceous earth Blood (computer game) Uranium RuneScape locations Diseases of the honeybee Use of poison gas in World War I Welding Rabies Fire extinguisher Coffee Clothing Insect Tattoo Shark Alcohol fuel Red Hot Chili Peppers RuneScape quests Characters of Naruto Thimerosal Combine (Half-Life 2) Gypsy moth Explosive material Dairy Iron Animal Crossing Basement Ammunition American Alligator Ranma __ characters Cigarette One Piece minor characters Breastfeeding Poison Fire fighting Castle of the Winds Diving Hunting Chemical warfare Autonomous building Pesticide Aluminium Plutonium Energy development Chocolate Methamphetamine Hand grenade Tiny Toon Adventures DDT Helium Spider Wal-Mart 2001 anthrax attacks Richard Chase Inflation Hay fever M16 (rifle) Nuclear power Zinc Carbon Battlebots Diving suit Fluorescent lamp Shaggy dog story Cocaine The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Cochineal Saw II
