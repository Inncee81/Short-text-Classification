is it a milk allergy lactose intolerance or something else i used to be lactose intolerant but was over it for about five years now for the past couple of years i've had what i've assumed was and what my doctor told me was an allergy to milk the symptoms do match i get hives and my throat swells but only with certain foods i can however have processed or cooked milk cheese sour cream lactaid yogurt etc but not pure milk products like milk ice cream and whipped cream that matches neither allergy nor intolerance if it was intolerance i wouldn't have those symptoms and if it were an allergy i wouldn't be able to have any milk products at all what do i have any and all answers are welcome it sounds like an intolerance to me my children were lactose intolerant for the first few years of their lives and have slowly become more able to tolerate some dairy foods like you they have experienced a greater degree of intolerance with certain foods ice cream and cream for one and cheese for the other the foods you don't react to may be contributing to a greater degree of reaction with pure milk solids as an intolerance is about levels of substance people can also develop intolerances at different times of life and for different periods of time you are right about an allergy any incidence of the protein would cause a reaction trust your instincts and avoid the foods you react to Lactose intolerance Milk Dairy product Cheese Allergy Ice cream Dairy Yoghurt Cream (food) Crohn's disease Breastfeeding Multiple chemical sensitivity Soy milk Butter Tofu Veganism Vegetarianism Soybean Pasteurization Meat analogue Raw milk Vitamin D Diarrhea Protein Chronic fatigue syndrome Sugar Charles Darwin's illness Cat Fermentation Soy protein Coffee Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Flatulence Atkins Nutritional Approach Asthma Cheesecake Chocolate Mouth ulcer Food science Aspartame Livestock Insomnia Breakfast Medicine Coeliac disease Acid Omega-3 fatty acid Breast milk Angioedema Psoriasis Tattoo Listeriosis Biochemistry Glucose Capsaicin Sour cream Alcohol fuel Water (molecule) Insulin Basic taste Milkshake Pancake Gelatin Irritable bowel syndrome Guinea pig Immunoglobulin E Cuisine of Austria Methylsulfonylmethane Cocaine Bengali cuisine German cuisine Hypoglycemia Lac operon Eczema Bloating Infant formula Hedgehog Drink Water Acetic acid Food preservation Clomipramine Anaphylaxis Tea
