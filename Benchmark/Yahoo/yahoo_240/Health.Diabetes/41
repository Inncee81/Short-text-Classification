i am some and after hysterectomy years ago started to gain allot of weight now having diabetes i try to diet but honestly i get so discouraged because i feel like i do so good but no results or if any very little most of all my concern is i carry wieght in my stomach i always had a flat stomach but now i have people asking me when i am due what can i do well the old remedy for that problem was to go on hormones for a few more years but that's iffy now i would say natural hormones made by certain old fashioned pharmacists work pretty well other than that its a lot of hard work and exercise if you have diagnosed diabetes tho you most likely would not need meds if you lost sufficient weight it's the extra weight that triggers the diabetes enrolling in a gym or weight loss program really works last thought get tested for low thyroid even if its borderline get low dose thyroxine a prescription item Diabetes mellitus Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Chronic fatigue syndrome Hypoglycemia Medicine Coeliac disease Obesity Growth hormone treatment Hypothyroidism Hyperglycemia Insulin Thyroid Dieting Folic acid Insulin resistance Pneumonia Polycystic ovary syndrome Turner syndrome Clinical depression Tocopherol Thyroid cancer Cancer Homeopathy Hormone Atherosclerosis Endocrinology Osteoporosis Atkins Nutritional Approach Ionizing radiation Oral contraceptive Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stroke Erectile dysfunction Graves-Basedow disease Alzheimer's disease Cystic fibrosis Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Diabetic neuropathy Congenital hypothyroidism Weight training Borderline personality disorder Nutrition Osteoarthritis Asthma Migraine Growth hormone deficiency Amiodarone Breastfeeding Hypopituitarism Urinary incontinence Thyroid hormone Paracetamol Low-carbohydrate diet Chernobyl accident Vegetarianism Angina Hyperthyroidism Adjustable gastric band Stomach cancer Weight loss Chocolate Endocrine system Myocardial infarction Binge eating disorder Sugar substitute Fibromyalgia Diabetes mellitus type 2 Glucokinase Diabetes insipidus Endometriosis Milk Cervical cancer Acromegaly Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Aspirin Hypertension Growth hormone Obstetrics 2000 Australian Grand Prix Aspartame Birth weight Emergency contraception Caffeine Antipsychotic Anorexia nervosa Diabetic coma Menopause Autoimmune diseases Veganism Vitamin D Human skin color Raw food diet Glucose tolerance test Multiple sclerosis Traumatic brain injury Metabolic syndrome Omega-3 fatty acid Childbirth Homosexuality and transgender
