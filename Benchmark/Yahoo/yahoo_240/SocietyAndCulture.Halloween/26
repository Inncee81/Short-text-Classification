halloween party ideas i am thinking about throwing a halloween party and i have to have the best party ever i threw one a few months ago and evryone was talking about it i went all out and i need to top it with my next party i will most likely go all out with decorations but what can i do to make it spectacular make your whole house like a haunted house i know it sounds lame and over done but make it your own you should get a bunch of decorations like you said and if you have the money hire people to be ghosts and dead people walking around the place or again with money have people sitting around the house during the party that look dead and spring up once in a while or having someone kill someone fake that'll scare everyone make sure to have really good halloween food and lots of candy scare tricker treaters too that's always fun don't forget the alcohol if you are of age Halloween Dead Like Me Trick-or-treat Treehouse of Horror XII Treehouse of Horror XI Sluggy Freelance Day of the Dead EastEnders The Amber Spyglass Ron and Fez Scream (film) Garfield Carnival Prank flash The Haunted Mansion Rice University Egg (food) Time Out of Mind Knott's Berry Farm Piccolo Junior Saga Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Horror film New York's Village Halloween Parade Treehouse of Horror IX Rent (musical) The Emancipation of Mimi Avenue Q Casper the Friendly Ghost Silent Night, Deadly Night The Apprentice 2 RuneScape economy Animal Crossing The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Blonde on Blonde Ghost Columbine High School massacre Mad Money The Shining (film) Eric Cartman Culture of France Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Misfits Knots Landing Great Teacher Onizuka Satchel Paige Social rule National Lampoon's Animal House Shaggy dog story Survivor (novel) Breath of Fire III Nineteen Eighty-Four Treehouse of Horror XIII Mardi Gras Tag Beavis and Butt-head The Inside Phish Aquemini The 7th Guest The X-Files (season 1) The Young Ones (TV series) Make money fast Batman: The Long Halloween Le Malade imaginaire Pitaten Charles Dickens Milton H.
