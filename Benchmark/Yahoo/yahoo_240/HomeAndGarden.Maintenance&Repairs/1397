electrical heating stays at c even if programmable thermostat is set at we shut off and removed the heater simple white unit in my bedroom to install a laminated floor since we reinstalled the heater it just keeps on heating to over c even if my programmable thermostat is set at c what gives we only uninstalled the heater not the thermostat if the heater was wired wrong wouldn't it cause a short circuit i followed dennis' advice to no avail it's degrees outside and the baseboard is continually heating it's so hot i can't event touch it i'll shut the breaker but i need to know now what needs to be changed the baseboard unit or the thermostat on the wall could it be simply miss wired if it worked before i'd try that first additioanally the question is did it work before you removed the wiring to put in then floor if it did then it must be wired wrong it is not likely that the thermostat just happend to go bad the power source is likely or vac leg of power should go to the heater and the other should be interupted by the line voltage thermostat and connect to the other wire feeding the heater element good luck Thermostat Three-phase electric power HVAC Apollo 13 Furnace Electrical wiring Solar power Refrigerator Oscilloscope Bi-metal Vacuum tube Transformer Relay Electrical element Circuit design Overhead lines Ring circuit Fuse (electrical) Hysteresis Fan (implement) Circuit breaker Antenna (radio) Thermocouple Domestic AC power plugs and sockets BS 1363 Central processing unit Transistor Lineman (occupation) Spark plug Tesla coil Electric motor Gas metal arc welding Carburetor Residual-current device Switch Water heater Basement Process control Digital circuit Soldering iron Welding Incandescent light bulb Autonomous building Capacitor Electrical wiring (UK) Seismic retrofit Logic gate High-voltage direct current Peltier-Seebeck effect Solar panel Fossil fuel power plant Alternating current Resistor Ironing Heating element Potentiometer Power strip Short circuit Impedance Electronic amplifier Energy Radioisotope thermoelectric generator Electric power transmission Fluorescent lamp Maxwell's equations Solar cell High-voltage hazards Wind power Electrical resistance Pebble bed reactor Electricity meter Wind turbine Ground (electricity) Conductor (material) Split phase Operational amplifier Impedance matching Diode Radiator Electrical generator Waterbed Printed circuit board Ground and neutral Hall effect Electronics X10 (industry standard) Embedded system Burglar alarm Heat Rice cooker Voltmeter Stairway Bathroom Electrician Volt Electrophysiology MOSFET
