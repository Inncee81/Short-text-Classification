what is the good better best brands of heating air components and wich to stay away from i've heard of trane carrier heil but wich is best or does it really matter with the brand on a furnace and a c unit i'm getting a lot of quotes that range from up to for a ton a c btu gas furnace my home is right at sq ft and has vents of wich are ran in the attic b c that part of the house is a addition one guy wants to tear out all the attic vents and put in new ones and double them from to some are hybrid heat pump and they are more expensive but not by more than over the standard but i havn't had to shop for this type of item before and i don't know much about it and of course every sales guy that comes out with a different brand claims their's is the best trane is one of the best manufacturers i would stay away from carrier be careful of names you have not heard before because chances are carrier owns them i could go into great detail about why you should not choose carrier but it would take a lot of time i do not have a manual j in front of me and do not know the volume of your home but from experience tons for sf might be to much air units are like cars continual start and stop will hurt the unit more than a good steady run units installed larger than required start and stop frequently because it does not take them long to cool or heat the problem with that is the unit does not run long enough to equalize the humidity in the air as for costs of unit there are many options new law enacted by the help of global warming gore has raised the seers level of all hvac units the minimum level of seers rating is seers as opposed to seers the problem with this is that the copper tubing for the lower rating seers will not work with all higher seers units this requires more time and material for insulation the good thing about the higher seers ratings is that they are more energy efficient variable speeds are the most expensive and the most efficient unless you plan on living there for more than years you may not make back in energy savings that you spent for the unit i do believe that in the next years people are going to look past the cost of a home and look into the cost to operate a home Solar power Air conditioning Hydrogen economy Furnace Carburetor Nuclear power Solar cell Hybrid vehicle Transformer M16 (rifle) Welding Wind turbine Thermal power station Alcohol fuel HVAC Turbocharger Fossil fuel power plant Diesel engine Spark plug Casting Toyota Prius Wind power Brewery Nuclear reactor Steam engine Internal ballistics Motor oil Explosive material Ocean thermal energy conversion Renewable energy Carbon dioxide Gas metal arc welding Battery electric vehicle Automobile Fuel injection Internal combustion engine Circuit breaker Supercharger Pebble bed reactor Microeconomics Rocket fuel Solar power satellite Gramophone record Insurance Airbus A380 Loudspeaker Steel Energy development Electric arc furnace Diode Inflation Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Gas turbine Daylight saving time Inventory Vacuum Mitigation of global warming Lighting Gasoline Hydraulic machinery Transistor Motorcycle TGV Optical fiber Tire Diving suit CPU design Fire fighting Personal rapid transit United States Postal Service Nuclear weapon design Hydrogen vehicle Circuit design Swamp cooler STS-62 Water (molecule) Bicycle lighting United Kingdom corporation tax Capitalism Powder metallurgy Ceramics Battery (electricity) Electrical wiring Turbofan Central processing unit Bicycle frame Biodiesel
