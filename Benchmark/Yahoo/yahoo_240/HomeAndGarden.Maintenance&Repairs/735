recently had repair to new cabinet vendor is saying it will darken over several weeks to match original shade moved into new home one cabinet needed minor repair vendor took cabinet to his shop sanded and stained however repair area is noticeably lighter than all other adjacent cabinets vendor said it is cherry wood real and stained hazlenut color the color will darken to match other cabinets within a couple of weeks from lighting in the house it seems like i'm getting a fish story can anyone tell me the real skinny thanks cherry does darken over time particularly if exposed to sunlight some flourescent lights will do this also as to how much it will darken well we can't really say if it will be enough without being there to look at it however your vendor can always take it back and darken it some more by applying a slightly darker color to the topcoat without having to sand it all back to bare wood just a little light scuffing to get the new topcoat to adhere would be all that's necessary my recommendation would be to get it in writing that if the color does not conform to the rest of the cabinets within days that the vendor will rework it you didnt mention it but realistically they should have taken a door or drawer face that did not need repair to use as a reference matching existing colors is a challenge at times and a good reference sample is priceless good luck Black Arcade cabinet Knife Sunlight Color theory Melanin Eye color Coffee Human skin color Ultraviolet Computer animation Wood Campfire Nintendo Entertainment System Microscopy Wood carving Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Bluebeard's Castle Atari 8-bit family Lunar eclipse Extraterrestrial skies Bulk vending Shroud of Turin Radio controlled airplane Color blindness Physical attractiveness Drawing Kigo Magical objects in Harry Potter NTSC Volleyball Babe Ruth Oscilloscope Shade Wing Commander (computer game) Equine conformation Seismic retrofit Staining (biology) Final Fantasy (video game) Four color theorem Dog Chess terminology Pump It Up Prime Minister of Canada Kitchen USS Sand Lance (SS-381) The Tomb of the Cybermen Autogyro St Albans Cathedral Psoriasis Prime Minister of the United Kingdom X Window System Shetland Sheepdog Tooth bleaching Agarose gel electrophoresis Houseplant Sun Stained glass Professional wrestling slang Red Christmas tree USS Seadragon (SS-194) Glass Albedo Anchor Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Coat (dog) Fischer Random Chess Professional wrestling match types Ammolite Woodworking Primer (paint) Medical prescription Weight training Dragon Booster Heinkel He 100 Japanese tea ceremony CPU cache Marching band Color temperature Electron microscope San Francisco Giants Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Harp OpenGL Scientology beliefs and practices Richard Rahl Color Color vision Spirit rover timeline for 2004 February USS Augusta (CA-31) Biblical archaeology Glasses The Hobbit Spidey Super Stories
