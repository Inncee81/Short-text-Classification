central air unit outside has dampness on the concrete around it my a c unit outside has dampness around it i live in the south where summer temperatures approach almost daily i had the unit serviced in may by someone who works as the maitenance person for an apartment complex he is also the person who installed this unit two summers ago the unit is cooling fine but all of this dampness concerns me is this normal or is something leaking that i should look into when he serviced the unit he said it was lbs low on freeon spelling i thought this was strange for a new unit is it yes it is normal the larger pipe the one with the insulation on it will gather condensate especially on the inside of the ac unit where the line is not wrapped so it is doing just what it should the fact that you were two pounds of freon low is not normal either the guy didn't put in the lbs or he did and the original installers didn't fill the freon up correct or you have a leak in the system if you have a leak that large insulated line will get a frost on it if that happens call you ac guy and have him find the leak and get it fixed or you stand the chance of freezing up the compressor Air conditioning Refrigerator Jet engine Haloalkane Thermal power station Solar power Hydrogen economy Cray-1 HVAC Autonomous building Phase (matter) Vacuum Insulation Gas compressor Vacuum tube Passive solar Mercury Atlas 6 Fossil fuel power plant Circuit design Basement Climate of the United Kingdom Containment building Carburetor Pebble bed reactor Seismic retrofit Superconductivity Supercharger Phase change heat pump Apollo 13 Frost Carbon dioxide Heat Glass Electrical wiring Water (molecule) Asbestos Air pollution Spark plug Space Shuttle Columbia disaster Heinkel He 100 Brewery Ice cream Ocean thermal energy conversion Chevrolet Corvair engine Space Shuttle external tank Futurama (TV series - season 5) Bleed air Furnace Refrigeration Gas turbine Engine cooling Helium Diving suit Flush toilet Swamp cooler Ammonia Thermostat TGV Energy development Loudspeaker Overhead powerline Overhead lines Pound Roof and tunnel hacking Fog Huntington Beach, California Casting Electric power transmission Ice Seismometer Transformer Mars Exploration Rover Turbofan B-47 Stratojet Thunderstorm Chernobyl accident Computer cooling Air brake (rail) Fire fighting Geothermal exchange heat pump Super Mario 64 Mercury 4 Nuclear power Chevrolet Corvair Harp Knife Tire Teller-Ulam design Electricity pylon Diode Turbocharger Bong Axial compressor Fuel cell Action potential Hydropower Geology of the Moon W.
