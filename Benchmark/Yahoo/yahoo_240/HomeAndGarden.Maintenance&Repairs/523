i moved into a newly built house weeks ago the central air is not flowing evenly thru house any suggestion get the contractor back in and have him balance it under warranty failing that make sure the filter is not clogged with construction dust do a make shift balance by closing down the grills in the rooms getting to much air this will cause air noise at the grills so this is a temporary measure once you get it fairly balanced you will want to take notice of where the damper position of each grill is e g closed closed etc get a piece of duct board pressed fiberglass or styrofoam insulation at your favorite home center with the air off remove the grill from each register box that has the grill closed more that cut a piece of the duct board to snugly fit the side of the register box where the air duct is cut into it measure the hole in the register box for the duct for my example i am going to assume that the register on the box was closed and the duct size was inches once you have a piece of ductboard that fits snugly over the opening for the duct remove it and cut a hole through it equal to open percentage i e if the grill was closed it is open so we cut a hole of inches which equals diameter i realize this is not of the area this is the way that it works insert the ductboard over the hole in the register box reinstall grill with the damper full open repeat for all the grills closed or more you should have a fairly even temperature through the house now good luck Drill bit HVAC Bong Thermal power station Gramophone record Spark plug Loudspeaker Printed circuit board Screw Tire Furnace Opportunity rover Carburetor Propeller Dundas Square Door Casting Flute Jet engine Glass Transformer Fume hood Window Entropy Brewery Action potential Radio controlled airplane Dog agility Seismic retrofit Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Air conditioning Polystyrene Table saw Carbon dioxide Semiconductor Kasparov versus The World Diamond Knife Explosive material Panama Canal Locks Passive solar Two-stroke cycle Ozone depletion Movie projector Textile manufacturing Space shuttle main engine Diving suit Fiberglass Shoe Fossil fuel power plant Upholstery Baroque chess Ice core Vacuum Glossary of firefighting equipment Diode Dialysis Ozone hole View camera Piano Hard disk Betting (poker) Semiconductor device Stairway Solar power Coffin Floppy disk STS-114 Wind turbine Equine conformation B-47 Stratojet Internal ballistics E85 Nose flute Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Wrench Anemometer Clarinet Sun Turbofan Cello Punt (boat) Diving regulator Kitchen Kidney Wood carving Rathfarnham Table tennis Glossary of partner dance terms Bicycle frame Textile manufacturing terminology Jennings Randolph Lake Straw-bale construction Duct tape Hubble Space Telescope Wood
