is there any way i can bill my neighbor fir trimming and removing branches from his trees on my property this has been going on for more than yrs i've tried to be neighborly but no use every time i cut the overhang she starts with they are my trees leave them alone i know i can cut them 'cause the town and the village have told me so i live in ny state i'm disabled now and can not continue to do this work for her sure you can bill them it's a matter of ethics from what i see you are correct as to you being able to legally trim the over hang now that you are disabled if you hire it done you would have to pay the person s and in turn pass the bill on to your neighbor failure to pay this you can easily take your neighbor into small claims court and you will get your monies due try this send your neighbor a letter of intent of what you will do if they won't keep the trees trimmed send this certified mail and make sure you keep a copy if you go to small claims be polite but direct in your letter of intent i know the value of being and have good neighbors it sounds to me they aren't very good neighbors but you want to be this will work for you if they won't take care of there trees oh keep track of monies you have to pay to get this done filing fees etc you will be awarded this as well i have a feeling that the letter of intent certified will do it hopefully you will look out oneday and they took care of them without futher action good luck United States Postal Service Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Notary public Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 SCO-Linux controversies Appeal Theory of conduct Article One of the United States Constitution Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Terri Schiavo Trust (Law) USA Public domain Royal Assent Trademark Poker jargon Animal Crossing Taxation in the United States Mail fraud Tom DeLay Ethics Wal-Mart Estoppel Domestic partnerships in California Health insurance Software patent debate Make money fast Public good E-mail spam Copyright infringement of software Democratic Party (United States) Health care in the United States Military unrest since the Fiji coup of 2000 Evan Mecham Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution Political correctness Fair Game (Scientology) Advance fee fraud Public-key cryptography Christmas tree National Kidney Foundation Singapore Jean Schmidt Medical malpractice Unemployment benefit Bush v.
