i bought and hooked up a cheap digital thermostat ac worked before hand didn't work after rehooked up old still don't work what the world is wrong did you shut off the power to the system before hooking up the thermostat if you did not you may have short circuited the wires and burned up the transformer it takes th of a second to melt a transformer to test access the wires from the back of the thermostat the red wire is the power jump it to the green wire if your indoor fan comes on your transformer is still good if the fan does not come on you have a dead transformer if you are fortunate it may be a fuse that has opened up rather than the transformer if the fan functions jump red to yellow this is the cooling the system may have a short delay up to minutes if after seven minutes the cooling does not come on you have a problem that will need to be corrected by a reputable service company if the system does work your problem is with the 'stat or how you hooked it up if it was made in china the stat may be dead in the box not that uncommon take it back to retailer and get a replacement keep kool Thermostat Fuse (electrical) Apollo 13 Solar power Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Transformer Circuit breaker Telephone exchange Embedded system Residual-current device Central processing unit Cable television DVD HVAC STS-61 Universal Serial Bus Voice over IP Oscilloscope BS 1363 Armored Core Cray-1 Lineman (occupation) Computer Three-phase electric power Ice hockey Light-emitting diode Joy Division (band) Thermal power station Relay Digital circuit Circuit design Field-programmable gate array Telephone IBM PC compatible Transformers: Armada Phreaking Power line communication Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis International League Link (Legend of Zelda) Printed circuit board Electrical wiring (UK) Action potential Welding Futurama (TV series - season 5) Gas metal arc welding Carburetor Unicode Thermocouple Bubble Bobble Dog agility DualDisc Three Mile Island Cleveland Browns MapleStory Hand grenade MOSFET Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Ceramics Incandescent light bulb Calculator Overclocking Vacuum tube Walt Disney World Railroad Mario Poker jargon Pebble bed reactor Apollo 1 Apollo Guidance Computer Electrophysiology Electronics Compiler optimization System/34 Sonic the Hedgehog Electric motor Professional wrestling throws Earthing system Peter Gabriel Wi-Fi Overhead lines Items in the Metroid series Solar cell Donkey Kong 64 Railway signalling TGV Electrical wiring Control system Loudspeaker RS-232 Oakland Athletics Switch Mattress Doctor Who (Enemy Within) Atari 8-bit family Megas XLR Transistor SCART ITunes Music Store Aircraft carrier Public-key cryptography
