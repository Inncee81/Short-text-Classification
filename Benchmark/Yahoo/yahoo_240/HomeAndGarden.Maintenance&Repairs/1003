the refrigerator in the office isn't keeping things cold what could be the cause i had a bottle of powerade in the freezer since yesterday afternoon and went to get it today and it just feels like it's been in a refridgerator at it's coldest temp needless to say it wasn't frozen i showed it to my boss and she said that the handyman needs to vacuum the coils does this sound right if so what else could be the cause aren't the coils on the back of the fridge i went to look at them to see how dusty they were but i didn't see any coils have they changed the location of the coils there is a metal cover about inches wide and the length of the fridge vertically on the back could this be covering the coils doubtful about this any other suggestions are gladly appreciated you could be low on freon but probably your boss is right a good cleaning of the coils condenser motor etc in the back will probably do wonders oh yeah the coils are what the fan blows through the hot gas from the condenser passes through this and is cooled with the fan if this coil is blocked by dust air flow does not do it's job Refrigerator Air conditioning Thermal power station Tesla coil Solar power Mattress Bong Phase change heat pump Thermostat Fossil fuel power plant Vacuum Haloalkane HVAC Carburetor Brewery Bass guitar Magnet Furnace Cryogenics Paul Is Dead Heat exchanger Hard disk Carbon dioxide Electric motor Fog Transformer Temperature Climate of the United Kingdom Vacuum tube Stove Relay Wire Episodes of Lost (Season 1) M16 (rifle) Cloud Stirling engine Welding Nine Inch Nails Spark plug Fluorescent lamp Fan (implement) Jet engine Autonomous building Water (molecule) Stone Cold Steve Austin Ice cream Steam engine Food preservation Ocean thermal energy conversion Charmed Hong Kong-style milk tea Soldering Movie projector Engine cooling Equine conformation Floppy disk Spacecraft propulsion Heat Gas tungsten arc welding Piccolo Junior Saga Circuit design Basement Hey Jude Cathode ray tube Helium Refrigeration Polyethylene terephthalate Coil (band) Glass Coffee Tea Naruto jutsu Dodge Neon Marilyn Monroe Heinkel He 100 Motor oil Gong Gas compressor Pebble bed reactor Knots Landing Severe weather terminology (United States) Solar variation Wind Refrigerant Computer cooling Ice core Seismometer STS-87 Blood on the Tracks Salad Fingers Railgun Superconductivity Diode Weather lore Precipitation (meteorology) Shakuhachi Gramophone record Upholstery Town gas
