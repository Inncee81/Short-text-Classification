what's wrong with this sewing machine i am taking at a sewing machine that isn't working it makes two or three stitches before locking up with a tangle of thread that ruins the material and can only be removed from the machine by taking out the bobbin shuttle it appears that loops of thread are catching on the hook causing the tangle what is wrong with it and can it be fixed at home what i've neglected to mention is that this problem occured after some heavy sewing through some heavy material i am wondering particularly if this could be that the machine's timing is off out but i don't know enough about sewing machines to know if this is the case or if it's something else or how to fix it if it is the timing having just looked a little more closely it seems that the top thread is catching on the hook but it's not releasing and sliding around the bobbin as i assume it should there could be several reasons why it isn't working the tension could be off which side of the fabric is the tangle on if the bottom clean out the bobbin area well and check the tension of the bobbin if on the top check the thread tension it is also possible that the thread you are using is not compatible with the machine sometimes that happens it could also be something else if the machine's balance is off messing with the tension and cleaning it won't necessarily help in that case you'd have to take it in to get it looked at Sewing machine Textile manufacturing Textile manufacturing terminology Sewing Knitting Glossary of climbing terms Lace-making Drill bit Weaving Cotton mill Mattress Wire Upholstery Poker jargon Suture Mach kernel Friends Crochet Blood on the Tracks Climbing equipment Lathe Bong Floppy disk Carpet Space elevator Halting problem Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Social rule Tire IBM PC compatible Embroidery Compiler optimization Kilt String theory Debugging Tatting Windows XP Movie projector Mary Poppins Rigging Screw Equine conformation Violin Thermal power station Hydraulic machinery Floyd Rose Datatype Betting (poker) Aerial (dance move) Spinlock Wound LOOM Shaggy dog story Knife Freehand lace Classified information Condom Seine (fishing) Helicopter Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Fiddler on the Roof Suplex Glossary of firefighting equipment Kitesurfing C programming language Chess strategy and tactics CPU design Machine gun M16 (rifle) Atari 8-bit family Table saw Time travel Dry cleaning Radiohead M60 machine gun Slide rule Combine harvester Bicycle brake systems G__del's incompleteness theorem GLOCK Law of value CPU cache Pitaten STS-61 Metalworking Spinning wheel Applique Glossary of nautical terms Characters in the Smurfs Vise (tool) Cross-stitch Tattoo Space Shuttle program
