our air conditioning vent makes a horrible rattling sound when the dust filter is in when we take the filter out it's quiet we've tried to figure out what's causing the problem but can't we even put a new dust filter in thinking it would help nada any help would be appreciated i had a filter in my cold air return that would do the same thing double check the size of the filter and make sure it is correct you may have to take measurements the filter probably has a metal frame as does your vent you could try getting some adhesive rubber or foam tabs and apply them to the filter frame to make it fit better also try using some weather stripping which has adhesive on one side i remember the sound and it was quite annoying good luck Loudspeaker E85 Diving suit Upholstery Mattress Motor oil Tire Sun Air filter Tank Laserdisc Brewery Violin Car handling Bass guitar Gramophone record Carburetor Luminiferous aether Table tennis Motorcycle Apollo 8 Air pollution Hydraulic machinery Plastic Thermal power station Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Airbag Anamorphic widescreen Coffee Explosive material Kalman filter Ultraviolet Printed circuit board Dialysis Bicycle brake systems Glasses Polyurethane Big band Wrench Incandescent light bulb Fire extinguisher Radio controlled airplane Fume hood Charles Goodyear Electronic filter Bicycle frame Galileo spacecraft Amateur telescope making Glossary of firefighting equipment Many-worlds interpretation Horseshoe Global climate model Capacitor plague Low-pass filter Shit Condom Technicolor Vacuum cleaner M16 (rifle) Scale model Mount Pinatubo Compact audio cassette Menstrual cup Cello Hubble Space Telescope Polarization Clementine mission Social rule Hubble Deep Field Friction MOS Technology SID Drill bit Cocaine Movie projector Debugging Welding Space Shuttle Columbia disaster Sunglasses HVAC Roswell UFO incident Bicycle helmet Computer cooling Adhesive Casting Bayesian probability Forcing (mathematics) Space disaster Mooney M20 Hard disk Particulate Cannabis cultivation NTSC Diving regulator COBE 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Space Shuttle external tank Stealth technology ZX Spectrum
