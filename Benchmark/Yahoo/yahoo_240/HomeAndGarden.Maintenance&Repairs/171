why does my metal light switch faceplate lightly vibrate when switched on this is a recent discovery by me when switching on a light that does not get used very often i took the faceplate off this morning and nothing seems obviously wrong on the inside i e wires sticking out and touching the plate it does not shock or spark when touched is this something i can fix should i call an electrican for what seems like a minor problem should i ignore it and not worry too much since it is not used daily or for long periods of time thanks we could go into some trouble shooting but fir the price of a switch change it and if the vibration goes away hooray' if not little loss and we move to the next step at which time a little more info would be nice Switch Violin Light switch Guitar Welding Lathe Glossary of climbing terms Firearm Knife Tank Transformer Piano Fluorescent lamp GunZ The Duel Overhead lines Game Boy Micro Relay Telephone exchange Electric guitar Digital photography Harmonic series (music) Diode Professional wrestling throws Fan (implement) Jumpstart 3rd Grade Lathe (metal) Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Baseball Double bass Mitsubishi 3000GT Badminton Wire wrap Professional wrestling slang Transistor Cathode ray tube IPod Piezoelectricity Digital Faster-than-light Charles Wheatstone Futurama (TV series - season 5) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Telephone numbering plan Enron Corporation Xbox 360 Rotary dial Gemini 9A Daylight saving time Softball Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Volleyball Aluminium Digital circuit Static Shock Debugging Action potential Ice hockey Tesla coil Tire Glossary of American football Game controller Stage lighting Vacuum tube Central processing unit Nonblocking minimal spanning switch Aarti Hand grenade Laser engraving Gas metal arc welding Harp Good Vibrations: Thirty Years of The Beach Boys Solar power Mouse (computing) WQHT (FM) Nuclear weapon design Nintendo DS Electroshock gun PlayStation 2 Loudspeaker Virtual memory X-ray Monty Hall problem Circuit design The Time Machine Sumo Reservoir Dogs Gaussian elimination Burglar alarm Timpani Potentiometer Harmonica Land mine Hydrogen economy 2003 North America blackout Mercury Cougar Rail tracks Floppy disk
