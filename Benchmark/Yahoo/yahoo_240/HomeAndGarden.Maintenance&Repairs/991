do you do regular maintenance on your toilet econo rooter came to my house today to clear a blockage of charmin tissue i've got two small kids who are scheduled for retraining on single use quantities how many squares do you need my question is if you use charmin and have kids or have another member of the household who leaves a large paper trail do you do regular maintenance to avoid those bills i know there are chemicals at the store and i've read remedies like flushing a bowl of boiling water once a week but i'd really appreciate personal experience here i was having problems with the toilet clogging up and finally a new plumber told me that charmin is the worst brand to use it doesn't disintegrate he said to switch to scott brand he also said to never flush kleenex or papertowels down there he did a demonstration where he grabbed a wad of charmin tp and washed it in a bowl of water it just congealed into one glob he did the same with the scott tissue and it all disintegrated into very tiny pieces i couldn't believe it needless to say i haven't had any problems since i switched brands Toilet paper Flush toilet Japanese toilet Menstrual cup Toilet Kimberly-Clark Corporation Brand Urinary incontinence Paper Hard water Weed control Urinal Acne Japanese tea ceremony Thermal power station Hydroponics Procter & Gamble Sulfuric acid Washroom Electrophysiology Hamster Qur'an desecration controversy of 2005 Cincinnati Bengals Water Home repair Bong Coffee Carburetor Toilet humour Space Shuttle Columbia disaster CPU cache Fecal incontinence New England Patriots Jennings Randolph Lake Sento Ice cream Homer Simpson Bowl Championship Series Filling station Drain cleaner Siphon Sears Holdings Corporation Sewage treatment Wood Digital circuit Dioxin Hydrogen economy Autonomous building Hey Jude Tea Genericized trademark New York City Subway nomenclature Domestic water system Fire fighting Pebble bed reactor Dishwasher Surveillance Drill bit Tampon The End of the World (Doctor Who) 2003 North America blackout Kylie Minogue Ant Kitchen National Football League Stomach cancer Mercury Atlas 6 Mouse (computing) Bidet New York Giants Firearm Pan Am Flight 103 IRT Flushing Line Vitamin C Compiler optimization Euphemism Textile manufacturing Miami Dolphins Whose Line Is It Anyway?
