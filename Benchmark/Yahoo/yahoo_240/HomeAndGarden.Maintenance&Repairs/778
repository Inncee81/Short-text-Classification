wd as a stainless steel kitchen appliance cleaner a repairman recommended using wd on kitchen applicances made with stainless steel anyone ever heard of this he swears by it but i can't get myself to try it fearing permanent damage if you had ever used a commercial stainless steel polisher you would notice that it smells and feels just like wd however this is not a cleaner it is a polisher if you are looking to get rid of water spots it works wonders if you need to actually clean it of gunk it doesn't work so well use a green scrub pad first wipe with a damp cloth wipe with a dry cloth then apply the wd to the dry stainless as for the wd hurting the stainless this is a type of steel if water won't hurt it the wd certainly won't your biggest concern should be scratching it stay away from abrasive cleaners and steel wool and you will be fine Knife Stainless steel Drill bit Wok Dishwasher Cookware and bakeware Brewery Dry cleaning Corrosion Kitchen Mattress Upholstery Manicure Textile manufacturing Vacuum cleaner Washing machine Screw Welding Car washing techniques Billiards Jam (TV series) Gilding Cast iron Menstrual cup Woodworking Violin Beretta 92F/FS Brazing Passenger car Wound Professional wrestling match types Tattoo Glass Printmaking Pok__mon types Casting Clothing Japanese toilet Home repair Wool Vinegar Diamond Refrigerator Seismic retrofit Hydrochloric acid Hat World War Three (Doctor Who) Disc brake Domestic water system Carpet Hydrogen peroxide Steel De Lorean DMC-12 Fecal incontinence Lionel Corporation Cerium Sento Fire extinguisher Shoe polish Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Japanese kitchen knives Nitrocellulose Electrical wiring Berkshire Hathaway Soldering Justification (theology) Ironing Gas metal arc welding Boat building Shoe Nuclear power Nickel Vacuum BS 1363 Great Lakes E85 Harry Brearley Harry Harrison Galvanization Gas tungsten arc welding Linen Salad Fingers Thermal power station R46 (New York City Subway car) Lumber Arc welding Sodium hypochlorite Veganism Amateur telescope making Lighting Electrostatic precipitator Electric motor Tofu Diatomaceous earth Dinghy Accuracy International AWM Paint Dairy Pok__mon Abilities Hemp
