electric motor smokes won't spin i am trying to fix the electric motor on a paper shredder i have all the pieces and when the motor is together it seems to turn fine but when i plug it in it smokes from the end with the brushes you can hear the click of the juice hitting it when you plug it in but then a few seconds later the thin smoke starts the brushes seem to be in pretty good shape but there's no spring behind them so it could be that they aren't making contact it seems like they should have springs to push them but instead it looks like the tension of he wire that pushes them toward the middle shouldn't they have springs of some sort if the brushes are supposed to touch the inside metal ring commutator and don't would that cause the smoke somehow everything else on this thing seems to be in good shape thanks springs would be nice it isn't likely someone tried a repair and missed both all the springs the smoke has to be from the coil shorting out it is overheating because all the current isn't passing to the correct parts usually one is toast when ti gets hot enough to smoke Electric motor Spark plug Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Theory of conduct Seismometer Enigma machine Drag racing Welding Transformer Bong Guitar Thermal power station Wire Earring Electrical generator Overhead lines Soldering Fan (implement) Poker jargon Tire Carburetor Solar power Residual-current device Spacecraft propulsion Pottery Equine conformation Airsoft Reading spark plugs for racing Commutator (electric) Incandescent light bulb Ignition system BS 1363 Switch Gas metal arc welding Mouse (computing) Hiberno-English Fire fighting RuneScape quests Snooker Brushless DC electric motor Textile manufacturing Shell (projectile) Social rule Circuit design Alternating current Milton H.
