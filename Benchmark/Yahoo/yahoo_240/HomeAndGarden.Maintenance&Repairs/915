dryer vent heating dog house i was wondering if it would be safe possible to heat my dog house with the dryer vent he is a husky and does not need constant heat nor does it want it so the dryer heat would be sufficent we do one three loads a day i was wondering if this is unsafe or if anyone had any suggestions on how to do this safely i am thinking it's a great way to recycle the lost heat we pay for does anyone have any suggestions or comments thank you sorry didn't mention but it's an electric dryer i wouldn't even think of it if it was gas i am most concerned about the moisture and lint are there any vent covers that allow heat exhaust but contain moisture lint i would not vent the dryer into the dog house the humidity and lint particles would be bad for the dogs health as would the rapid changes in temperature humidity dampening his fur and letting him cool off is no favor in cold weather venting the dryer through the house through a metal pipe maybe one massive enough to hold some heat and act like a radiator would be a better idea it wouldn't be very efficient but it's waste heat recovery so it still helps p s love huskys siberian or alaskan Air conditioning Autonomous building Nuclear power HVAC Renewable energy Solar power Nuclear reactor Heat Explosive material Furnace Sun Hyperthermia Diving suit Humidity Microwave oven Temperature Relative humidity Incineration Casting Pebble bed reactor Water vapor Carburetor Siberian Husky Iditarod Climate change Energy development Plastic Diesel engine Welding Water Fossil fuel power plant Desert Dog Steam engine Hydrogen economy Sewage treatment Internal combustion engine Stove Electrical wiring Wind power Dairy Ocean thermal energy conversion Ozone depletion Tire Jet engine Power station Tank Severe weather terminology (United States) Transformer Fire extinguisher Stirling engine Fog Gasification Alcohol fuel Engine cooling Ammonia M16 (rifle) Future energy development Haloalkane Diode Nuclear fuel cycle Vacuum Swamp cooler Solar variation Flood geology Battery (electricity) Comet Sulfur Instant coffee Thermoregulation Global warming Gas turbine Rebreather Hiking Wind Disaster Space manufacturing Three Mile Island Alaskan husky Gas metal arc welding Supercharger Waste management Curitiba Compost Aluminium Cogeneration Spark plug Tobacco smoking Plutonium Environmental concerns with electricity generation Combined cycle Radon
