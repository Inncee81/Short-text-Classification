cooling a heat pump will spraying water on the heat pump coils help it to keep the house cooler on these hot east tn days yes you can do this to make your system more efficient however if it is not cooling well it probably needs service this should only be done to increase efficiency running water over the condenser is not the best way to use water to cool a condenser though the hardness minerals in your water will eventually start to build up on the fins and actually make the system less efficient if you are serious about making your system more efficient you can buy a water cooled heat pump for about in materials Solar power Furnace Thermal power station Heat exchanger Brewery Swamp cooler Autonomous building HVAC Thermostat Fossil fuel power plant Ocean thermal energy conversion Steam engine Temperature Heat Tesla coil Refrigerator Deep lake water cooling Renewable energy Phase change heat pump Fire fighting Watercooling Timeline of steam power Eldfell Transformer Internal combustion engine Motor oil Trans-Alaska Pipeline System Turbojet Newcomen steam engine Radiator Evaporative cooling Hyperthermia Carburetor Gas absorption refrigerator Fog Hydropower Space shuttle main engine Diesel engine Peltier-Seebeck effect Heinkel He 100 Dairy Solar collector Engine cooling Hydrogen economy Heat pump Pebble bed reactor Three Mile Island Dundas Square Fluorescent lamp Gas compressor Overclocking Jet engine Steam Phase (matter) Spark plug Power station Glass Basement Phase transition Passive solar SABRE Water purification Rankine cycle Solar panel Spacecraft propulsion Natural gas Geyser Pressurized water reactor Vacuum Urban heat island Water vapor Turbocharger Energy development Diving suit Soldering Incandescent light bulb Wire Convection Coffee Heat engine Infrared homing Pump Heat sink Powder metallurgy Fractional distillation Central heating Solar cell Welding Climate of the United Kingdom Nuclear thermal rocket Universal Century Technology Watt steam engine Nuclear reactor Fuel cell Glossary of firefighting terms Two-stroke cycle Concrete
