edward humphrey wants to know can i use steel roofing on an older house edward humphrey wants to know can i use steel roofing on an older house steel roofing is a very logical option when considering replacing a residential roof keep in mind that in addition to the cost of the actual metal roofing panel most likely in order to qualify for the warranties associated with these products you must also use their accessories and adhere strictly to their installation instructions if you have a very cut up house lots of dormers and valleys etc the costs to waterproof these areas before installing can get to be costly but as far as a straight forward reroof over existing substrate costs are very competitive as much as i see a lot recommend going over existing shingles i prefer to strip the existing shingles and check the sheathing before waterproofing and roof installation Roof Light-frame construction Vinyl roof Geodesic dome Electrical wiring Hubert H.
