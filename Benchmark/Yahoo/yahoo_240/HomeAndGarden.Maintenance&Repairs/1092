i have an ariens lawn tractor it is of the emperor models it is pull start but wont start what do i do i changed the spark plug changed the oil cleaned the carb bowl what do i do next please help i have a lawn mowing job i'm and mow a few lawns and just got this tractor but it wont run keep in mind i only have about remove the spark plug reattach the plug wire to it then lay it down on the head or somewhere where the metal part touches the head or elsewhere on the engine and pull the starter cord you should see a spark at the tip of the plug if you don't then the ignition system may need repair if there's spark then try dumping a small amount of gasoline teaspoon into the carburetor throat and then pull the starter cord a few times if it fires up for a second and then dies there's no gasoline getting into the combustion chamber from the carb beyond that all that an engine needs to run is air and compression which i presume it has tho' you didn't say if you've ever seen the engine run and if not all bets are off if you don't have a compression tester a quick and very crude test for compression is to pull the starter cord slowly the engine should have enough compression to pretty much stop the rotation if not then there may be a stuck valve or some other problem head gasket cracked piston etc last if the gasoline in the tank is extremely old old gasoline is notorious for causing hard starting it sours by way of an oxidation process and loss of some volatile components try some fresh gasoline Internal combustion engine Spark plug Two-stroke cycle E85 Motor oil Gasoline Four-stroke cycle Lawn mower Jet engine Reading spark plugs for racing Automobile Bong Toyota Prius Steam engine Compression ratio Thermal power station Turbocharger Automobile emissions control Chevrolet Corvair engine Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Gas turbine Internal ballistics Ford FE engine Alcohol fuel Diesel cycle Ford Windsor engine Ignition system Manifold vacuum Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Space shuttle main engine Engine tuning Radio controlled airplane Gnome Monosoupape Hydrogen economy Turbojet Carbon dioxide Aircraft engine Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Hydrogen vehicle Battery electric vehicle Reciprocating engine Biodiesel Tractor Convair B-36 Model aircraft Dodge Charger Gasoline direct injection Wankel engine Energy development M16 (rifle) Glossary of firefighting terms AMC V8 engine Fordson tractor Torpedo 24 Hours of Le Mans Cylinder head Top Fuel Town gas Alkane Sleeve valve Welding Automobile ancillary power Hybrid vehicle Toyota S engine Hybrid Synergy Drive Oldsmobile V8 engine Tobacco Glow plug Engine Petroleum Stratified charge engine Drill bit Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Air gun Dodge Neon Timeline of invention Fire fighting Tire Furnace Oxyacetylene Gas compressor Pulse jet engine Knife Tesla coil
