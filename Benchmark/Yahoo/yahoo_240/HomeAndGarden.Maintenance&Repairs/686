what do you do for a skunk stench what do you do to get rid of skunk smell in a wooden shed i need to know so i can go to home depot and get some stuff go to a pet supply place like petsmart or petco and buy some stuff called nature's miracle this stuff has enzymes in it that breaks down organic material like urine and gets rid of the skunk spray odor too they have one labeled specifically for removing skunk odors i'm not kidding this stuff really gets rid of the animal odors if you apply it thoroughly and give it time to dry spray it kind of heavy on the walls and floor and any other surface you can in the shed to really wet the surfaces don't skimp because the spray probably soaked into the wood and you have to make sure this stuff gets down into it too so really soak the surfaces well with the nature's miracle also you should spray it extra heavy into the corners and along the bottom of any walls in case any urine ran under the wall as the surfaces dry you may notice that the smell gets stronger but that will go away when it dries it may take several days to dry and some sort of ventilation will help after it is dry if there is still some odor then the nature's miracle didn't get down completely into where the urine or skunk spray was you should apply it again and really soak the surface well one thing about the zinser or kilz sealers is that they are white zinser is great for sealing in odors but if you don't want to pain the inside of your shed then you should not use zinser or similar sealer primers so go get some nature's miracle and in a few days the skunk odor will be history Skunk Hamster Pet skunk Menstrual cup Fire fighting Wood Diseases of the honeybee Cat Textile manufacturing Dairy Mattress Seismic retrofit Pottery Urinary incontinence Vermicompost Upholstery Spotted Skunk Baylisascaris Tofu Paint Thermal power station Bradley Nowell Coconut crab Sulfur Diving suit Handloading Geodesic dome Drug test Cell (biology) Tanning Rabies Cannabis cultivation Shoe Brush Knife Manicure Virus Glossary of firefighting terms Hydrogen sulfide Wood pulp Boat building Composting toilet Electrical wiring Tire Perfume Tlingit Thiol Toilet paper Domestic rabbit 1957 World Series Smegma Bullet Odor Micro-encapsulation Coffee Manure Polyethylene terephthalate Air conditioning Miracle Brewery Ammunition Plastic Irrigation Dundas Square Fire extinguisher Asbestos The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Ammonia Internal ballistics Carbon dioxide Door Sake Bassoon Thermal depolymerization Carnivorous plant Toilet humour Compost Cyanide Urine Blood (computer game) Psoriasis Opportunity rover Tobacco Masonry Cheese Rich Mullins Drill bit Architecture of the California missions Glossary of firefighting equipment Olfaction Terrazzo Time Out of Mind Dry cleaning Laws of cricket
