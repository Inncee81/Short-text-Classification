has anyone used bath fitters to cover an old tile shower did you feel it was worth the investment i called for an estimate and they stressed i had to be the person home since they want to offer me incentatives this makes me wonder if it is a legitimate service why incentives need to be offered anyone know what these incentives will be i really don't want to deal with a pushy salesperson there are main companies doing this type of remodel luxury bath re bath bath fitter luxury bath is the highest quality by a long shot it also has a product called microban microban is a antimicrobial product that actually kills mold and mildew it also comes with the best warranty www luxurybath com re bath would be my second choice the reason being is they like luxury bath have a one piece dog leg the area on the wall in front off the tub the dog leg goes from the top of the tub rail to the floor the reason i would not recommend bath fitter is because of the dog leg this is the area that is most prone to leaking and they piece it together here as far as other options there is tearing it out and starting over ceramic tile re glazing with tearing it out you will be forced to use a fiberglass tub which is very porous making it very difficult to clean for those that are reading this thinking how nice your fiberglass tub is go in there and rub your fingers over it it may look o k but it will be greasy that s because the porous material is literally sucking the soap scum in fiberglass surrounds are also known for cracking and being spongy when you stand in them ceramic tile is definitely attractive but unfortunately the grout is the weak point after all its sand and sand sucks in the water making it a perfect surface for mold and mildew grout also needs maintenance once a month but before you do the maintenance you need to clean it with a toothbrush re glazing is when they paint the tub this is more of a band aid if your trying to sell the home but don t care how it will look in months to year it also doesn't address the walls or fixtures Casting Pottery Tile Sento Strap-on dildo Drill bit Violin Plastic Mattress Glass Customs and etiquette of Japan Fiberglass Textile manufacturing Ceramics Seismic retrofit Upholstery Equine conformation Bong Menstrual cup Asbestos Privatization Fecal incontinence Diving Hamster Japanese toilet Roof Cookware and bakeware Masonry Gay bathhouse Dishwasher King Khalid International Airport Soap Dymaxion house Ra (board game) Spark plug Microeconomics Swimming Wallpaper group Combine (Half-Life 2) Social rule Toilet Fuselage Volleyball Bath Loudspeaker Tooth enamel Washroom Solar power Basement Lionel Corporation Boat building Breastfeeding Bathroom Glaze Ford Thunderbird Psoriasis Tank Hydrotherapy Happy Tree Friends Top-bar hive Wood Wind turbine Sales Pebble bed reactor Poker jargon Naruto jutsu Xanadu House Brush Jackass: The Movie Plame affair Carburetor Tooth Glossary of climbing terms Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Tire Have I Got News For You Korean tea ceremony Professional wrestling holds Terminal ballistics Richard Chase Mosaic Donald Trump Radio controlled airplane Manicure Japanese tea ceremony Cast iron Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve St Albans Cathedral Product Lifecycle Management
