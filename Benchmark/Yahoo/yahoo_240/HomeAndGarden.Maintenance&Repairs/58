i just purchased a home and found out that when i test recepticals with tester it shows open ground recently looks as if new circuit breaker panel was installed i can see both hot wires ground and neutral all hooked to panel but no ground wire to outlets so i am assuming the conduit acts as a ground instead the problem is i cant see where ground wire is going to in wall to see where it ends up and the wire on water meter also is there a way to check to see if my ground is good comming into panel or any ideas how i go about getting a proper ground this house was built in and has prong outlets already i recently was called to unstop a sewer in a house that was built in the ' 's i had plugged the sewer machine in and was fixing to insert the cable into the cast iron pipe when the cable touched the pipe it started arcing and fire and smoke was everywhere i pulled the cable out and it hit the aluminum siding and started arcing again i finally managed to free the cable and unplug the machine upon testing every outlet in the house except the kitchen had an open ground luckily i wear rubber gloves and electrically insulated shoes some people haven't been as lucky plumbers have died because of this situation the homeowner is now getting an electrician to rewire his house good luck BS 1363 Electrical wiring National Electrical Code (US) Residual-current device Solar power Electrician Three-phase electric power Kitchen Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Fuse (electrical) Spark plug Seismic retrofit Gas metal arc welding Ground and neutral Welding Circuit breaker Domestic water system Seismometer Ring circuit Thermal power station Lightning rod Enigma machine Third rail Printed circuit board Overhead lines Lineman (occupation) Transformer Electrical wiring (UK) Loudspeaker Japanese toilet Rapid transit Apollo Command/Service Module Drill bit Vacuum tube Glossary of firefighting equipment Renewable energy Earthing system Wire IPod Elevator Power cable Overhead powerline High-voltage hazards Relay Geodesic dome Fire alarm control panel Split phase Burglar alarm Super Mario Bros. 3 Mario Lighting Combine (Half-Life 2) Single-phase electric power Switch Tesla coil Submarine communications cable Fan (implement) Lightning Coaxial cable Arc welding Oplan Bojinka Basement D-subminiature Irrigation Carburetor Antenna (radio) Wardenclyffe Tower Oscilloscope M16 (rifle) Sewer Electrical breakdown Solar cell Glossary of climbing terms Jack plug Fire fighting Alternating current Gliding Bombe Charles Wheatstone Brazing Power line communication Telephone exchange Tire Electric power transmission Furnace Category 5 cable Plastic
