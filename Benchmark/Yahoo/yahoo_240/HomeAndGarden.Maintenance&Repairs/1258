any suggestions on how to fix my clothes dryer does anyone know how to fix a dryer i bought a used washer and dryer when we moved this past spring but the dryer hasn't workked properly since we got it it takes hrs to dry one load of clothes i'm not overloading it or anything i clean out the lint catch each time and i checked the tube to make sure there wasn't a block there but i can't figure it out i'm getting sooo frustrated we move in a few months and can't take a washer and dryer to europe so a new one isn't an option if any one has any suggestions please shoot them my way thanks i can't hang clothes outside because we get a lot of dust storms in my area and the clothes would either blow away or be full of dust my washer and dryer are seperate and they are regular size not apartment size the dryer is a whirlpool extra large capacity and has the lint vent on top this is the best dryer there is and its sooo easy to work on with a few tips open the door to your dryer and hold the door switch with your finger and start it on timed dry see if the heating element comes on after a few seconds you will see red in the back grate and even feel some heat after a minute if so pull the duct off the back and turn it on and see if the air is coming out strong and hot and if not the dryer is stopped up with lint probably in the blower duct you have to remove the panel from the back to get at it if the air is coming out ok then you have a stoppage in the ducting outside the dryer oh yes if the drum is not turning then your belt is probably broken and needs replacing Upholstery Thermal power station Washing machine Bong Dishwasher M60 machine gun Dry cleaning Fan (implement) M16 (rifle) Textile manufacturing Winning Streak Furnace Carburetor Volleyball Brewery Seismic retrofit Oscilloscope Sento Fume hood Poker jargon Mattress Sonic the Hedgehog 2 BMW M5 Floppy disk Conker's Bad Fur Day Fossil fuel power plant Spark plug Menstrual cup Electrical wiring Glossary of firefighting equipment Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Piccolo Junior Saga Wind Passenger car The Amazing Race 1957 World Series Carbon dioxide Elevator Skateboarding trick Combine (Half-Life 2) Dialysis The Dalek Invasion of Earth Solar power Fire fighting Indianapolis 500 Tofu Airbag Movie projector Cruising (maritime) Fecal incontinence Aerial (dance move) Kitchen The Doors Two-stroke cycle Novelty (locomotive) Japanese toilet Pebble bed reactor Jet engine Tire The Midnight Sun Heinkel He 112 Table saw Relay Climbing equipment Diving suit Shaggy dog story Eye GunZ The Duel Haloalkane Scuba set Drill bit Dodge Charger Characters in the Smurfs Paintball Ford Ranger EV Super Mario Bros.
