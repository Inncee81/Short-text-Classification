central a c condensation question is there such thing as too much condensation for the a c unit the condensate drain from the unit in the basement started leaking and i have been collecting the condensate in a bucket i feel like there is too much i get like gallons or more a day this seems alot to me i wonder if this is a sign of a problem with the unit i thought the evaporation of the condensation across the coil was what created the cooling and worry if the condensation is an issue i live in nj and it has been humid but we always seen to get alot of condensation any suggestions pour some bleach into the condensate drain in the evaporator it will clear and clean out the line the cooling is done by the evaporation of the refrigerant inside of the evaporator when the refrigerant changes states from a liquid to a gas it absorbs heat the compressor pressurizes the gas and it is returned to a liquid state in the condenser where it dissipates the heat it has absorbed basic temperature and pressure correlations i m not sure if many of the people answering your question know the basics of the refrigeration system Phase change heat pump Gas absorption refrigerator Refrigerator Brewery Ocean thermal energy conversion Heat exchanger Thermal power station Water vapor Evaporation Phase (matter) Gas compressor Humidity Distillation HVAC Phase transition Relative humidity Superconductivity Fossil fuel power plant Solar power Carbon dioxide Swamp cooler Fog Refrigeration Ammonia Hyperthermia Apollo 13 Dairy Vacuum Heat Evaporative cooling Fire fighting Helium Basement Ice Thermostat Bong Explosive material Carburetor Haloalkane Pebble bed reactor Stirling engine Refrigerant Natural gas Fermionic condensate Fire extinguisher Sun Water (molecule) Casting Nitrogen Origin of life Hydrogen economy Hydrogen Town gas Condensed matter physics Coffee Water Motor oil Xenon Dehumidifier Vacuum tube STS-87 Alcohol fuel Big Bang Furnace Space shuttle main engine Turbocharger Weather lore Hydropower Hydrogen peroxide Geothermal exchange heat pump Thunderstorm Glass Rankine cycle Ozone depletion Neon Bose-Einstein condensate Boiling point Lake Mercury arc valve Fractional distillation Milk Spark plug Liquified petroleum gas Heinkel He 100 Dry cleaning Gas turbine Mercury (element) Climate of the United Kingdom Houseplant Greenhouse effect Turbojet Internal combustion engine Renewable energy
