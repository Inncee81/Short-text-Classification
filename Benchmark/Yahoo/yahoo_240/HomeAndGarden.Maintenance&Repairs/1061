a question about my central air unit and freon ive been having a problem with my c a unit ive changed the filter cleaned the coils and everything to the point that the only thing that it might be needing is freon to put in so we called a heating and air speicalists and he said he would charge us no higher then to put freon in it thats labor and all he says it depends on how low it is it could cost us lower then that he said freon is a pound my qeustion is is that a good deal we are new to this and i just want to be careful about who i get to do this also when the c a tech goes to check out everything to make sure that the central air is working correctly what all rooms do they check do they stay mostly in the basement and around the outside unit the reason why i'm asking because i have small children and our house is a large story so i dont want the c a tech to come into a room and fall over a toy or anything lol hello karma if this price includes the service call it is a bargain if it is just for the refrigerant and installation it is still a good price but be sure to ask what the trip cost is pound for r is a fair market price this includes the training tools and regulations the hvac tech has to have in order to install the stuff the tech will need to have access to your indoor unit the thermostat the return grille grill that collects the air returning to your indoor unit and a supply grill air coming out of the indoor unit if you can have the children stay out of the way it will be appreciated the little ones are curious but he will be moving quickly and be focused on getting the job done quickly and correctly the first time if you can have the kids visit a sitter that would be best otherwise ask them to stay out of the way keep kool HVAC Air conditioning Thermostat Inflation Haloalkane Refrigerator Thermal power station Cray-1 Microeconomics Autonomous building Scientology beliefs and practices Heat Economics Deflation (economics) Welding Ives Manufacturing Company Solar power Transformer Mutual fund Labor theory of value Airline Illegal drug trade Swimming pool E85 Carburetor Burglar alarm Economic calculation problem Arbitrage Kitchen Modem Loudspeaker Economy of the United States Labour economics Hard disk Hydrogen economy Euro Externality CPU design Monetary policy Free trade Minimum wage Tariff Phase change heat pump Dialysis Ford Motor Company Light-emitting diode Supply-side economics Commodore 64 Incandescent light bulb Turbocharger Keynesian economics Health insurance Efficiency wages Mainframe computer Equine conformation Technology Volleyball Daylight saving time Domestic rabbit Capitalism Floppy disk Natural monopoly Biodiesel Wind turbine Mach kernel Motor oil Coin collecting Mac OS X Sailing Gold standard Nuclear power Economic rent Value added tax Offshoring Terran (StarCraft) Solar cell Internal ballistics Handloading Glossary of firefighting terms CPU cache Laserdisc Web crawler Hamster In-N-Out Burger Airsoft Japanese toilet Air pollution Basement Paragliding Furnace Law of value Electrical wiring Economy of India Bank
