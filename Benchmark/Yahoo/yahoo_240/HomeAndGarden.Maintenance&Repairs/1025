help how can i get dried paint cleaned off of a vinyl floor my son knocked over a half gallon of paint and did not tell me until the next day what can i use to clean it up with thanks if it's latex you can probably peel most of it off and then use a plastic bristle brush with warm water to scrub up the rest i wouldn't try any type of paint thinner as that may remove the top layer of your floor and cause it to have a dull spot Brush Casting Paint Manicure Mattress Diving suit Coir Dry cleaning Plastic Gramophone record Tattoo Knife Brewery Car washing techniques Menstrual cup Dishwashing Hand washing Japanese tea ceremony Car wash Textile manufacturing Label Tooth Dialysis Fire extinguisher Wine making Gilding Curling Hamster Glossary of climbing terms Bong Vacuum cleaner Glacier Primer (paint) Christmas tree Acne Vitreous enamel Strap-on dildo Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Tofu Japanese toilet Impressionism Milk Soldering Tempera Glaze Vermicompost Basement Fire fighting Glossary of wildland fire terms Wok Typewriter Lionel Corporation Wallpaper Piet Mondrian Washing machine Spirit rover timeline for 2004 February Cast iron Dairy Skin Concrete Sento Poker jargon Diaper De Lorean DMC-12 Fancy rat Enceladus (moon) Chatsworth House Manganese Fan (implement) Carbon dioxide Epoxy The Legend of Zelda series enemies Geography of Bolivia Watercolor painting John McDouall Stuart Hard disk Cannabis cultivation Jan van Goyen Woodworking Seismic retrofit Eraser Paper marbling Tile SS Morro Castle Sterilization (microbiology) Printmaking Compact audio cassette Chewing gum Metal leaf Wood Valles Marineris Slide rule Sex toy Brazing Lead Laser printer Death Valley National Park Comanche Dodge Neon
