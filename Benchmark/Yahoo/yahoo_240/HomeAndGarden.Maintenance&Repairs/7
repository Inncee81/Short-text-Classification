rain gutter pictures any problems you see just wanted you to see these gutter pics i took to get an idea how things go first picture http hidebehind com ce ae second picture http hidebehind com e questions what is that metal thing at arrow is that a drip edge and if so then when you follow the drip edge does it look properly installed or does it seem to not be outhanging enough over the gutter what is that thing at arrow it seems to be some kind of make shift drip edge but if that is the case then back to arrow what is that if it isn't a drip edge notice at arrow the gutter seems to buckle is that acceptable or does that mean it is installed incorrectly and what are the consequences of that buckling you see there what problems that weren't discussed if any above do you see in these picture if any in picture the metal thingy that overhangs into gutter can that cause problems what kind of problems arrow is drip edge all right it's install poorly but it's there the shingles should hang over the dripedge to inch though arrow looks like something that was stuck in there to help the water make it to the gutter to stop a leak that was dripping behind the gutter arrow shows that the installer bent the gutter upwards as he she was installing it and that caused a stresspoint and made the back of the gutter buckle out this will let rain get behind the gutter and drip down it will also let water get on the facia and cause it to rot if the shingles were installed properly that wouldn't be a problem now on to the shingles they have served their time and need to be replaced they do have a time period in which they will do their job up here that's to years depending on the quality of the shingle you can see all the clay in the gutters that's coming from the shingles that are coming apart i don't know if it's just the picture but it appears there's a huge bow in the gutter section in picture that means that either the wall or the facia is in bad shape and is bulged out that's not a good thing i hope it's just the picture making it look like that i's say you need new shingles and fix up the roof deck as required make sure the new ones hang over the drip edge at least inch as this also help with the water drainage when water gets to the edge of anything it tries to climb back up the wat it looks now it can climb right up back onto the roof deck i m betting there will be some rot there or at the least some swelling that will need fixing replacing when the shigles hang out farther the water climbs back and when it hits the dripedge it then runs down not going back under the shigles and onto the roofdeck the metal strip that hanging over the gutter i'm thinking is there to get the watter into the gutter instad of running down the facia and dripping onto your head if you take it out i would almost bet you'd have a leak it won't hurt anything having it in there i would say it's helping right now Irrigation Roof Drill bit Glossary of climbing terms Poker jargon Intravenous therapy Knife 2000 Australian Grand Prix Violin Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Seismic retrofit Home repair Rigging Tire Archery Blackjack Cricket Theory of conduct Equine conformation Baldrick 1957 World Series Floppy disk Double bass Planetary orbit Spark plug Solar power Debugging Tile Craps Determinism Geodesic dome Nine Inch Nails Skateboarding trick Microeconomics Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 The nature of God in Western theology Heinkel He 112 Boat building Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Katana Epistemology Climbing equipment Furnace Pump It Up Weapon Laserdisc Paragliding Escape from New York English longbow Mattress Backstroke Supply and demand Teen Girl Squad Entropy 24 Hours of Le Mans Vinyl roof Paradox Hard disk Scientology beliefs and practices Causality Gambling Plame affair Action potential Bong Terminal ballistics Ontological argument Volleyball Extreme Programming Zeno's paradoxes Shaggy dog story Floyd Rose Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Non-native pronunciations of English Draw poker Carnivorous plant Traffic light Hamster Tank Gramophone record Messerschmitt Bf 109 Casting Textile manufacturing Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Atari 8-bit family Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Billboard (advertising) P-47 Thunderbolt Blood Simple Characters of Lost Nuclear power Diving USS Tunny (SS-282)
