year old house is it okay to buy is it okay to buy a house that is almost years old what are some things to look out for we don't mind doing cosmetic things but don't want to do anything structural or major is it a given that the basement will get seepage any advice would be greatly appreciated thanks any structure that you may purchase may have problems the way to tell is to determine whether or not there is wood rot in the main parameters of the structure a pest inspection will reveal alot of termite wood rot or fungae problems the real test is that you won't know until you actually pull a wall apart the older homes utilize a treatment called lathe and plaster these are small little boards that are about wide and run the span of the vertical members x or whatever they were running a years ago one good way to tell about the structure is look at the roof from feet look for sagging members look at the ridge boards and see if they sag look at the edge facia boards are they peeling take a nail d coated at poke at the different members all over the house if the wood is soft it is either dry rotted or diseased this is a start get a latter try looking under the soffit area directly above the wall backside of the roof and see if there is softness in these areas this strategy will give you a pretty good idea what it is your buying if you are buying from a private party and a bank or lending institution is not involved an appraisal or pest inspection will not be requried in most states be careful structual repairs are outrageous i provide services like that in my area and i have heard of some good ones don't believe anything anybody tells you about the structure if the seller is going to put a clause in the sales contract to reimburse you should there be problems then go for it in the meantime be very prudent feel free to contact me you might check the electrical box and see if there are the old type screw in fuses in most states the box needs to be updated prior to sale in some states if you buy it then try to sell the home you will be responsible to ensure that the home is up to the latest code for the area prior to sale turn on the water at various points inside the house and see whether the pipes bang that will tell you that they did not replace a simple thing like rubber washers in the faucets prior to sale in this instance you will have a better idea of what your seller is like be careful ask about when the pipes were replaced and what type pipe was utilized you can tell by looking in various points where the water has a valve called an angle stop take a utility knife and scrap the paint behind the valve to reveal the metal on the pipe if it's a brass color it will be replaced with copper tube and sweat soldered or metal color would denote galvanized make sure that there isn't pvc it's white like sprinkler lines this is bad good luck jim Seismic retrofit Mattress Tire Electrical wiring Irrigation Thermal power station Straw-bale construction Bong Wood carving Poker jargon Wood Glossary of firefighting equipment Carburetor Basement Home repair Soldering Microeconomics Pottery Knife Hydraulic machinery Volleyball Hamster Fire extinguisher Upholstery Light-frame construction Printed circuit board Money Solar power Rail terminology Airsoft Glossary of firefighting terms Elevator Spark plug Radio controlled airplane IPod Diving cylinder Diamond Conker's Bad Fur Day Vacuum tube Violin Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Textile manufacturing Lathe Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Japanese toilet Overhead lines Insurance Monetary policy Kitchen Sento Strap-on dildo Craps Skateboarding trick Objective-C Christmas tree Guitar Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Lighting Short selling Stairway Wallpaper group William Murdoch Firefighter Furnace Woodworking Portsmouth Block Mills Solder Air-raid shelter Eifel Aqueduct Bus models used in New York City Transit Domestic rabbit Baseball Real estate broker Cheating in Counter-Strike Gramophone record Diving regulator Equine conformation Carbon dioxide Dodge Charger Roof Internal ballistics Welding Fuse (electrical) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Corrosion Aluminium Bulk vending Liquid crystal display Scientology beliefs and practices Milton H.
