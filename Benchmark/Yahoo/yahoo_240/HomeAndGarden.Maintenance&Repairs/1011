hard wood garden furniture treatment i recently bought a beech coloured hard wood set of patio furniture it was expensive but i bought it as i liked the colour of the wood my husband when i was out treated it with 'teak oil' and it has completely changed the colour and i now hate it so as you can imagine we exchanged a few words my husband said it is the correct treatment for the wood and it has to be treated anybody know if this is true are you supposed to coat outdoor wood in teak oil thank you for any serious answers p s he told me to ask on yahoo to prove he is right as a member of his gender i am sorry to say he is wrong teak oil is a darker colour than beech wood hence it will obviously darken the colour of beech coloured hardwood to best retain the appearance of light coloured woods i recommend a clear water based exterior varnish there are many brands on the market these days your local hardware store will advise oils are good for wood but they generally darken the colour initially with the added disadvantage of not sealing the wood from staining by just about anything else try washing it off with caustic soda and bleaching it to get the original colour back well let him do it to retrieve the relationship hehehe Teak Wood Plastic Nunchaku Bicycle lighting Thermal power station Wood carving Guinea pig Mattress Paint Soap Drill bit Violin Acne Hardwood Password Flowering plant Theory of conduct Hydrogen peroxide Lumber Neopets RuneScape skills Amber Menstrual cup Turquoise Atari ST Animal Crossing Hamster Water purification Plame affair Flag of Hong Kong European Beech Tesco Expert system Psoriasis Alhambra Sunglasses Linseed oil Glass Isaac Newton's early life and achievements Patent medicine Sewage treatment Brush Woodworking Knife Ultraviolet Soft drink Gift economy Digital photography Supply and demand Staining (biology) Debugging Japanese tea ceremony Richard Rahl Clear Channel Communications Anchor Gross domestic product Hard disk Redundant array of independent disks Advertising Bulk vending Wood pulp Hydrochloric acid Floppy disk Electronic commerce Beer Eastern Orthodox Church Oscilloscope Gender-neutral language Lacquer Dishwasher Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown) Textile manufacturing Radeon Coffee Dial M for Murder Virtual memory Sodium Wood finishing Commodity markets Punt (boat) Natural health Plantation Apollo Guidance Computer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Tofu Domestic violence Vincent van Gogh Pottery Google Discus (fish) Binoculars Gold standard Illegal drug trade Species The Curse of Fenric
