unclogging a toliet that has candlewax in it after my wifes friend stay here she dumped a pot of candlewax in the toliet how can i unclog it candle wax never had that before many other things but not candle wax i have had to unclog many toilets that would flush barely because of obstruction one thing in your favor is that you are dealing with a smooth porcelain finish so this is what i would do first turn off the water supply and flush to remove as much water as possible and disconnect the supply line remove bolts from the bottom of the stool and remove stool if you tip the stool back you will release the water in the trap of the stool at this point the stool should be free of all water clean the bottom of the stool around the drain and remove all of the wax from the stool and from the floor heres where the fun begins get some of those cheap plastic knives the kind like you use for picnics begin scraping away all wax the bond of the wax should be minimal due to the smoothness of the porcelain this will take some time clean as much as you can from the bowl and from the bottom of the stool by the drain once you have all the visible wax removed then you will want to put vasoline on your hands and begin scraping into the trap from both ends you will then have the inner most part of the trap to deal with take a plastic coated coat hanger and begin using it as an auger this method won't be as effective as scraping with the plastic knives but will clear the opening in the trap to allow for free flow of the trap time and waste will remove remaining wax once you have done this you will need a new wax seal to set on the bottom of the stool set stool and fasten in place tighten nuts hand tight and tighten with wrench alternating from one to the other with equal pressure be careful not to over tighten and crack stool reconnect supply line and turn on water supply otherwise buy a new stool and charge your wife's friend for replacement Poker jargon Toilet Dairy Casting Plumbing fixture Flush toilet Motor oil Dialysis Naval mine Textile manufacturing Top-bar hive Toilet paper Toilet humour Seismic retrofit Domestic water system Thermal power station Siphon Brewery Glass Diseases of the honeybee Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Knife Fecal incontinence Urinal Manicure Wrench Woodworking Lock picking Sewage treatment Transformer Hamster Professional wrestling holds Urinary incontinence Soldering Japanese tea ceremony Clinker (boat building) Cross-country skiing Carburetor Spark plug Printed circuit board Pottery Betting (poker) Irrigation Cheating in poker Internal ballistics Space shuttle main engine Drainage Canoe Draw poker Mattress Japanese toilet Glacier Menstrual cup Dietary fiber Fire fighting Upholstery Double bass Rebreather Shaggy dog story Basement Customs and etiquette of Japan Christmas tree Gilding Bassoon Thermostat Timpani Sewer Circuit design Dry cleaning Diving regulator Anchor Texas hold 'em Fancy rat Skateboarding trick Spanking Environmental concerns with electricity generation Water Water (molecule) Coffee Wood carving Sento Sailing Phonograph cylinder Sea ice Autonomous building Vacuum tube Die (manufacturing) Deforestation
