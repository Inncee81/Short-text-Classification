how can i remove ink or maker stains from my white leather sofa any product recommendations if it is on a pigmented leather which i think yours will be then the first thing you should try is an ltt ink stick the fresher the ink the more chance you have of removing it it is a good idea to have one in your house if you have a pale leather you should also be using a good quality leather protector on your suite this will act like a 'scotchgard' and will make any more mishaps easier to clean off if an ink stick doesn't work a solvent based remover will need to be used and it may also remove finish and pigment so is best left to the experts using hairspray is very risky as it can make the matter far worse as it can spread the ink over a bigger area especially on an aniline style leather and can sometimes then be impossible to fix nail varnish remover or any other solvents will remove the finish and pigment which will need replacing do not use baby wipes as they are about the worst thing you can use on a leather as they break down the finish and will eventually ruin it please do not try milk it is a silly idea that this will work and will leave sticky residues on the surface which will help to break down the finish if the ink is on an aniline style there is nothing that will remove it because the ink will have re dyed the leather it may dissipate over time with cleaning and protecting old ink will be harder to remove than new ink and may mean resorting to solvents which will also remove the finish this is probably best left to the experts silicones furniture polish are the worst thing to use on leather as they will form a coating on the surface of the leather which will not allow any moisture to get to the leather and will eventually break all the finish down and make it crack leather needs water and should not be protected against it leather does not need conditioning it needs cleaning and protecting on a regular basis with water based products this will keep it rehydrated and supple oils will make things much worse leather should be cleaned gently not scrubbed so 'elbow grease' will only do damage to the finish nail varnish remover solvents will remove the finish on the leather even if you cannot tell it is doing so and alcohol may do the same depending on the strength of the finish on the leather source s http www lttsolutions net leather care consultnts to the furniture and cleaning industries Upholstery Leather Dry cleaning Knife Plastic Violin Manicure Woodworking Printed circuit board Pottery Tattoo Acetic acid Inkjet printer Soap Drawing Tooth Brush Mattress Textile manufacturing Biodiesel Cross-country skiing Dairy Corrosion Coffee Shoe polish Water (molecule) Drill bit Soy protein Welding Water Brewery Strap-on dildo Perfume Hemp Soldering Wood Coal Lacquer Chromium Aniline Dye Solvent Fecal incontinence Bong Sewage treatment Hydrogen peroxide Casting Benzene Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Turquoise Explosive material Chair Cast iron Aluminium Extreme Programming Haloalkane Tofu BASF Shampoo Color theory Diving suit Brazing Wok Wood carving Inflation Poker jargon Painter and decorator Diamond Clinker (boat building) Seismic retrofit Tanning Motor oil Home repair Keynesian economics Industrial wastewater treatment Computer virus Concentration Disc brake Pastel Windows XP Laser engraving Solar cell Gilding Silly Putty Skin Theory of conduct Menstrual cup Glycerin
