cost of finishing a basement i have a sq ft basement to finish what is the approximate cost to include a bathroom and finish the basement is there already plumbing for a toilet installed in the basement if not you can get the toilets that are made to flush up instead of down as far as cost to do your sq ft basement i have no clue new houses are per sq ft for garbage on up to per sq ft for something really nice probably minimum would be if you went retail and had someone else do the work of course this all depends on the area you live in if you went to auctions and did your shopping really well and did the work yourself if you do hire the work done by a contractor don't ever be shy about asking for references proof of insurance bonding and licensing and call your state board and check out he guys license and then go look at other work he has done and see that the work isn't shoddy and the customers were happy and he did what he said he was going to do i go to building material auctions and buy materials for anything i want to build the stuff ends up being just pennies on the dollar like a nice grade of hardwood flooring enough to do sq ft all in the same color and pattern cents a sq foot home depots price on the same stuff was sq ft you do have to buy bunks of stuff like a bunk of sheetrock but at cents a sheet who cares a bunk of x x 's ends up being cents per board and they are per board at home depot you can buy sinks toilets shower stalls plumbing everything you might need to build an entire house except the right color of paint if you plan on remodeling to code you will need to get a permit and if the house is yours and you don't get a building permit when you sell the house they can make you pay fines and penalties for not getting the permits and inspections as you go along with your project if you are doing the wiring yourself to you will need to get that inspected as well the one thing that i am really careful on is the wiring if the place burns down because of an illegal wiring job then insurance won't cover the loss Wal-Mart Toilet United States Postal Service Air-raid shelter Autonomous building Japanese toilet Insurance Poker jargon ITunes Music Store Sears Holdings Corporation Microeconomics FairTax Dormitory Auction Electrical wiring Taxation in the United States Make money fast Illegal drug trade Toilet paper Plumbing fixture Gross domestic product Plastic Bank The Apprentice 2 Neopets Auto insurance Bulk vending Elevator Construction Mutual fund Home improvement Sears Catalog Home Apple Macintosh MTR Filling station Public transport Solar cell 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Predatory lending United States dollar Chatsworth House Xanadu House CPU cache Bond The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina The Amazing Race Financial services Berkshire Hathaway Bathroom Bristol Grammar School Queensbridge Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Sin City Arbitrage Tax Straw-bale construction Coffee Washroom Urban sprawl Mac OS X Linux Animal Crossing Dialysis Toilet humour Drywall Flush toilet Food Stamp Program Mortgage Ice hockey Humphrey Bogart Driver's license Wood Public domain Fireworks Life insurance Firefighter Lighting Enron Corporation Brewery Drill bit Ra (board game) Warren Buffett E85 Internet fraud Motion picture rating system National Kidney Foundation Singapore Bethalto, Illinois SCO-Linux controversies Medicare (United States) Nuclear power phase-out Annuity Day trading Medical malpractice
