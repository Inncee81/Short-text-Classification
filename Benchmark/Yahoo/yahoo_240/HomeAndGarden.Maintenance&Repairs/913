want to play judge and help me settle a dispute right after completion of a home that was built the customer moved furniture into it there was a leaking pipe upstairs and it caused water damage through the ceiling to the bottom level of the home where it leaked onto a used leather couch the next day the contracter sent the plumber sheet rockers and painters out to make all of the repairs everything was done quickly and efficiently within the next days however there was water damage to the leather couch the couch is used and has some dog scratches and worn places after the water dried there was a light mark about the size of a large pan on the upper corner the contractor volunteered to have it cleaned which would cost about including pick up and delivery or give the customer the cash outright to put towards the purchase of a new couch the customer feels that the contractor should pay for a brand new couch what do you think as a former contractor myself i will side with the contractor and so will a judge the reason being is that the contractor did everything in his power to rectify the problem the contractor wasn't trying to deny or get out of anything he sent in sub contractors to repair the situation and made efforts to have it cleaned or replaced at a fair market value for a couch in used condition with previous damage already you can take this to small claims court but will lose because of your unwillingness to settle with reasonable terms the judge will ask you if the contractor made the efforts necessary to correct the problem and when you say yes he will dismiss the case because of the contractor's efforts and the timely fashion in which the other repairs were made i'm sure that the contractor is licensed and bonded which will exonerate him and maintain his reputation of years of being in business and willingness to take care of the problem therefore you will come out on the losing end and the as well if the couch had been newly reupholstered and was verified as an antique you might have had a case Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Seismic retrofit Welding Tire SCO-Linux controversies Kitchen Nuclear power Home repair United States Postal Service Babylonian law Insurance Contract Scientology beliefs and practices Dairy Inflation Violin The Apprentice 2 Public good Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Sento Boeing Carburetor Upholstery Manitoba Hydro Brewery Natural monopoly Public domain M16 (rifle) CPU design Intellectual property Mediation Thermal power station Atari 8-bit family Hurricane preparedness for New Orleans AMD Heinkel He 100 Mattress Security (finance) Citigroup Space Shuttle program Urinary incontinence E85 Mortgage Menstrual cup Shoe Fecal incontinence Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Plame affair FairTax ITV Property (ownership right) Medical malpractice Fair use Toyota Prius Wayne Corporation Apollo Command/Service Module Surveillance Oil-for-Food Programme Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Debt Gramophone record BAE Systems Microeconomics Leather Heinkel He 112 Clothing Schabir Shaik Trial Public-key cryptography Chair View camera Energy development Ford Motor Company Sears Holdings Corporation Diamond Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Blenheim Palace Equine conformation Volleyball Hamster Child support Management information system Information Technology Infrastructure Library Stanley Cup Negligence Airbus Delta Air Lines Berkshire Hathaway Boeing 747 Corporate personhood Trademark Gold standard Chernobyl accident
