do i need a new washing machine i think i've broke our washing machine i put a large blanket in it last night and near the spin cycle it just started making a funny noise in the end i had to remove the soaking wet blanket tried the machine this morning on a normal wash and it seemed to be working then the dial started moving round and the light started flashing indesit w about years old any ideas on parts or what to do the exact same thing happened to me with an indesit sorry can't remember the model number strangely enough mine was years old too i think they make these things just to last the warranty period and that's when you start having problems have you ever cleaned out the filter i hadn't even realised that you had to do this regularly and mine started working again once i had done it but not for long so i had to get a new one i think you could spend just as much on a new one as you could if you got it repaired Dry cleaning Washing machine Tank Milton H.
