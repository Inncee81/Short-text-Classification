my basement floor was poured in two sections and the seam leaks when we get heavy rain any ideas to fix there is no good fix for this problem they should have installed a waterstop and key along the joint but they obviously didn't you could chip out a section on either side of the joint dowel in some rebar add a section of hydrophylic water stop it expands when it gets wet and re pour the concrete back my other suggestion would be to cut in a sump along where the joint is and install a sump pump with a float direct the discharge outside away from the foundation preferrably so it drains away from the house this will minimize the amount of water you get up through the crack a third suggestion would be to install the hydrophylic waterstop along the walls about to off the wall and pour a new lift of concrete to deep put a sheet of plastic down over the existing floor before you pour and make sure you pour it monolithically or that you key and waterstop any joints Concrete Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Reinforced concrete Drill bit Air-raid shelter Upholstery Welding Panama Canal Dam Pile Drywall Thermal power station Whitewater Wind turbine Light-frame construction Motor oil Casting Panama Canal Locks Cave diving Portsmouth Block Mills Glossary of firefighting equipment Irrigation Sellafield Masonry Rail tracks Autonomous building Sewage treatment Glacier Clarinet Prestressed concrete Rebar Elevator Table saw Atari 8-bit family Domestic water system Straw-bale construction Mooney M20 Hoover Dam Mattress Rail terminology Solar power Hydroponics Passive solar Poker jargon Pavement (material) Fire fighting Equine conformation Flush toilet Screw Internal ballistics Soldering Bong Fire extinguisher Water (molecule) Textile manufacturing Apollo Command/Service Module Toilet paper Erie Canal Kitchen Geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area Natural building Le Corbusier Keynesian economics Brewery Electrical wiring Town gas Portland cement Israeli West Bank barrier Cruising (maritime) Building material Big Dig Orjen Debugging Jumpstart 3rd Grade Transistor Cookware and bakeware Urinal Plastic E85 Naval mine Cinder block Mercury 4 Bassoon Xanadu House Valles Marineris Oil platform Glass Boat building Carburetor Space elevator Air conditioning Diving De Lorean DMC-12 Glossary of firefighting terms Glossary of climbing terms Plumbing fixture
