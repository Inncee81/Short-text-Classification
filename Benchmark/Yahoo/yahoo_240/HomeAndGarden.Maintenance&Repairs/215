my central air run capacitor went out it was volts microfarads can i use a capacitor with v mf my central air run capacitor went out it was volts microfarads can i use a capacitor with v mf anyways bottom line will a volt micro farad work it takes a volt micro farad capacitor its hot and i want to know if this will work till tommarrow it will be alright until you can buy the correct one the voltage is fine but since the microfarads are lower the unit will pull more amps it will also have a harder time starting even if you cant notice the difference the general rule of thumb is you can go plus or minus percent of the original one and be safe since yours is more than percent then you need to get the correct one as soon as possible Capacitor Circuit design Capacitance Electrical element Electrophysiology Volt Microphone Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Membrane potential Action potential Spark gap Tesla coil RLC circuit High-voltage hazards Impedance matching Operational amplifier X10 (industry standard) Phase-locked loop Oscilloscope Electric motor Lineman (occupation) Switched-mode power supply Series and parallel circuits Analog-to-digital converter Decibel Electrolytic capacitor Low-pass filter Diode Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Thermostat Impedance Transformer Toyota Prius Electricity Dynamic random access memory RC circuit Capacitor plague Permittivity Electricity distribution Fluorescent lamp Electric power transmission Alternating current Three-phase electric power Van de Graaff generator Power factor correction Ampere Internal ballistics Power factor Transistor Central processing unit Bicycle lighting Dielectric Voltage source AC power Fossil fuel power plant Electrostatic discharge Incandescent light bulb Ceramics Phantom power Explosive material Redundant array of independent disks Spacecraft propulsion Vacuum tube PC motherboard Thermal power station Electrical network Electronic amplifier Solar cell Back to the Future Negligible Lightning Power (physics) Jet engine Battery (electricity) VFO Exploding-bridgewire detonator Corona discharge Energy development Rail transport in India Uninterruptible power supply RS-232 Resistor Plasma (physics) Logic gate CPU design Electrical generator Mains electricity Energy storage SI Milgram experiment Xenon flash lamp Arcade cabinet Charge-coupled device Wind power Circuit breaker Digital-to-analog converter Particle accelerator MRAM Electric potential Geologic time scale
