i must ask as it is very important does metallica rule wow so many people hate metallica what did they ever do to you i guarantee they're better musicians than any modern band and they have more awesome songs than most bands do and they didn't sell out they just started playing different stuff none of it is awesome but most of it is cool in its own right and i suppose most of you are angry about the whole napster thing well someone had to step up and sue them if metallica hadn't put their foot down there would be no music anymore because bands wouldn't be able to afford to play and so everyone would quit so basically metallica does rule but no one is intelligent enough to realize how blind they are to it all excellent question my brother i must answer this with a long thought out philosophically adept post full of double meanings and impeccable logic yes metallica rulz Metallica Rich Mullins Dave Mustaine Guns N' Roses VH1 ECW One Night Stand James Hetfield Napster Rock (music) Selling out Guilty Gear Timeline of trends in music from the United States (1970-Present) Therion (band) Dream Theater Irony Philosophical skepticism Britpop Queen (band) Thrash metal Satchel Paige Blonde on Blonde Shaggy dog story Megadeth Avenue Q Wheel of Fortune Hip hop rivalries Michael Savage (commentator) History of the Beatles Steely Dan Time Out of Mind Coercion Heavy metal music Theodicy Blur Children of Bodom The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll Intelligent design Limp Bizkit Cliff Burton Little Britain Kurt Cobain Nine Inch Nails Victor Cousin Buddy Guy The Chemical Brothers Timeline of heavy metal Ontological argument Logic Ranma __ characters Blood on the Tracks Theory of conduct The Wall Glenn Danzig Pantera The Church Beavis and Butt-head MTV2 Hey Jude George Harrison The Smashing Pumpkins Primitive accumulation of capital Master of Puppets Kill 'Em All Sampling (music) Noel Gallagher Dialectic Extreme Championship Wrestling Copyleft Tris Speaker Philosophy of language Self Portrait Volleyball Radiohead Marching band Karl Rove Meaning of life Philosophy Poker jargon Pure Pwnage File sharing Bj__rk Lars Ulrich Scott Raynor Red Hot Chili Peppers Philosophy of mathematics Liam Gallagher Jethro Tull (band) David Hume Objectivist philosophy Eric Clapton Green Day 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Jennifer Lopez The nature of God in Western theology Atari 2600 Piccolo Junior Saga Denis Law Linkin Park Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
