what is the meaning of life i've sat down for ages at a time trying to figure it out and sometimes i get close to a reasonable idea but then i always come back to the point that there isn't a point it's pointless what do you think there are two different concepts involved real meaning and the feeling or illusion of meaning real meaning logically can only come from living for a real purpose and real purpose can only come from our creator the word purpose answers the questions why was i put on this earth and what am i supposed to do here if we reject the idea of god then we have no more real purpose than let's say a rock on mars evolution is a mindless natural process just as weather is a mindless natural process evolution can no more grant us purpose than a storm can grant purpose to a rain drop so neither life nor death nor reproduction nor survival are purposes here's what the atheist bertram russell tells us about purpose unless you assume a god the question of life s purpose is meaningless bertrand russell th century philosopher mathematician and nobel laureate but our human nature demands that our lives have worth and that requires living for a purpose if we reject the idea of god we will invent some purpose and imagine that it is real so while we can't create real meaning we can create the illusion here is how that can work do something worthy of praise such as volunteering to mentor inner city youth next give yourself praise and imagine others giving you praise your mind will automatically connect praise with self worth and self worth with purpose mentoring inner city youth presto the illusion of a purposeful life i don't know if god exists or not but i'm not willing to deceive myself and try and create my own purpose for being here on earth i would rather seek god even not knowing if he exists Philosophy of mathematics Meaning of life Philosophy of language God Religion Creationism Theodicy David Hume Infinity Ontological argument Intelligent design A Course In Miracles Existence of God Origin belief Soul Atheism Reincarnation Supernatural Agnosticism Epistemology History of creationism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Cyberspace Evolutionary creationism Intelligent design movement Art Objectivist philosophy Goodness and value theory Atomism Philosophy of perception S__ren Kierkegaard Young Earth creationism Philosophy Determinism Immanuel Kant Summa Theologiae Logic Free will Donald Davidson (philosopher) Urantia Science Creation-evolution controversy William A.
