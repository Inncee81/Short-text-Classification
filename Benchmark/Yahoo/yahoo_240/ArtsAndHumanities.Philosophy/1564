love is the greatest thing on earth and to know what is you must know what isn't agree or disagree and why or does it really boil down to i'm okay you're okay i agree to be able to know what something is we must know what it isn't if we have never experienced the concept of what it is not then how do we know we are experiencing the concept of what it is it is through this comparison that all things exist if everybody was tall then tall would be nonexistant am i making any sense at all lol if everybody in the entire world was the same height there would be no tall no short no in between we would all just be it is not until we see what a short person looks like compared to a tall person that we can come to the conclusion that tallness exists and shortness exists if there were no bad moments in our lives how would we be able to recognize the good moments if we never understood what it felt like to not be loved how would we know how wonderful it actually feels to be loved there is not a battle going on between good and evil love and hate in reality each concept could not exist without the other now this doesn't mean that we should practice the absense of love as often as the presence of love no not at all i beleive our goal in life should be peace love and acceptance with everything we encounter it is just through this comparison that we become aware that each concept exists it is from then on i beleive where we are then able to choose which concept we desire to base our lives on i know i have encountered enough lack of love in my lifetime being aware that these two concepts exist and knowing what comes out of them i get a greater feeling of satisfaction by basing my life on love Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Summa Theologiae Eastern Orthodox Church God Goodness and value theory Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Reality Theory of conduct S__ren Kierkegaard Reincarnation Theodicy Evil Objectivist philosophy Force (Star Wars) Sexual orientation Supernatural Scientology beliefs and practices Happiness Ontological argument Infantilism Utilitarianism Microeconomics Original sin Transactional analysis Current teachings of Prem Rawat Atheism Hell Karma Property (ownership right) Causality Moral objectivism Alignment (role-playing games) The nature of God in Western theology Iago Merit Arthur Schopenhauer Karen Horney Problem of universals Michel Henry Human Religion Predestination Epistemology Socrates Narcissism Economic inequality Christian eschatology Nicomachean Ethics Immanuel Kant Vulcan (Star Trek) Duties of the Heart Urantia Critique of Pure Reason Alexander Technique Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Gnosticism Agnosticism John Howard Yoder John Wycliffe Al-Ghazali Friedrich Schleiermacher ISO 9000 Past teachings of Prem Rawat Neuro-linguistic programming Justification (theology) Mach kernel Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Free will Michael J.
