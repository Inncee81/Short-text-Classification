why is animal euthanasia considered ethical but human euthanasia is not i'm not supporting one or the other because of reasons people unfortunately have an unhealthy attachment to humans we can recognize that an animal will be better off if they were euthanized to alleviate chronic pain and misery we think that keeping humans alive in similar conditions is right and proper we stick them with numerous chemicals and drug them up so much they lose consciousness to ease their suffering so that we can gaze upon their lifeless shell saying their better off like this some people don't consider that animals are as important as humans we say that animals we keep are pets and not family my cocker spaniel cleo passed away month ago and our family mourned and had a short memorial to celebrate her life she lived for years and months she had a massive impact on our lives and was part of our family we grieved when she passed some people especially animal shelters say if they are not adopted in days kill them humans are found and taken care of as wards of the state i'm not saying kill humans too just saying that animals are not viewed with the same respect Euthanasia Animal euthanasia Abortion debate Lethal injection Peter Singer Animal rights Dog Animal testing Kashrut Cat Addiction Feral cat Simone Weil Terri Schiavo Pet skunk Palliative care Vegetarianism Grief Migraine Person Theory of conduct Animism Suicide Nicomachean Ethics Utilitarianism Hunting Drug abuse Ethics Clinical depression Asthma Medicine EastEnders Kurt Cobain Happiness Bioethics Biodiversity Animal welfare Consciousness Infantilism Socialization Wolfrider Zoophilia Welding Pitaten Rabies Domestic rabbit T'Pol Tooth enamel Objectivist philosophy Death The Holocaust The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Religion and abortion First aid Burial Motivation Immortality Anti-psychiatry Buddhism Francis Hutcheson (philosopher) Sant Thakar Singh Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Taboo food and drink Psychosis Prehistoric Britain Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Speciesism Cruelty to animals Surveillance Liberalism Transsexuality Confucius Laura Schlessinger Consensual crime International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement Euphemism Yin Shun Crohn's disease Livestock Pope John Paul II Shark Combine (Half-Life 2) Jewish bereavement Health insurance Empathy Alignment (role-playing games) Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Scientology Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson Separation of church and state Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Tobacco smoking Golden Retriever Growth hormone treatment Psychiatric hospital
