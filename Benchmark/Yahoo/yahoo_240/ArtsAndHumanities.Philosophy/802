where is the outrage over this insane war young people wake up this is your world don't you care young adults where is your voice do you care or is it no draft no care i am extremely bothered by the war having said that i'm not sure what to do it is not apathy but rather rationality that holds action suspended if the us withdraws troops and the region falls into chaos we have created a bigger mess civil war greater symbolic power for terrorists to use as a source of recruitment and lost leverage against iran simultaneously if the us stays it remains in a space that is killing american soldiers and seems hopeless in developing maintaining and running a country we have already lost over soldiers and we are not sure how many more are going to die the future path then is unclear what is clear is that we should never have gone into the war to begin with this in my opinion is what people should be outraged by the president of the us should be held accountable for such a screw up people should write their represenatives and senators requesting no demanding that george w bush be impeached to impeach merely means to hold accountable in trial clinton had an affair not unlike many other american men but his actions lead to impeachment hearings why really why has a president that has misinformed the american people helped his oil ties get richer taken more vacation that any other president slowly responded to the largest national disaster in us history katrina taken away constitutionally guaranteed rights from citizens the patriot act and made a mockery of the office not been impeached George W.
