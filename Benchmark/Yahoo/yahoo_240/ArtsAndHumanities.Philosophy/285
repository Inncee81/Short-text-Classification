i would have sex in public only if taboo is a major issue in philosophy therefore i dared to ask the question would you dare to give a rational feedback ok guys let's step it up a notch what do you think should be changed about yourself the society and the perception of sex that would make this act socialy acceptable as a fulfilment of a biologic need equal to eating and drinking ladies gentlemen there are kinds of answers that totaly missed the point of my question this is not a call for sex in public nor it is a comic relief it's a phylosophy of sex question that seeks to dissect the social interpretation the ethics of copulation sadly most of the answers have commented on the question rather than tried to truely adress the issue waiting for further analysis more replies taboos are about secrecy take the net and yahoo answers for example human tendencies are to fulfil certain needs in anonymity the things that people say on yahoo answers are in many cases things they would never say face to face with family or friends but can comfortably espouse to strangers sex in public could only become culturally and socially acceptable if there was another major taboo that took over from sex for example if eating in public became socially abhorent and was only acceptable in private now for eating in public to be repulsive to us it would most likely have to result from mass poisonings of food where only preparation in the privacy and safety of our homes could ensure pure food that didn't sicken or kill us the taboos about sex are most often connected with shame so perhaps if other things that people did became so shameful that sex was let off the hook perhaps then it would be acceptable in public the other thing that would prevent this of course is the issue of vulnerability having sex in public and being enamoured or embroiled in the act leaves us unaware of what is happening around us and that is a public safety issue so no i can't see it happening any time soon Abortion debate Rape Feminism Human sexual behavior Oral sex Same-sex marriage Philosophy Meaning of life Mojave people Free will Adoption Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Incest Rick Santorum History of sex Social rule Transsexuality Sexual intercourse Religion Sexual orientation Ethics Nudism Narcissism Utilitarianism Robert A.
