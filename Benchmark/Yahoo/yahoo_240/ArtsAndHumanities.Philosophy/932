is it right to read a person through avatar nickname is it not better to read through the person's q a what can the avatar or the nickname or both tell about the person intelligent as well as wise people read others it is rank foolish to judge others i would suggest it is just right to prefer on the latter because you can more evaluate or read a person the way he or she answered a question or throw a question whatever it may be avatar and nickname is just a matter of choice in my case as you would see i chose that because that was the first sample in yahoo i just learned after a few days that you could choose from a variety of avatars provided by yahoo again it is only limited to their own preferences however you could also make your own but to those who don t have the idea is a problem you see avatar doesn't reflect what a person is you may wonder why i didn't change my avatar despite i already learned there preferences to choose from i didn't do so because i wanted to be known in my original suit and i am already acquainted to it and so to my friends but nickname is more reliable than avatar for me since in my case i used my real nickname my real name is giovanni c pasamba iii that's why my nickname is third p stands for pasamba my family name but our good friends in this site chose their own new nicknames they prefer to have a new nickname and for me that's fine freedom of choice as they would say therefore for me it is more reliable to choose the person's q a in reading the personality of an individual Theory of conduct Free will Theodicy Avatar Goodness and value theory Expert system Socrates LiveJournal Transsexuality GunBound Microeconomics Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Avatar (virtual reality) Meaning of life Charmed GED Transactional analysis Moral relativism MP3 Plame affair Leo Wyatt Kalki Predestination Sexual orientation Prayer Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Ethics Same-sex marriage in Canada Alignment (role-playing games) Bayesian inference Coercion Ontological argument Belief revision The Apprentice 2 Alexander Technique Instant-runoff voting Single Transferable Vote Judicial review Visual Basic Political correctness Avatar: The Last Airbender School of Salamanca Whose Line Is It Anyway?
