whats the purpose of life of humanity the religious folks don't need to ask the meaning of life the church tells them the supernatural explanation but the rest of us can't swallow religious dogma because there's no evidence nobody can prove that there life after death that people are tortured or rewarded after life or that there's invisible spirits running around i've come to two conclusions recently life has no meaning life has a million meanings first there's a certainty that death and annihilation awaits not only you but the earth in general it's an astonomical certainty that our sun will supernova and leave the earth a burnt crisp not to mention all the other extinction level events around the corner second the million things that give us meaning are the pleasurable experiences we can conjure up during the short period we are here on the earth in the form of the relationships we have with our kids and other people and the 'housekeeping' types of purposes what i mean by that are the curing disease ending hunger improving literacy reducing crime preventing war helping other kinds of things so the bottom line is we only have a temporary meaning to life to reduce pain and increase pleasure other than that everything is lost to oblivion to be or not to be to be is temporary and not to be is inevitable Supernatural Religion Al-Ghazali Hell Supernova Black hole Human extinction Angel Mortification of the flesh Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Intelligent design Neutrino Simone Weil Reincarnation Kain (Legacy of Kain) A Course In Miracles Soul Sun Tribulation Immortality Clinical depression Creationism Goodness and value theory Human sexual behavior Fermi paradox Existence of God Prostate cancer Phaedo Gamma ray burst Nicomachean Ethics Happiness Christian eschatology Impact event Guns, Germs, and Steel Evil Young Earth creationism Theodicy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an End of civilization Origin belief Falun Gong Evolutionary creationism Social psychology Torture Urinary incontinence Extinction Utilitarianism Justification (theology) S__ren Kierkegaard Surveillance Agnosticism Animism Magic (paranormal) Solar system Atomism Global warming Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Abortion debate Folk music Addiction Orgasm God Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Capitalism Scientology beliefs and practices Capital punishment Ecology Black Death Ozone depletion Jiddu Krishnamurti Creation science Overpopulation Biodiversity Urantia Oral sex Merit Alzheimer's disease Book of Mormon Blood (computer game) Fine-tuned universe Eastern Orthodox Church Chronic fatigue syndrome Human Resurrection of Jesus The Amber Spyglass Chronology of the Ancient Near East Extinction event Population history of American indigenous peoples Altruism Muraqaba Epistemology Autism Human skin color Birth control Creationist cosmologies Evolutionism
