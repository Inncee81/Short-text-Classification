who else besides me is of the opinion that refusual to admit or deny is pretty much an admission of guilt this cop out has most famously been used by all those cheating baseball players mcguire sosa bonds palmero etc but others involved in less publicized cases use it in court and it really urks me to no end either admit that you did something wrong and deal with the consequences or deny and makes your accusers have to prove otherwise doing nothing just tells me that you know you'd have no leg to stand on if you were to challenge the accuations so instead you avoid the issue all together in the hopes that enough people will presume you innocent since there's no proof to say differently and then you can just use that philosophy as a crtuch the rest of your life don't know how it works in court but as for the court of public opinion and mine in particular refusual to fight deny or in any acknowledge an accuation made towards you tells me that you know you have no way of hiding the truth or proving your innocence doing this will make me think you guilty everytime innocent until proven guilty is fine but this 'th amendment and no contest plea crap make it awfuly tough for me to think that way don't know how some can think otherwise if i accuse you of something that you know you didn't do tell me i'm wrong sue me do something for crying out loud ignoring me and doing nothing is just going to make me assume that you have something to hide and are there for too afraid to plead your case cause you know you'll get found out i'd of course love to hear from others that agree with me but others who see this differently are welcome to state their opinions as well i'd be very interested in understanding how sonme of you can still think of someone as innocent if they refuse to even acknowledge accuations made towards them those that do this might as well have a huge g for guilty branded on their face cause it's nothing but the equivilent of a year old lying and saying they didn't do something even though they can't look you in the eye people like you no offense intended i probably should say people who think that way are the reason people like me are around if i were innocent i probably would refuse to take the stand for several reasons i might be a little weirded out about how what i may say could be twisted around by an intelligent lawyer i might just want to see how anyone could prove something that's not true i also might stay off the stand just because some people want me up there i can't agree with you based on the fact that there are probably more people like that out there but at the same time i find myself wondering the same thing sometimes Appeal 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Plame affair Slander and libel Schapelle Corby Theory of conduct Jury trial Plea bargain Schabir Shaik Trial Mumia Abu-Jamal Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Trials since the Fiji coup of 2000 Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Ten Commandments Days of our Lives Burden of proof EastEnders Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Scots law Apology (Plato) Sin City Supreme Court of the United States Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution Blue Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Capital punishment Watergate scandal Hearsay Scientology controversy Ronnie Earle Moore v.
