aren't there situations in life where using the morally absolute yardstick of right vs wrong is not the right thing to do in other words aren't there situations in life where both and or neither would actually be the correct evaluation of the situation given all the situations' kaleidoscopic details and parameters logic is the root of morality all moral judgments depend on logical reasoning this means evaluating the facts the motives and the results of actions and decisions the more crystal clear is our logic the more moral and just are our own decisions and actions one can only work to be as intellectually honest as he is willing and capable since humans are not infallible that's where in certain cases a perfectly correct evaluation of right and wrong is difficult to achieve justice is not always possible precisely because there are situations where the facts are not all available to us therefore we must absolve an accused for insufficient evidence if we are not sure who committed the crime we can't be sure that justice is done by convicting someone on the basis of our feelings most moral decisions or actions we choose daily are based on pretty clear evidence and we are typically conscious whether when we lie cheat and do everything else to cover our tracks there are cases in which our reasoning is so fuzzy we actually don't know what's moral or immoral the cure for that is not to invoke more fuzziness and say some situations can't be analyzed if we dig deeper even the greyest situations have a little more right or a little more wrong and can be classified accordingly but this kind of work is for those who want to make the effort to go to the very bottom of things and are not happy with the grey area some situations are worthy of the effort some are too petty to bother too Theory of conduct Ethics Goodness and value theory Theodicy Objectivist philosophy Religion Expert system Friedrich Schleiermacher Value system Bayesian inference Human nature Microeconomics Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Social justice Merit Scientific method Philosophical skepticism Morality Atheism Simone Weil Peter Singer Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Determinism Postmodernism Freedom of speech Utilitarianism Slander and libel Fallacy Ontological argument Summa Theologiae Reparations for slavery Conscience Argument from morality Categorical imperative Appeal Sexual orientation Falsifiability Francis Hutcheson (philosopher) The nature of God in Western theology Scientology beliefs and practices Mediation Alignment (role-playing games) Immanuel Kant Nicomachean Ethics Capital punishment Moral objectivism Moral relativism Sin Soul Rudolf Hermann Lotze Second language acquisition S__ren Kierkegaard Al-Ghazali Epistemology Universal pragmatics Philosophy Fathers' rights Spanking Intelligent design movement Biblical inerrancy Equal Protection Clause Just War theory Principal-agent problem John Howard Yoder Noam Chomsky Lie Jury trial Rape Animal rights Homophobia Francis Crick Sant Thakar Singh Halakha Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Decision theory A Course In Miracles Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Criticism of libertarianism Charles Grandison Finney Patriotism Vagueness Probation officer Opus Dei Moral absolutism Moral Politics Homosexuality and Judaism Conspiracy theory Theory
