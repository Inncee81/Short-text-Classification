how was created this universe by god not this universe alone but the whole cosmos was built by god almighty through the mother of all explosions the sacred big bang and what is this big bang theory what do we mean when we talk of the big bang theory the sacred big bang occurs when god almighty explodes himself with a big bang and why does god almighty explodes self the complete explanation has been rendered by sacred bhagavad gita the doctrine given to mankind by lord krishna an avatar of the era god manifest in human form as per bhagavad gita when the dissolution of the old cosmos occurs the entire cosmos reduces to the size of half a thumb and what is this the size of half a thumb this size of half a thumb the volume consists of all purified souls atmans in the cosmos does it mean that put together in their purified state size of the entire cosmos is just the size of half a thumb yes the truth is so this cluster of all purified souls atmans in the cosmos at a given point of time is what we know as god almighty bhagavad gita is explicitly clear on that imagine the power this small cluster of all purified souls atmans contains unable to retain itself for long in this prime pure state it again explodes with a big bang causing formation of a new cosmos a new cosmic life cycle the massive explosion causes all souls atmans to scatter out in the whole cosmos at unimaginable speeds as the rolling ball gathers moss all hurtling souls atmans also gather impurities in their cosmic sojourn to remove the impurities within the dross within every soul atman needs to work out its karma and starts the cosmic life cycle of every soul atman one cosmic life cycle requires soul atman manifesting million bodily forms an earthly journey of million years every soul atman initially manifests the form of an amoeba single cell formation the first manifestation in the cosmic life cycle it subsequently evolves into multi cell formation then insect life plant life animal life and finally the form of a human being only as a human being the soul atman within gains liberation from the cycle of birth and death forever the big bang theory is contested by many scientists world over but the cosmic truth can never be belied the truth of the cosmic system is beyond the capture of science spirituality starts from the point where science ends science demands proof on the contrary spirituality requires absolute faith in the system of god more on big bang theory http www godrealized com bigbangtheory html Advaita Vedanta Hindu philosophy Sri Aurobindo Soul Origin belief Big Bang Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Human Avatar Moksha Reincarnation Involution (philosophy) Indian caste system Adi Shankara Physical cosmology Universe Bhakti Vishnu Hindu scripture Cosmology Arjuna Aum Upanishad Old Earth creationism Al-Ghazali Phaedo Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Immortality Determinism Creationist cosmologies Ken Wilber Mantra Simone Weil Krishna Meaning of life Hindu Intelligent design Creationism Eschatology Evolutionary creationism Samael Aun Weor Creation-evolution controversy Adi Da Summa Theologiae Non-standard cosmology Ishta-deva Monotheism Karma Yoga Samadhi Book of Mormon Neutrino Supernatural Origen Heaven Animism Mahabharata Urantia Devil Modern geocentrism Theodicy Dark energy Fermi paradox Emanuel Swedenborg Sant Mat Maimonides Gravity Pantheism Jesus Buddhism Alchemy Panentheism Shiva Steady state theory Rudolf Hermann Lotze Religious perspectives on Jesus Water COBE Bah__'__ Faith and Science Fred Hoyle Hannes Alfv__n Kosas Numerology Eastern Orthodox Church Dark matter
