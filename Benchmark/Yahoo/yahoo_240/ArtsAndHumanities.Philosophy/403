why do we feel the need to know others opinions if we end up doing what we want i mean friends often come for me for advice or my opinion on a certain situation and then dont even apply my words od wisdom into consideration when it comes to making a decision they to the total opposite dont get me wrong i do it too i dont know why for example i can ask which i better item a or item b i like item a and know thats the one i will get but i still manage to ask which one do u like which one is better which one should i get they all say item b yet i still get item a after hearing everyones advice or opinions its not just with materialistic things but with real life situations as well why do we do this ask even thogh we already know in our hearts we know the answer i guess if we followed our hearts there would be no need for yahoo answers huh what do u think i did it again lol very good question personally i think it's mostly due to our own human nature we want to know what others think or would do because we don't want to feel alone even though we may not take their advice my mother for instance is constantly asking what should she do i've been fielding that question from her since i was but rarely does she listen Theory of conduct Goodness and value theory Socrates Little Britain Abortion debate Laura Schlessinger Singlish The Apprentice 2 Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Consensus decision-making Philosophy of language Appeal Meaning of life Expert system Social rule Simone Weil Utilitarianism Nicomachean Ethics Pitaten Yusuf al-Qaradawi Religious Society of Friends Sydney Riot of 1879 Current teachings of Prem Rawat Past teachings of Prem Rawat Supreme Court of the United States Rudolf Hermann Lotze One Tree Hill (TV series) Epistemology Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution The nature of God in Western theology Roe v.
