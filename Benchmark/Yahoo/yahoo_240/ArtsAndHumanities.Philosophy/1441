the soul is the eternal mind if the mind is not eternal there is no soul perhaps the soul is eternal conciousness after death if the soul is re incarnated into another body the mind will be different the concioussness will remain the same i dont believe we possess a soul im just trying to get an adequate description of what a soul is whatever it is can we agree it must be eternal in order to be called a soul no dictionary definitons please i m not asking webster i think there is a conflict with the views of the soul being eternal in the sense with religions like the catholics believe in the soul that it lives on after you die and go to heaven and hell depending on the way you live on this earth then the buddhists believe in mindfulness the mind lives on after the body dies i see the confusion in that what you say about the reincarnation of the mind in another body and the clash of the soul and the mind being different some how in all my beliefs and readings and studies of worl religions i feel that the mind is extremely connected to the soul and that the soul will control the mind because they are so connect the soul is the most powerful that is why we have dark and light souls on different planes of this conscious life and the realms that we can not see only the dead that have gone on can see some souls are old and some are new it is amazing how people never tap into their souls and they must for it is eternal and knows the answers the mind only functions because of the soul the soul is the power source that we connect to god a higher power how many people have we seen walking around lifeless no energy no brains what so ever because they were not connected to their souls the mind will not change i feel even if it is in a different body the soul will always direct it that is if you believe in reincarnation the soul is far more powerful the mind will always be the same even if the body changes you cannot change the soul it is eternal Soul Reincarnation Immortality Hell Afterlife Hinduism Heaven Religion Bible and reincarnation Friedrich Schleiermacher Theosophy Abrahamic religion Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Urantia Consciousness A Course In Miracles God Simone Weil Christian eschatology Jiddu Krishnamurti Sikhism primary beliefs and principles Dualism (philosophy of mind) Purgatory Sant Thakar Singh Sant Mat Ayya Vaikundar Demon Witchcraft Incarnations of Immortality Salvation Ghost Jewish eschatology Spiritual evolution Rebirth (Buddhism) Maimonides Bhagavad Gita Origin belief Advaita Vedanta Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Eckankar Angel Angel Sanctuary Phaedo Spiritism Atomism Summa Theologiae Edgar Cayce Holy Spirit Animism Out-of-body experience Justification (theology) Evolutionary creationism Egyptian soul Hindu philosophy Problem of Hell Bangsian fantasy Sin Catholicism Jesus Ekadasi Origen Buddhism Merit Sri Aurobindo Pentagram New Age Human Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Harrowing of Hell The nature of God in Western theology Rudolf Steiner Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Marvel Universe Gnosticism Resurrection of Jesus Avatar Original sin Rosicrucian Fellowship Vishnu Brahmanism Meaning of life Charles Grandison Finney Buddhist philosophy Eastern Orthodox Church Eternal return Kabbalah Supernatural Idolatry Qiyamah
