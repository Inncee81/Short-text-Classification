what have you been taking for granted or who thank you for your answer have a wonderful night day since you are a dear friend i have to be honest all the way i have been taking my future for granted all my life like the only thing that keeps me going is my sentimentality more of looking back than looking forward most of my answers are encouraging people to do otherwise because me myself cant do it in my own life i often get dragged by past hurts and things i find very difficult to let go of which in the process ive totally taken the future for granted i never plan i never save i work hard here in bermuda for my family back home sending my earnings to my parents and my brother who has a family of his own because nobody works except me and i always thought my own worth is just that i have no future so i shouldnt look forward for it i can die now or anytime i want to and i dont care for myself hope that changes coz as time goes by i find my future getting bleaker and bleaker i have nowhere to go nothing to look forward to The Time Machine The Amber Spyglass Charles Ives Kain (Legacy of Kain) Social rule Incarnations of Immortality One Tree Hill (TV series) Vegeta Phoebe Halliwell Futurama (TV series - season 5) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Coming of Age (TNG episode) Inception of Darwin's theory Marty McFly Mystique (comics) Friends Rich Mullins Futurama (TV series - season 2) Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Freeters The Silence of the Lambs Jon Secada Justification (theology) The Inside Sin City Abortion debate Alcoholics Anonymous The Pilgrim's Progress Pitaten Back to the Future Shen Gong Wu Theory of conduct Appeasement Adoption God Emperor of Dune Children of Dune Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Avenue Q Piccolo Junior Saga The Death Gate Cycle Bob and George John the Baptist Infantilism About a Boy The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Honey and Clover EastEnders Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Jean Grey Melanie Wilkes Predestination paradox Father's Day (Doctor Who) Daylight saving time Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Datalore (TNG episode) Religious Society of Friends A Simple Plan Richard Feynman Hollyoaks Mina Mongoose Charles Darwin's education Divorce Philosophy of space and time Ludwig Wittgenstein Panay incident Hillary Rodham Clinton Blankets (graphic novel) Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story!
