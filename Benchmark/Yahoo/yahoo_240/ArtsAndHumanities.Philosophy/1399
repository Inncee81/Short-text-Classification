do you believe as you get better in life the trials become greater the best students always get the hardest tests because they can handle them and that is in life not the classroom only well yes i believe that life won't give you a problem if you'renot capable of handling it and solving it but not all of us get better in life and get the harder problems some are not so good but still they have mounting problems i guess the difference is the people we are as we get older and wiser we know things we haven't known before solving a great problem may be another step in solving another greater one and if you pass former you'll get to climb the ladder i think that all of us gets to have great problems no one is an exception all are equal in facing them all have the same means of solving it we were not designed as who gets to have a better life will get the greater problem but it's inevitable that as we get better we also face trial in life that exceeds our capacity as before but nevertheless we are brave in facing them head on 1957 World Series Athenian democracy Theory of conduct Capitalism Aerodynamics Current teachings of Prem Rawat Space elevator The Princeton Review Expert system Goodness and value theory Jet engine Halting problem Finite element method Cessna T-37 Microeconomics TGV Labor theory of value Energy economics Quicksort B-47 Stratojet Minesweeper (computer game) Complexity classes P and NP Mountain bike Ludwig Wittgenstein Explosive material M16 (rifle) Car handling Ethernet Extreme Programming Utilitarianism Economics Augustus De Morgan Charter school M60 machine gun File Allocation Table Tour de France Hard disk Contract Welfare economics Sense and reference Software engineering Engineering Grade (education) Bernard Williams Panama Canal Beretta 92F/FS Tidal power Drill bit Nuclear power Experiment Pump It Up Debugging Autogyro AMD Recurrence relation Infantilism Principal-agent problem NP (complexity) Aikido XML Equine conformation Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism MS-06 Zaku II Floppy disk Quantum harmonic oscillator Cryptanalysis Four wheel drive Education in the United States Volleyball Glossary of climbing terms IBM PC compatible Concerto Digital circuit Esperanto as an international language History of the halfpenny Martingale Moore's law Coming of Age (TNG episode) Thermal power station Commodity markets Clinical trial Criticism of libertarianism Computational complexity theory Socrates Externality Heinkel He 100 Education in Germany Archimedes Josip Plemelj IP (complexity) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Renewable energy Scientology beliefs and practices Supermarine Spitfire Requirements analysis Chu-Han contention Mathematics Proposals for a Palestinian state Springfield 1903 rifle
