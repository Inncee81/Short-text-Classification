is the soul in the body when people die it is said that the soul is released from the body and it flows freely but then isn't there a possibility that the soul isn't even in the body in the first place i'm curious to hear what other people think let's define the soul as the part of your mind that survives the death of your brain now some people believe this is a cohesive spiritual being that departs the body at death great concept but highly speculative it s much like believing your data can survive a meltdown of your hard drive so does your data join the great database in the sky do your files and programs reintegrate into the new computers being born everyday be nice if it did but i wouldn t bet money on it ah but there is part of our self we know survives children hear the advice of long dead parents we often know what absent friends would say the living are surrounded by the voices of the dead for better or worse our words and actions echo through time that soul isn t in your body you create it in those you touch every day Soul Afterlife Animism Death Reincarnation Ghost in the Shell The nature of God in Western theology Phaedo Simone Weil Purgatory Christian eschatology The Parting of the Ways Computer virus Resurrection of Jesus W.
