have you ever had a near death experience if so what was it like i have had one i was without a heartbeat and respiration for a bit over minutes i saw so much that human words cannot begin to do justice to i saw my guardian angel they are the one that brought me 'back' i saw my mom passed years prior to the nde she would not come up to me i think that she knew i'd be inclined to want to stay with her if she did and it was not 'my time' and i saw a light not a bright white light it was bright but not in a way that lights here on earth are bright and it was alive and intelligent it was a life changing experience the dr who was the specialist in charge of my care later said you left and saw a lot of things it shows but you're back you're meant to be here this write up of it sounds flat lame compared to what it really was human experience and words can't touch what i saw and heard and felt Milton H.
