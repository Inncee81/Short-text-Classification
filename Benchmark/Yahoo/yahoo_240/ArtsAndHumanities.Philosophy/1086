are we like batteries because we need to charge like healing when we tired and we have electric on our system mobile fone can talk to one another with electricity and radiations capture how come we cant do that within our supernatual because we have that on our system every inventions imaginations can make real why not from supernatual in us true you're really cute but i can't understand what you are saying Solar cell Battery (electricity) Electricity Toyota Prius Radio Semiconductor device Quantum mechanics Universal Century Technology Capacitor Directed-energy weapon Cosmic Era technology Electrical engineering Energy Telephone Naval mine Battery electric vehicle Solar power Ford Ranger EV Laptop Internal combustion engine Diode Solar panel Electrical element History of physics Current (electricity) Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Mobile phone Apollo spacecraft Tire Antenna (radio) Flux Circuit design Perpetual motion Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Action potential Musical Instrument Digital Interface Electromagnetic spectrum Johann Philipp Reis Atmospheric electricity Permittivity Pok__mon Abilities Geomagnetic storm Third rail Radiation hardening Electromagnetic radiation Electromagnetic field Autonomous building Cruising (maritime) Air conditioning Renewable energy Nuclear technology Electric charge Incandescent light bulb Logic Segway HT Vacuum tube Software patent debate Flashlight Heat Church of Christ, Scientist Radio controlled car Plutonium ZAFT Armed Keeper of Unity Names of large numbers Torpedo Hybrid vehicle Electric power transmission Read-only memory Polarization Refractive index T-64 Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Loudspeaker Trolleybus Yom Kippur War STS-87 Flywheel energy storage Tesla coil Temperature Sound film Superconductivity Charles Wheatstone Volt Photoelectric effect Flash memory Wardenclyffe Tower Anode Teleforce Programmable logic device Analog computer Technology History of radio Maxwell's equations Timeline of invention Stomach cancer Lithium ion polymer battery Conductor (material) Car audio Electric vehicle Transformer
