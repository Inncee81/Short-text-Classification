there is ample evidence that nazi physicians performed experiments on humans german scientists and physicians are not stupid by a long shot one example that i have read about is this one nazi pilots were being shot down over the north sea they survived the crash but froze to death in the ice cold water physicians developed a way to bring them back by thawing them out some way maybe years ago a young boy fell through ice into ice cold water and froze doctor using the nazi technique brought him back the moral question came up is it right to use techniques developed by using humans to bring back a person from freezing a perplexing question when it is someone elses child but of it is my son damned right it is ok how about your child or loved one the nazi's preformed horrible horrible experiments on living people the only reason they could do this is because they had no regard for any life besides their own but i think that using that information for example the bringing back a person from freezing should be able to used otherwise didn't the jews and others who were murdered die in vain we should condemn all those who preformed those experiments but if the knowledge can be used to help others we should be able to use it Sub-Zero Martin Heidegger Drowning Supporting Characters (Xenogears) Nazi human experimentation Capital punishment Flood geology Abortion debate Cryonics Sea ice Reinhard Heydrich Sea level rise Hell The Holocaust Ice age Euthanasia Schutzstaffel Assassination Little Ice Age Nazi concentration camps The X-Files (season 1) Human cloning Josef Mengele Religion and sexual orientation Creationism Mein Kampf Water (molecule) Reincarnation Sealab 2021 Socrates Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Immortality Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Project MKULTRA Schindler's List Miracle Climate of the United Kingdom Air Florida Flight 90 Young Earth creationism Franz Boas Water Supernatural Peter Singer Summa Theologiae Characters in Neon Genesis Evangelion Science Glacier Erich Priebke Theory of conduct Kyle Broflovski Charles Lindbergh Taken History of gays in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust Theodicy Eugenics Adolf Eichmann Carbon dioxide Luke and Laura Spencer Severe weather terminology (United States) Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Prehistoric Britain Night (book) Magda Goebbels Frankenstein Kristallnacht Jewish views of religious pluralism Cro Immanuel Kant Kain (Legacy of Kain) Ravensbr__ck concentration camp Werner Heisenberg Child sexuality Religion Death Human Paul von Hindenburg Miss Saigon Rudolf Hermann Lotze Ice Exploration of Mars Sacrifice Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Scientology beliefs and practices Charles Grandison Finney Appeasement Avatar: The Last Airbender Total war Snowball Earth Incarnations of Immortality Fishing The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Frank Herbert Moon Lucid dreaming Fred A.
