i am emo what's wrong this is my only option my life is pointless and being an emo loving it emo haters what is it you hate i'd have to agree with one of the people here that this is not your only choice that everybody has choices i'm not really sure what qualifies a person for emo and i'm not going to look it up on the net either but i would like to know what you think would make you emo and what doesn't for me for the people that call themselves emo or the reason that it can be a pain to see people that think they are emo is like a the problem that a lot of people have the problem that a lot of people have is that they think that their lives suck and that there is nothing that they can do about that this life is useless well if that's so then go out and change that in some way i'm not condoning anything but you kind of get what i mean for the first thing i know that people lives can suck that there is nothing that they can do about it but do you really think that with all the people that presicribed anit depresents and anti psycotics really need them sometimes it's just like something that people carry around with them since they were a baby kind of like what's wrong baby are you hurt are you hungry oh wait baby want's their toy then you give the toy to the baby and it quits crying then it grows up and becomes this brat talking about how life is so unfair in suburbia and talking about all the hardships well the friend that's getting raped and beating by their parents or whoever is taking care of them just rolls their eyes while the kid that came here from another country because they didn't want to continue or either not become a child soldier is like why can't you just be happy but both of them don't realize that the problem is that the emo kid is just spoiled that they need to be fixed but a pill isn't really going to help now there's a diffence for the people that spoiled and the truly depressed don't try and mis read what i'm trying to say and it's so irrating that people would want to be deprassed for no good reason i'm not saying that person that is depressed can't have everything but i'm just saying that person who has everything and isn't sick now that's messed up do emo kids think it's cool to go around and cry for no reason to never truly feel laughter to think that laughter is something with knives in it that just hurt you in the back this could be the reason that a lot of people don't like emo kids or the emo scene in recent years how it's become something like this for poor rich kids to identify with now they might not be the richest kids in the land but i'm sure that they don't have to worry about food being on their tables that they have both parents around and they probally have both grandparents around as well it's not that i hate emo becaus hate is strong word but i just don't agree with it totally and if fuguzi is emo well i don't like i said i don't totally agree with current scene and i don't think that afi would be emo so what is emo Emo Theory of conduct Kodocha Social rule Shaggy dog story EastEnders Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Knots Landing Rich Mullins Abortion debate Jon Secada Friends Transsexuality Ranma __ characters Something Positive Kyle Broflovski Piccolo Junior Saga Breastfeeding The Inside About a Boy The Catcher in the Rye Goodness and value theory Poker jargon Cindy Sheehan Fruits Basket Avenue Q Theodicy The Marshall Mathers LP The Amber Spyglass Humphrey Bogart True Crime: Streets of LA Jam (TV series) The Human Stain Kender The Smoking Room YuYu Hakusho Time Out of Mind The Contender (television series) W.I.T.C.H.
