what is the meaning to life so i know what im here for the philosophical question what is the meaning of life means different things to different people the vagueness of the query is inherent in the word meaning which opens the question to many interpretations such as what is the origin of life what is the nature of life and of the universe in which we live what is the significance of life what is valuable in life and what is the purpose of or in one's life these questions have resulted in a wide range of competing answers and arguments from scientific theories to philosophical theological and spiritual explanations these questions are separate from the scientific issue of the boundary between things with life and inanimate objects popular beliefs what is the meaning of life is a question many people ask themselves at some point during their lives most in the context what is the purpose of life here are some of the many potential answers to this perplexing question the responses are shown to overlap in many ways but may be grouped into the following categories survival and temporal success to live every day like it is your last and to do your best at everything that comes before you to be always satisfied to live go to school work and die to participate in natural human evolution or to contribute to the gene pool of the human race to advance technological evolution or to actively develop the future of intelligent life to compete or co operate with others to destroy others who harm you or to practice nonviolence and nonresistance to gain and exercise power to leave a legacy such as a work of art or a book to eat to prepare for death to spend life in the pursuit of happiness maybe not to obtain it but to pursue it relentlessly to produce offspring through sexual reproduction alike to participating in evolution to protect and preserve one's kin clan or tribe akin to participating in evolution to seek freedom either physically mentally or financially to observe the ultimate fate of humanity to the furthest possible extent to seek happiness and flourish experience pleasure or celebrate to survive including the pursuit of immortality through scientific means to attempt to have many sexual conquests as in arthur schopenhauer's will to procreate to find and take over all free space in this game called life to seek and find beauty to kill or be killed no point since having a point is a condition of living human consciousness animals do not need a point to live or exist it is more of an affliction of consciousness that there are such things as points a negative side to evolutionary development for lack of better words wisdom and knowledge to master and know everything to be without questions or to keep asking questions to expand one's perception of the world to explore to expand beyond our frontiers to learn from one's own and others' mistakes to seek truth knowledge understanding or wisdom to understand and be mindful of creation or the cosmos to lead the world towards a desired situation to satisfy the natural curiosity felt by humans about life ethical to express compassion to follow the golden rule to give and receive love to work for justice and freedom to live in peace with yourself and each other and in harmony with our natural environment to protect humanity or more generally the environment to serve others or do good deeds religious and spiritual to find perfect love and a complete expression of one's humanness in a relationship with god to achieve a supernatural connection within the natural context to achieve enlightenment and inner peace to become like god or divine to glorify god to experience personal justice i e to be rewarded for goodness to experience existence from an infinite number of perspectives in order to expand the consciousness of all there is i e to seek objectivity to be a filter of creation between heaven and hell to produce useful structure in the universe over and above consumption see net creativity to reach heaven in the afterlife to seek and acquire virtue to live a virtuous life to turn fear into joy at a constant rate achieving on literal and metaphorical levels immortality enlightenment and atonement to understand and follow the word of god to discover who you are to resolve all problems that one faces or to ignore them and attempt to fully continue life without them or to detach oneself from all problems faced philosophical to give life meaning to participate in the chain of events which has led from the creation of the universe until its possible end either freely chosen or determined this is a subject widely debated amongst philosophers to know the meaning of life to achieve self actualisation all possible meanings have some validity life in itself has no meaning for its purpose is an opportunity to create that meaning therefore to die to simply live until one dies there is no universal or celestial purpose nature taking its course the wheel of time keeps on turning whatever you see you see as in projection makes perception there is no purpose or meaning whatsoever life may actually not exist or may be illusory to contemplate the meaning of the end of life other to contribute to collective meaning we or us without having individual meaning i or me to find a purpose a reason for living that hopefully raises the quality of one's experience of life or even life in general to participate in the inevitable increase in entropy of the universe to make conformists' lives miserable to make life as difficult as possible for others i e to compete
