what's the difference between faith and hope please elaborate faith and hope are actually quite similar but there is a difference faith is the belief in something beyond what your human senses can perceive with little or no substantial tangible evidence for example my mother is about a hour plane ride away yet somehow i have faith that she is alive and well even though i have no way of knowing this for sure unless of course i call her up right now another example i have faith that i will wake up tomorrow i believe i am a fairly healthy individual but there's still no guarantee that i will even survive until bedtime tonight i just have faith hope involves a little less certainty making it more whimsical and almost more magical when it is realized i hope to be a published author someday just like i hope to have a family with at least two children there is enough time between now and when these hopes can be actualized that there is a higher level of doubt not that i doubt myself no i am only aware that a lot needs to happen before i am published or before i have a family Soul Reincarnation Out-of-body experience Jon Secada Roman Catholic Church Theodicy Exorcism Philosophical skepticism Karen Horney Sleep Atheism Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Objectivist philosophy Epistemology Religion Magical thinking Supernatural Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity A Course In Miracles Psychology of religion Religious pluralism The nature of God in Western theology Abortion debate Community of Christ Breastfeeding Justification (theology) Eastern Orthodox Church Cultural relativism Divorce Biblical canon Al-Ghazali Baptism The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Milton H.
