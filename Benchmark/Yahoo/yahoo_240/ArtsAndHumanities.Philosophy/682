has anyone ever experienced a near death or after death experience after watching a researcher's lecture at ucsb about his lifetime studies on near death and after death experiences i have been doing much research it seems that percent of these cases people have very similar stories the medical community always has a scientific explanation for instance one person was diagnosed as being dead and after hours in the hospital morgue an attendant heard a banging sound and opened the cooler the the body sat up and whooosh started gasping for air the hospital claimed it was faulty equipment that went wrong and misdiagnosed the person as dead just check out what wikipedia says on the page death and the section on misdiagnosed death any takes on this subject i have had a few very close calls and i saw my whole life flash before my eyes it's really scary when you honestly think this is it i am dead your right this subject is extremely interesting and definitely enchanting Milton H.
