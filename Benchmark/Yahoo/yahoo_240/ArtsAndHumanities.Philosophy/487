guess my age tongue piercing hi by the way i speak can you tell how old i am i want a tongue piercing by the end of this year its just simply something i want i know its 'taboo' and frowned upon but i know the risks and the way corporate america looks at body piercings it is slightly immature and doesnt make much sense at all but im more urban and underground orientated than anything else by this can you determine how old i am dont presume im a minor adolescent just because i haven't pierced my tongue yet thanks dont presume im a minor adolescent just because i haven't pierced my tongue yet actually that presumption is more likely to arise from the fact that you say you want it in spite of all the reasons you give against it your individual identity is not yet well formed since you say you are more urban and underground orientated than anything else and the consideration you give to corporate america in flouting their expectations i would say probably about why are you asking this Sexual orientation Body piercing Pedophilia Human sexual behavior Oral sex Sexual abstinence Tongue piercing Swedish language Body modification Democracy Abortion debate Barbell (piercing) Contract Relative clause Old Tongue Adolescence Androgen insensitivity syndrome Child Reparative therapy Nipple piercing Homosexuality Sesotho language Surveillance Statutory rape Sexual abuse Prisoner's dilemma Mutant X (television) Roper v.
