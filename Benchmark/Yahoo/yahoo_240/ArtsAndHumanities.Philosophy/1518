what is the value of education i just recently graduated with my bachelor's and i want to start this by saying that without my education i wouldn't be who i am and my horizons would be much more limited i also know that a degree is a staple for getting ahead faster in a career however i've learned so much that it has gotten to a point where i realize that for any one phenomenon there are multiple theoretical perspectives to explain it i feel somewhat unrooted most theories have valid elements and invalid elements so really in the end what is it that i believe i know i am the only one who can answer this in the specific but do you understand what i am getting at life is relative or so it seems part of this amiguity resulting from so many different perspectives might be a result of the fact that i am under the assumption that there are some capital t truths out there because i am searching for it i feel out of sorts if i don't find it i don't know but nietzsche might be relevant ideas education in a narrow sense increases your chances of leading a fulfilled life in a broad sense it exposes you to the realities and paradoxes of life i understand your quandary as i have been there myself sometimes i feel that there is only one person that feels and thinks the way that i do and that is a very lonely thing however it is true i am a unique person shaped not only by what i know but by the relationships that i have formed and my upbringing and social background you are the same if you will excuse the paradox in that you too are unique and shaped by your experiences and not just your intellect i too have many perspectives on my world but they are tied together by the realisation that my education and the knowledge i own are not what shapes me i have found a degree of happiness in cultivating good quality relationships friends and family work colleagues etc i have come to realise that they also have multiple perspectives and that wherever i am and whoever i am with life is rich in challenge and reward just be in the present see beauty and appreciate kindness you won't go far wrong Epistemology Friedrich Schleiermacher Meaning of life Deconstruction God Law of value Happiness Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Religion Postmodernism Scientific method Intelligent design Cultural relativism Ethics Summa Theologiae Determinism Strategic management Objectivist philosophy Current teachings of Prem Rawat Aristotle God Emperor of Dune Theory of conduct Noam Chomsky Jiddu Krishnamurti Microeconomics Logic Philosophy Theodicy Social psychology Philosophy of science Truth Species Ken Wilber A Course In Miracles Phaedo Franz Boas Free will Altruism Rudolf Hermann Lotze Many-worlds interpretation Causality Infantilism Second language acquisition EPR paradox Modernism Frankfurt School Problem of universals Rudolf Steiner Simone Weil Economics Philosophical skepticism David Hume Coercion Creationism Bell's theorem Science Al-Ghazali Theory Prices of production Fundamentalism Prisoner's dilemma Faster-than-light Sexual orientation Sapir-Whorf hypothesis Max Stirner Universal pragmatics S__ren Kierkegaard The nature of God in Western theology Falsifiability Intelligence (trait) Physical paradox Sociocultural evolution Ontological argument Tonality Supernatural Labor theory of value Traumatic incident reduction Education Model (economics) Speed of light Friedrich Nietzsche Soul Critique of Pure Reason Michel Henry Capitalism Buddhism Contract Black hole Multiverse Psychoanalysis
