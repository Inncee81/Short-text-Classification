who do you love more yourself or your children do you think love your children basicly is loving yourself since they are your life extention i do more for my children than i do for myself but i also know that without me my children would have a difficult life to face i know this because i lost my husband their daddy years ago and although he was very sick for a long time and expected it was still a loss i had to bring them up through their crucial teen years so i learned the hard way that i had to take care of myself first to take care of them a year and a half ago i was in the hospital and my middle son completely freaked out when he saw me lying their after surgery my fiance' reminded him i was still coming out of the anesthesia but he ran out crying the next day i was much better and when he hugged me he had a hard time letting go so it's important to love yourself and take care of you so you can be there for your kids and take care of them better About a Boy Infantilism Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Anesthesia Miss Saigon Sin City General practitioner Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Le Malade imaginaire Grief Melanie Wilkes The Amber Spyglass Time Out of Mind One Life to Live Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Flash (comics) Medicine The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Hearing impairment Breastfeeding Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Characters of Lost Traumatic brain injury Laura Schlessinger Pitaten Son Goku (Dragon Ball) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Stomach cancer The Jazz Singer Sant Thakar Singh Marilyn Monroe Stroke Shaggy dog story The Care Bears (television series) Billboard Hot 100 Days of our Lives Hospital Care Bears Stillbirth Hollyoaks Prostate cancer Gosei Sentai Dairanger Transsexuality The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask characters Physician Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Ultimate Muscle The Elephant Man (film) YuYu Hakusho Kodocha Supporting Characters (Xenogears) Nurse Maury Arjuna Hillary Rodham Clinton Friends Emergency Medical Services Mail-order bride Urinary incontinence Haven (TNG episode) History of intersex surgery Niddah Hank Williams Motivation The Critic Muslim ibn Aqeel Situation comedy Wolfrider Poker jargon Soap opera Gia Carangi EastEnders Leo Wyatt Humphrey Bogart Pat Evans General anaesthesia Lie Justice (TNG episode) Teen Titans (animated series) Polyamory John the Baptist Ken Jennings Love Hip hop collaborations Tekken characters Blankets (graphic novel) Luke and Laura Spencer Into the West (miniseries) Child sexuality Cardcaptor Sakura Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Cephalic disorder Triage Everwood Church of Christ, Scientist Freddy Fender Social rule Maison Ikkoku Sant Baljit Singh
