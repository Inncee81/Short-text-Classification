is order a subset of randomness here's an example suppose that you have an mp playlist alphabetically ordered but you prefer to listen to it in a random order you turn on the shuffle but the songs still play in a perfectly alphabetical order unlikely yes but definitely possible would that indicate that order is just a subset of chaos while i agree that there's an element of subjectivity when using the terms order and random the actual rules for very well defined an alphabetical order is quite precise and isn't a matter of one's whim anything which isn't in alphabetical order isn't ordered so chaos cannot be a subset of order it is consistency that differentiates order from chaos as the above answer says any sequence could be some order if we choose to define it that way but it won't be order unless it can be repetitively consistent repetition is an essential part of judging consistency which therefore means strength of probability differentiates between random and order to put into order is to enhance probability of the desired consistency does that make order a subset of chaos in my view no it is chaos put into a bind to lose its randomness in order to tilt probability towards a defined consistency what an awesome thought provoking question Randomness Dynamical system Function (mathematics) Stochastic process Probability Poker jargon Random variable Mathematics Quantum logic Determinism Lebesgue integration Reverse mathematics Theory of conduct Manifold Bayesian probability Distribution (mathematics) Naive set theory G__del's incompleteness theorem Entropy On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Password Forcing (mathematics) IP (complexity) Meaning of life Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Intelligent design Non-standard analysis Infinity Fischer Random Chess Clifford algebra Countable set Alignment (role-playing games) Coercion Occam's Razor Standard deviation Real number Voting system Expert system Binomial type Axiomatic set theory Quicksort Causality One-time pad Information entropy Epistemology Topology glossary Formal power series Set Writing system English grammar Infinite monkey theorem Monty Hall problem Sampling (statistics) Serialism Series (mathematics) Hangul Optimization (mathematics) Originalism Collation Philosophy of mathematics Sheaf (mathematics) Negative binomial distribution International Phonetic Alphabet Sexual orientation Card game Halting problem Hyperreal number Specified complexity M-209 Cardinal number Abortion debate Goodness and value theory Margin of error Diablo II Glossary of graph theory Canadian House of Commons ELO rating system Normal distribution Probability theory PP (complexity) Deconstruction Magic (paranormal) Prolog Domain theory XML Cult Abstract interpretation PaX Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game Quantum mechanics Blackjack
