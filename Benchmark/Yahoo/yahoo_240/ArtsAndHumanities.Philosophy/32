is mathematics dangerous ethically isn't it too easy to make a person a number to lay them off to write them off as casualties ect it just seems so dangerous look at the nazis they loved math and logic hmm im very wary of this worship of math we have in our society remember atlantis i debate the value of to me it is ownership mathematics devalues everything that it comes in contact with that includes medicine ect i agree with dryheatdave but how about a surprise mathematics could be the savior of ethics give me minutes i'll elaborate ethical reasoning requires the consideration of values if we represent the values numerically we can use standard mathematical operations to manipulate them and hopefully produce an answer which we can use to guide our actions an example i am considering committing an illegal act i know that i can perform this act the problem is how to handle the uncertainty as to whether i'll get caught by the police and punished i consider that there are three possible outcomes assuming that i decide to do this act outcome i perform the act and do not get caught by the police outcome i perform the act get caught by the police and get found guilty and punished by the courts outcome i perform the act get caught by the police but get found not guilty by the courts the other alternative is that i choose inaction outcome the situation is modelled by this tree http www mypicshare com rh jddhpic html the tree consists of nodes and links a node represents a situation and a link indicates which situations can follow from which previous situations the triangular nodes called payoff nodes represent outcomes and are numbered as above the square node at the top the root node r represents my position it is square because it represents a choice i can make it is a decision node i can choose to do the act and go down the path to a or i can choose inaction and go down the other the circular nodes represent situations which are resolved by chance and are called chance nodes chance node a represents the situation in which i choose to do the action it leads to node where i get away with it and to node c where i get caught the number by a link from a chance node indicates the estimated probability of that link being followed given that we are already in the position above for example it only makes sense to talk about the probability that i get caught in the case where i do choose to do the action i don't get to position a until i've decided to act and nodes and can only be reached from c they can't try me if they don't catch me the next step is to estimate the value for each situation represented by a payoff node when estimating we must consider intensity duration and extent of the interests involved as compared to a baseline usually inaction basically everything except certainty i consider that if i choose not to do the act then everything continues as before inaction has the value i consider the value of my action ignoring any cost to me to be the value of being tried as due to the inconvenience etc and the value of being tried found guilty and punished as this gives the payoff values node node node node we can now calculate the tree value and from this learn which branch i should pick i could in a larger analysis have many other branches links from the root node indicating things i could choose to do instead of the particular act that i'm thinking of i would then choose the node with the highest value the values are calculated from the bottom up a decision node has the largest of the values of the nodes that follow from it it is assumed we always choose to do what we think is most valuable a chance node has an expected value which is sum of the values of its sub nodes multiplied by their respective probabilities in this example the expected value of c is the probability of reaching node the value of node the probability of reaching node the value of node the expected value of a can now be calculated as the probability of reaching node the value of node the probability of reaching node c the value of node c the next node up being a decision node its value is simply the largest of node a and node max since the expected value for node a is higher than that for node and a represents what happens when i do this action the tree therefore indicates that i should do the action in preference to not doing it if i could create a tree for a different course of action which when using the same scale returns a value greater than then obviously i ought do that instead Extensive form game
