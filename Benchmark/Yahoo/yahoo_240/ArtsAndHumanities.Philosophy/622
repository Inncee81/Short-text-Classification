how would you define beauty beauty is so subjective it's tough to say what it is without saying just what it is to me beauty in terms of physical beauty is kind of hard to describe in words just something so amazing and pleasing to look at there are different kinds of beauty like the beauty of a young child innocent and cute to the beauty of a very attractive woman or man to the beauty of nature and just being awed by the amazing things like sunsets or oceanic views or mountains in the distance in terms of people i think that inner beauty personality and the person as a whole can really add to or detract from a person's beauty i've known plenty of girls that i thought were kind of cute or didn't really notice at all but after getting to know them and finding them to have great personalities clever wit intelligence found them to be incredibly attractive and it seems like they became more physically attractive Beauty Physical attractiveness Cuteness The Amber Spyglass Pedophilia Otaku Love Sexual orientation Child sexual abuse Anime Kawaii Mo__ Trinity Theory of conduct The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Mathematics Abortion debate Property (ownership right) Woman Human Diamond Joke Beauty and the Beast (1991 film) Maison Ikkoku Romulus and Remus God Emperor of Dune Gender The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Bish__jo game Goodness and value theory Agnosticism Mary, the mother of Jesus K' Homosexuality in Japan Justification (theology) Political correctness Arthur Cayley Mary Sue Aesthetic Realism Science Francis Hutcheson (philosopher) Gay Computer Nicomachean Ethics General relativity Supernatural Evil Lewis Carroll Current teachings of Prem Rawat A Course In Miracles Sexual attraction Homophobia Sin Humphrey Bogart Troll Religious conversion Simone Weil German grammar Pok__mon Ruby and Sapphire Toad Patrol Okashina Okashi Shit Rape Charles Goodyear Rudolf Hermann Lotze Mojave people Anne Boleyn American Psycho Gender role Leviathan (book) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Stock character Transgender Infinity Infantilism Urusei Yatsura Theology Pitaten Mercury Atlas 6 Friends Sunset Boulevard (1950 film) The Pilgrim's Progress Drama Make money fast Milton H.
