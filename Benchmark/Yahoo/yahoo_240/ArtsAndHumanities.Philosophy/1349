is there anything noble about pain lately i've been going through a lot of internal emotional pain i'm only so it' probably based on coming to terms with the adult world etc but i feel this pain much harder than most people it seems i let myself open to feel the real pain of tragedies even if they don't directly effect me do you think that the pain we experience in life has any value is there anything noble in our pain will we ever look back on our lives and be glad that we experienced any of the pain we feel i think everything we experience in life has a value because if we don't experience these things now we won't grow and learn to understand things in our life or learn from things such as our mistakes i think pain is something that's noble its something we all feel at the end of the day it all depends on how we react to that pain and what we learn from experiencing such emotions and feelings Transactional analysis Drama Happiness Traumatic incident reduction Alexander Technique Dualism (philosophy of mind) Jon Secada Prostate cancer Gate control theory of pain Pain Pratitya-samutpada Empathy The nature of God in Western theology Narcissism Social psychology Transsexuality Current teachings of Prem Rawat Diving The Amber Spyglass One Tree Hill (TV series) Year of the Spider Motivation A Course In Miracles Karen Horney Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Ty Cobb Emo Artificial consciousness Grief Nicomachean Ethics Human Religion Kender Simone Weil Polyamory Milton H.
