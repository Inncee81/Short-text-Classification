what does this quote mean please help me undersatnd what we are reluctant to touch often seems the very fabric of our salvation hyperreality existence is process and life is growth in other words things are always changing but changing from what to what and why here lies the key to your question change always involves some level of risk some contact with the unknown from an experiential point of view change is never completely comfortable and frequently involves some form of pain thus even those who are adventurous and love change must still overcome some level of fear we need change in order to exist and grow but we can't help but experience some level of fear and discomfort in the process growth is the very fabric of our salvation and what we are most reluctant to touch is often the very thing that we most need in order to grow i believe that the psyche has a sort of growth instinct just as our physical bodies move us to seek out the nutrients etc and just as our physical bodies know how to heal most wounds our psyches seek out the sorts of mental spiritual experiences needed for a life of meaning and various psychological self healing processes try to lead us toward wholeness the ego is constantly fearing its own destruction but deeper down the psyche knows that the ego's well being is not the primary concern in fact life wants us to ultimately confront the ego's inherently impermanent nature so from the standpoint of the everyday ego it seems that life is always confronting us our egos with challenges painful lessons and just in general giving us a hard time the ego ultimately most fears what will make our lives most whole and meaningful because the process of attaining holism and meaning is a process of ego transformation which from the ego's perspective is essentially a process of ego destruction so we find that what evokes the strongest emotional reaction within us including those emotions that make us the most uncomfortable are signs of life trying to lead us toward growth and meaning we try to grab hold of pleasure permanence and cling to it but life won't allow this in the long run because real meaning and health go deeper than the ego can see in most cases when we feel the need to run away from something or push it away most violently what's really going on is that life is trying to pull us kicking and screaming into our most meaningful future one important note the implication of what i'm saying is not that we should willy nilly embrace everything we fear or hate with full open arms if you feel a strong desire to kill someone and you fear this desire the solution is not to simply embrace your desire and go kill someone but the solution is also not to ignore or deny the impulse the impulse is telling you something important what life wants you to do is explore your desires and impulses mindfully observe them and learn from them the more powerfully you fear something or hate something or love something etc the more important it is for you to look at these emotions and figure out what life is really trying to tell you Simone Weil Narcissism Soul Transactional analysis Modernism Sadism and masochism Force (Star Wars) Friedrich Schleiermacher Aikido Meaning of life Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Stoicism Sri Aurobindo Human Karen Horney Buddhism Sigmund Freud Psychology Scientology beliefs and practices Martial art Free will Transsexuality Goodness and value theory Psychoanalysis Emotion Anthroposophy Hulk (comics) Art Traumatic incident reduction Social psychology S__ren Kierkegaard Domestic violence Religion Darth Vader Milton H.
