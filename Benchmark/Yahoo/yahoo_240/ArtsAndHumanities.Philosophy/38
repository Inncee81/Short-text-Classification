do you still flirt even when you're already committed if what makes you do that well just because i truly am infatuated with my lover doesn't mean i can't still be a social person does it i mean some people are so hawt they ought to be flirted with there is no point in denying yourself that fun true however that a line needs to be drawn between causing emotional pain and having a bit of fun further since i enjoy flirting i have noticed that periodically people respond by flirting back i submit to you that this is harmless and i generally set up some rules for example i usually disclose quite quickly my intentions and limitations and this is an important consideration now i also firmly believe that our current social model of monogamy is seriously under attack i challenge it on the basis that it doesn't work around half of all marriages end in divorce and many of these by reason of infidelity too much emphasis is placed on monogamy and too high an expectation is forced upon couples to maintain it i can say that it is seriously under attack by reference to what young people are doing they are hooking up and do not have a g f or b f but instead have convenient arrangements and agreements of various forms involving intercourse or not i see this social development occuring in my own teenage children's generation of friends it is now widespread and it is we who are out of touch if we do not think polygamy is the next generation's lifestyle they dont want marriage and they don't want children fancy that and i think i am a flirt Marriage Polyamory Polygamy Human sexual behavior Social rule Anne Boleyn Same-sex marriage Human sexuality Lawrence v.
