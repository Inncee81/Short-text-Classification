why can life be so boring hi richard life has many stages when we are very young it is curiosity that keeps us going and anxious for new presents sights and family love a little older in puberty we look another way curiosity turns into wonder we wonder what it would be like to anything admiration for those you recognise as your superiors you envy them and want to make the grade as they did in adolescence curiosity turns into conquest we want to conquer everything physically in sports high grades in classrooms and admiration from everyone close or far away adolescence turns into immature manhood when you think you know everything and wish to try everything this is the most dangerous stage since you will always find someone who will drag you into temptation and tempted you will be unknowingly or not you will do both right and wrong righteous acts will be rewarded with praise wrongdoing will be chastised and punished accordingly by this time you will know enough to trace your own destiny for you are now a grown up man and from the tone of your questions i can sense that you will make the grade at times it may not seem easy since the principle of trial and error is no longer valid and you must get it correct first time now that you know wisdom from folly you will succeed source i am and still have a few candles to burn boring at times but never without hope and this keeps me going for it is the best antidote for boredom Appeal Religion Narcissism Adolescence Duties of the Heart Second language acquisition Maimonides Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Buddhism John Howard Yoder William Shakespeare Puberty Child sexuality Merit Pederasty John Wycliffe Original sin Love Theodicy Four Quartets Humphrey Bogart Cultural and historical background of Jesus Charles Grandison Finney Supernatural Socrates Christian eschatology Zhao Yun Kender Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Joseph (Hebrew Bible) Hide and Q (TNG episode) Jewish principles of faith Sola fide Hell Homosexuality Free will Peter Cook Richard Rahl Alexander Technique Pedophilia Seventeen-article constitution Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus The Brothers Karamazov Philo The Once and Future King Irony Karma in Hinduism Suicide Salvation Debugging Monomyth Simone Weil The Dunciad Tosca Education in the United States Heretics of Dune Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Bertrand Russell Fallacy Soul Starfleet ranks and insignia Coming of age Creation-evolution controversy Goodness and value theory Motivation Colley Cibber Johann Strauss II Sin Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Israel ben Eliezer Immortality 613 mitzvot The Giver Prostate cancer Abrahamic religion W.I.T.C.H.
