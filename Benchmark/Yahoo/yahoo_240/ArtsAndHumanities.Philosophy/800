love or money i would personally pick love but i'm curious to see what others think this question is great because it separates answers into two camps those who are hopeless romantics and those who are uttely rational if you pick love you are playing to the emotional side of being human the pathos as rhetoricians call it if you pick money you are picking the logical side of being human the logos as rhetoricians would call it those who pick love would argue that the others who pick money are selfish heartless and miss out on the 'true' nature of being a person those who pick money would say that the others who pick love are blind because they do not realize that money can and has actually bought love simply see one of the earlier answers where a young lady says she would marry for money and then make it love for me i can simply say i'm married and broke and wouldn't change a thing Objectivist philosophy Human Soul Meaning of life Altruism Theodicy Gorgias Simone Weil Rhetoric Alignment (role-playing games) Game show Evil S__ren Kierkegaard A Course In Miracles Epistemology Expert system Summa Theologiae Ad hominem Goodness and value theory Wheel of Fortune Economics Numerology Babylon 5 Atheism Family Feud Ethics Friedrich Schleiermacher Eastern Orthodox Church Abortion debate Immanuel Kant Philosophy of language Dialectic Existence of God Happiness Sexual orientation Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Coercion Donald Davidson (philosopher) Bernard Williams John Howard Yoder Calvin and Hobbes Existence Jiddu Krishnamurti Jon Secada Patriotism One Tree Hill (TV series) Faith and rationality $ale of the Century Urantia Saved by the Bell Nicomachean Ethics Trinity Zhao Yun Anarchism and capitalism Friends Fallacy Metaphysics Victor Cousin Bayesian inference Stoicism Scientific method David Hume Problem of evil Monty Hall problem Utilitarianism Deconstruction Motivation G__del's incompleteness theorem Neighbours Critique of Pure Reason Sin Logic Poker jargon Religion Creationism Billboard Hot 100 Charles Dickens Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Philosophy The Human Stain Moral objectivism Reincarnation Phaedo Gary Snyder The McGuire Sisters Lincoln-Douglas Debate Two Treatises of Government Intelligent design Moral relativism Betting (poker) Incarnations of Immortality God Lojban Sant Thakar Singh Beauty and the Beast (1991 film) Kitsch Jewish principles of faith Species Pedophilia
