do you believe that the brighter your light shines the darker your darkness grows this question relates to jungian philosophy okay geebob this would make sense to me in the sense that if you are concentrating so much on finding your light and showing it to the world then you are likely suppressing or repressing whatever darkness you have and in the process because you are not dealing with the darkness it ends up festering until eventually it overshadows the light is this what you meant ultimately i believe we are all capable of evil ie we all have a dark side some darker in others but we are also capable of extreme good it seems to me that in order to avoid having our goodness overshadowed by our dark sides we should acknowledge and try to understand and deal with our flaws evil thoughts desires etc we must be self aware balanced individuals if we are to live healthily somehow though i doubt very much that this statement is an absolute different people have different capacities for both goodness and evil i suppose whether or not one believes in god also has much to do with the validity of this statement or maybe i've completely taken this idea out of context Goodness and value theory Atheism Force (Star Wars) Logic Epistemology Predestination Carl Jung Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Evil Summa Theologiae Theodicy Scientology beliefs and practices Yin and yang The nature of God in Western theology Philosophy of mathematics Religion Legacy of Kain Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Phaedo Reality Ontological argument Gnosticism Human nature Supernatural Conscience Ekadasi Existence of God Theology Simone Weil Leviathan (book) Meaning Darth Vader Alignment (role-playing games) Satanism Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Causality Scientific method Theory of conduct Existentialism Contract Sigmund Freud Determinism Extreme Programming Jiddu Krishnamurti Nihilism Ethics Political economy Objectivist philosophy Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Meaning of life David Hume Reincarnation Immortality Artificial consciousness Religious pluralism Philosophy of language Justification (theology) Free will Rudolf Steiner Philo Angel Infinity Nicomachean Ethics G__del's incompleteness theorem Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Fundamentalism Islam Socrates Rudolf Hermann Lotze Psychology of religion Philosophical skepticism Postmodernism Past teachings of Prem Rawat Friedrich Schleiermacher Animism Transsexuality Karen Horney Art Aesthetic Realism Civil rights Young Earth creationism Neopaganism God Confucius Deconstruction Nontrinitarianism Confucianism Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel Al-Ghazali Book of Revelation State Philosophy of science Postmodernity Teller-Ulam design Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an
