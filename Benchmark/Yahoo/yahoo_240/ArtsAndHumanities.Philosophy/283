is the journey more important than the destination i think of people on rafts leaving haiti to gain refugee status in the united states is their journey more important than their destination i think of people put on trains to concentration camps is their journey important at all more than less than the camps i think of people sold to others sent shackled in ships to foreign lands and i think of hour plane flights to places like africa and to asia and how i hate those flights and i know without a doubt that my destination is was far more important but sailcat i think of the other meaning the one behind your words is the process more important than the product is the act of creating more important than the creation is any working hard and joyfully at something more important than the result of that work and i ask myself is the act of operating more important than saving the life of another was painting the mona lisa more important than the painting is any act of giving struggling for a cause dying for a belief more important than the salvation of the people or the faith itself it's a wow tough question for sure and i can only conclude that no matter which is more important enjoy the process live in the process because the journey is real and the destination the product if reached until reached is only a consummation devoutly to be wished Salvation Refugee Current teachings of Prem Rawat Justification (theology) Origin belief Karl Marx Origen Sola fide Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Heaven Abraham Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Divine grace Confucius Leonardo da Vinci Religious pluralism Arab-Israeli conflict Hong Kong International Airport Paul of Tarsus Wealth Indulgence Irish Guards Salvation Army Paris Theory of conduct USS Waters (DD-115) Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II Christopher Columbus Theosis Creationism Religion United Airlines Flight 93 Slavery A Course In Miracles Trinity Characters of Lost Young Earth creationism Roman Catholic Church Al-Ghazali Gospel of Thomas Buddhism Acts of the Apostles Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Christian eschatology Voodoo Baptism Merit Right of return Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial Decolonization Eastern Orthodox Church Creation according to Genesis Ibn Battuta 2004 Haiti rebellion Foreign relations of the Republic of China Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity USS Albemarle (AV-5) Sheikh Abdullah Summa Theologiae Northwest Airlines USS America (CV-66) Resurrection of Jesus Meaning of life Predestination Shannon Airport The nature of God in Western theology Phaedo Jacob Hyperinflation Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses USS Jacob Jones (DD-130) Holocaust denial Government of India Act 1935 Palestinian exodus Faith in Buddhism Supernatural General aviation Night (book) Epistemology British Airways Cultural Revolution Palestine Liberation Organization USS Wasp (CV-18) The Holocaust Theodore Beza Altruism USS Saratoga (CV-3) Sri Aurobindo Apple Macintosh USS Atlanta (CL-51) Evolutionary creationism Air Canada USS Ammen (DD-527) Equal Protection Clause Chosen people History of Israel USS Wickes (DD-578) Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Political economy USS Alamo
