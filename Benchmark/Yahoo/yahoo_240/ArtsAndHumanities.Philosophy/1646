among the words good better and best why does better seem to have a bad connotation like when someone said to himself i am better than you but not as bad as i am the best or i can do better seem to be worse than i did my best why when it's all but a middleground maybe that is just your feeling about better for i think good in itself is just that you are good at what you do you are a good friend i am the best is usually an earned expression either someone has told you or by your own self confidence in that which you have learned you feel you are the best and when expressed in the proper way either as i am the best or in your performance being the best is accepted by most people as the truth as for better even he who is the best will tell you that he can do better and usually does your teacher might say you can do better to get you to try and reach higher in learning however i don't feel that better it is a bad connotation if i am interviewing you and i ask you what you feel about your job performance and you tell me you are the very best then i might think this person has no room for growth and thus put you in another pile actually have you ever taken a poll after talking to a customer service rep and you say that person was excellent they actually count that down for they understand that everyone can do better and that is the whole purpose of incentives and motivation its not the middle ground its always striving and excelling higher by doing just a bit more better each time Social rule Theory of conduct Unemployment Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Nicomachean Ethics 1957 World Series Shit Mojave people Equine conformation Milton H.
