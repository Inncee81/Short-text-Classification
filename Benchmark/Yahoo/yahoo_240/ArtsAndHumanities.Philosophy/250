do you think anyone is really happy in life i mean i look back at the times i thought i was happy and turns out i was mistaken i think that we as humans do not know how to be truely happy we always want more and more so it never stops anyone else feel this way i can't really understand what you mean i've answered a question like this before and the first thougt is that it seems like a such a modern question to wonder about being happy and how that would have such an effect on the rest of you life i think the reason that it is such a modern question is because at least in the industrail type countries we don't have to worry to much about our health and yes i alread know a little about sicko but that's not completely what i'm saying most people don't die from childbirth or you don't hear about that happing and being able to get from one part of the country well here in the states is realtivily easy as opposed to about hundered years ago because making a trip forty or less miles you it might have took a few days to travel that far but now it doesn't take that long to go that far so even if you get sick or something like that you might have to pay for things like that but chances are you're going to live so now the problems are no longer so much intersted of such things like that it doesn't matter i remember that people would say things like well at least we still have our health and yes health is important but it seems like it's an old saying from way back in the day so does being happy really matter and what is happienes it could mean anything to anybody it's so subjective that's it's weird people are in search for it everywhere like it's the holy grail i think that in a healthy human being being happy is possible but not to the point we're it seems like you're on some drug or other i think it is possible but at the same time you have to take the sad times to really know how good it feels to be happy kind of like having a flu it's a bit hummility and a bit of reason to be happy that you still have you're health something that we forget about easily in the modern age Theory of conduct Nicomachean Ethics Social rule Abortion debate Goodness and value theory David Hume Time Out of Mind Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Piccolo Junior Saga Philosophical skepticism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Ashlee Simpson Show Utilitarianism Jon Secada Theodicy Rich Mullins U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Socrates Simone Weil Pitaten Samuel Goldwyn Health insurance Avenue Q Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Past teachings of Prem Rawat Negima Sexual orientation The nature of God in Western theology Philosophy of language Parsifal Prostate cancer Stomach cancer Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Ethics Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Cultural relativism Current teachings of Prem Rawat The Amber Spyglass Immortality Le Malade imaginaire Incarnations of Immortality Hey Jude Shaggy dog story Spanish flu Sydney Riot of 1879 Haven (TNG episode) Computer numbering formats Science Influenza Rent (musical) Transactional analysis Infantilism Food and Drug Administration Year of the Spider Epistemology Breastfeeding Ontological argument Sant Thakar Singh Gross domestic product Meaning of life 2000 Australian Grand Prix Infant baptism Philosophical Investigations The Star Wars Holiday Special Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Milton H.
