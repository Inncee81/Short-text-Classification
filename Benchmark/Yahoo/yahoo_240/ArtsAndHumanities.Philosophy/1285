could you choose your own dream before going to sleep will this happen the only way i know of being able to choose your dream is when we lucid dream this means that while we are asleep and dreaming we are aware of the dream and are able to make conscious decisions movements i tend to have lucid dreams during the early stages of sleep or just before i wake up there are some theories around that if you concentrate on the subject you wish to dream about before going to sleep then the subject will occupy your dreams however this never works for me i tend to agree with the theory that dreams are one of the ways your sub conscious deals with the nagging thoughts ideas issues etc that get pushed to the back of our minds during the normal course of our days Dream Lucid dreaming Out-of-body experience Consciousness Sleep Hypnosis Carl Jung Unconscious mind Sigmund Freud Philosophy of mind Electroencephalography Reality Narcolepsy Psychoanalysis Existentialism Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Mind Hypnagogia Animism Oneiromancy Sleep paralysis Edgar Cayce Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel Free will Theory of mind Art Artificial consciousness Psychology of religion Therion (band) Self-harm Philosophy of perception Turiya Soul Social psychology Sleep disorder Thomism Insomnia Gestalt therapy Mental image Dream (DC Comics) Rapid eye movement The Fourth Way Astral projection Philosophy of language Carlos Castaneda Children of Dune Milton H.
