what is love arent we just mistaking feelings with each other isnt it just some kind of imagination love is the emotion associated with the awareness that one's own interests and the interests of another are congruent in other words i feel love when i realize that i so strongly identify with another person that when that other person feels joy i too feel joy and when that other person feels sorrow i too feel sorrow that identification of interests is based on shared values love's power is in its ability to allow us to increase the happiness we experience not only am i happy when good things happen to me i am happy when good things happen to those i love the more people i love the more happiness i can experience it also gives me a vested interest in helping others who share my values experience happiness this view of love is consistent with a benevolent sense of life that there is more joy than sorrow in the world and with an appreciation for the marketplace where all are free to exchange lesser values for greater ones thus increasing everyone's happiness Happiness Altruism Human Patriotism A Course In Miracles Past teachings of Prem Rawat Objectivist philosophy Theory of conduct Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Microeconomics Theodicy Love Current teachings of Prem Rawat Empathy Michel Henry Storytelling Simone Weil Coercion Nicomachean Ethics Anthroposophy Transactional analysis Culture Asperger syndrome Gratitude One Tree Hill (TV series) Autism Pitaten Utilitarianism Jon Secada Polyamory Dead Like Me Deaf culture Rudolf Steiner David Hume Sheikh Abdullah Johann Wolfgang von Goethe Alignment (role-playing games) Sin Summa Theologiae Transsexuality Economic inequality Israel ben Eliezer Bhajan Francis Hutcheson (philosopher) Friends of the Western Buddhist Order Buddhist philosophy Miss Saigon Narcissism Bernard Williams Traumatic incident reduction Eastern Orthodox Church Artificial consciousness Religion Therianthropy Carl Jung Ethics Angel (vampire) Care Bears Mathematics S__ren Kierkegaard Anarchism and capitalism Guru W.I.T.C.H.
