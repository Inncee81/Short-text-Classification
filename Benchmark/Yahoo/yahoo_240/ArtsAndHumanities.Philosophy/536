i want to live out my purpose hi i'm rachael and i'm and i was just thinking about all the time in my past that i should've spent differently and have decided that i am going to change ps i know this is going to sound cheesy to you but that's okay read on i feel a change within my soul i'm excited to jump and fall because from each and every fall i will learn something new and that is exciting in itself i want to be touched deep within my spirit and touch others as well i wish to take no one or thing for granted i want to look to the lord i want to stand an gaze at his wonders fall into the stars rapt in awe i'm deciding right now to do my absolute best in all circumstances i am the only thing i have to make me step forward i choose not to whittle my life away i don't know my purpose but i plan to put myself in the best place so that i may live it out so please say something make my head spin my soul dance my imagination laugh and we will live it out just say whatever comes to mind i'd love to hear it good for you go ahead and live out this new revelation of yours and leave our tortured questioning souls to the wind in which you're own will dance broaden your newly optimistic mind and don't let our ugly pessimistic thoughts and comments let yours spin downward laugh at our negativity and realistic views on life but we're all in it together so you're right we will live it out Milton H.
