an aquarius and an aries what do i do i'm an aquarius and this guy i was with for three months was an aries i know we were a good match but we really cared for each other and i came back home to a different state for a little while and had plans to come back and even though he was sad to see me go and was telling me i better come back he then told me the other day he wasn't ready to live with me anymore or have anything serious that he couldn't handle it right now he wouldn't answer my calls then sent a me a text the other night saying he was thinking about me and he'd call me tomorrow but then he never called and hasn't answered my calls or responded to my texts i really think we are a good couple how can i get my aries to give me a chance to prove that and at least talk to me what is wrong with him he always complained that i never showed any emotion i'm an aquarius as well we have the tendency to come off as being cold or detached when in reality we are affectionate and have feelings for that person i don't know why but it is true maybe you don't show your emotions that well and he probably wishes you did that make sure this guy really has feelings for you because if you are so into him i don't understand why he is reacting this way maybe he's afraid to lose you again give him some time and space and he will come around good luck Social rule Friends Jon Secada The Ashlee Simpson Show One Tree Hill (TV series) Theory of conduct Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Time Out of Mind Humphrey Bogart Novel The nature of God in Western theology Theodicy Shaggy dog story Eddie Guerrero Kodocha Cliff Richard Ontological argument Athrun Zala Piccolo Junior Saga Plame affair Pok__mon Live!
