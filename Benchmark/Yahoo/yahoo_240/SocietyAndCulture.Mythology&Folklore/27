knot magick hey please write if you're trying to help knot magick i know what it is but what are the basics i can do candle word and color magick knot caught my attention but the thing i read in the book dosen't really answer questions if i untie a knot i used would the spell revert what if i wanted to re use that rope how does knot magick work i haven't used knot magick too much but you could find a lot of info online if you do a search when i used cords for magic i only used them for that one spell and usually didn't untie them or use them for anything else i've used cords in different ways for different types of spells for love spells i've knotted together two cords and wore them as a bracelet the meaning should be obvious i did a spell once where you tie a cord around your body where you are experiencing pain let the pain seep into to the cord and then untie it and throw it away colors are important just as in all magick you should know the meanings of colors already if you've been doing magick for a while but remember the way magick really works is by your intention it's not so much getting every little thing right as it is making it feel right for yourself you could make up your own magick and have it be even more effective Shoelaces Nunchaku Witchcraft Gerina Dunwich Magic (paranormal) Escapology Magick Quipu Theory of conduct Necktie Knot Wicca Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem RuneScape skills Rope Aleister Crowley Tzitzit Pentagram Sling (weapon) Naruto jutsu Grimoire A Course In Miracles Pain RuneScape weapons Shaggy dog story EastEnders Phoebe Halliwell Falconry Textile manufacturing terminology Textile manufacturing Knot theory Thelemapedia Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Chaos magic Magic (illusion) Philosophical Investigations Hey Jude Sex magic Tattva Arthur Machen House of Leaves Knots Landing Aikido Tefillin Newbie RuneScape quests Kender Argenteum Astrum Blood on the Tracks Out-of-body experience Wood Orc Climbing equipment Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Magic: The Gathering Negima Sheepshank Comanche Abracadabra Philosophical skepticism LaVeyan Satanism Singlish Tao Te Ching Some Enchanted Evening (Simpsons episode) Glossary of climbing terms Final Fantasy magic Avalanche DragonQuest Creationism Neuro-linguistic programming Enochian Mattress Hakama Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Paul Is Dead Milton H.
