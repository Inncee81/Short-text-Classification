is it illegal to build on top of a old cemetery at my college in minnesota there is a legend that has that part of one of the dorm buildings and a practice field were built on an old cemetery a girl is said to be seen hanging from a tree at night by the dorms i thought it was illegal to build on cemeteries am i wrong its illegal to build on cemetery if you don't move the graves so if there was a cemetery there then the graves have been removed and relocated its a very long complicated legal process that tends to take a few years to resolve thats why most of the time they just build around the cemetery instead of trying to build on it University of Massachusetts Amherst Dormitory University of Minnesota Trinity College (Connecticut) Burial Cemetery Florida Institute of Technology Cremation Yu-Gi-Oh!
