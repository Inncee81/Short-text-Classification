some questions about mermaids firstly yes i know they're not real so these questions will be practically impossible to answer but this is hypothetical just pretend they are ok if you've been paying enough attention in bio you'll know there are different groups of vertebrates two of these being mammals and fish which one would mermaids be fish because they have scales and can breath uinderwater i'm pretty sure they don't come up for air or mammals because their human like appearance indicates this they have a covering of hair on their uppper halfs or at least on their heads and they almost certainly 'suckle their young' as the female mermaids have breasts next are there freshwater and saltwater mermaids or do they just change depending on where they are like salmon also how do they reproduce i'm not asking these questions for any reason other than the fact that i am strangely fascinated by mermaids right now just give me your best shot at answering and i will be happy thanks i think they would live in lakes sometimes they do in harry potter and anyway i like the idea of a mermaid popping up from a river every once in a while i've seen mammals w scales armadillo and pangolin i've never seen or heard of a fish w breasts i've never seen a pic of a mermaid w gills since a mermaid has breasts we can assume she bears live young there are pics of mermen much less common than pics of mermaids probably because most seamen of yore were males we don't see pics of the mermaid's or merman's reproductive organs because in the age of mermaids and mermen it was considered unacceptable to display them in public therefore we don't know the mechanisms methods of reproduction but it would be reasonable to assume they effected insemination in the manner of mammals and live bearing fish therefore we can conclude that mermaids and mermen are mammals mermaids and mermen may have been anadromous like the salmon or there could have been both salt and fresh water species or there could have been both scenarios to my knowledge the is no historical references to support either situation one thing is certain they did inhabit both environments as pictorial evidence exists for both environments Mermaid Species Sockeye salmon Mammal Bird Salmon Fauna of Australia Fish Aquarium Cryptozoology Fish migration Chinook salmon Shark Breastfeeding Fishing Ecology Weekly World News Aquatic ape hypothesis Scientific method Human Biology Fish farming Breast Science Microeconomics Angling Atlantic salmon Orca Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Evolution Sexual reproduction Reproduction Whale Epistemology Color Parthenogenesis Marine aquarium Puberty Sexual attraction Aquaculture Biodiversity Inheritance (computer science) Ontological argument Theory of conduct Determinism Richard Owen Natural selection Largest organism Seabird Intelligent design Cetacea The Little Mermaid Noah's Ark Cancer Marine biology Extraterrestrial life Batoidea Normal distribution Life Philosophical skepticism Pink salmon Lamprey Water (molecule) Monogamy Elephant Trout Creationism Tlingit Philosophy of science Goodness and value theory Sociobiology Crocodilia Giant Panda Franz Boas Fishery Animal Mussel Expert system Rainbow trout Crocodile Drowning Sexual dimorphism Smelt Biology and sexual orientation Whaling Meaning of life Thermoregulation Dinosaur
