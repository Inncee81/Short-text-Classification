i am thinkin getting my guinea pig a cage mate i want to get my guinea pig peanut a friend he is bout months and i just got him bout a week ago i saw a guinea pig that was a male and was so cute and very heathly and hyper by the looks of it but the question i have is the guinea pig i want for peanut has read eyes and if not a white one i dont know if that is bad or not he is brown and white witrh red eyes i would also be scared that they would fight i really dotn wanna lose any animal so ya no i mean i love my piggy but when i go to school he will be alone for hours a day but other than that he is usally cuddled up with me or even cuddling with my bunny or what not but ya so please help me out the guinea pig i like is aslo one month younger will that affect it to my guinea pig that i have now has black eyes so i dont know his cage is already huge enough for piggies and the guinea pig i want is a male like him there not caged together i just put them on my lap together and what not and my cousin my guinea pigs cage so it's like feet total and conects to a playpen here's the thing my mom cant afford another cage firstly nothing is wrong with having red eyes one of my girls buttercup is golden and has deep red sort of eyes here is a picture http i photobucket com albums bb kwazy monkey buttercup jpg secondly please do not put your guinea pig with your rabbit even if it is only for short occasions rabbits have strong hind legs which when they jump go backwards if the guinea pig happened to be in the way it could seriously hurt the guinea pig http www rabbitsnrodents com guineapigs htm thirdly getting a guinea is a fantastic idea and even better is that peanut is young so you will have even more chance of them getting along when you get the new one you will have to quarintine him especially if he is brought from a pet store this needs to be done behind closed doors more information is on this site http www cavyspirit com sociallife htm neuter you just need to scroll down past the neuter information after you have quarintined the new guinea pig you can introduce them if you do this properly both guinea pigs should get along fine a nuetral place like a couch is essential get two people one holding one piggy the other holding the other guinea pig let both guinea pigs go and let them find each other in their own time it is highly unlikely that they will kill each other if blood is drawn seperate them and try the bathing technique to find this article you will have to scroll down the introductions page a bit http www cavyspirit com sociallife htm introductions i am not sure whether or not you made a c c cage or whether you brought the pet store cage if you did buy the pet store cage then you need to invest in a bigger cage because that cage was small for but it is going to be unacceptable for just keep that in mind i am sure that you know that guinea pig needs a sq ft cage and need a sq ft cage addition look i am really sorry but if you can not get another cage or a bigger cage then you can not get another guinea pig instead of doing peanut any good you will be making the whole situation worse by overcrowding the cage in the end it comes down to this bigger cage or no more guinea pigs addition pobrecita is correct in regards to rabbits carrying bordetella who knows maybe peanut has it now that they have been together i would like to add that males should get along fine if they are in a big cage and if introductions have been done properly good luck Domestic rabbit Hamster Garfield Peanuts Dog Happy Tree Friends Who Framed Roger Rabbit Animal testing Cat Professional wrestling match types Pig Shaggy dog story Invader Zim John Cage Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Pitaten Japanese tea ceremony Fancy rat HyperText Transfer Protocol Sin City Trapping Shark Pet skunk Unreal Hip hop rivalries Theory of conduct Taikyoku shogi Minor Harry Potter Beasts Animal rights Holes (book) Kodocha Bugs Bunny Kangaroo Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Equine conformation McMug Social rule Jon Secada Sea-Monkey Charlie Brown Characters of Naruto Tiny Toon Adventures Dairy Salad Fingers Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) The Legend of Zelda series enemies House Mouse Poker jargon Camp Lazlo KaBlam!
