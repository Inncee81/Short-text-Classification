hamster time one of my hamster is nd a half years old hes so weak and looks like his hair is thinning he can hardly run like before nd moves slowly i feel bad because i want to hold him but hes always sleeping until like at nite so i have to wake him up to spend time with him wen i put him in his running ball he doesnt run in it he sleeps in it should i just leave him alone untill he wakes up then i would hardly ever get time withhim because i sleep before he wakes up he is quite old and slowing down a lot which is normal i would try the ball only once a week and take him out if he doesnt run in it at this stage i would wake him up carefully with a treat so you can hold him and feed him treats he may also like apple juice or a flavored cool aid then put him back in his cage to let him sleep if he doesnt wake up easily then just leave him sleep keep his bed area really clean and make sure he can get his food and water easily he might not want to climb anymore prepare yourself for his death he might live quite a while yet but eventually it will happen he has had a good life with you so dont be too sad Hamster Pitaten Mattress Atomic Kitten Fast bowling Brewery Pok__mon Live!
