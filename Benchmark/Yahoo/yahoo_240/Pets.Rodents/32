i want a hamster but im unsure of which type i want only one hamster and i want a playful hamster so a dwarf is perfect but they like to be together so what about a syrian hamster they can be alone but dont play a lot and can get stuck in tubes which type should i get would a dwarf be alright alone erm syrians arent as bad as that lol they are playful but its up to you to tame them and make them playful you cant just buy it and expect it to be playful from my experience of a year and a half working in a pet shop syrians are more tolerant and will play more dwarf hamsters are extremely fast and either want to run away from you or will just lie in ur hand just be careful with dwarf hamsters if uv never had them before they are really fast and once they get out it's hard to get them back agen dwarf's can live alone but like you say they are best kept in pairs for company purposes good luck with your hamster buying Fast bowling Golden Hamster RuneScape quests Paintball Mouse-like hamster Poker jargon The Young Ones (TV series) Domestic rabbit Animal testing The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Violin Fruit tree propagation Red Dwarf characters Father Ted The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Computer RuneScape weapons Internet phenomenon 2000 Australian Grand Prix Luck Galaxy Angel Craps Melonpool Monster Rancher monsters Rugby union positions Pet store Pet Customs and etiquette of Japan Tire Social rule Hypoglycemia Extreme Programming Discus (fish) Kirby's Dream Land 2 Characters in the Smurfs Milky Way Sid Vicious Pitaten Main sequence Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Lie Table tennis Volleyball Pop Art: Pet Shop Boys - The Hits PlayStation 3 Cheating in poker Red Dwarf Internal ballistics Snake Internet slang Electronic amplifier AdventureQuest The Hampster Dance Little Britain Final Fantasy XI Falconry Varieties of Arabic The Ashlee Simpson Show Bulk vending Domestication Black Open cluster United Artists Dog Codename: Kids Next Door Arianne Dog training The Death Gate Cycle Theory of conduct Gandalf Health insurance Skateboarding trick Lightsaber combat Devil sticks The Hobbit (1977 film) MapleStory Meat Loaf $ale of the Century Manila Shannara creatures Wheat Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor RuneScape locations Science fiction on television Apple Meriones unguiculatus Situation comedy Computer and video game genres The Walt Disney Company Strap-on dildo Arnold Rimmer Neutrino Dwarves (Middle-earth) Neopets In The Groove (game) International cricket in 2005 Umpire (cricket)
