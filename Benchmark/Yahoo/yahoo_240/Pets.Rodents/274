i want to get hamsters and i want them have bbys what hamsters live in peace together the others are right if they are talking about syrians but dwarves are a whole different story they are social unlike syrians who need to be kept one per cage and a pair can live together quite comfortably also as a campbell dwarf breeder i know that they will not eat their young unless there is a good reason ie you touched the babies a baby has a defect inadequate cage space ect but a good reason is not because the male is in the cage males can usually be in the cage with the female d but depends totally on the female during the pregnancy the birth and helps with the raising of the pups he won't eat them but if you keep the male in the cage with the female she can become pregnant again right after giving birth which means as soon as the first pups are weaned she'll be having another litter and that is way too soon for her to be pregnant again as an experienced breeder i would suggest that you not breed your hamsters as you know nothing about them or breeding them do alot of research and be prepared to have a lot of cages if your hamsters don't have homes lined up you'll also want to know how to sex them if they are dwarves since they can live in the samec cage if you accidentally put a male in with three females chances are you're going to have three pregnant females all with pups on the way so i ask can you handle that Hamster Domestic rabbit Guinea pig Gray Wolf Breastfeeding Dog Nerpa House Mouse Pregnancy Ferret In vitro fertilisation Domestic goat Pet skunk Monogamy Gun dog Sexual reproduction Elephant Folic acid Fertility awareness Golden Hamster Red Fox Red Squirrel Shark Tigon Platypus Androgen insensitivity syndrome Satanic ritual abuse Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sea Otter Prenatal diagnosis Chicken Toxoplasmosis Oral contraceptive Friends Pack (canine) Sex assignment Kitten Childfree Boston Public Abortion Premature birth Antarctic Fur Seal Obstetrics Teenage pregnancy Clinical depression Postpartum depression Harp Seal Oral sex Animal testing Psoriasis Cattle Dobermann Fancy rat Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) John Cage EastEnders Kodocha Norman Borlaug Days of our Lives Equine conformation Tobacco smoking Bird Golden Retriever Gender Monster Rancher monsters Schizophrenia Koala Cat Mountain Gorilla Nuclear power Childbirth Infanticide Miscarriage Condom Cephalic disorder Birth control Apple Bee Cross-dressing Turner syndrome Earless seal Rabbit Manx (cat) Melanie Wilkes Liger Bicycle frame Charmed Sheep husbandry Animal Liberation Front Chinchilla Anencephaly Little Britain Knots Landing Gender identity Fur farming Honeybee
