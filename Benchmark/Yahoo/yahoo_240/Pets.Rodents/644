she bit me i have a rat casper she's about months old she's a cutie pants she's always been such a sweetheart and last night she bit me she has never did that before maybe a little nibble if i had just ate and and she could smell it on my hand but that's it i was on the phone and i stopped paying attention to her for a second and next thing i know i feel a bite on my foot it didn't draw blood it just pinched then i jumped and yelled a curse word and she backed away then came back and did it again i had a sock on then i put her back in her cage then put my hand in and she just sniffed my hand she didn't do anything was it maybe i wasn't giving her attention for that second and she was trying to get it because the other day i had her out i was saying something to my mother and stopped paying attention and she was standing up pulling on the chest area of my tank top just looking at me could that be it or was it maybe something else help me rats are extremely intelligent there could be a number of reasons your little casper bit you the most likely is she wanted attention she really wouldn't have any other means to get it except with the little nibble she did fyi rats can bite with a pressure of psi if she was being mean you wouldn't be wondering about it some might consider this a love bite and feel quite thrilled their rat thinks so well of them to not draw blood when they bite if this is new behavior from your little friend then make sure nothing has changed in her life check her well being make sure she hasn't gotten into anything that is hurting or can hurt her her attention getting routine may be a plea for help check her teeth and front paws for any injuries if she continues this behavior she may need a visit to the vet for a more thorough exam Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Garfield Milton H.
