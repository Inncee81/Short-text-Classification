roborovski dwarf hamster meeting another hamster i'm planning on getting a roborovski dwarf hamster in about a month so is my boyfriend we are both getting females so that they will be social together i've heard that this kind of hamster is very social i have a carrier for past rodents i've had that's been cleaned i'm hoping to bring my new friend over to meet my boyfriends roborovski hamster and hopefully they can become play mates is this a good idea will they fight if they're both females of the same species i expect a little comfrentation but will they get along or is this a bad idea to let them meet if they're introduced as babies and living together they should be ok if they're not living together they'll forget each other and just fight as they get older they'll be willing to fight to the death if you put them together they still may not live together but there's a high chance they will if they're babies still littermates are ideal for this as they don't need introducing even then it's been known for to kill the other so they either need to be together or apart no way house sorry hope this helps Hamster Mouse-like hamster The Ashlee Simpson Show Social rule Phoebe Halliwell Neighbours Elephant The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Knots Landing Boston Public Memento (film) Little Britain Psychokinesis Humphrey Bogart The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe AFI 100 Years series Twelve Monkeys Rodent Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Estrus cycle Kakapo Poker jargon Jon Secada Pet skunk The Hobbit The O.C.
