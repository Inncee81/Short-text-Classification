is a rat safe to play with a syrian hamster i've just bought a male rat but i've owned a syrian hamster for nearly a year i know syrians are very territorial and will kill any other hamsters that are in their space but what about the cross rodent relationship is it safe to let them both out at the same time to exercise i usually let them out for a run on my bed one at a time but i don't know if they would try and attack each other if i let them both out at the same time can you offer any advice thank you i actually got the rat with another male who was in the cage but they ended up repeatedly fighting during the night so i had to seperate them if your male rat has already been involved in fights then i strongly recommend against excercising them together they could seriously injure each other enjoy the alone time they get to have each with you its certainly nicer for the rat that way Hamster Fancy rat Yom Kippur War Guinea pig The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents Animal testing Rodent Golden Hamster Cat Muroidea Chinchilla Cricetidae The Secret of NIMH Mouse-like hamster Golan Heights The Tribe Six-Day War Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty 1982 Lebanon War Pet Lebanese Civil War New World rats and mice Kakapo Hezbollah Sid Vicious Mesothelioma My Parents are Aliens InuYasha (character) Bob and George Ferret Lebanon House Mouse Kevin and Kell Iraqi insurgency Israeli Air Force Laotian Rock Rat Breath of Fire III RuneScape quests Sin City Geography of China Arab-Israeli conflict Irish Guards State terrorism Eumuroida Aspartame Atrazine Murinae Rat (zodiac) Weight training Gambian pouch rat Plame affair Lady and the Tramp Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March The Young Ones (TV series) Parliament of Canada Blood (computer game) Sleep Rat Monogamy Flea 2003 Invasion of Iraq Osama bin Laden Lebanese Forces Athrun Zala Canary Rat poison STS-58 Kenneth Bigley Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Twelve Monkeys Snake Politics of Canada Ariel Sharon Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Professional wrestling slang Vermin Pet skunk Cedar Revolution Professional wrestling match types Gerbil About a Boy Jamar Shipman Fawlty Towers Nocturnal animal Life extension Minor Discworld characters The Sopranos USS Forrestal (CVA-59) Pesticide Wal-Mart Phoebe Buffay's songs Roman Catholic Church Theory of conduct First aid Long-term potentiation Hamato Yoshi Stock History of Lebanon
