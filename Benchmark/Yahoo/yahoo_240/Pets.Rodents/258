how can i stop my hamster from putting her food in her wheel she continues to take her food from her bowl to her plastic wheel that is attached to her cage when she runs in the wheel the food makes loud sounds and goes all over the place i have emptied the wheel each time she does this and she just doesn't get it well sorry to say that hampsters aren't really able to be trained not to do things they have their habits and i don't think there's a way to help that i think that your only way out of this is to take away her wheel or buy her a new one that the food would fall through at least the small stuff so it doesn't make as much noise once she realizes that her food won't stay there she'll probably stop best of luck Hamster John Cage Time Out of Mind Shaggy dog story The Price Is Right The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Breath of Fire III Fecal incontinence Baroque chess Timpani Rail tracks Chopsticks The Hampster Dance Customs and etiquette of Japan Fancy rat Winning Streak Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Skateboarding trick Sin City Aerial (dance move) Guinea pig Chicken The Silence (The Twilight Zone) Chinchilla Escapement Professional wrestling match types Pok__mon Live!
