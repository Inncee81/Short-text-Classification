whats wrong with my hamster there seems to be a bald spot under her chin or a bump it is really hard to tell bcuz she is hard to handle bcuz she was abused by her old owner it is a cricle shape it is real small if it is a bump what could it be or if its a bold spot is that just ageing i am not too sure how old she is the old owner just told me to take her but i know she is at least a year plz tell me if i should wait a day or so to see what happens or go to the vet when hamsters get bald spots it usually because they are sick or under stress and if it is a bump it probably hurt itself somehow in the cage Hamster Professional wrestling slang Guinea pig Pet store Codename: Kids Next Door Ferret Bumps race Teen Girl Squad Strap-on dildo Tire Car handling Housebreaking Happy Tree Friends Garfield Boston Public Jackass: The Movie Kodocha Equine conformation Salad Fingers The Marshall Mathers LP Meriones unguiculatus Fancy rat Aerial (dance move) Bicycle frame Hip hop rivalries Hulk Hogan Roomba Sin City Domestic rabbit Hal Trosky Pet skunk Mark Calaway Atomic Kitten Embedded system Birthday Minor characters in Seinfeld Animal testing The Young Ones (TV series) Alcoholics Anonymous Spanking Rachel Corrie Professional wrestling throws Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Motorcycle Volleyball Coprophagia Shawn Michaels Dog training Pitaten Alopecia areata LiveJournal Shot of Love Stage lighting Baldness Hamtaro 2000 Australian Grand Prix The Ashlee Simpson Show One Piece minor characters Domestic violence The Family from One End Street Butters Stotch Leather Extras (sitcom) Hip hop collaborations Shaggy dog story Piccolo Junior Saga Digital recording Moult Poker jargon Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Professional wrestling holds Dissociative identity disorder S.N.O.W.I.N.G.
