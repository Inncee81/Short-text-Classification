how much will it cost to euthinize a gerbil one gerbil of my gerbils has a tumor and is losing his fur he sleeps like all day he is still eating and drinks a lot i feel bad for him and can't even look at him he has a large blad spot on his neck and is almost years old i wanted to get his tumor removed but i'm only and don't have money to pay for it he also has a good risk of not making it through will they charge me to put him out of his pain how much please no rude comments i'm already upset about this as it is cowboys you should be ashamed of yourself i would never ever do that to my gerbil hi i can understand your worries about your gerbil's tumor it can be really hard to know the right thing to do when your pets start getting old a vet checkup sounds like it's in order don't worry though vets will not recommend euthanization unless the pet's quality of life is bad like if they're terminally ill or have severe pain or if the tumor is affecting a major organ and your pet can't live comfortably you mentioned that he's sleeping a lot but eating and drinking well years is kinda old for a gerbil some animals can lose hair as they age just like people do and elderly pets do need a lot more sleep than young ones the good news is that if he's able to eat and drink and he does so with enthusiasm the quality of his life is probably ok and he won't need to be euthanized animals that are really sick or hurting will often have no appetite and it'll be obvious that they're in pain once i had an older rat with a big tumor on his leg since he seemed happy enough ate and drank and played the vet said that he'd probably die of old age before the tumor seriously affected his health surgery was also risky for him too because of his age however if your gerbil is having problems getting around or eats drinks much less than normal and is unresponsive when you or the other gerbils play with him he probably is doing badly and the vet may recommend putting him to sleep if the cost is an issue do a search for your local spca they may be able to help you find a vet that you can afford hope this helps good luck Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Fancy rat Cancer Prostate cancer Stomach cancer Cat Fecal incontinence Ferret Pitaten Kodocha Hypoglycemia Babe Ruth Euthanasia Sin City Theory of conduct Grief Colorectal cancer Dog Tuberculosis Binge eating disorder Lung cancer People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Pet skunk Chronic fatigue syndrome Radiation therapy Anorexia nervosa Cancer of the larynx Trapping Androgen insensitivity syndrome Diarrhea Urinary incontinence Tooth enamel Social rule Humphrey Bogart Malignant melanoma Pneumonia Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Equine conformation Piccolo Junior Saga Goodness and value theory Breastfeeding Breast cancer Garfield Childbirth Insomnia Poker jargon Obesity Hamster Traumatic brain injury Shaggy dog story Characters in the Smurfs Publicly funded medicine Domestic rabbit Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Soft tissue sarcoma Sleep EastEnders Animal euthanasia Timon and Pumbaa W.I.T.C.H.
