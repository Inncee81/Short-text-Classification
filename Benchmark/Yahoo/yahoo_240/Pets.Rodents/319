is it possiable for a rat to sneeze and not be sick my rats all sniffle around each other sometimes and once in awhile they sneeze but they all don't have discharge from their noses or eyes i also keep their cages really clean and i use rat friendly bedding aspen not pine and i also heard that its okay if they're a little more noisy but i'm not sure all i know is that i can't afford to take them to the vet please help me mycoplasma pulmonis the organism that almost all rats in the general pet population carry is the cause of the majority of respiratory and genital infections in rats the organism is carried in the upper respiratory system and is transmitted by direct contact between mother and babies by sexual transfer through the air over short distances and can even be passed to the babies while going through the birth canal if the mother is infected predisposing factors stress or other illnesses can weaken your rat's immune system and cause your rat to break with an active mycoplasmal infection if left untreated this can lead to pneumonia therefore it is very important to ensure a stress free environment for your pet this includes providing an uncrowded well ventilated clean cage with a safe bedding product in which to live at all times this will eliminate any chance for ammonia buildup from urine and feces or phenols from cedar and pine to damage the respiratory system's own protective capacity it is also very important not to expose your pet to other rats who may be sick since a secondary bacterial or viral infection could allow the mycoplasmal infection to accelerate to pneumonia very quickly possibly causing death some of the bacteria that may accompany mycoplasma pulmonis during respiratory disease and may worsen symptoms include pasteurella pneumotropica streptococcus pneumonia bordetella bronchiseptica car bacillus cilia associated respiratory bacillus and corynebacterium kutscheri viral infections such as sda virus sialodacryoadenitis and sendai virus in combination with mycoplasma may also quickly lead to death sda virus is frequently seen in the pet rat population so be especially careful about quarantining any new rats you bring into your home for a least two weeks symptoms the symptoms of the upper respiratory disease which involve the nasal passages and middle ears can include sneezing sniffling occasional squinting rough hair coat and porphyrin staining around the eyes and nose if the inner ear becomes involved head tilt wry neck and rolling may occur as the disease progresses it will enter the lungs if exacerbated by bacterial infections viral infections or ammonia symptoms may include lethargy rough hair coat hunched posture porphyrin staining chattering weight loss labored breathing and eventually death if the mycoplasmal infection is not complicated by any other bacterial infection or viral infection the terminal stage of the disease can last for weeks or even months there is no cure or vaccine for mycoplasma pulmonis however infection and symptoms can be suppressed with antibiotics in the early stages of the disease but will most likely become a chronic condition requiring periodic or even constant treatment this disease progressively worsens eventually causing consolidation of the lungs and abscesses in the lungs leading to death some antibiotics proven to be effective against mycoplasma are tetracycline tylosin gentamicin amikacin chloramphenicol doxycycline and enrofloxacin baytril doses are as follows tetracycline orally at to mg per pound three times daily for at least days tylosin orally at mg per pound twice daily or mg per litre of water for to days gentamicin best used in combination with cefadroxil at to mg per pound injected twice daily for to days amikacin at mg per pound injected twice daily for to days chloramphenicol at to mg per pound injected twice daily for to days doxycycline orally at mg per pound twice daily for to days enrofloxacin baytril orally at mg per pound twice daily for to days baytril and doxycycline also work extremely well in combination in the advanced stages of the disease or in cases of wry neck and rolling a corticosteroid such as prednisone given in addition to an antibiotic may be helpful in reducing inflammation by reducing inflammation in the infected lungs the rat may breathe easier resulting in less frequent gasping attacks allowing the rat to live an extended life more comfortably in the case of wry neck and rolling reducing inflammation in the inner ear will stop the rolling within a few days prednisone dose to mg per pound once daily normal use of prednisone would be only for a few days but in terminal cases where comfort of a dying rat is the goal it can be used longer another drug helpful in severe cases of pneumonia is aminophylline this drug relaxes and expands bronchial tubes helping the rat to breathe easier dose to mg per pound orally or injected twice or three times daily good husbandry breeding only from mycoplasma resistant rats and early treatment are the only things we can do to fight this deadly disease at this time someday maybe we'll be lucky enough to have a drug company develop an effective vaccine we can only hope and since you said you couldnt afford the vet try a few of these things my rat is sneezing what should i do all pet rats carry mycoplasma this is the bane of all rat fanciers hopefully your rat's immune system will be strong enough to fight it however certain factors in your rats life can significantly lower the immune system and allow the myco to take hold when this happens you'll notice sneezing perhaps some red discharge around the nose this is poryphin not blood it's the normal color of rat tears and nasal discharge if the sneezing is light and dry occasional sneezes are normal we're talking about continual sneezes important we're talking about dry sneezes if the sneezes are wet and there is a lot of the red staining around their nose and or eyes or if you hear congestion in the chest it's important to go ahead and get them to a vet for some antibiotics they can go downhill so very fast you can use children's benedryl read the label and make sure it doesn't contain tylenol you will give cc about drops to an adult rat twice a day liquid echinacea and goldenseal available at health food stores like gnc it has to be liquid form drops twice a day for weeks or you can put drops per oz of water in the water bottle in the water to prevent by mouth if there are symptoms if you have rats and one is sneezing and one isn't i treat the sneezer with meds and put the echinacea in the water to help boost the immune system of both rats try the site below http www rmca org
