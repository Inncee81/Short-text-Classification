ungrateful bunnies i have two male rabbits which i recently put into an enclosure approximately feet x feet x feet x feet and feet high there's a two storey hutch in there too i let them out of the hutch every morning and shut them back in again at about pm so they have free roam all day anyway despite this lovely big run they still try to dig under the gate and fencing to get out there's logs and pipes for them in the run i put fresh grass and dandelions on the ground for them everyday as well as the rabbit food in their hutch and yet all this isn't enough for them but anyway my question is if i bury chicken wire under the ground around the edges of the enclosure will that stop them digging or is there anything else i could do because the enclosure is so large i can go in there and sit with them i even have a chair for myself i rehomed them from someone who was going to kill them if a new home couldn't be found one is black the other is white with a black stripe down it's spine and black dots all over but when it came to me it was dirty yellow and black now that it's moulted it's real colour has come through i don't know how it's previous owners treated it but it's been here about months and it's still a bit wary of people the black one is fine i've had them both neutered and vaccinated and they get the best of everything like all my pets do which is why i'm peeved that they don't want to stay in their own space they'll even try to follow me through the gate when i leave their enclosure the cheeky little critters i know rabbits dig it's just that they try to dig out of the enclosure rather than just dig a hole in the middle of it the only thing you can do to stop them digging through is to have a material on the floor of the enclosure that is un diggable such as concrete your little rabbits are not ungrateful they are just rabbits with a natural instinct to dig afterall they live in burrows in the wild its nice that you have provided such a good home for them rather than letting them rot in a hutch over time as your rabbits get older they will mellow out a little bit and may perhaps stop the digging in the meantime perhaps you could consider having them neutered which will help the raging hormones to settle and get them through the naughty teenage years a little quicker good luck Domestic rabbit Hamster Rabbit Guinea pig Cat Ferret Shaggy dog story EastEnders Fancy rat Pet skunk Dog training Fox hunting Bugs Bunny Electrical wiring Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Opportunity rover Unreal Dog Rabies Episodes of Lost (Season 1) RuneScape quests Loudspeaker Capercaillie Poker jargon The Adventures of Pete & Pete Trapping Livestock The Amber Spyglass Codename: Kids Next Door Professional wrestling match types Milton H.
