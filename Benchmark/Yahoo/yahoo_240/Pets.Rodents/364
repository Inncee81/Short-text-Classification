hamster care i've had a hamster for my son for a couple of months bought as a baby from the pet store he seems to be in perfect health so i've never felt it necessary to take him to the vet however a friend of mine told me that hamsters need to have their teeth trimmed regularly otherwise they won't be able to eat and will starve is this true and if so how often right now he doesn't show any signs of not eating quite the opposite you don't have to take your hamster to the vet to get his teeth trimmed i have teddy bear hamsters and a dwarf hamster and have never had to get there teeth trimmed just put stuff in his cage to chew on like toilet paper rolls or paper towel rolls they love chewing on them you can also go to the pet store and buy hamster toys for him to chew on also you can give hamsters dog biscuits for them to chew on it's good for there teeth Hamster Fancy rat Domestic rabbit Pet skunk Guinea pig Garfield Care Bears Tooth enamel Kodocha Dog training The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius Animal testing Codename: Kids Next Door The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Mouse-like hamster Golden Hamster Ferret Dental caries Butters Stotch The Fairly OddParents Dog The McGuire Sisters Neighbours Pet Menstrual cup Salad Fingers Mojave people Canary Brian Griffin The Critic Pet store Liam Gallagher Tooth Internet phenomenon Humphrey Bogart Chinchilla Cat Shaggy dog story The Beach Boys Shit The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Friends Wal-Mart My Parents are Aliens The League of Gentlemen (comedy) RuneScape quests Sears Holdings Corporation Havanese EastEnders Monster Rancher monsters Fecal incontinence The Ashlee Simpson Show Alfred Korzybski Squidward Tentacles Taboo food and drink RuneScape economy Unclean animals Veterinarian Kurt Angle Teacher's Pet (Disney) Ron Weasley Nile crocodile True Crime: Streets of LA S.N.O.W.I.N.G.
