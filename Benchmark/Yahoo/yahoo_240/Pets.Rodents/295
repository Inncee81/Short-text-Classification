gerbil has bloody nose help i have a mongolian gerbil about the age of he had a brother but he sadly passed away unexcpectedly for some reason my mongolian gerbil had a bloody nose i panicked because his brother use to have a bloody nose too and he you no sooooo i dont want the same thing happen to him i will try bringing him to the vet but meanwhile what should i do yep basically gerbils porphyrin pretty much snot eww heh is red not blood if it's just his nose it's allergy probably to the bedding my female gerbil had it a fair bit when we were keeping her on wood shavings not cedar or pine safe ones we switched her to carefresh and it nearly stopped but not quite the male her brother in the cage right next to her still had woodshavings so we switched him over and tada no more red nose so change the bedding over if you can't get aspen or hardwood shavings and she's on carefresh get a load of the paper bedding stuff for now she'll live on that just as well if that doesn't help it try changing the food to a different one if she's on a gerbil mix try a hamster mix try a plain pellet only food anything don't give too many treats while trying to eliminate the problem but the bedding is the most likely thing to cause it so switch that for now i'd say within a week you should see much reduced or no blood my gerbil took about a week to be clear most of the time and after it was permanent if your gerbil's fur is clean ears clean eyes are bright she's eating drinking and playing normally then she's probably ok if any of that isn't ok you may want to see a vet but otherwise i'd just try changing bedding and keeping an eye on her for now by the way it's likely the brother just died young it happens sometimes my last hamster died at only about months old which is young for a hamster hope this helps Fancy rat Meriones unguiculatus Pet skunk Cat Domestic rabbit Social rule Shaggy dog story Happy Tree Friends Dog training Tattoo Theory of conduct The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Tuberculosis Shark Sento Characters of Naruto Common cold Sewage treatment Blood First aid Diving Rosacea Acne Chinchilla Little Britain Elephant Ron and Fez Hormone replacement therapy (trans) The Young Ones (TV series) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Radio Yerevan House Mouse Sin City Wood Negima Time Out of Mind Comanche Malaria Minor Harry Potter Beasts Dragon Booster Vampire Eye Traumatic brain injury Animal communication Plastic Zhao Yun American Black Bear Ferret Urinary incontinence Characters in the Smurfs Bart chalkboard gags Friends Breastfeeding Monster Rancher monsters Allergy Certified Nursing Assistant Blood on the Tracks Traumatic incident reduction Narbonic Golden Hamster Body piercing Stomach cancer 613 mitzvot The Ashlee Simpson Show Ebola Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Pitaten Episodes of Lost (Season 1) RuneScape quests Hydrochloric acid Good Morning, Vietnam Cosmic Era list of characters Professional wrestling match types Drill bit Russian joke The Jeffersons (South Park) Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Breath of Fire III Kurt Angle Dog Upholstery E85 Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story!
