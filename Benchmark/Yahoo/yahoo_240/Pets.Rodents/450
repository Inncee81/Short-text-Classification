i'm thinking about getting a pet rat looking for your views do you have one if you do would you recommend it and where did you get it from thanks x hahaha i know i wasn't going to go and get one out a bin ive owned plenty of rats bald ones hooded ones dumbo rats i think thats thier name and i could tell you they have a personality similar to dogs you can train them i taught mine how to get treats and how to finish a maze believe me thier tons of fun and adorable they can be taught to sit on your shoulder and even litter box trained they will learn thier name to rats are very smart and they dont smell like mice mine lived years he even licked me when i hadnt seen him for awhile oh and i can tell you they loved the little rat hammocks sold at pet stores they are smart animals though and they need stimulation so expect to buy a new toy at lease once a week a wheel doesnt really entertain them none of the rats ive owned even used the wheel maybe because theyre smart enough to relize they arent going anywhere anyways mine loved treats fresh fruit and veggies and cereal and bread and of course cheese every once in awhile i would spoil them with cake or french fries i know i know thats not supposed to happen but i just couldnt resist but best to get your rat in a pair buy because they are social animals imagine living your life without any human contact the entire time i say go for it but buy but not males though and no they wont like eachother more than they like you they will both demand your attention and eachothers plus its fun to watch them interact goodluck with ur new pets sadly i lost my last one to a tumor oh and almost never bite especially thier cherished owner Fancy rat Hamster Cat Guinea pig Ferret Dog training Brown Rat Bread Domestic rabbit Pet skunk RuneScape quests House Mouse Garfield Dog SpongeBob SquarePants Ren and Stimpy InuYasha (character) Dilbert Walt Disney Breakfast Property (ownership right) Taboo food and drink Mickey Mouse Gaia Online Dairy Tofu Alaga__sia Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Theory of conduct Stem cell Family Guy Fish and chips Human sexual behavior Tire Sea-Monkey Avenue Q Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film) Felis sapiens Care Bears Bart chalkboard gags Refrigerator car Long-term potentiation Flea Food Kim Possible Hedgehog Socialization Game show Sin City Ford Motor Company Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist The Apprentice 2 Tuberculosis Behaviorism Vulcan (Star Trek) Aladdin (1992 film) Oral sex Fruits Basket Colorectal cancer Disney's Animal Kingdom Adolphe Thiers Professional wrestling slang Japanese cuisine Peanuts Pet Sounds Baldrick Spidey Super Stories Blood (computer game) Natt__ The Apprentice 3 FoxTrot Aspartame Working dog The Walt Disney Company German cuisine Friends Bat Robot Neopets Snack food Rabies Meaning of life Kangaroo Whose Line Is It Anyway?
