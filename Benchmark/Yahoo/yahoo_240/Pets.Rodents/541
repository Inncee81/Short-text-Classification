guinea pig hamster or neither for christmas i was thinking about getting a hamster because i've always wanted one and my parent's think i might be responsible enough my neighbors once had a hamster and a guinea pig and we got to babysit them one time that's when i really fell in love with hamsters but when i told my brother what i wanted he said guinea pigs are better i didn't agree because i remembered that we got to play with the hamster and the guinea pig slept in it's igloo all day please help me with this which is funner which is easier to take care of which is less expensive which one doesn't stink as much because those are me and my parent's main concerns thanks if you are looking for the best rodent type pet get a rat domestic rats unlike hamsters do not bite are affectionate and have their own personalities they can be let out of their cages to roam around a room at will and left on their own for short periods of time they will also often come to you if you call them because they are highly social creatures they are also very easy to take care of as they can eat just about anything they are also relatively inexpensive available from any pet store for or less however you will want to get one from a pet store and not a feeder store for snakes as the ones from pet stores will be handled and socialized more personally i've had regular and dwarf hamsters as well as rats all were sweet in a way but the hamsters would often bite usually by accident but if you put your hand into their den they would often take a bite out of your finger thinking it was food rats will not do this and in general are much more affectionate than hamsters as for stinking do not get a guinea pig they don't do much besides eat sleep and poop it virtually amazes me when people loose their guinea pigs because it seems as if they have a literal trail of poop following behind them overall rats and hamsters require about the same maintenance as far as cleaning and feeding go although it is also easier to bath rats as they like to swim it is fun to fill up a bathtub and let them play in it provided you give them some dry land to get on too in terms of funny you just can't beat rats get a pair of baby rats and put them in a cage together and you will never see anything more funny or adorable when you watch them play on that note if you get a rat i recommend that you at least get of them they are very social creatures and love the company of another rat around anyway i wish you good luck and whatever pet you get just give it enough love and attention and it will be a good pet no matter what you get Domestic rabbit Fancy rat Garfield Cat The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Pet skunk Pet Rat Chicken Shaggy dog story Customs and etiquette of Japan EastEnders Theory of conduct Social rule Sento Ferret Humphrey Bogart Chinchilla Spidey Super Stories RuneScape quests Textile manufacturing Animal testing Pig The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents The Fairly OddParents Brown Rat Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pet store Creatures in Bionicle Spirited Away Domestication Fruits Basket John the Baptist Taboo food and drink Care Bears Surveillance Internet phenomenon Snake Sinfest The Sims Dog training W.I.T.C.H.
