what do pet rats eat my brother got a pet rat and i was wondering what a good diet for him is a good diet to feed your rat is what is called a block diet or as everyone else said the pellets the reason for this is that it provides more nutrition when you give your rat seed it is like a treat for them the rats can choose what they want and leave everything behind so they can loose nutrition that way the block diet also provides a good substance to chew on rats always need things to chew on their teeth always grow making them a part of the rodent family if they get to long it can be really bad for your rat and that can result in the need to get your rats teeth trimmed which isn't very cheap rats do really good with most vegtables don't over feed though again the veggies should be given once a day rats like salty things so anything salty would be a treat for them rats can pretty much eat most human foods but that doesn't mean it is good for them provide veggies like carrots and collard greens stay away from lettuce and such because it is mostly water and not nutritional they also have little treats at the store you can give them but don't go overboard on those either cause that can result in a fat rat things like hamsteroids are a good treat they provide a good chewing surface and a minimal amount of vitamins not enough to supplement anything also rats like bananas and oranges oranges are good to give to rats because of the vitamin c i hope this information helps f y i whatever diet you choose be sure to keep him on it changing his diet all the time can make him sick Hamster Fancy rat Vitamin C Nutrition Vitamin Domestic rabbit Tocopherol Tooth Vegetarianism Food Genetically modified food Cat Folic acid Breastfeeding Raw food diet Chicken Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Omega-3 fatty acid Pet skunk Dietary fiber Veganism Antioxidant Dieting Bread Cyanocobalamin Ramen Cheese Egg (food) Rat Anorexia nervosa Tooth enamel Famine Stomach cancer Vegetarian nutrition Chinchilla Milk Healthy eating Organic food Bodybuilding Theory of conduct Hedgehog Soybean Soy milk Coronary heart disease Atkins Nutritional Approach Garlic Kim Possible Taboo food and drink Oily fish Sea-Monkey Brown Rat Tobacco Nutrient South Beach diet Colorectal cancer Dental caries Chronic fatigue syndrome Dog training Fruitarianism Life extension Fecal incontinence Hamburger Dog food Vitamin D House Mouse Rice Food coloring Acorn Rodent Alzheimer's disease Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Binge eating disorder Maize Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Food guide pyramid Blood (computer game) Textile manufacturing Calorie restriction Trans fat Potato Squirrel Goldfish Potassium Cuisine of the Southern United States Garfield Sauerkraut Coeliac disease Miso Banana Weight training Cirrhosis
