why did my mouse do that please click here when i had a mouse named oreo she'd escape every night orsoand get into my rats cage she could eaisily get in and out of my rats cage because the wiring was in the first time she did this i thought they killed her becauce she was curled up in the bedding sleeping i even turned the cage around because the rat's cage was next to her cage so i thought maybe she had a certin spott she got out of but sure enough the next morn she was in there with them she did this up until the day she died about a week after she started my mini poodle killed her not my rats luckily i still have them oreo was housed with another mouse could it be she wanted someone to play with and she didnt like snowflake the other mouse and she liked sugar and buiscut the rats more accualy she died because my mom let my dog in my room when i was cleaning their cage downstairs my dog killed oreo but snoflake was safely hidden in a slim fast can it was probably just curiosity when she got out of her cage she probably followed the rats' scent into their cage just be thankful that the rats didn't attack him and yeah you probably should have gotten another cage but i don't think her death was your fault unlike other people and also you can own more than one pet such as rats and mice anyway that's my two cents Fancy rat Hamster Ferret Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Guinea pig Shaggy dog story Garfield House Mouse Trapping Cat Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March The Secret of NIMH RuneScape quests One Piece minor characters Flea Russian space dogs Mickey Mouse Animal testing Johnny Cage Dog agility Hip hop collaborations Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban EastEnders Steven Wright Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Ron Weasley Brown Rat Domestic rabbit Oreo Sin City Kakapo Dilbert The Shining (film) Palindrome Sid Vicious Dog The Visitation Lady and the Tramp Eminem The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Phoebe Buffay's songs Lauren Bacall Fox hunting Pok__mon Live!
