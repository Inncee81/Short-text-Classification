killing mice give me your thoughts on humane traps hi i killed a mouse this morning i take no pleasure from doing so but they are clearly in the area in large numbers and i find it necessary to lay traps when i find droppings or see one running over the kitchen worktops when i get in from work i've been using sonic alarms for a few months and they seemed to be working but now the mice are ignoring the alarms and are making a nuisance of themselves again prior to buying the alarms i killed and buried mice i am aware that this isn't a particularly pleasant thing to be doing the traps are very powerful ones so should be killing the mice instantaneously i don't hate the mice actually they're quite cute but they are ferrel and carry disease and it's not like i can make pets of them i am aware that there are humane traps but have also read that often mice starve in these traps because they are not immediately released i would have difficulty releasing the mice because i work as a chef the only viable option would be to release them in one of the local parks and my work means i couldn't always make the time to do this immediately i caught one for obvious reasons i don't want to release them in to my own back garden questions i'd like answering then how long can mouse survive without food water if a wild mouse is caught in a humane trap won't it stress itself to death in any case even if it doesn't starve is there an alternative solution i haven't thought of alyssa k and lakely i know that this is the ideal humane traps and i have seen them available in one of the local shops i am just not sure it would work for me because if i get in late and have back to back shifts so that i'm back at work early when can i release the mouse if i am to get sleep to be fit for my days work if i leave it there too long mouse starves i don't actually regard myself as an animal lover saorsie but i admire other creatures and became aware of people's hatred for seagulls and pigeons since i took on my seagull photo for an avatar clearly i have hardened my heart against the mice intruders but still i don't like killing them golden i see where you're coming from but equally i can find it absurd at times that we treat some animals with love and others with loathing vermin is anything that bugs us but some so called vermin are actually really splendid creatures foxes and seagulls being a couple of examples my stance is that i kill mice because i have to and not because i want to and if anyone can convince me that humane traps are viable in my situation then i'll give them a go if they can't then we'll go on as we are doing dragon i do currently use spring loaded traps like the ones you're describing xx cc xx your answer has me pretty well decided to give humane traps a go my first mice were caught over a month period i don't think it's so much the house that's infested as the neighbourhood generally if the mice can wait hours or so to be released then a humane trap is viable liv big open field is all very well but the area i'm in is basically industrial with a few parks fields are miles away and i don't have a car also i would like to know where i stand legally with releasing mice as i have a choice between scrubland surrounding industrial premises or parkland if i got caught releasing mice could i be prosecuted thanks brindle i would wear gloves to release the mice though main concern now is precisely where i could release mice and not be in trouble with law for doing so i think the risk of them dying of shock has to be weighed against otherwise certain death i am pretty well decided to get a couple of these humane traps by now and see if they work out thank you thekikicd i have never used glue traps and wouldn't consider doing so originally very guilty killing mice but then justified it because they were invading my home i'm not a nice person really as i kept a mouse tally of my kills my equivalent of notches on the bedpost when i first got here up to getting the sonic alarms basically it was bravado though cat good answer the house isn't mine it is a house share with two other tennants i suppose it would be an option to ask a professional to advise about mouse proofing the house without them laying poisons for the mice i might try speaking to local police about suitable places to release wild mice locally and the legal implications my concern is that by releasing them they then become someone else's problem that is why i would expect people locally to be unimpressed if they observed me i suppose a town mouse and country mouse are much the same thing i hate to tell you people this but i just heard the trap go snap and another mouse has just snuffed it v sorry also that said mouse can wait till daylight to be buried he she is after all dead and i'm not up for burying mice at am i am wondering if i will let the mice play russian roulette and give them both snap traps and humane traps they would die of stress or dehydration before ever starving you might get by with a few hours or so but overnight or anything would be really pushing it do you have any idea how they're getting inside if you could correct that problem eventually solved i'm stumped too humane traps and releasing is the way to go but if you can't you can't although snap traps and poison are certain death at least they have a chance with humane traps and eventual release you could call in a professional but that won't be kind either eta good point about 'not making it somebody else's problem' it's too bad time doesn't really allow you to free them in time and that there's no field nearby well close enough to be convenient yet far enough away to not become another's problem hopefully you can figure out how they're getting inside and won't have this problem much longer do you have a cat they might think twice about coming inside with one Poker jargon Abortion debate Social rule RuneScape quests The Death Gate
