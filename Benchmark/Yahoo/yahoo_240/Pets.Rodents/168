which is beter i am planning on getting a hamster which is beter a female or a male and please state a reason why i disagree i have had many many hamsters in my life have a female now and it seems to me that my females are just a friendly as my males although i did have a favorite male that was mean as fire i loved him even though he bit me and charged the cage and i was kind of scared to put my hand in to feed him i would have to trap him against the wall of his cage in order not to get bit he was a cambell's dwarf i have had a mix of cambell's and syrians at the same time anyway i loved him because of his meanness he had spunk he was the smallest cambell's i've ever seen and he was the meanest animal i have ever seen and i practically raised him i was as gentle and nice to him as i was to every one of my hamster's but he was just vicious i guess i will say though that the males are way lazier than the females my female is almost years old now and she still runs all night long my males would retire from the wheel at just over a year and would instead only force themselves to run when i put them in the ball Hamster John Cage Monster Rancher monsters Wrigley Field Professional wrestling match types YuYu Hakusho Time Out of Mind Spider Fur farming Eric Cartman Indianapolis 500 Avenue Q Theory of conduct Animal testing Tenshinhan The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Wolfrider Pet skunk CPU cache Jon Secada Stone Cold Steve Austin Monogamy Pinky and the Brain Characters in the Smurfs The Angry Beavers Vegeta Kirby's Dream Land 2 Textile manufacturing Domestic rabbit Internal ballistics Gordon Campbell Trapping Fast bowling Lion The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Kim Possible Guinea pig On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Zhao Yun One Power She Loves You Drag racing W.I.T.C.H.
