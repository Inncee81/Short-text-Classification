i want to breed my hamster i want to breed my hamster in a few month so i want to ask some question i think my male hamster is a syrian because he golden will my hamster kill another syrian right away or is it possible to breed can my syrian breed with a dwarf or any other how can i tell if the mum hamster is pregnet what happen during her pregnet days will i have to do anything during and when it time pregent should i remove the male hamster or let it be i heard the male kills other if remove the male hamster the mother eat the baby how can i reduce mum hamster from eating her babys when can i pick them up what an avarge litters of the mum to give birth if im missing somthing importenent can u answer it too plz answer all and i know if i touch the baby the mum hamster wont renember the scent and eat the baby but inclue that in the list firstly the time has to be right for syrian hamsters to breed because if its not then it will cause death of one hamster mainly the male also if there syrians then they must be kept in separate cages so they will not fight nope the syrian can only breed with a syrian and dwarf with dwarf etc nothing would happen because they are different species of hamsters their gestation period is only days the signs that are female syrian is pregnant are she doesn't not come in to heat days after the mating drinks loads of water stores loads of food makes a nest her abdomen will swell but you cant see this untill about days after the mating her nipples become more pronounced the only things that will happen during the pregnancy is that her abdomen will swell and her behavior might change as well all you need to do is just give her food which is high in protein eg bits of boiled eggs cheese boiled pasta and roast chicken the sandwich chicken she will give birth with in days and she might get very restless a day before she gives birth when she goes in to labour just leave her to do her job because if you don't then she will turn on her babies after the birth try not to disturb her much only to give her clean food and water and you can continue giving her plenty of vegetables and food which is high in protein you should remove the male becasue he will distract the female hamster and they both will eat the babies you can stop the mother from eating her babies by trying not to distrub her often only for certain things you should clean the female hamsters cage out days before she gives birth because you wont be able to clean it again untill weeks and once the babys are weeks they can be held a bit but not to long they should be taking from a drip feeder by days and they should have opened there eyes by now and you should put another food bowl in for the baby hamsters because they do eat loads they should be fully weaned by days and they might also start to fight so you should seperate them into there single sex groups male in one and female in the other you can tell males from females very easy because the females have circle shapes close together and the males have circles which are far away from each other the average litter can vary from to but some hamsters are known to have babies which is a lot just dont touch or distrub the mother and babies while they are in the cage because the mother will see this as a threat and she will attack her babies and eat them just wait untill the handleing age which is weeks at the most good luck hope it helps Chicken Guinea pig Elephant Platypus Cat Domestic rabbit Pet skunk Social rule Kakapo House Mouse Spider Pregnancy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Fancy rat Obstetrics Abortion debate Golden Hamster Garter snake Dog Tasmanian Devil Domestic goat RuneScape quests Bird Ant Milk Childbirth Mosquito Egg (food) Potato Koala CPU cache Giant Panda Fecal incontinence Menstrual cycle Tarantula Friends EastEnders MRE Anopheles Clownfish American lobster Coconut crab Seabird Coffee Breech birth Monogamy Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Premature birth Acorn Animal communication Tofu About a Boy Red Fox Cuisine of Denmark Ostrich Nerpa The Ashlee Simpson Show Snake Livestock Species Kodocha The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Fasting Japanese tea ceremony Urinary incontinence Leatherback Sea Turtle Ramen Hamburger Sea Otter Atomic Kitten Kosher foods Lion Baboon Cheese Goldfish Kender Coeliac disease Sharon Tate Hedgehog Nile crocodile American Black Bear Food Stomach cancer Androgen insensitivity syndrome Textile manufacturing Estrus cycle
