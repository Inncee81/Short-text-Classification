rat q's i went to meet this lady about rats and the lady told me that male rats do not mark their territory or pee as much if you feed them hamster food is this true and she also said that female rats bleed when they come in heat like dogs do is this true also i have never heard any of this before and i was wondering if the lady was just making this up um she's completely wrong on both accounts all rats leave scent trails to mark their territory males and females diet does not affect this though it could affect the smell of the urine don't feed your rats hamster food because hamsters have different dietary needs than rats rats need more protein so just get a good lab block for rats and they're dietary needs will be met read the labels and make sure that corn isn't the first ingredient wheat or soy should be the first ingredient animal protein is also important in their diet mazuri rat lab block is the best food i've found and you can buy it at petsmart it doesn't have any animal protein in it so i supplement it with a little dog food i have two female rats and they have never bled while in heat they get extra hyper when they're in heat but that's really the only way you can tell if they're in heat Hamster Fancy rat Soybean Protein Food Vegetarianism Cat Genetically modified food Veganism Dietary fiber Dog Omega-3 fatty acid Prostate cancer Coeliac disease Sugar substitute Rat (zodiac) Guinea pig Vitamin C Folic acid Tocopherol Dietary supplement Vitamin Aspartame Raw food diet Vegetarian nutrition Dieting Crohn's disease Egg (food) Tannin Flour Agriculture Tofu Animal testing Milk Cancer Zinc Kakapo Animal communication House Mouse Chicken Ramen Rat Lady and the Tramp Low-carbohydrate diet Calorie restriction Soy milk Pet skunk Organic food Gluten-free diet Food allergy Domestication Anemia Soy protein Stomach cancer Barley Kidney stone Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Fecal incontinence Warfarin Cereal Golden Hamster Bread Dog food Food and Drug Administration Cuisine of the Southern United States Brown Rat Semen Iron Taboo food and drink Trans fat Kashrut Gluten-free, casein-free diet Survival skills True Crime: Streets of LA Chinese astrology Sorghum Cheese Wheat American lobster Chocolate Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Saccharin Retinol Theory of conduct Vegetarian cuisine Chinchilla Phenylketonuria Methylsulfonylmethane Osteoarthritis Japanese cuisine Blood Atkins Nutritional Approach Urinary incontinence Cat food Environmental vegetarianism
