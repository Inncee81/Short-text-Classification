pet mice can i put new mums together with their babies our little girls have had babies one was days ago and one was just over hours ago can we put them in the same cage with their babies we separated them into boxes and containers when we thought they were going to give birth but now we feel sorry that they are not together will they eat each others babies at this point it is best to leave them seperated until the babies are days old the move may stress out the mothers and they may kill the babies most mother mice will help care for eachother's young it would have been just fine to leave them together but best not to disturb them now when the babies are about weeks old you can try introducing the families to eachother they will probably be fine especially if they have lived with eachother before just remember that baby mice can start having their own babies between weeks old so seperate the males into their own cage by then EastEnders House Mouse Hamster Elephant Days of our Lives Guinea pig Breastfeeding Childbirth Kodocha About a Boy Cliff Richard Neighbours Mouse (computing) Knots Landing Premature birth Friends Tasmanian Devil Prisoner (TV series) One Life to Live Domestic rabbit Garfield Abortion debate Play School Characters in the Smurfs Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Family from One End Street Chicken Pregnancy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Garter snake Infantilism Hall & Oates Hollyoaks Phoebe Buffay's songs Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Giant Panda Sub-Zero Bat Milk Fancy rat Dead Like Me Pok__mon Live!
