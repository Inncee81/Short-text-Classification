baby hamsters about days ago my hamster had her babies she has previously had other litters and the male has always been taken away but when i do this she tends to eat the babies around days old this time i decided to see wot would happen if i left dad in the cage with them and he has been really good when i go into the room he tends to be siting with them and doing everything apart from the feeding obviously is this normal for the father to take this role as iv heard that the dad can be nasty to the babies and kill them also when can we start to pick the babies up regarding picking the babies up depends really on the mum and how she is with them when you are around if she is nervous and runs around alot i would leave it as long as possible before handling the babies once the babies have their eyes open and are covered in fur it should be ok to handle them this is usually days old the male hamster does take care of the babies especially dwarf hamsters he will even assist on the actual birth of the babies and clean them up and keep them warm until mum is ready to feed them the only problem being that the mum can get pregnant again hours after giving birth so make sure she has plenty of fruit chopped up cucumber and apple and some boiled egg the babies will also eat these and this will help wean them Hamster Breastfeeding Social rule Domestic rabbit About a Boy Chicken Pregnancy Elephant Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Egg (food) Conker's Bad Fur Day EastEnders The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius Nerpa Childbirth Fancy rat Kodocha RuneScape quests Jewish cuisine Toxoplasmosis Koala The Ashlee Simpson Show Cat House Mouse Little Britain Internet phenomenon Days of our Lives Kakapo Premature birth Paintball Golden Hamster Gray Wolf In vitro fertilisation Apple Giant Panda Kitten Vegetarianism The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe The Rutles Shaggy dog story Abortion debate Jon Secada RuneScape Random Events Fecal incontinence Infant Korean cuisine Jam (TV series) Red Squirrel Sharon Tate Paradox Viva La Bam Father's Day (Doctor Who) Minor Harry Potter Beasts Prenatal diagnosis Thermal power station Shark Tasmanian Devil Cerebral palsy Livestock Bat Wonderland (McFly album) Sexual reproduction Capercaillie Boom Town (Doctor Who) Japanese tea ceremony Comanche Hedgehog Dog Happy Tree Friends Cuisine of Singapore Futurama (TV series - season 5) Alois Hitler Friends Soup Charmed American lobster Sea-Monkey Sea Otter Coeliac disease Aphid Vitamin C Spider Domestic goat Foodborne illness Nile crocodile Teenage pregnancy Leo Wyatt Parenting Baseball Spina bifida Hollyoaks John Cage The Adventures of Pete & Pete Kyle Broflovski Virginia Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) Biological pest control Potato
