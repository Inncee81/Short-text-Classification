experts on hookah shisha hi those of you who know their shisha hookah stuff im new to it and my husband really wants one his birthday is coming i want to get him soemthing good price is not an issue it should be of good quality please advice what specs ishould look for or if you know where i can find one oh thank you for the answers no one seems to wanna help i am from uk there are plenty of websites to get hookahs from i am actually starting my own hookah business soon but i dont have my website established yet my supplier is hookah shisha com and i have never been disappointed hookahs are highly variable depending on what you are looking for number of hoses is one thing to look for they range from to or for a first timer i would suggest a hookah that has hose and rotates it will be a more intimate experience for you and your husband to enjoy together also get as long a hose as possible so you can lay back and relax while smoking and aren't huddled around the hookah ive seen hookahs range from inches to inches so think about how large you want it to be i recommend something between and as the large chamber created in the base makes for a very smooth smoke there are many styles of hookahs such as egyptian syrian mya indian rotator etc so i would just peruse about online and find the style that you think your husband would like the most as far as coals go i would recommend quick lighting golden coals you only need a lighter to light them instead of a gas stove romman is the best brand of shisha on the market in my circle of friends' opinion i would not recommend buying one from some small arab store or ebay as you don't know if what you are ordering is of high quality or even if its been used before when ordering from hookah shisha com you get everything you need to start smoking right away with every hookah purchase free coals tongs all hoses and grommets a bowl a wind cover and of course boxes of romman shisha with every purchase good luck and have fun Hookah Bong Mattress Coffeehouse Cigar Ioannina M16 (rifle) Advertising Vacuum Kitchen Lionel Corporation Illegal drug trade Thermal power station Fossil fuel power plant Coffee Gramophone record Economics Tobacco smoking Irrigation Tobacco Electronic commerce Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Portable stove Theory of conduct Smoking pipe Petroleum Social rule Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Hashish Shaggy dog story Inflation Glossary of firefighting terms Hybrid vehicle Airsoft Neopets Carburetor Japanese tea ceremony Radio controlled airplane Management information system Hydraulic machinery Parachuting 1973 oil crisis Digital photography Microeconomics Stove Shotgun F-16 Fighting Falcon O scale Hydrogen economy Cable television Windsurfing Gas metal arc welding William Murdoch Slide rule Energy development RuneScape quests Drill bit Turbocharger Supply and demand Philatelic investment IPod Floppy disk RuneScape skills Commodity markets Diesel engine Cigarette Binoculars Network effect Hamster Plastic Nuclear power Electrophysiology Town gas Strap-on dildo Air gun Concrete Arbitrage Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Topps Causality Commodore International EverQuest Charles Ives Wood Publicly funded medicine Solar power Eyepiece Siphon BMW RuneScape economy Glossary of firefighting equipment String theory Use of poison gas in World War I Internal ballistics
