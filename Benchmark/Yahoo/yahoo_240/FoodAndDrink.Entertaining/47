how come menthos react with diet coke according to hyneman he's the mustachioed mythbuster it's a process called nucleation in which the particular chemistry of the mentos candy interacts with the chemistry of the carbonated diet coke causing the carbon dioxide gas or co to suddenly come out of suspension in the liquid and make a break for freedom but you have to have the right mentos the non mint type hyneman says have a glaze on them and they don't work at all it only works with the mint ones because they have a matte finish that surface serves as these little portals for the gas to escape through but the story doesn't end there hyneman says there's a cascade that happens with it's a little esoteric an ion exchange basically the mentos start to dissolve and it's like tripping a switch it's not what you would call a chain reaction because that's something else in chemistry terms but it's a cascade whereon all of a sudden all of the co that was contained in the liquid is suddenly not as attracted to the liquid as it was before because of this slight change in the chemistry that occurs that's not surprising since we all know how a change in chemistry can cause attraction to wane but as in many things a little sweetness can slow the process so regular sugared soda doesn't produce the same reaction sugar molecules are very large hyneman says and that doesn't allow this to happen as quickly that's the key sugar is gooey and sticky even though it doesn't seem that way when it's in a soda but there's a lot in there and it helps hold onto the co a lot better on the other hand hyneman says sweetness of no kind natural or artificial results in a disappointing fizzle Carbon dioxide Glass Biochemistry Water (molecule) Explosive material Corrosion Brewery Hydrogen Soft drink Enzyme Sugar Hydrochloric acid Chemistry Acetic acid Alkane Iron Rebreather Tooth Coca-Cola Methane Photosynthesis Phase (matter) Ammonia Coal Fire extinguisher Sulfuric acid Bread Haloalkane Ecology Alternative biochemistry Gum arabic Hydrogen sulfide Plastic Lake Ozone depletion Sulfur Town gas Sewage treatment Carbon Water Abiogenic petroleum origin Volcano Ester Redox Origin of life Alcohol Nitrogen Formic acid Methanol Champagne (beverage) Sugar beet Titanium New Coke Ozone hole Aspartame Gas metal arc welding Coulometry Mass spectrometry Scuba set Chemical reaction Tea Paint Temperature Nuclear reactor Chocolate Uranium Benzene Polymer Greenhouse gas Petroleum Water purification Polyethylene terephthalate Greenhouse effect Stroke Aluminium Alcohol fuel Soil Alum Sugar substitute Hydrogen chloride Carbon dioxide sink Nuclear power Motor oil Sodium Action potential Liquid crystal Base (chemistry) Flue gas desulfurization Cellular respiration Miller-Urey experiment Wine
