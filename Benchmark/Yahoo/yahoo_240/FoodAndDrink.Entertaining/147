what company makes those candy ciggerates for kids that 'light up' when you blow on them i remember smoking those candy ciggerates when i was a kid but what i find more appealing today for candy ciggerates are the ones that light up red when you blow on them i saw my freind sucking and blowing on it but i can't find it anywhere i went to the candy store and asked but they said they don't have it they sugested looking it up on the internet but i can't find it anywhere too i decided to go to yahoo answers so please help me there were two different kids of candy cigarettes when i was a kid the first was a little stick of a compressed sugar product rather thin thinner than a real cigarette they were white except for one tip which was pink as if it was lit most had a light wintergreen flavor the second and the one i think you're remembering were bubble gum cigarettes they were the exact same dimension as real cigarettes and were a little cord of pink bubble gum they were wrapped in a piece of white paper with a beige end that looked like the filter the gum was coated with a little corn starch so when you blew into one end enough air would pass through the wrapper between the gum and create a little puff of corn starch powder to make smoke Chewing gum Bulk vending Bubblegum Tobacco Cigarette Topps Brewery Starch Glass Tea Plastic Soap bubble Cigar Jelly Belly M&M's Mojave people Tofu Sugar Dental caries Bong Kit Kat Wm.
