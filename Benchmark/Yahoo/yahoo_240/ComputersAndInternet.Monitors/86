i have a by screen resolution is a hz refresh rate safe i am using a forcer powerstrip it seems to safely go up to hz without crashing i am doing this because the normal hz gives me a headache very quickly is it safe to do this hz is too low a refresh rate even though hz is a standardized minimum refresh rates lower than hz causes a percievable flicker in crt monitors it can cause head aches and may be bad for the eye hz is a good rate it will not consume too much cpu and refresh is handled by the graphics processor so as long as your system runs smoothly go for a higher refresh rate Frame rate Refresh rate Interlace Atari 8-bit family Computer display Video Graphics Array NTSC Embedded system Liquid crystal display television IMac Cathode ray tube Central processing unit Computer animation Sinclair ZX81 TRS-80 Color Computer Liquid crystal display Original Amiga chipset Windows XP Computer display standard Persistence of vision PlayStation 3 SGI Indy Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Digital Visual Interface Laptop ATI Technologies Amstrad CPC Atari ST Super Nintendo Entertainment System Computer workstation CPU design Deinterlacing Apple Macintosh Personal computer 3dfx MIPS architecture Pixel Alternating current 1080p Apple Computer Commodore 64 PowerBook Color Graphics Adapter Sega Saturn Movie projector RISC Fuse (electrical) Apple IIGS NX bit Texas Instruments TMS9918 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Plasma display EMac Amiga Commodore 128 MOS Technology VIC-II MSX Light gun Motorola 68000 History of computer and video games Computer terminal Dynamic random access memory Screenshot Light-emitting diode ZX Spectrum AMD IBM PC compatible MP3 Console game PostScript Zilog Z80 Computer architecture CPU cache Nintendo 64 Silicon Graphics Laserdisc Redundant array of independent disks Digital Display resolution Game programming QuickDraw Fluorescent lamp TRS-80 PC Engine Windows Vista Athlon DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution High-definition television Inflation Xbox 360 Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Beatmania IIDX Oscilloscope Nintendo Entertainment System Sport utility vehicle Microsoft Windows Pentium 4 NVIDIA Nintendo Virtual Boy
