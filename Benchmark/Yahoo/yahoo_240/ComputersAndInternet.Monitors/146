so my computer is the problem i figured out that it wasn't actually my monitor that was the problem it was my computer but i have no absolute idea how to fix that my monitor goes to hibernation mode automatically when its turned on and it won't wake up but it's done that with two monitors so its obviously not the monitor and like i said i have no idea how to fix the problem if the problem is the actually computer tower itself help other than running a windows repair or system restore i would try changing the settings for hibernation apply then changing everything back to never and apply Windows XP Debugging Windows 2000 Microsoft Windows Screenshot Apollo Guidance Computer Patch (computing) Embedded system System/34 Modem Liquid crystal display Atari 8-bit family Mainframe computer Virtual memory Digital circuit U.S. Electoral College Personal computer Color Graphics Adapter Windows Vista IBM PC compatible Year 2000 problem System/36 Internet Explorer Windows Me Mercury Atlas 6 Automatic transmission Software bug Computer Windows Explorer Information Technology Infrastructure Library Anti-virus software Windows 3.x Hubble Space Telescope Computer terminal History of Microsoft Windows Toyota Prius System 7 (Macintosh) Computer virus MDAC Commodore 128 Blue screen of death Spyware Mathematics X86 NeXT Geodesy Digital Equipment Corporation Windows Server 2003 Screensaver Web design Mouse (computing) L4 microkernel family Central processing unit Steam (content delivery) IBM PC Addressing mode INMOS Transputer Trusted computing Complex number AmigaOS Microeconomics Newline Commodore 64 Von Neumann architecture Video Graphics Array TRS-80 Color Computer Computer display Mandriva Linux Version Opera (web browser) Four wheel drive Windows 95 Computer multitasking Rail terminology IA-32 GunZ The Duel Atari ST X86 assembly language Extreme Programming Linux Windows registry Multiplayer Apple II family Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Fsck Keynesian economics Amiga Computer and video games Virtual machine Server KIM-1 Common Unix Printing System STS-62 Internet Relay Chat Transmission (mechanics) Timeline of computing 1990-forward Ethernet Aliasing Pretty Good Privacy Hard disk
