what are the resolutions that the sony cpd g r can support i am at a very old to years system right now and am not sure what this crt monitor supports i know that with newer monitors one can not easily set an unsupported resolution but i do not know if that is still true with older monitors crts because of how crt works can support a very broad spectrum of resolutions usually for a crt it can get as low as x resolution and in your models case as high as x either way the model in question will most definitely accommodate any age pc you will have no problems running it on a windows machine Cathode ray tube IMac Apple II family Atari 8-bit family Gamut Apple Macintosh Amstrad CPC Laptop Windows XP PowerBook Oscilloscope Refresh rate Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Computer display Liquid crystal display television Color Graphics Adapter 1080p ZX Spectrum Plasma display Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Pixel Television Atari ST Personal computer Video Graphics Array Liquid crystal display EMac Super Nintendo Entertainment System History of operating systems Interlace SGI Indy Laserdisc Computer terminal PlayStation 2 Computer-aided design Xbox 360 Tungsten Handheld Sega Dreamcast Thread (computer science) Vorbis PowerPC USB flash drive Display resolution Amiga Device driver Amstrad PCW In The Groove (game) Computer display standard History of computer and video games Digital cinematography MIPS architecture Windows 3.x System 7 (Macintosh) Theory of constraints Degaussing MIPS Magnum Autodesk Media and Entertainment MSX Digital photography Mac OS X Dialysis Commodore 128 Commodore 64 S__CAM Automatic number plate recognition Dance Dance Revolution Digital cinema IBM PC compatible TRS-80 Color Computer IBM 5100 Visual Basic E-waste Linux Mouse (computing) Windows 2000 High-definition television Transformer IPod Windows registry Eye Sega Saturn Acorn Archimedes Server OS/2 Information Technology Infrastructure Library Commodore PET Digital projector Digital Equipment Corporation IBM 700/7000 series Light gun MP3 Sinclair QL Digital Visual Interface Screensaver Gamma correction Business Process Management Aliasing Kaypro
