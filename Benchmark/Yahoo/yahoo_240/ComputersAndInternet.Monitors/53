why does my computer say display switch set incorrectly when booted i have to press f to continue and then the computer works fine just curious as to what this means do you have on board graphics and a plug in graphics card if you do it may be that you haven't disabled the internal one you'll have to enter bios and force the machine to use the agp pci e card rather than the internal alternatively it the other way round it's set up for an external card and you need to tell it to use the internal one jbv Personal computer Computer bus Atari 8-bit family IBM PC PCI Express Apple Macintosh Peripheral Component Interconnect PC motherboard Windows 2000 Computer hardware GeForce 6 Series AmigaOS USB flash drive Front side bus Color Graphics Adapter Graphics processing unit TRS-80 IBM PC compatible ATI Technologies IPod Apple II family Expansion card Sinclair ZX81 Universal Serial Bus Windows Vista Knoppix Industry Standard Architecture BIOS Laptop GeForce 7 Series Graphics card Radeon X Series 3dfx Commodore 64 Motherboard History of operating systems Desktop computer Atari ST ZX Spectrum Power-On Self Test Windows XP Acorn Electron Power Macintosh G3 Apple Computer Mouse (computing) Hercules Graphics Card Modchip Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis GeForce FX Scalable Link Interface HyperTransport PC card SGI Octane Linux IBM Personal System/2 PC Engine History of the graphical user interface Texas Instruments TI-99/4A Jack plug Commodore 128 Sega Dreamcast PowerPC Nintendo GameCube Ethernet Slot machine Exidy Sorcerer NuBus ATX Screenshot GeForce 4 Redundant array of independent disks SCART Digital Visual Interface TRS-80 Color Computer MAME Cisco PIX Amiga KIM-1 Booting SAM Coup__ Open Firmware Enhanced Graphics Adapter Floppy disk MSX Video Graphics Array Windows 3.x Northbridge (computing) Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Radeon NVIDIA History of computer and video games Wintel Microprocessor PlayStation Portable PowerBook G3 Wheel of Fortune IMac PlayStation 2
