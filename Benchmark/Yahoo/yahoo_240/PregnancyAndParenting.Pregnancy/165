so its confirmed so its confirmed ladies im due on march this is my first baby do any of y'all have any advise first of all congratulations secondly read all you can about pregnancy and not jsut off of yahoo answers but do some reading on your own what to expect when your expecting is a good book and pregnancy for dummies and even though they are really sanitized versions of births try watching some birth shows on discovery health like birth day or house of babies i'd advise against watching maternity ward though because they tend to focus on only the high drama someone is either dying or in trouble births and that can cause more anxiety than help sign up for breast feeding classes and birthing classes but don't be afraid to scream the words i want my epidural when the breathing exercises aren't cutting it anymore take your prenatals and exercise and resist the temptation to sit down and eat ice cream and cookies because your pregnant and deserve it otherwise you may find you've changed to a larger permanent size after the baby is born or you'll have alot of post baby dieting to get anywhere close to where you used to be again congrats and good luck the first is always the most exciting Breastfeeding Obstetrics Pregnancy Childbirth Abortion Prenatal diagnosis Folic acid Guinea pig Infant Midwifery Postpartum depression Menstrual cycle Breech birth Abortion debate Caesarean section Hypertension Urinary incontinence Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Miscarriage Prenatal care Cytomegalovirus EastEnders Hypoglycemia Birth weight The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Fecal incontinence Abortion in the United States Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Dog Coffee Egg (food) Omega-3 fatty acid Coeliac disease Melanie Wilkes The Ashlee Simpson Show Mental retardation Diabetes mellitus Fetus Fertility awareness Pre- and perinatal psychology Giant Panda Obesity Congenital disorder Weight training $ale of the Century Virgin Mary in Islam Prolactinoma Pregnancy fetishism Anxiety Cliff Richard Mary, the mother of Jesus Tocopherol Anencephaly Theory of conduct George VI of the United Kingdom Cookie Monster Biology and sexual orientation Sesame Street Kodocha Sharon Tate Brassiere Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Cat Hamster Androgen insensitivity syndrome Hillary Rodham Clinton What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?
