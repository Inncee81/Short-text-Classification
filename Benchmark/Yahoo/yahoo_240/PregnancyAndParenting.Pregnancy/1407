did you have sex on bedrest sorry if it's a personal question i've just been put on bedrest and i don't think the doctor said anything about sex just curious to see what other people have done i know it's a little bit of a stupid question i'm just feeling a little stressed out now and the little things will take my mind off of it please understand i am weeks pregnant and have been on bedrest since weeks due to an incompetant cervix i was told no sex by my doctors i however haven't listened about times a weeks i am still having sex ask your doctor but chances are if they didn't say anything about it when they put you on bedrest then that isn't a restriction good luck with the baby Social rule Miscarriage Theory of conduct Pregnancy Singlish Milton H.
