what are my chances of going into labor before my th week im weeks and day my due date is sept i know that its only weeks and days left but it seems so far away i was just thinking about all the people i know and how they usually go into labor before weeks these are a few symptoms a lot of pressure down there i pee all the time sometimes i feel like i have to but cant diarrhea swelling pitting edema baby already weighs pounds losing weight more colastrum leaking bellys not getting any bigger lol the only thing the doc hasnt said anything about the baby dropping he said my cervix is closed and if i wont go into labor before th week do you think theres anyway i can tell him i want to be induced especially if the baby is going to be so big that i'll have to have a c section i really dont want to do that i want to have him natural please give me any information you can it will all come in handy please help thanks a lot kalens mommy oh do i remember the day when i felt exactly like you do ready for baby to be here there are stages that have to happen on your next visit be blunt with the dr ask all of the questions tell him that you know you are close what are the options he'll explain what is best for you and your baby he'll walk you through it should baby is healthy i went into labour in my th week you do not want that any time before the th week the baby could be under developed so best thing for you to do is ask the nurse before you see the doc your next visit or call the dr's office they can ask the nurse of doc to call you back with that info you don't necessarily have to be in the office so much is happening right now inside your body that if you had a computer in there it would not keep up with it all the baby doubles size in the last trimester the longer you wait to th week the healthier that baby will be for delivery your body will go through it naturally so if you think it's cookie cutter going to go as your best friend did em nope god has specially chosen time just for you and baby go take a hot bath thank god your belly isn't bigger and relax pressure is normal and i would say the baby is dropping you just feel like the feet are in your throat that means the baby is positioning if either one of you is losing weight you need to call the docs office relax say it with me now relax get some rest call the docs office and sleep you are going to need all the rest you can get Obstetrics Childbirth Breastfeeding Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Social rule Breech birth Humphrey Bogart Abortion debate Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Infantilism Prostate cancer Diabetic retinopathy AFI 100 Years series Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Stomach cancer Traumatic brain injury Carpal tunnel syndrome Jon Secada Dieting Puberty Intact dilation and extraction Abortion Poker jargon Equine conformation Big Brother UK series 6 Characters in the Smurfs Professional wrestling holds EastEnders Toilet humour Radiohead Diving The Emancipation of Mimi Goodness and value theory Strap-on dildo Dialysis Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Diarrhea The Shining (film) Out-of-body experience Friends Group A streptococcal infection Skateboarding trick Fertility awareness Clinical depression Menstrual cup Professional wrestling throws Cancer Aerial (dance move) Cliff Richard Fast bowling Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Spice Girls Drowning Androgen insensitivity syndrome Carburetor Shaggy dog story Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Sant Thakar Singh Sleep Miscarriage Kyle Broflovski Internal ballistics Wal-Mart Super Size Me RuneScape quests Night (book) Common cold 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Cytomegalovirus Fecal incontinence Child sexuality Hyperthermia Extreme Programming Theory of conduct Pok__mon Abilities Rodney Anoai The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Psoriasis Mass Shen Gong Wu Bayes' theorem Coeliac disease Prenatal diagnosis Piccolo Junior Saga Doc Holliday Rais massacre Mario Kart: Double Dash!!
