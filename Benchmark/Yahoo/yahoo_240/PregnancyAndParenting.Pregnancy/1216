is it possible to continue school months pregnant hi everyone i have this crazy plan and i am asking myself if it is because i am from such a crazy city like new york i am about months pregnant in september i will continue going to school i will finish in december and consequently i will be months in january i will start a spring semester of months i am not sure what my due date is i will know it soon but i assume that is going to be march or april my school has a spring recess around this time if god bless i give birth mid march april then i will take a week off i will notify professors if that does not fall in to recess come back to school and continue till may the month when my school is finished my mom will help to watch a kid for more months then i will have an entire summer to be with him or her is it realistic yes it's absolutely realistic the only thing that is concerning is only taking a week off to have the baby then going immediately back depending on your delivery and how everything goes with yours and the baby's health it seems quite daunting to go back to being well enough for classes again within just a week and of course you can't predict exactly when you'll have the baby which you already know but i'd say finish school or at least try to and if the baby doesn't come according to plan just be really up front with your professors and ask them for an extension or to take your final exams from home something like that i commend you for wanting to finish school keep that attitude and you'll be so much better off throughout your life congrats and good luck Academic term Pregnancy EastEnders Charmed Kodocha One Tree Hill (TV series) Friends Futurama (TV series - season 2) Sharon Tate Education in Germany Gregorian calendar Education in Romania New York Giants Humphrey Bogart Daylight saving time The Apprentice 3 Bah__'__ timeline USS Ticonderoga (CV-14) Breastfeeding Knots Landing USS Wallace L.
