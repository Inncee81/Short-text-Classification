do you feel like you breath heavier i am only weeks but my hhusband asked me last night if i was ok because i was breathing so heavy and i noticed it today was well what do you think and i am not overweight ok maybe a little but not obese and did not have this issue before getting pregnant ive never had thyroid issues i dont feel like i am breathing heavy and have no problem catching my breath i live in nyc and they did mention today that the air quality was extremely bad today it is also like degrees so early it's a bit strange but i would talk to your doctor as you progress in the pregnancy you'll find that the pressure the baby puts on your lungs and the extra oxygen requirement of the baby will make you breath heavier however if you aren't doing anything and having trouble breathing you need to talk to your doctor asap Miscarriage Premature birth Breastfeeding Scuba set Liquid breathing Obstetrics Sleep apnea Pregnancy Breech birth Drowning Equine conformation Fetus Rebreather Breathing gas Decompression sickness Theory of conduct Traumatic brain injury Carbon dioxide Social rule Myocardial infarction Friends Mattress Xenon Infant respiratory distress syndrome Cancer Exercise Diving cylinder Coeliac disease Pneumonia Boston Public Childbirth Lung Hypertension In vitro fertilisation House of M Mechanical ventilation Tobacco smoking Abortion Halitosis Prostate cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Diving Adjustable gastric band Abortion debate Folic acid Prolactinoma Urinary incontinence Diving regulator Pulmonary embolism Turner syndrome Shock Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Breath Ron and Fez Fire fighting EastEnders Boom Town (Doctor Who) Medicine The Curse of Fenric Emphysema Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Bird Stomach cancer Beetle in an Anthill Prenatal diagnosis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hydrogen sulfide Reptile Pneumothorax Respiratory system Conspiracy (TNG episode) Asthma Diabetes mellitus Jet engine Captain Thunderbolt Air embolism Mental retardation Opie and Anthony Psoriasis Cancer of the larynx Obesity Lung cancer 2000 Australian Grand Prix Cytomegalovirus First aid Dorothy L.
