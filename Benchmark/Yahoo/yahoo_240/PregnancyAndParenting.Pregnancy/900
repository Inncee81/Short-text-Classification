to all moms to be how does implatation pain feels like and for how long did u feel it implantation cramping can feel like pms cramps actual menstrual cramps like being poked with a sharp hot needle or like someone's sewed a string on your uterus and given it a few sharp tugs pretty icky it happens when the fertilized egg burrows into the uterus and can last up to a few weeks some embryos seem to dig in and settle quickly and some take their sweet time about it i had it for a few weeks and it was pretty unsettling but it went away however after that your uterus starts to grow rapidly and that can bring the next strange set of pains until week i had intermittent pain that felt like something was pinching me from the inside i used to give my belly a pat and tell the baby to stop pinching mum i asked both my doctor and my midwife and both said that pregnancy comes with so many bizarre aches and pains and not to stress about it too much Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Childbirth Obstetrics In vitro fertilisation Endometriosis Ectopic pregnancy Sexual reproduction Uterus Twin Ovulation Emergency contraception Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Abortion Embryo transfer Endometrium Ovary Female reproductive system (human) Premature birth Gonorrhoea Breastfeeding Infertility Breech birth Ovum Sexual intercourse EastEnders Birth control Amniotic sac Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Oral contraceptive Pregnancy (mammals) Cervix Urinary incontinence Kodocha Fertility awareness Human cloning Cramp Premenstrual stress syndrome Endometrial cancer Pain Platypus Menstrual cup Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Stem cell Comanche Estrus cycle Abdominal pain Dialysis Fetal development Multiple birth Chemical abortion Human development Intact dilation and extraction Xenomorph Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Intravenous therapy Prostate cancer Acupuncture Abduction Phenomenon Milton H.
