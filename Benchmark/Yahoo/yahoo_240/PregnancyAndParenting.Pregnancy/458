what happens if you get pregnant too soon after a c section i was told by my doc to wait at least months before getting pregnant again following my c section we are using protection but what would happen if by accident i got pregnant before that is there a risk that the sutures would rapture inside or any other risk regardless of a c section or vaginal everyone should give their bodies that year recovery time doctors tell you this because your muscles hormones skin everything needs time to heal and get back on a normal cycle after having a child a c section takes longer to recover from but i do not think that your doctor was saying specifically because of that you should not have children for a year my doc told me that too and i delivered naturally nothing to worry about if you did in fact get pregnant it's usually no big deal it may be a little more difficult because your body has not fully healed but nature has a way of making things work Pregnancy Childbirth Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Prostate cancer Fertility awareness Urinary incontinence Suture Caesarean section Oral contraceptive Breech birth Tocopherol Strap-on dildo Obstetrics Glucocorticoid Acne Breastfeeding Growth hormone treatment Psoriasis Traumatic brain injury Phoebe Halliwell In vitro fertilisation Partial-birth abortion Menstrual cup Androgen insensitivity syndrome Human adaptation to space Anabolic steroid Ozone depletion Cephalic disorder Radiation therapy Menstrual cycle Fecal incontinence Spina bifida The Venture Bros.
