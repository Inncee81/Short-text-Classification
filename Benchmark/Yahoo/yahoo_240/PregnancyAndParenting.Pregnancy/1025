does the pull out method works well my cousin called me today and we were talking about babies so she told me that she and her boyfriend has been using the pull out method for a year and months and she never used any protection or birth control so i was wondering why did the method work for her they both can have children but it seems like the method does works so my question is why didn't she get pregnant yet thanks the pull out method withdraw method is effective depending upon what he is pulling it out of but if you are using the withdaw method to prevent pregnancy during vaginal sex you are taking a big risk before a man ejaculates he produces pre ejaculatory fluid this acts as a lubricant inside the man's urethra the pre ejaculatory fluid contains some sperm and cause your friend to get pregnant so she is rolling the dice sooner or later she will lose Birth control Condom Safe sex Sexual intercourse Oral sex Fertility awareness Prostate cancer Orgasm Oral contraceptive Ejaculation Androgen insensitivity syndrome Penis In vitro fertilisation Pornographic movie Pregnancy Abortion debate Abortion Spina bifida Testicle Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Obstetrics Vagina Pre-ejaculate Breastfeeding Gonorrhoea Strap-on dildo Puberty EastEnders Coitus interruptus Semen Menstrual cup Sexual dysfunction Medical analysis of circumcision Infertility Premature ejaculation Miscarriage Emergency contraception Vaginal lubrication Intact dilation and extraction Intersex surgery Knots Landing Prenatal diagnosis Anal sex Childbirth Masturbation Sex toy Foreskin Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Intersexuality AIDS Male reproductive system (human) Cytomegalovirus Premature birth Neighbours Friction Elephant Breech birth Married... with Children Teenage pregnancy Child sexuality Personal lubricant Friends Sterilization (surgical procedure) Kodocha Jam (TV series) Partial-birth abortion Abortion in the United States Female ejaculation Cephalic disorder Paroxetine Adoption Birth weight Folic acid Boston Public Kate Vaiden Amniotic sac Sex and the City Herpes simplex virus History of As the World Turns (2000-present) History of sex Sami Brady Multiple sclerosis Sex education Social rule Fire fighting Humphrey Bogart Douche Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Craps Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters Psoriasis Sex organ Babe Carey Masters and Johnson Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Democratic Party (United States) Endometriosis
