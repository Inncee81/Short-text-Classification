i don't want my wife to get pregnant my wife and i have been trying to have a baby for about years now and she has had miscarriages it has made us become distant and our relationship has become very strained we don't have the fun we used to and since the last time she miscarried we have hardly had one decent conversation i almost don't want her to get pregnant now so she doesn't get hurt again and we are pushed to the brink of divorce is this normal to want to give up is there any way we can get back to normal i know a baby would do the trick but i have a gut feeling that that will never happen we are both btw thanks for anyone who helps i think you just need to look at it from her point of view she thinks its her fault that she cant have a baby and she feels guilty and useless even though i'm sure you love her enough to know that its not her fault she still feels this way so you might want to try to get close to her take away the pressure of wanting to have a baby from her because she feels like she cant please you have you guys considered adopting i'm sure there are plenty of babies in need of good parents and you guys seem to be good candidates since you really want a baby its normal to want to give up just dont give up on the relationship talk to her tell her how much you care and like i said before just take away the pressure of you wanting a baby talking is the best way to get things back to normal if you really want to have a baby have you guys consulted a doctor about this although i dont suggest taking fertility pills b c of the high risk of having tripplets or even quintuplets for that matter trust me as long as you guys stop worrying about having a baby you guys can focus on your love and relationship instead try to be good and have a little bit of patience she'll come around good luck EastEnders Friends Abortion debate Social rule Knots Landing Theory of conduct Charmed Pregnancy Humphrey Bogart Transactional analysis Miscarriage Sharon Tate Neighbours Phoebe Halliwell Kodocha Jon Secada Infantilism Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Breastfeeding Sex and the City The Ashlee Simpson Show Birth control Characters in the Smurfs Milton H.
