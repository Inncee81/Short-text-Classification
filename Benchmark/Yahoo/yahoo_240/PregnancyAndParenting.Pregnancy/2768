doctors appoitment this morn detailssssssss i went to my doctors appointment this morning he said i was progressing very well and fast im effaced and cm dialted he told me that it should be any day now how can he tell that its going to be any day and not any week he has me so excited and i cant wait for the baby to come d i know its true that some women stay at cm dialated for quite some time but he said that i should be going into labor anyday how does he know that the fact that you are effaced is what i would imagine has him saying any day i was cm dialated for the last weeks of my last pregnancy but because i was hardly effaced they couldn't say when exactly i would start going into labor when you are effaced that means the lining of your uterus is thinning so even cm of dialation could be enought to get labor started and then the baby would probably come quick since you are already half way there so to speak good luck Pregnancy Childbirth Breech birth Cervix Miscarriage Obstetrics In vitro fertilisation Premature birth Recurring South Park characters Caesarean section Social rule Intact dilation and extraction Abortion Shaggy dog story Androgen insensitivity syndrome Morning sickness Emergency contraception Gonorrhoea Aquarium (album) Friends Urinary incontinence 2000 Australian Grand Prix EastEnders Cornelia Rau Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Landing at Anzac Cove One Life to Live Franz Boas Spina bifida 24 Hours of Le Mans Care Bears Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Twin Prenatal diagnosis AFI 100 Years series Lost in Translation (poem) Days of our Lives Amniotic sac The Red Pony Jon Secada Night (book) Paul Is Dead Jennifer Lopez Simone Weil Piccolo Junior Saga Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Breastfeeding Humphrey Bogart Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Ebola Ben Johnson (athlete) Brian Close The Contender (television series) Embryo transfer Ocean's Twelve Psoriasis Knots Landing Estrus cycle The Curse of Fenric Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Father's Day (Doctor Who) Death Comes to Time Partial-birth abortion Uterus Endometrial cancer Norway national football team Whitney Houston The Unquiet Dead The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Maya calendar Fetal development Operation Market Garden Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Gough Whitlam Birth weight Sexual reproduction Roswell UFO incident Abortion debate 9/11 conspiracy theories Elephant John Wesley Harding (album) Sabbath True Crime: Streets of LA Eight hour day Deconstruction Oral contraceptive Volleyball New Morning Ramadan Ectopic pregnancy Always Be My Baby Melanie Wilkes Hijra (South Asia) Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Birth control John Kerr Cliff Richard
