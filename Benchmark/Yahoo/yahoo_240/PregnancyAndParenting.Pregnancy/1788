nipple rings pregnancy and breastfeeding so i have had my nippples pierced for oh years now i am weeks pregnant i go to the doc on monday but am curious now lol if i plan on breasfeeding should i take my rings out now and let them heal up obviously i will take them out when i am actually breasfeeding and replace when done because i would like to keep them peirced although it hurt so so much if i let them heal i will not be getting them repeirced what do you guys think anyone have a similar situation if it matters they are loops with the peircing going straight across through the middle gage i believe all in all i want to do whatever is best and safest for my upcoming child and it would just be a bonus if i could keep them peirced i only ask now because if they should heal up before i give birth then i needed to take them out like a while ago slow healers they are lol thanks for all input i am weeks with my nipple rings still in i plan on breastfeeding the doctor only said something about taking them out because of swelling and she wouldn't want me to lose a barbell all the stories that i have read or looked up info about said they had no problems taking out the barbells or rings during feedings jus make sure to keep them clean because of milk buildup so i doubt this will be a problem leaking milk all day anyway you will most likely wash alot so the chances of a clogged milk duct would be silm to none i say leave them in until you noticed that your breast are too swollen or when your ready to give birth i also wanted to keep mine pierced bcuz of the pain the first time i havent had any problems with them at all the whole time i have been pregnant either good luck Breastfeeding Nipple piercing Pregnancy Fertility awareness Nipple Breast Childbirth Infant Guinea pig Earring Obstetrics Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Body piercing Baby bottle Dairy Mammary gland Prolactin Weight training Brassiere Premature birth Psoriasis Tongue piercing Barbell (piercing) Knots Landing Folic acid Charmed Urinary incontinence Mastitis Cytomegalovirus Birth control The Contender (television series) EastEnders Prince Albert piercing Traumatic brain injury Married... with Children Prolactinoma Medical analysis of circumcision Breast reduction In vitro fertilisation Ayyavazhi mythology Friends Oxytocin Fecal incontinence Tattoo Miscarriage Carpal tunnel syndrome Turner syndrome Nine Inch Nails Breast milk Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Apollo 8 Eddie Guerrero Abortion debate Coeliac disease Platypus Acne Daredevil Jon Secada Mystique (comics) Spina bifida Ocean's Twelve Mouth ulcer The Caves of Androzani The Emancipation of Mimi Haloperidol Leon White Hyperprolactinaemia Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Jaundice Menstrual cycle Characters of Naruto Insulin Textile manufacturing Warrior (World of Warcraft) Boom Town (Doctor Who) Adjustable gastric band Elephant Janet Jackson Tank Nudity Plame affair RuneScape weapons Piccolo Junior Saga Babe Ruth Condom Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Hip fracture Scientology beliefs and practices Shaggy dog story Milk Breast pump John Lennon Androgen insensitivity syndrome Tocopherol Refractive surgery Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Lord of the Rings
