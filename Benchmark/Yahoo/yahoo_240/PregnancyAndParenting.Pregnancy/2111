arrrggghhh my best friend is pregnant unexpectedly and is due in about a month now and i have been trying to get pregnant since before she found out she was it is so frustrating watching her get all ready and excited even though i am definitely very excited and supportive of her and her baby and will do anything for her or my little godson when hes born but has anybody else been in the same boat how do you deal with it i realise that some people get pregnant easier and quicker then others but y know when your trying and everybody else around you seems to be pregnant it does start to get you wondering why your not getting pregnant my best friend of my cousins and the girl that works with me are all pregnant so i cant get away from it and the worst thing is that they were all accidental pregnancies i know how frustrating it is i have gone through the same thing and i just got angry on everything around me my fate god my luck i tried to conceive for a year and then started treatment the doc couldnt find any problem my problem was unexplained infertility while the treatment was going on for yrs my friends cousins all of them got married and had children not one but two and here i was still undergoing treatment i remember going to weddings directly from a doctors appointment and then hear that particular couple is gonna have a baby and i was still running to the doc how angry i was on god for what he was doing to me two of the couple didnt even plan and found out they are going to have a baby and they were in for a shock while others conceived in the very first month and i was always thinking how it has taken me one year of trying and and half yrs of treatment while others are getting pregnant in the first month itself or without any effort why me when i go to god i will ask him this question i think there is always a right time for the right thing it was so frustrating to take painful injections every month and then see my periods while others conceived easily i was mentally so upset that i had to go to a rabbi i am jewish to ask why god is doing this to me or u can say what wrong did i do to suffer so much the answer he gave changed my life he said i havent done anything wrong and that my soul is pure so god is taking his time to make the perfect child with a pure soul for you and he will give it to you when he sees the time is right maybe god is seeing u have problems in your life and it isnt the right time to give u a child so he is waiting to see when you wont have any problems and then he will hand over this pure soul in your arms so that u can take care of him better than what u can in your present circumstances i dont know if it was true but it sure made me feel better i can perfectly understand what u r going through go to the doctor find out if theres any problem and keep in mind what have written above i bet u will feel much better and get a confidence to fight your fate Friends EastEnders Pregnancy Abortion debate Episodes of Lost (Season 1) In vitro fertilisation Days of our Lives Jon Secada Social rule God Emperor of Dune Marriage Childbirth Friedrich Schleiermacher Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Neighbours Father's Day (Doctor Who) Sant Thakar Singh Soul Birth control Milton H.
