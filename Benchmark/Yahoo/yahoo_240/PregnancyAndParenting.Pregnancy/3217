physical therapy and pregnancy so my question is does anyone know what they do in physical therapy with a pregnant person i am weeks and have horrible back pain and have been recomended for physical therapy and don't know what to expect physical therapy for back pain during pregnancy can be tricky there are many things that cannot or should not be done such as ultrasound as mentioned above certain exercises you will not be able to do such as anything requiring you to lie on your stomach i once had a pregnant patient who really needed to do an exercise on her stomach to get the full effects she was too pregnant to do this so we really took a more pallative approach showing her painmanagement strategies such as good body mechanics and issued her a pregnancy belt once she delivered the baby she was able to return for the full program the type of treatment you receive will depend on the examination findings on the first day they will mostly take a history and perform an exam they will most likely look at your flexiblity and pelvis externally they will use these findings to determine if you need simple exercises or just some advice sometimes treatment really becomes about keeping the pain from getting worse as opposed to making it better as the pain tends to increase the further along in the pregnancy you are good luck and congrats Stomach cancer Prostate cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Obstetrics Medicine Pregnancy Miscarriage Radiation therapy Psoriasis Stroke Abortion Cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Urinary incontinence Abortion debate Ectopic pregnancy Multiple sclerosis Endometriosis Folic acid Chiropractic Breast cancer Cerebral palsy Childbirth Clinical depression Adjustable gastric band In vitro fertilisation Weight training Prolactinoma Prenatal diagnosis Massage Doxepin Alcoholism Carpal tunnel syndrome Cytomegalovirus Breastfeeding Antidepressant Malignant melanoma Duchenne muscular dystrophy Esophageal cancer Paracetamol Exercise Psychotherapy Clomipramine Drug abuse Breech birth Obesity Aortic dissection Palliative care Intravenous therapy Diazepam Anxiety Autism Maprotiline Oncology Haloperidol Insulin Teenage pregnancy Turner syndrome Cephalic disorder Iliotibial band syndrome Spanking Colorectal cancer Hypertension Polycystic ovary syndrome Tocopherol Pulmonary embolism Herpes simplex virus Acute lymphoblastic leukemia Twin Gonorrhoea Shock Scientology beliefs and practices Spina bifida Paget's disease of bone Acupuncture Chlorpromazine Traumatic brain injury Repetitive strain injury Schizophrenia Traumatic incident reduction Bone marrow transplant Stuttering Endometrial cancer Asthma Bipolar disorder Mesothelioma Reparative therapy Addiction Roe v.
