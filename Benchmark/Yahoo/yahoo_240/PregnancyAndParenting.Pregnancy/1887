i don't want to freak my family or boyfriend out but i think i may be pregnant before you tell me to buy a pregnancy test i really don't want to do that yet i don't want to take it too early or anything but i keep thinking that perhaps i'm pregnant last month july i had no period at all this month i have yet to have it i have pms like symptoms but my period just wont come sore breasts nausea all the time headaches and cramps are what i'm having i'm not sure if these are signs of pregnancy or not i don't want to take a test too soon and have it come out negative if i am pregnant so i wanted to ask if i should bother and if so when should i thank you so much also i am years old i live with my boyfriend and my friend so i'm not a year old or anything i'm worried about telling my parents because i don't want to worry them right now seeing as i moved out only a few months ago are you eating enough calories or working out more than usual if you have an eating disorder or your body fat percentage is too low then you may miss periods i realize you said you do not want to take a pregnancy test however there are tests like e p t that is at a drugstore that determine whether or not you are pregnant within a few days of your missed period since you did not have a period last month a test taken now should be pretty accurate knowing is better than not knowing i understand that this can be a scary time but take it one step at a time take a trip to the drugstore and grab a test like e p t or first response regardless of if it is positive or negative you will want to call your doctor to share the results and your symptoms if it is positive then you will want a physician to confirm this if it is negative then you will want your doctor to determine the cause of your symptoms and missed periods i hope this helps Pregnancy Folic acid Breastfeeding Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Prostate cancer Cytomegalovirus EastEnders Obstetrics Psoriasis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Anorexia nervosa Autism HIV test Hypoglycemia Miscarriage Chronic fatigue syndrome Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Friends Migraine Stomach cancer Anxiety Stroke Pregnancy test Humphrey Bogart Clinical depression Cancer Traumatic brain injury Urinary incontinence Tocopherol Group A streptococcal infection Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Charles Darwin's illness Adult attention-deficit disorder Controversies in autism Marilyn Monroe Knots Landing Multiple sclerosis Neighbours Cephalic disorder One Tree Hill (TV series) Gonorrhoea Doxepin Hay fever Acupuncture Medicine Hepatitis C Decompression sickness Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis Haloperidol Endometriosis Ovarian cancer Prenatal diagnosis Hypertension Child sexuality Breast cancer Pneumonia Propranolol LSD Gastroparesis One Life to Live Syringomyelia Tobacco smoking Schizophrenia Transsexuality Obesity Drug test Androgen insensitivity syndrome Premature birth Asthma Malaria Omega-3 fatty acid Spina bifida Shaggy dog story Sharon Tate Veganism Milton H.
