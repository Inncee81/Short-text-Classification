is it ok to have a filling while pregnant hi everyone i need to have a filling removed and have it re filled again is this safe in pregnancy local anaesthetic x rays etc thank you for your help hi hayley its not advisable to have any x rays in pregnancy let the dentist know and he wont do any latest research shows that mercury is unsafe to be used in the mouth of a prgnant woman if the old filling is mercury the dentist will probabley either prefer to wait until you have had the baby before drilling it out as there is a risk that your baby could absorb some of the mercury whilst its being drilled out of the tooth or use a dental dam which minimises the risk of you absorbing any mercury in the process the dentist would use white filling material instead of mercury to fill the tooth with instead of mercury as for local anaesthetic there is a type that is safe for using in pregnant women good luck Tooth Dental caries Tooth enamel Dental fillings Breastfeeding Mercury (element) Oral sex Abortion Crown (dentistry) Oral hygiene Amalgam Pregnancy Coeliac disease My Family (television) Anesthesia In vitro fertilisation Dentistry Mercury (planet) The Dentist Folic acid Gingivitis Miscarriage Scar Omega-3 fatty acid Prolactinoma Ultraviolet Bruxism Thimerosal Cytomegalovirus Psoriasis Drill bit Multiple sclerosis Obstetrics Nuclear power Birth control Menstrual cycle Breech birth Breathing gas Abortion in the United States Diethylstilbestrol Premature birth Nutrition Dental brace Dentures Dental floss Tobacco smoking Clomipramine Childbirth Ectopic pregnancy Abortion debate Aluminium Prenatal diagnosis Cocaine Nitrous oxide Car safety Panama Canal Locks Toxoplasmosis Halitosis Mercury 4 Nuclear reactor Stem cell Harm reduction Dam Urinary incontinence Intact dilation and extraction Acne Ford Crown Victoria Airbag Mercury Records Stroke Coffee Root canal Spina bifida Oral contraceptive Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Caesarean section Xenon Guinea pig Roe v.
