is it possible that i would be preg while on bc yes sigh i'm asking one of those questions that only a test can truly answer anyhow i think i'm crazy b c i keep thinking that something weird is going on but there's no way i'm pregnant i have been on bc pills for years have never missed i take them religiously and at the same time so these weird things must be a coincidence right i'm just wanting some reassurance my last period lasted days instead of but it was more than just spotting i asked a after my period ended the same symptoms are still present more i cry all the time for no reason i have cramps i have been nauseus but not vomited diizzy i have blurred vision headaches tired i really do not want to take a test but would rather get some reassurance that it's just stress or something wait a few weeks to make sure my next one is normal so please let me know that it is not possible for me to be pregnant when i've been so careful so that i can throw this thought out of my head it is possible i got pregnant twice on birth control miscarried both times and i also had never missed one you still had a period so its unlikely however some women still have a period for the first couple months of pregnancy my mom got prego w me while on bc and had periods after being pregnant sounds like your other symptoms are more related to stress than anything so being worried that it's pregnancy might be exacerbating them Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Psoriasis Fertility awareness Obstetrics Oral contraceptive Endometriosis Breastfeeding Hypertension Abortion Charles Darwin's illness Childbirth Shaggy dog story EastEnders Stomach cancer Gonorrhoea The Inside Multiple sclerosis Cytomegalovirus Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Prolactinoma Knots Landing Birth control Apollo 8 Premature birth Traumatic brain injury Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Diabetes mellitus Stillbirth Charmed M__ni__re___s disease Guinea pig Diabetic retinopathy Spina bifida Emergency contraception Folic acid Melanie Wilkes Tocopherol Morning sickness Pregnancy test Turner syndrome Prostate cancer Sharon Tate Panic attack Transsexuality Pregnancy fetishism Cephalic disorder Elvis and Me Roe v.
