epidural with or without this is my first child i am going to try and be strong my mother gave birth to children with no pain reliever one with pitocin and one with extra wide shoulders p im sure i can do it well i hope just wanted some to hear some of your expeirences with and without a epidural what would you suggest keep im mind in petrified of the epidural needle i'm not getting an epidural my mom had six births without it and each of my sisters had at least birth without it natural is generally the safest thing for you and your baby unless there is some particular reason other than pain to get it like your labor is not progressing despite what people say the epidural does cross the placenta and get to the baby even if it is just a little bit i read a study that said that babies who were born to moms who got epidurals had more trouble breastfeeding in the first few weeks and who knows what other complications can be with an epidural you are much more likely to have an episiotomy because you can't really feel down there enough to be very helpful with the pushing you are also more likely to end up with a c section also one of my sisters who ended up with an epi with one of her kids still has pain where at the injection site nearly years later so my advice commit yourself to not having the epidural but if something comes up during labor and your doctor feels it's the best thing for you don't feel like you failed oh yeah and remember that women have been giving birth to babies with no epidurals for thousands of years and they still do it throughout much of the world Childbirth Epidural Breastfeeding Caesarean section Obstetrics Pregnancy Local anesthesia Humphrey Bogart Breech birth Traumatic brain injury Charmed Twin Miscarriage Characters of Lost In vitro fertilisation Jon Secada Premature birth Lumbar puncture Fertility awareness Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Abortion debate Sharon Tate Urinary incontinence Intact dilation and extraction Milton H.
