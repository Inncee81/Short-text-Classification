is yrs old too young to have a baby my boyfriend and i live together and have been a couple for years just wondering what everyone's opinion is on this topic he's i'm we're not partiers i go to college and he works full time going to college is very difficult with a baby unless your university offers some kind of daycare it's almost impossible even then most daycares won't accept newborns i suppose if you could somehow plan your pregnancy so you would give birth during the summer and didn't go to summer school you might be able to make the transition but that's very hard to do i got pregnant when i was and in college with my now husband however i had a miscarriage but before i had my miscarriage i cannot tell you how much my mom lectured me and blah blah blah i don't know how your mom is but i'm assuming all moms are the same in this regard if you're willing to put up with that and you feel emotionally mature enough to handle the stress of children and college and you're sure you're in a long lasting committed relationship i don't see why you shouldn't have a baby Pregnancy Miscarriage Abortion debate Abortion Friends Neighbours Knots Landing Childbirth Breastfeeding Boston Public Birth control Iggy Pop EastEnders Infantilism Infant History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Obstetrics Sex and the City Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Dinah Marler Anne Boleyn Abortion in the United States Marilyn Monroe Stillbirth Sharon Tate Charmed Angelina Jolie Kodocha Marriage Elephant Adoption Days of our Lives Spina bifida Glen Jacobs Lucille Ball Kindergarten Amy Dumas Teenage pregnancy Intact dilation and extraction Theory of conduct Melanie Wilkes Everwood Social rule Baby Blues Little Britain Twin Midwifery Infant baptism Polyamory Religion and abortion Humphrey Bogart In vitro fertilisation Jon Secada Futurama (TV series - season 2) Justification (theology) Day care Homosexuality and transgender Postpartum depression Henry VIII of England Prenatal diagnosis Transsexuality Avenue Q Babe Carey Graduate school The Ashlee Simpson Show Street-Legal Cartman Joins NAMBLA Full House Series finale The Adventures of Pete & Pete Generation Y The O.C.
