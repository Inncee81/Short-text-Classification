i am and having my st kid in weeks i am really scared i am so scared i'm about to have a kid i don't even know if i want her i know that is a bad thing to say but i had a really bad experience while pregnant i don't know if i can do this being a single young mother i do not think i was ready for a child the father is not supportive so it hurts even more i think she deserves better then what i can give her i try to be positive about the situation but tears bring my joy down everyday some say i will not be able to party or date that my life is over and i made a big mistake by not getting an abortion i am starting to feel this way to i do not know what to do i know if i give her up for adoption my family and peers will look down on me the father says its my fault and i have to live with the consequences and that i can't date or go out that my life is over and tells me i can't raise this child i need some serious advice i feel like i am losing it hey there i'm sorry you're having such a tough time your mind must be racing i think it is a personal decision whether you want to keep your baby or not and i won't be the one to make the decision for you i'm just here to give you some advice first of all don't go through this alone tell your friends and family how you are feeling let them help you sort your feelings out this could all be because you're nearing the end of the pregnancy if you do decide to keep the baby even though the father says it's your fault don't believe him it takes two people to get pregnant if you have to take him to court and get child support if you are too afraid to talk to your family amd friends go to a psychologist psychiatrist or talk to you ob gyn having a child is a big responsibility but also comes with some big rewards whatever you decide to do make sure you have thought long and hard and research your options and good luck EastEnders One Tree Hill (TV series) Pregnancy Jon Secada Transactional analysis Friends Theory of conduct Kodocha Infantilism Laura Schlessinger Everwood Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Social rule Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pitaten The Adventures of Pete & Pete Knots Landing About a Boy Alcoholics Anonymous The Ashlee Simpson Show Milton H.
