hi my best friend is pregnant need advise well she has not started her period in weeks she is really scared she is about to turn on the of this month she took a pregnancy test at home and it was she has decide to not go through the pregnancy so my question is what are her options to terminate the pregnancy please no answer about she shouldn't do that i already talked to her about keeping it and this is her decision and i am going to respect that i just want whats best for her i need some advise and some facts what is safe for her thank you to be completely honest i have never answered a question about abortion because i am against it regardless it sounds like you are trying to be mature about this situation that she is in my advice would be that she tell her family and the father first despite the laws morally the father has a right to know her parents need to know and help her with this situation once all parties are informed she can get the proper medical treatment should she still choose to do so although i do not agree with this your friend needs to be sure to go to a licensed physician do not try anything stupid like falling down the stairs to terminate a pregnancy you never should but if she has already made the decision do not let her do anything without talking to everyone involved first good luck to both of you and god bless also i know you have tried to talk her out of it but maybe you could find some information on people who have been where she is personally i was pregnant at i am now blessed with a beautiful month old daughter and i am graduating college this year i am only now with the right support system it can be done i had no support from my parents but i made it work there are solutions for everything i am living proof that it will be extremely hard but the rewards of your child are amazing you can still have a life and bring one into the world if you get your priorities straight just thought i'd throw that in there since i've been where your friend has been good luck to you both and be sure to use protection from now on Abortion debate Roe v.
