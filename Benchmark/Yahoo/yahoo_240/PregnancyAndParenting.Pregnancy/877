i'm flying while pregnant soon and need advice i am weeks pregnant and i am stationed in europe in two weeks i am flying back to the states and i am scared of the international flight what i am most afraid of is how my body will react i've been getting severe heartburn and i never know when i have to go to the bathroom i'm also worried about getting dehydrated for those who have done an international flight while pregnant especially recently with all these rules on what you can't take past the gates how did you cope what did you snack on when you had heartburn tums alone don't always work for me what did you do about the bathroom issues what about coping with the jet lag i have flown hundreds of times before and i am aware of the flight procedures including meals seatbelts take offs landings etc my main concern is that by the time i get to my final destination i will have traveled for hours i'm worried about what my body will do and how to cope during that time try to get in an aisle seat so that it is easier to get up and go to the bathroom and so you have some room to stretch your legs get up and walk when you can and stretch when you go to the bathroom its good to keep your blood flowing if you get heartburn try getting milk when the drink cart goes by that can help with heartburn make sure you sit up strait i just took a long military plane trip myself at weeks good times good luck Hong Kong International Airport Gastroesophageal reflux disease Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sleep Concorde Airport Airport (film) Social rule Fixed-wing aircraft The Inside Breastfeeding Insomnia Japanese toilet Boeing 747 United Airlines Flight 93 Pan Am Flight 103 Dead Like Me Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Jet lag EastEnders The Amazing Race 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Dairy Toilet The Shining (film) SR-71 Blackbird Ryanair Passenger car Dehydration Bird migration Airbus A380 Singapore Changi Airport Obstetrics Southwest Airlines Aircraft Prostate cancer Gliding Air traffic control Traumatic incident reduction Paragliding Skateboarding trick Stewart International Airport Malaria Dialysis Aer Lingus Air New Zealand Canadian Senate Air safety Immortality Human adaptation to space Coeliac disease Airline Friends Foreign relations of the Republic of China Dutch Schultz American Airlines Flight 11 Airbus Abbey Iditarod Air navigation Vampire Air traffic controller Traumatic brain injury South African Airways Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport San Francisco International Airport Characters of Lost Srebrenica massacre United States House of Representatives JetBlue Airways The Family from One End Street Vickers VC-10 Milton H.
