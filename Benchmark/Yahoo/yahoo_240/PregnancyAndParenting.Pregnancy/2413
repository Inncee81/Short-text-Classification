my wife won't get an abortion d my wife is weeks pregnant and refuses to abort she has already been put on modified bed rest for the rest of the pregnancy for heart problems our ob gyn has discussed with me that abortion would be best we have a month old son and i think she's being selfish for carrying through with this pregnancy is there any advice someone can give me to convince her to have one i don't think i'm selfish for wanting the love of my life to stay in my life i'm asking such a question because i feel that online is a good place to ask it yes it's personal i know but i feel i have no one else to turn to on this i really need another view i am anti abortion but also a bit pro choice this situation is a tough one i suggest you and your wife pray and pray ask friends to pray and ask god for a sign ask him to show your wife what she needs to do she is a woman who knows what it is like to carry a child give birth to it and tend to it it is hard to make a choice to end the process sometimes when there are tough decisions there need to be a bit of time to let go of the emotional reaction and give the brain time to process this i have a feeling the more you say do it she will resist it she needs to know that you too struggle concerning the life of your child have a non judgmental nonsided conversation with her ask her to help you make a list of pros and cons tell her that your mind and heart are open and that as a couple you need to come to a decision if she decides to keep the pregnancy the two of you and the doctor need a whatif plan what if she hemorages what if she goes in to cardiac arrest what if she dying who gets medical attention first mom or the fetus there is a point where she has to realize that the loss of both her and the baby would be too much for the family to bare if she continues she must agree to reasons that she will have to choose the procedure tell her that you will non judmentally listen to her without you saying a word if she will do the same to you listen without interruption i learned a few years ago that just because you listen to someone doesn't mean that you agree with that person it just means that you are listening your wife is very hormonally emotional you are very practable and pragmatic there needs to be a blending of the two so stop trying to convince her and start open communication so that she doesn't shut you out completely it is a mother's joy to protect her children it is a father's job to see the bigger picture the two will come together god bless you all p s wow lots of people didn't read the question correctly you definatly arn't the monester some think also being a christian doesn't mean that an emergency procedure isn't the answer life is complicated this is not an easy decision for any of you god will give you peace if she won't go through it then don't make this a month fight tell her you have her back and support but she also needs to agree with the what if plans if a quick life and death decision needs to be made if the baby is aborted it's little soul will go right to god and be waiting for her family in heaven i believe that with all that is within me infact i have three grandchildren there that spontaniously aborted we grieved the loss and i have one baby there who tried but didn't make it past the second month if your baby is lost assume your wife that the child will have a name and be remembered as a member of the family there are some parents of babies who are still born or born too early that bury the child it is a tremendous loss EastEnders Miscarriage Pregnancy Abortion in the United States Breastfeeding Abortion Roe v.
