watery discharge for a couple weeks now wks preg is it normal to have watery discharge for a few weeks or a month or more prior to due date i thought watery discharge meant labor would be relatively soon also having a lot of intestinal cramping loose bowel movements for weeks and increased braxton hicks for the last few days also baby movement is still normal he's always moving around very active you need to get the discharge tested to see what it is it is possible you are leaking amniotic fluid and if that is the case you would need to be under a dr 's supervision most likely in the hospital if the water bag breaks or is leaking then that means your baby is at risk for infection call your dr as soon as you possibly can or go to the er good luck Diarrhea Urinary incontinence Premature birth Childbirth Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Gonorrhoea Abortion Ulcerative colitis Coeliac disease Pneumonia Obstetrics Escherichia coli O157:H7 Breastfeeding Traumatic brain injury Dialysis Irritable bowel syndrome Fecal incontinence Cytomegalovirus Miscarriage Intravenous therapy Rotavirus Conjunctivitis Prenatal diagnosis Acting President of the United States Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Spina bifida Multiple sclerosis Prostate cancer Pregnancy Clostridium difficile Flatulence Lymphatic system Safe sex Hirschsprung's disease Dietary fiber Stomach cancer Endometrial cancer Diabetic retinopathy Bone marrow transplant Breech birth Vitamin C Infantilism Medical prescription Infectious mononucleosis Body piercing Cryptosporidiosis Colorectal cancer Cephalic disorder Gastroparesis Herpes simplex virus Group A streptococcal infection Menstrual cycle Ovarian cancer Glucocorticoid Diverticulitis Hurricane Rita Aortic dissection Cystic fibrosis Marburg virus Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Extreme Programming Cirrhosis Anthrax Legionellosis Mental Health Act 1983 Plame affair Lymphogranuloma venereum Birth weight Small intestine Radiation poisoning Tuberculosis Endometriosis First aid Cancer Syringomyelia Cryptosporidium The Emancipation of Mimi Gallstone Insulin Ascariasis Inflammatory bowel disease Diverticulosis Glycogen storage disease type I Radiation therapy Urine 2001 anthrax attacks Opportunity rover Indomethacin Progress of the SARS outbreak Enema Campylobacteriosis STS-51-L Nuclear power Amiodarone Sickle-cell disease Chronic fatigue syndrome Autism Giardiasis
