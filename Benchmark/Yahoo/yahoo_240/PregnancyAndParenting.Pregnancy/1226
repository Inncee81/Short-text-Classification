need some opinions i recently bought a doppler to listen in to my babys heartbeat im almost weeks now this is my forth pregnancy and im picking up strong heartbeats on both sides of my abdomen in the middle it goes a little quite does this sound like im having twins or could i just be picking up the same heartbeat on both sides i should also point out i look huge which i know can be a sign of twins im hoping this will turn out to be one baby but it freaked me out cause i don't remember with my other pregnancys how it works with the listening in any one thats had twins it would be great if you could give me your opinions i have a scan on monday so i will find out for sure then but just looking for some opinions for now i should also add that i have had no other signs of it being twins ive had hardly any sickness but i did have a painful ovulation thanks in advance i think it could be possible heres some things i found of signs of twins or multiples twins pregnancy signs and symptoms larger faster weight gain early weight gain of up to ten pounds in the first trimester can result due to increased blood volume and uterine size by the end of the second trimester most mothers of twins have gained fifteen to twenty five pounds whereas singleton pregnancies usually produce gains of ten to twenty pounds a large for date uterus if your uterus seems to be growing more rapidly than expected for your due date a multiple pregnancy may be suspected other possible causes of a larger than expected uterus include a miscalculated due date an excessive amount of amniotic flued or the presence of uterine fibroids measuring large for gestational age increased uterus size can be a strong indicator of multiple pregnancies however most women measure larger and show earlier with subsequent pregnancies so don't be alarmed if you can't fit into your jeans after six weeks of pregnancy with your second child even if you didn't wear maternity clothes until twenty weeks with your first baby severe morning sickness more than half of multiples moms have morning sickness which tends to be more severe than for a singleton pregnancy fetal movement early in the pregnancy there is considerable disagreement among medical professionals as to whether a woman carrying twins is more likely to feel movement earlier but many moms do claim that those early flutters and flips were their first clue that they might be having more than one your care provider hears two or more heartbeats as early as ten to weeks depending on the position of the babies a practitioner may be able to hear two or more separate heartbeats however since the heartbeat of a single fetus may be heard at several locations only if the heartbeats are different in rate is a diagnosis of multiple pregnancy made abnormally high results from an afp test for many mothers who do not experience any other extraordinary symptoms this is the first thing that raises suspicions for them and their physicians the afp test measures a protein secreted by the fetal liver more than one baby increases the amount of this protein in the mother's blood and will produce a high result because a high result can also suggest abnormalities with a single baby a doctor will usually schedule an ultrasound for further determination of the situation extreme fatigue nurturing one baby drains a body's energy but carrying around two three or more can be even more exhausting it's easy to dismiss the increased fatigue if you've never had a baby before you might be surprised by your lack of energy but not realize it is out of the ordinary if you have had previous singleton pregnancies you might attribute the tiredness to being older or maintaining the responsibilities of family and work however fatigue is probably the most common complaint of mothers of multiples water retention mothers of twin find that they retain more water than with singleton pregnancy exaggerated pregnancy symptoms with twins the typical signs and symptoms of pregnancy can be magnified predisposition to having twins there are several factors that make a woman more likely to have twins including twins in the mother s family advanced
