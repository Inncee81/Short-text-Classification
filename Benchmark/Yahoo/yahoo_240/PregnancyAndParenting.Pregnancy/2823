please answer a brief survey regarding circumcision have you had both circumcised and uncircumcised partners which do you prefer why how did intercourse feel different would did u circumcise your boys i have had both i don't suppose i prefer one or the other because it doesn't feel any different but i do think that circumcised penises look sort of mutilated this is probably just because i have been with more uncirced than circed but it seems like most things are better in their natural state the men i have been with claim that being uncircumcised increases their sensitivity but i have read studies that say men who were circumcised later in life reported no difference in feeling if my baby is a boy i will not circumcise him for the same reason that i would not circumcise my girl i think it is kind of a cruel archaic practice based in religious belief but that has extended to a cultural level and therefore lost all religious meaning Circumcision Medical analysis of circumcision Foreskin restoration Human sexual behavior Female genital cutting Masturbation Penis Phimosis History of male circumcision Infant baptism Circumcision advocacy Foreskin Circumcision in the Bible Bioethics of neonatal circumcision Sharia Human sexuality Jewish Christians Judaism Breastfeeding Orgasm Glans penis Sexual orientation Pubic hair Body modification History of Christianity Gay slang Human penis size Genital modification and mutilation Oral sex Dispensationalism Balanitis Strap-on dildo Genital integrity Smegma Gliding action Who is a Jew?
