stripping membranes so i am weeks in two days i asked my doctor to strip me if possible will she be able to if i am not dialated at all with my son they did when they induced me its how they got my labor going i nkow its more painful if you've made less progress i am having this done to keep from going over i am just wanting to avoid going past my due date with my first son when i hit weeks it was downhill and he was almost a still born because of going over and other medical reasons ths is why i am opting to be stripped at weeks i am close enough to term my due date is off by one day for everything august th dd any moms where it has worked for but not i am hoping it works or at least helps me dialate a little more i know you get crampy and bleed spot a little i've been losing my mucous plug the last two weeks so hopefully i am who knows though i didn't with my first my fingers are crossed it works about of the time but only if your body is ready and yes you do need to be dilated enough to get finger through to separate the membranes from the lower uterine segment this can release what is called prostaglandins which may stimulate cramping or contractions sexual intercourse with orgasm can sometimes accomplish the same thing and it's a lot more fun the upside is it can start labor if your cervix is ripe but the downside is the doctor or midwife can accidently rupture your membranes and you don't want this to happen if you are not in labor yet you said that there were difficulties with your first son i hope your doctor has done a few nst's to check on the baby's well being good luck and congratulations Childbirth Cervix Abortion Miscarriage Breech birth Obstetrics Menstrual cycle Gonorrhoea Oral sex Orgasm Traumatic brain injury Sexual intercourse Fertility awareness Breastfeeding Caesarean section Prostate cancer Vagina Wound healing phases Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Penis Intact dilation and extraction Prostaglandin Androgen insensitivity syndrome Human sexual behavior Action potential Gynaecology Endometriosis Milton H.
