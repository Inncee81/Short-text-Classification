just out of curiousity about false positives i know that everyone says you can only get a false positive by taking medicine with hcg but a few years ago i got a 'false' positive according to the doctor is was caused by a very severe uti i had at the time all of my research has said this isnt possible was my doctor lying to me do you think i had a misscarriage like i suspected at the time i took a home test and one at the doctors i also dont know why he would have lied he wasnt a very good doctor regardless though it was a great deal of blood and pain it felt like the other miscarriages i'd had before but i had alot of other stuff going on that was causing everything in my body to be out of wack extreme stress and essentially half starved for a month among other things but when i asked my doctor he just said it was because my uti was so bad well i think that if you think you had a miscarriage then you probable did if you were bleeding and had cloths then yea you probable did have a miscarriage if you do then you can still get a positive test for up to weeks after the miscarriage so that is possibile that happened Miscarriage Pregnancy Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Coeliac disease Stomach cancer Menstrual cycle Abortion Urinary incontinence Medical analysis of circumcision Medicine Obstetrics Miscarriage of justice Prostate cancer Chronic fatigue syndrome Childbirth Psoriasis Cancer Stroke Polycystic ovary syndrome Ebola Human chorionic gonadotropin Bleeding Traumatic brain injury Lupus erythematosus The Caves of Androzani Hypoglycemia HIV test Radiation poisoning Insulin Scientology beliefs and practices Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Hip fracture Physician Aortic dissection Animal testing Ulcerative colitis Fertility awareness Migraine Graduate school Adverse effect (medicine) Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Theory of conduct Determinism Twin Post-traumatic stress disorder Eczema AIDS reappraisal Wound Scientific method Episodes of Lost (Season 1) False positive Pelvic inflammatory disease Endometriosis The Inside Abortion debate Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Rape Stem cell Malaria Church of Christ, Scientist Sam Sheppard Tocopherol Diabetic retinopathy Crohn's disease Glen Jacobs Breastfeeding Female genital cutting The Times They Are A-Changin' Bipolar disorder Tribulation Blood transfusion Stress (medicine) Doctorate False negative Bayesian inference Anorexia nervosa Triage Logic Paget's disease of bone Atherosclerosis Hulk (comics) Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Group A streptococcal infection Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial Mattress Alternative medicine Milton H.
