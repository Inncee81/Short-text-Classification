how do single mothers survive financially immediately after pregnancy i have a friend who is in the process of a divorce from which she will not receive any funds she is also pregnant she won't receive a paycheck during the period after she gives birth when she needs to stay home and recover and take care of her baby what do single mothers like this do is there any aid available her ex will not have to pay child support until the child is a month old or something he is demanding a paternity test which will take time and money by then she will have already been off work for a month with no money also she can't apply for disability because she is already pregnant ok you people out there like sweet p this woman is not immature or a bad decision maker just because she is pregnant doesn't mean she's an idiot also just because she needs help doesn't mean she's being paid to make babies it's not her fault that there are jerk husbands out there who could care less if their ex wives and babies survive she's not looking to mooch off of the government there are actually genuine people in need who receive this support it amazes me that some people think they know every situation wi mom should be ashamed of assuming that this woman made a poor choice why is pregnancy a poor choice maybe she didn't mean to get pregnant but she was taking every precaution not to get pregnant now that her husband leaves her it's her fault ignorant people if she has a good job and is planning to return to work which i would assume she is then i would say she could take out a small personal loan or apply for a credit card to cover her expenses for that month it sound like she must be making pretty decent money at her current job if she isn't expecting to be awarded any spousal support in the divorce settlement that should make it realistic for her to pay back her personal loan when we were expecting our oldest we both wanted to take time off to spend with our son i took three months and my husband took one month to prepare for our lack of income we worked overtime prior to the birth and saved every penny if your friend isn't due for a few more months she can focus on building her personal savings although having the expense of legal fees probably doesn't help in that area Pregnancy EastEnders Divorce Knots Landing Friends Marriage Alois Hitler Social Security (United States) Abortion debate Kodocha Breastfeeding Student loan 401(k) Abortion in the United States Unemployment Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Life insurance Days of our Lives FairTax Insurance Adoption In vitro fertilisation Roe v.
