my bf of yrs dreamt that he accidentally hit me and i had a miscarriage what could this mean my boyfriend of years had a dream that he was carrying something very large and heavy when he turned around and accidentally hit me very hard in the stomach with the object i fell and hit the ground and was in a lot of pain i started to bleed and was screaming eventually i had a miscarriage and thats all he remembers from the dream can anyone help us interpret this i am on birth control and we are not currently trying to have a baby thank you could be a feeling he has without even realizing it that came out through a dream my best guess would be taht he has a fear that somethings going to go wrong with the pregnancy and that its going to somehow be his fault something along those lines would be my best guess i think he's probably got alot of anxiety about the pregnancy and being a father especially if its for the first time i think its more reflecting his fears then some premonition of whtas to come so i wouldn't worry too much about his dream scenario playing out in real life i think the way the dream went is more symbolistic of his fears rather then what he is actually worried will happen in a literal sense Miscarriage Pregnancy Knots Landing Abortion Charmed EastEnders Anxiety Jon Secada Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Childbirth Theory of conduct Obstetrics Abortion debate Scenes from a Memory Philosophical skepticism Kodocha Phoebe Halliwell Out-of-body experience Paranoia Agent Friends One Tree Hill (TV series) Sex and the City Piccolo Junior Saga Daredevil Birth control Zhao Yun Hollyoaks Cordelia Chase Sigmund Freud 50 First Dates Miss Saigon Dream Marilyn Monroe Mulholland Drive (film) Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Breastfeeding Darth Vader Year of the Spider Menstrual cycle Virginia Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Earth Girl Arjuna Charles Darwin's illness The Lovely Bones Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Dinah Marler Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare American Dreams Humphrey Bogart House of M Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Intact dilation and extraction Abortion in the United States Wheel of Fortune One Life to Live Neighbours Mark Calaway The O.C.
