why do people look down on young mothers on here i have been surfing on here and i am appauled to see the amount of people that are on here putting down young mothers i had my first child when i was and my second when i was i am now and pregnant with my third and no none of them have been taken away and as for those who say that we are uneducated well i have my certificate in psychology and i am currently doing an advanced diploma of applied social science and yes maybe is too young to have a baby but it sure as hell makes you grow up fast i am now pregnant with a year old and a year old and when it comes to looking after them i do a great job they never ever go unfed or not bathed they are always warm and clothed and i have seen a year old woman give up of her children so anyone who thinks that being a young mum is wrong then it must mean being a mum at allis wrong yes people they are all to the same dad and no you arent paying for my children my partner has a full time job with really good pay and i have a part time job so if you think thats the case back off don't bother yourself about what people think live in your own way do anything that makes you happy not things that make others happy life is full of choices what you have is what you have chosen before so it's totally personal EastEnders Abortion debate About a Boy Humphrey Bogart Friends Teenage pregnancy Pregnancy Knots Landing Gender role Goodness and value theory Theory of conduct Little Britain Economic inequality Divorce Sento Pitaten Education in Germany Brave New World Breastfeeding Utilitarianism Economics Procrastination Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Ethics The Smoking Room IB Diploma Programme Intelligence quotient Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Microeconomics Unemployment The Wall Kodocha Abortion Father Infantilism Laura Schlessinger Civil unions in the United Kingdom Freeters Evil Justification (theology) Incarnations of Immortality The Sims Education in Portugal Oral sex Education in Australia The Catcher in the Rye College admissions Marriage Roe v.
