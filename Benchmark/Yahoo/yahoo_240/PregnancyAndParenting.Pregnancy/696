abortion ok so i wrote a few days about my pregnant sister her issue with her long distance boyfriend well i guess things have gotten worse with them they broke up well i get a text today from her that says its sad to say that i think it would be best for me to get an abortion i just cant understand this i do know its not my problem or that i need to butt out however i feel that if you r having unprotected sex joking about the possiblity of getting pregnant then you need to take responsibility for your actions she's a little over two months and she was happy in the begining and planning to move in with him and she's asked her year old son which he'd rather have a brother or sister shes even said that she did want to have another one before she turns but its like now shes not with the guy so whats the point to having this baby its not about being depressed she wanted to end it with the guy has anyone else been through these pregnancy feelings i dont get it she shouldn't get an abortion just because she is upset at her boyfriend if she is going to have one it needs to be because she wants one for herself as selfish as that sounds not because she's angry at some guy guys come and go children are forever no woman should ever do anything that involves hurting her child for any man even if he is the father of the baby EastEnders Knots Landing Friends Pregnancy Abortion debate Miscarriage Kodocha History of As the World Turns (2000-present) One Tree Hill (TV series) Neighbours Sex and the City Abortion Vernon Schillinger Teen Girl Squad Shaggy dog story Jam (TV series) Everwood Boston Public Humphrey Bogart Abortion in the United States One Life to Live Avenue Q Social rule Pitaten Virginia Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) Dead Like Me The Ashlee Simpson Show Melanie Wilkes Days of our Lives Eddie Guerrero Charmed Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Breastfeeding Birth control Sex education Adoption Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Ted Kennedy Oral contraceptive Maury Prenatal diagnosis Hollyoaks Sharon Tate Jennifer Lopez Phoebe Halliwell Recurring South Park characters Oh My Goddess!
