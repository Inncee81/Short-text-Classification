question about inducing labor hi my due date was on tues the th and my doctor wanted me to go into the hospital today so i could get induced i agreed with her but now i changed my mind i'm suppose to call tonight so i could go in and have the on call doctor insert a suppository that will work throughout the night and then my doctor will see me tomorrow morning but now i'd rather wait to see if my labor comes naturally do i just call the hospital and tell them i'm not going or just don't go in at all my doctor won't be there so i can't talk to her what should i do thanks everyone i just felt a lil silly calling to let them know i wasn't going but you guys made me feel better and i'm not worried about the suppository what i forgot to say is that if the suppository didn't work they were going to use pytocin not sure of spelling and i was reading the risk and many articles said it shouldn't be used until the benefits outweigh the risks and right now i'm still not even a week overdue and have no other medical problems so i'm not at risk thanks everyone for the support just call and cancel not a big deal ask for the maternity ward ask to cancel your appointment thanks bye hope that works out well good for you for listening to your gut Prostate cancer Childbirth Jon Secada Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Major League Baseball television contracts Publicly funded medicine The Emancipation of Mimi Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Extreme Programming Milton H.
