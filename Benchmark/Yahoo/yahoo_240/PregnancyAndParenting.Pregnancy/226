little concerned need some advice currently i am weeks pregnant and went in for my routine visit the doc said my uterus was a little large for weeks and that the baby will be a big baby what are the reasons for this also when they took any ultrasound they told me the baby's head was slightly large but nothing to be concerned with are there any rn's or pa's out there that could answer this for me i'd greatly appreciate any advice you can give fundal measurements are supposed to be two weeks and all methods of determining fetal size are little better than guesses including ultrasound many times when doctors start talking about big babies it means that for some reason they want to do a c section either they have too many women due at the same time or some other reason some doctors routinely tell all their patients this or some other similar thing so that if their labour runs long the woman won't argue when they say that labour has stalled and it is time for a c section http www ncbi nlm nih gov sites entrez cmd retrieve db pubmed list uids dopt abstractplus objective to compare clinical and patient estimation of fetal weight to ultrasound estimation study design prospective study of clinical patient and ultrasound estimation of fetal weight at term results a total of pregnant women participated there was no statistically significant difference between clinical and sonographic estimates of fetal weight of the estimates were within of the actual birth weight vs p there was no statistically significant difference between patient and sonographic estimates of fetal weight of the estimates were within of the actual birth weight vs respectively p senior resident clinical and sonographic estimates of fetal weight were superior to junior resident estimates of clinical estimates were within of the actual birth weight vs p and of sonographic estimates were within of the actual birth weight vs p nulliparous and multiparous patients were equally accurate in estimating fetal weight of estimates were within of birth weight vs p conclusion sonographic estimation of fetal weight offers no advantage over clinical or patient estimation of fetal weight at term senior resident clinical and sonographic estimates are superior to junior resident estimates parity has no effect on patient accuracy in estimating fetal weight Pregnancy Obstetrics Abortion Androgen insensitivity syndrome Miscarriage Birth weight Breech birth Biology and sexual orientation Prenatal diagnosis Abortion debate Partial-birth abortion Psychology Puberty Intact dilation and extraction Medical ultrasonography Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Insulin Autism Menstrual cycle In vitro fertilisation Folic acid Clinical trial Cancer Chiropractic Ovarian cancer Spina bifida Stomach cancer ELO rating system CPU cache Cephalic disorder Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Body mass index Normal distribution Law of value Migraine Left-handed Entrez Urinary incontinence Case-control Alternative medicine Economics Doomsday argument Breast cancer Monopsony Mesothelioma Haloperidol Oral contraceptive Premature birth Cytomegalovirus Roe v.
