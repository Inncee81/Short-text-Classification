weeks pregnant getting scared and anxious about losing my freedom i am a gemini so i am therefore a free spirit i am so use to getting up and going when ever i wan to when i want one night i might decide i want to drive to galveston or mexico just to get out of the house but now that i have a child on the way i know that i can't do that any more every descision i make has to be centered around her as i approach my due date i have been getting really nervous and anxious about this too the point where i can't sleep at night i love my baby all ready i don't have any regrets but i want to know how can i balance my freedom and having a child i am years old and i dont want the excitment in my life to be a fleeting memory but i also want to be a good mother you will lose a lot of your freedom but trust me as a young mother as well when you hold your baby being free will be the last thing on your mind you will sacrifice anything for that baby growing inside of you because the love you'll feel some women don't feel love at first site with their baby sometimes it takes a few days to get over the shock eventually and very gradually you will gain little freedoms back like showering and sleeping and going out but don't worry they're will be plenty of excitement and much more happiness taking the place of the things you care so much about now things that will seem so empty and meaningless after the baby takes their place Knots Landing Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Jon Secada EastEnders Breastfeeding Shaggy dog story Childbirth Humphrey Bogart The Amber Spyglass Pitaten Charmed Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Friends Social rule One Tree Hill (TV series) W.I.T.C.H.
