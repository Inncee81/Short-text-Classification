so what about the mini pill breastfeeding and pregnancy my son is weeks old and i breastfeed exclusively i want to get on the mini pill to prevent any pregnancies while breastfeeding however my doctor said that the mini pill has it's risks one of the risks is that if you don't take it at the exact same time every day there's a chance you could get pregnant also if you miss one day you could bleed a lot i don't know if she was just saying that or if it's really true i need to get on some sort of birth control even if i'm breastfeeding and i want to hear some opinions on what works best and what you all have liked and used does the mini pill really have these things happen or was she exagerating please don't suggest the mirena iud i can't afford that as it costs with my insurance i have and that's not feasable oh yeah i must mention that when we use condoms i almost always end up getting an infection i took the mini pill while breastfeeding you really do need to take it at the same time each day but that goes for any birth control pill your doctor was exaggerating if she said you could bleed a lot you can bleed some spotting but again that is the same for any pill that's great that you're breastfeeding keep it up i recommend the mini pill while breastfeeding it worked for me but as the poster above said not every type is for everyone when i came off the pill it took us three months to conceive if that's something you're considering also good luck the site i found said that the mini pill is effective http www fwhc org birth control minipill htm other types of birth control for breastfeeding moms http healthlibrary epnet com getcontent aspx token e c c a c a e c chunkiid Fertility awareness Breastfeeding Birth control Oral contraceptive Childbirth Emergency contraception Miscarriage Menstrual cycle Pregnancy Folic acid Intrauterine device Gonorrhoea AIDS Medical analysis of circumcision Abortion Spina bifida Urinary incontinence Progesterone only pill Tocopherol Herpes simplex virus HIV Premature birth Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Endometriosis Hypertension Nipple piercing Cytomegalovirus Condom Prostate cancer Ectopic pregnancy Prolactinoma Antidepressant Safe sex Stomach cancer Breast Vitamin D Abortion debate EastEnders Diabetic retinopathy Coeliac disease Obstetrics Stroke Hiberno-English Sudden infant death syndrome Breast cancer Pelvic inflammatory disease Sexual abstinence Guinea pig She Loves You Haloperidol Schapelle Corby Maprotiline Infertility Acne Sex education Twin In vitro fertilisation Vitamin C Sulfasalazine Chemical abortion Turner syndrome Cancer Genital wart Medical cannabis Oral sex Antiretroviral drug Insurance Bleeding Hepatitis B Roe v.
