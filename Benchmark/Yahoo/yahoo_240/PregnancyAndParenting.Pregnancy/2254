i'm weeks pregnant what kind of abortion is best for me hi i'm weeks pregnant and i have decided to have an abortion at this late stage because i have just found out the foetus has a cleft lip and i don't want a baby with a deformity however small my doctor told me i have a choice of four abortion methods partial birth induced labour saline abortion and one where my womb is opened up and the foetus removed that way abortion is legal in my country at any stage if the foetus has a deformity i know nothing about abortions can anyone tell me which one is best for me to have of course i'm not i amot evil but the foetus has a deformity and i have a right not to bring a child with a deformity in my country there is no limit to how late you can have an abortion if the foetus has a deformity yes i do know cleft lips can be healed with surgery but the face never looks right even after surgery i've seen pics of faces after surgery i'm really sorry i didn't mean to upset anyone but this is a q a site and people should be allowed to post a question on here without fear of being treated like this i'm only asking because i really need to know the answer my mum was told if she didn't abort me she would die and that she would be mad not to abort but she kept me regardless and she was fine and i was fine but i am not my mum abortion is so murder a woman has no choice when it comes to this if you didn't want children then don't get married or live with someone that is not your spouse any women who made the choice of abortion is a killing their gift from god and are saying to his face that they don't believe in him life is precious that unborn baby is a living human being i for one am proud to say i am one of eight its awesome with a big family life is so amazing please don't throw it away you need to give the unborn babies a chance to live and explore this amazing world god did not create us so that we could destroy our children that he has given us some will say that if a person were raped then wouldn't they want to just have an abortion well guess what you are dead wrong if you wanna get rid of the memory and kid wait and send him her to an adoption center i don't care if they are getting filled up it is unfair to that living yet unborn child in the womb of his her mother he may have a chance at life no matter what happened in his her past life pro choice and pro abortion are the same thing if you are pro choice you are saying that a person can make what ever choice she wants you are alowing people to make the bad choice you can only be pro life and pro abortion i stand on firm ground and no one can shake me the only being that can make me change my mind and i highly doubt he will is god pray for the unborn Abortion Abortion in the United States EastEnders Pregnancy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Fetus Theory of conduct Childbirth Religion and abortion Charmed Intact dilation and extraction Humphrey Bogart Partial-birth abortion Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Roe v.
