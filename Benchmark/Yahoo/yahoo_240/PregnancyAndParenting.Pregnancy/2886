vbac opinions and information i had a c section with my previous pregnancy months ago by the time of this birth it will be months because my labor was induced for hrs and he did not drop and my cervix would not soften or open at all my doctor just gave me the option today of a vbac vaginal birth after cesarian for this birth she told me to get as much information and opinions as i could so i was wondering if anybody had any good web sites with info and if anybody has had one before please if possible i would like to hear pros and cons of vbac i know there are serious risks but i really did want to have my first child naturally and this will be my last chance to do so you cannot have one after c sections thanks in advance for all of your help i'm so glad your doctor is giving you that option i hope you go for it i have had two successful vbac's there are risks associated but they are actually safer than c sections because a cesaerean is always major surgery both of my vbac's went very well with absolutely no complications and my recovery was so quick i went home with the baby after day it was wonderful i found a lot of great information at http www vbac com and also by reading the birth book by dr sears there's a whole chapter dedicated to vbacs with personal stories all the best Childbirth Caesarean section Abortion Pregnancy Breech birth Intact dilation and extraction Miscarriage In vitro fertilisation Cytomegalovirus Premature birth Obstetrics Urinary incontinence Fertility awareness Birth control Gonorrhoea Breastfeeding Abortion debate Cervix Oral contraceptive Intersex surgery Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Diethylstilbestrol Placenta praevia Partial-birth abortion Prostate cancer Androgen insensitivity syndrome Folic acid Prenatal diagnosis Spina bifida Abortion in the United States History of intersex surgery Uniform Resource Locator Roe v.
