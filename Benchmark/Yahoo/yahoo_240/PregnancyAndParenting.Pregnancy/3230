if you are weeks pregnant how much water should you be drinking i try to drink at most between a liter or two liters of water a day plus a small bottle of orange juice to get some extra vitamins last night i went to the er because i thought i was leaking amniotic fluid which i wasn't thank god and they said that my urine shows that i am not getting enough water to drink this means that if i don't take in more water i am liable for another urinary tract infection i know the experts advice glasses of water a day but what does that equate to in liters gallons etc not drinking enough water can cause more problems than utis dehydration is a primary cause of preterm labor the short answer is drink until your pee runs clear to directly answer your question you should probably try to drink a gallon to a gallon and a half a day or liters a day i know it sounds daunting but the more you drink the more you'll want to drink drinking enough water actually helps to prevent fluid retention water weight gain so there's another reason to drink it seems like a lot but you really can't get too much water when you're pregnant eat foods that are high in water content too fresh fruits and vegetables stay away from fruit juices sodas even the diet and caffeinated drinks they actually work to dehydrate you Urinary incontinence Urine Breastfeeding Milk Vitamin C Fecal incontinence Prostate cancer Guinea pig Diarrhea Dehydration Soft drink Nutrition Water Hamster Kidney stone Fasting Folic acid Rum Coffee Wine Drink Domestic rabbit Raw food diet Tooth Premature birth Dieting Breakfast Coca-Cola Tea Stomach cancer Urinary system Common cold Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Mountain Dew Blood Obstetrics Birth control Crohn's disease Pregnancy Bong Elephant Gout Food preservation Ramen Drinking Healthy eating Tocopherol Atkins Nutritional Approach Hypoglycemia Alcoholic beverage Veganism Rehydration Tropicana Products Alcohol fuel Abortion Hyperthermia Snapple Vitamin Cirrhosis Cuisine of Denmark Survival skills Fanta Hangover Escherichia coli O157:H7 Penis Hiking Urolagnia Hyperglycemia Beer Kosher foods Sugar substitute Bottled water Social rule Protein-energy malnutrition Word of Wisdom Grog Ammonia Insomnia Cat Colorectal cancer Multiple sclerosis Cancer Cystoscopy Dietary fiber Dr Pepper/Seven Up, Inc.
