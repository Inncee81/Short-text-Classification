trying to decide whether or not to circumsize my baby if its a boy would really like the guys' opinions i am trying to weigh the pros and cons on one hand what if something goes wrong and the poor little guy has to deal with it all his life on the other hand there is a very small chance of something actually going wrong and there are so many health benifits to being circumsized id like to hear from the guys do you like being or not being circumsized why or why not i just had a baby boy and i went thru that decision also working at a gyn you see alot of women complaining about y they have infections most of the times it because the men aren't circumsized which create bacterial infections to us women therefore i suggest you should not only to prevent infections also it looks much nicer too much extra skin hangs over the penis and your son in the near future will bring this topic if you dont but its your personal choice it only took a matter of seconds they give the baby sugar water or just the pacifier and sometimes they dont even cry i know someone in there mid 's who was just circumsized and he was upset at their mother because it hurt him more now that he is older than it would when he is a baby he also said the pleasure is much better than all that extra skin Circumcision Friends Breastfeeding Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Gonorrhoea Childbirth Theory of conduct Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Oral sex Jon Secada Jam (TV series) Urinary incontinence Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Contender (television series) Diarrhea Stomach cancer Kodocha Simone Weil Cytomegalovirus Social rule Infant Romulus and Remus Herpes simplex virus Bacteria Domestic violence Atomic Kitten Medical analysis of circumcision Otitis externa AIDS Humphrey Bogart Sexually-transmitted infection Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Tattoo Pneumonia Roy Meadow Wario Phimosis Good Morning, Vietnam Balanitis xerotica obliterans Stewie Griffin Appeal Alois Hitler Candidiasis Prostate cancer Babe Ruth Knots Landing YuYu Hakusho Infantilism Common cold Guinea pig Condom The Wack Pack Days of our Lives Wound Intersex surgery Abortion Strap-on dildo Masturbation Family Guy Capital punishment Poker jargon Fancy rat Shaggy dog story Nail (anatomy) Foodborne illness Ethics Joke Acne 613 mitzvot Gay slang Smegma Phoebe Buffay's songs Penis Mary Wells Dissociative identity disorder Peter Singer Birth control Free will Frankie Laine Predestination paradox Urinary tract infection Syphilis Anal sex Kyle Broflovski Married... with Children Abortion in Canada Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Mississippi John Hurt Human sexual behavior Psoriasis AIDS in Africa Coeliac disease Fathers' rights The Wall Gender role Utilitarianism The Shining (film) The Curse of Fenric
