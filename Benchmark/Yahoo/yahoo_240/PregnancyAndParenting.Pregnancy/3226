very personal after birth questions ok so heres what happened i gave birth to a big baby almost lbs everything went well except when the doc was pulling out the placenta the cord popped off so she had to remove it manually and i wouldnt stop bleeding and im not sure exactly what happened but everyone was rushing around trying to put something in my iv to stop my bleeding and all kinds of other stuff meanwhile doc had her hand inside of me pulling out all of the placenta and stuff and all kinds of metal tools sticking out of my you know what very painful more painful than having an almost c pound baby i lost like ml of blood not too horrible but now weeks later i am still bleeding and there is a kinda bad smell i know thats yucky but im worried about it i bled very heavy after for weeks straight it was very heavy and dark then it lightened up for about day then i woke up one morning feeling like i was having a period and bleeding alot more soaked thru a few pads for a few days and its still like a light medium period now weeks later i still have some cramping like a period here and there daily and im worried about it having a smell it not a fishy smell or anything but it isnt pleasant i go for my pp checkup monday but i wondered if it happened to anyone else thanks ps i got a fever shortly after also and so they pumped me full of antibiotics the whole time i was there for almost days so is it still possible i have some kind of infection the bleeding you are experiencing is most likely your lochia flow which is absolutely normal after birth it can last anywhere from weeks to months i bled for weeks straight and i also had a pounder it will get better though think of it as your body hasn't had a period in months so it's letting go of all the extra blood Childbirth Miscarriage Bleeding Menstrual cycle Pregnancy Breastfeeding Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Dialysis Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Urinary incontinence Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Bone marrow transplant Traumatic brain injury Poker jargon Stomach cancer Psoriasis AFI 100 Years series Diabetic retinopathy Intravenous therapy Humphrey Bogart Milton H.
