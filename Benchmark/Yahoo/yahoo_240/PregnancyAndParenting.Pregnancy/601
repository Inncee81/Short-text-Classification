pregnancy test experts i took a pregnancy test on friday b my missed period im not due til the th but i took a test and it was the kind the equate and i took it and waited min and when the results came back i had a very thick horizontal line but the vertical line was very very faint like really hard to see but i could see that it was there what do ya'll think i have taken lots of pregnancy tests and my recommendation to you is to wait until weeks after your missed period when you can be sure that your hormones are high enough sometimes those early epts can miss an early positive regardless of what the box says and their claims of a correct rate sometimes you can have a very early miscarrage that can give a result like this to where you tested just at the time when your hormones started kicking in but if the fertilized egg doesn't implant properly your next test will show totally negative pregnancy tests are easily messed up by not urinating enough on the stick or urinating too much get a test where you use a dropper to drop the correct of drops onto the little spot onto a plastic box rather than using a stick use a really basic test with the two windows two lines in result window pregnant one line in both negative also make sure the test has not expired most pregnancy test companies will provide a refund if you got a bad test i had be wrong for me and i've taken alot of them Pregnancy Prostate cancer Menstrual cycle Urinary incontinence Oscilloscope Pregnancy test In vitro fertilisation Abortion Fertility awareness HIV test Drug test Miscarriage Endometriosis Oral contraceptive Human chorionic gonadotropin Birth control Diabetes mellitus Guinea pig Ectopic pregnancy Emergency contraception Gonorrhoea Poker jargon Welding Jeopardy!
