birth control question okay so ive started it but i was wondering if its supposed to stop you from becoming pregnant why do you still ahve your period at the end of the month isnt that what causes egg production birth control pills or oral contraceptives contain hormones that suppress ovulation during ovulation an egg is released from the ovaries without ovulation there is no egg to be fertilized and pregnancy cannot occur there are types of birth control pills the combined pill and the minipill the combined pill contains both estrogen and progestin while the minipill contains only progestin the progestin in the minipill may prevent ovulation however it may not do this reliably each month the minipill works further by thickening the mucous around the cervix and preventing sperm from entering the uterus the lining of the uterus is also affected in a way that prevents fertilized eggs from implanting into the wall of the uterus the minipill is taken every day you may not have a period while taking the minipill if you do have periods that means you are still ovulating and your risk for pregnancy occuring is greater combination birth control pills come in either or day packs you take one pill each day at the same time for days if you have a day pack you stop taking birth control pills for days at the end of the pack if you are taking a day pack you continue taking pills every day the last non hormonal pills serve as a reminder to help you remember to take your pill at the same time every day your period will occur during the week you take the reminder pills Fertility awareness Pregnancy Endometriosis Ovulation Hormone replacement therapy (trans) In vitro fertilisation Ovary Progesterone Ectopic pregnancy Sexual reproduction Puberty Depo Provera Fertilisation Polycystic ovary syndrome Miscarriage Abortion Infertility Female reproductive system (human) Estrus cycle Obstetrics Androgen insensitivity syndrome Intrauterine device Ovarian cyst Urinary incontinence Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Acne Ovarian cancer Progesterone only pill Childbirth Twin Hormone replacement therapy Cervix Endometrium Gonorrhoea Sexual intercourse Psoriasis Swyer syndrome Gynaecology Baldness treatments Vaginal bleeding Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency Anabolic steroid Sterilization (surgical procedure) Abortion debate Cancer Flowering plant Premature birth Embryo transfer Dysfunctional uterine bleeding Breast cancer Cryptorchidism Growth hormone treatment Estrogen Spina bifida Guinea pig Cervical cancer Pregnancy test Intersex surgery Sexual differentiation Estradiol Multiple birth Prolactinoma Gonadotropin-releasing hormone Diaphragm (contraceptive) Uterine fibroids Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Breastfeeding Tocopherol Gynecologic hemorrhage Folic acid Prostate cancer Menstrual cup Caffeine Breech birth Gallstone Turner syndrome Sex education Fruit Cytomegalovirus Pelvic inflammatory disease Amenorrhoea Migraine Human cloning Osteoporosis Diabetes mellitus Glucocorticoid
