adoption could the birth father intervene im currently weeks pregnant and engaged to the birth father of my child it's an unplanned pregnancy and i really think that by marrying him i'd be ruining my life and maybe my childs his mothers really excited about the baby im debating looking into adoption if i left my fiance and went to a adoption home and gave up the child is there anything that he could do to stop this from happening many states have enacted putative father registries which give putative fathers a man who believes he may be the biological father of a child but who is neither married to the mother nor has legally established his paternity of the child the opportunity to make their interest in a child known and enables them to receive notice of an adoption so that they can object to the adoption if they wish to establish a relationship with their child conversely the registry protects adoptive parents and birth mothers from having an adoption disrupted as one who does not register may be barred from receiving notice or objecting the birth father has every right to the child and may choose to test paternity and then to have rights to the child after the birth he will be allowed to have the baby if in fact you do not wish to keep it it's better that way anyhow if you do not want the baby at least it's natural father will have the chance to give it a good life once two people conceive a baby that baby is their responsibility until both parties agree to give up their paternal rights that is except in the case of abortion for some reason a woman can abort a child without consent of the father sick anyway the man has a right to his child Abortion debate Divorce Marriage Adoption Abortion in the United States Father Abortion Pregnancy Roe v.
