is she pregnant i had sex a week ago with my year long girlfriend shes on the pill to regulate her periods we had sex about days after her period so it wasn't in the period of ovulation for her but i didnt use a condom because i didnt have one on me i didn't ejaculate because i never finished but im worried my pre c um might do something shes often tired but she normally is anyways she has migraines and shes been acting somewhat moody not sure if it's because of her breaking things off with her best friend or b c shes pregnant ugh i have too many conflicting signs here and im not sure what to do would she receive signs this early even if she wasn't ovulating is she pregnant if she is taking her birth control as she should be every day then she is most likely not pregant sounds like the friend thing is stressing her out along with most likely pms you know you can have that during your ovulation too just fyi anyway you should be fine i would not be worried you would have more signs than just moodiness she would most likely start feeling sick her breasts would be sore and she would know i can't explain but you kinda just know if she was not ovulating you do not have much chance of her getting pregant mostly because birth control if working correctly should stop that plus if she did have her period she would not have even dropped an egg yet Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Oral contraceptive Birth control Pregnancy Emergency contraception Puberty Knots Landing EastEnders Kodocha Breastfeeding Premature ejaculation Ovulation Oral sex Pornographic movie Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Abortion debate In vitro fertilisation Sharon Tate Jam (TV series) Marilyn Monroe Psoriasis Estrus cycle Premenstrual stress syndrome Prostate cancer George Costanza Urinary incontinence Safe sex Infertility Migraine Social rule 2000 Australian Grand Prix Sexual abstinence Ocean's Twelve Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Obstetrics One Tree Hill (TV series) Sex and the City Spice Girls History of sex Friends Condom Avenue Q Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sexual revolution Ernie Irvan Year of the Spider Sin City Folic acid Trainspotting (novel) Sex Pistols Alanis Morissette Neighbours The Contender (television series) Masturbation Orgasm Series finale Oasis (band) Fertilisation Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Androgen insensitivity syndrome Infantilism The Smoking Room Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Hall & Oates The Inside Dead Like Me Conker's Bad Fur Day Shaggy dog story The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Gender role Rent (musical) Premature birth Mystique (comics) Equine conformation Sexual reproduction Flowering plant Sexual intercourse Days of our Lives Charmed Troy Glaus Sex education Twin Apollo 8 Stomach cancer Piccolo Junior Saga Highway 61 Revisited Elvis Presley Hip hop rivalries Paranoia Agent Childbirth Hey Jude Time Out of Mind Katelyn Faber Soap opera Blonde on Blonde Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 TLC Gregory Goodwin Pincus Dawson's Creek
