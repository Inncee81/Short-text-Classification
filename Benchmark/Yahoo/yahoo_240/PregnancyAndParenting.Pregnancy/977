tell me some old wives tales related to pregnancy for example my grandmother who is a very traditional native american says that if i walk thru a doorway and i forgot something in the room to walk all the way out and turn around and not to walk backwards back into the room because that could mean that my baby could be breeched my mother in law very traditional mexican of indian descent believes that if you sleep a lot during pregnancy the baby will get stuck and not want to come out i tried to reason with her because i have never seen a woman walking around with a year old baby inside that didn't want to be born it's just not logical lots of active women have to have c sections too lots of people who see my baby ask me if i had heartburn because she has a lot of hair and i guess that's some old wives tale i've heard a ton of old wives tales about babies but not so many about pregnancy like if you let them see their reflection as a baby they will be dumb if you cut their hair before their first birthday they will be mute and that people can give them the evil eye and make them sick just by looking at them i think they're funny and i like to hear them but some people take it waaaaaaaay too seriously Childbirth The Shining (film) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Breech birth Little Britain Obstetrics Humphrey Bogart EastEnders Knots Landing Comanche Marilyn Monroe Friends Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pregnancy Charmed Joke Phoebe Buffay's songs What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?
