when you're expecting did you find it difficult to work in your usual job what were some of the positive or negative experiences you had my co workers and boss were extremely understanding and my job didn't become difficult at all my workload was lessened i had an office desk type of job where i didn't have any heavy lifting or anything like that and everyone inquired about my health i think that for someone who is very serious about having a career the leniency i received was both a blessing and an annoyance i kept wanting to act like everything was normal while my stomach kept getting bigger and reminding me to slow down i'm also a private person and didn't like how people who just strolled into the office kept asking me personal questions and gawking at my expanding waistline the only real negative thing was unpaid maternity leave everything else about my work experience was positive but i know that not everyone is so fortunate as me so i really shouldn't complain i've known people to be fired for becoming pregnant EastEnders Unemployment Infantilism Freeters Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma The Smoking Room Labor theory of value Shaggy dog story Secretary Coeliac disease Labour economics Plame affair IBM PC compatible Free will Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Compensation of employees Desk God Productive and unproductive labour Tony Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) Childbirth The nature of God in Western theology Entropy Babe Ruth Social rule Stomach cancer Ocean's Twelve Minimum wage Knots Landing Castle of the Winds Outsourcing Friends Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Nicomachean Ethics Inflation Final Fantasy magic Aerial (dance move) Software engineering Economic inequality Homer Simpson Theory of conduct Humphrey Bogart Calvin and Hobbes Ambulance Poker jargon Jam (TV series) Out-of-body experience Newbie Sant Thakar Singh Nevil Shute Episodes of Lost (Season 1) One Tree Hill (TV series) Secretary desk Exotic matter Ty Cobb The Apprentice 2 Child support Alex Ferguson Prostate cancer Diana Ross Wage slavery The Apprentice 2 candidates Milton H.
