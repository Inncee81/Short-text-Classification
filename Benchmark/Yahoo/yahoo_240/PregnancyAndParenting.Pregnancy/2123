weeks prego i am weeks pregnant and i am ready to have this baby does anyone have any good ideas to get the process moving everybody says sex will it really help let me start by saying that even though you feel ready the baby may not be you are technically not full term for another three weeks it doesn't seem like much time but it is for your baby once you are full term it's not just sex but it really helps if you have an orgasm an orgasm is actually your muscles contracting which may lead to the start of labor also stimulating the nipples helps to produce oxytocin which is similar to the pitocin that is used to induce labor Orgasm Oxytocin Breastfeeding Childbirth Pregnancy Nipple Oral sex Sex toy Mammary gland Erotic sexual denial Human sexual response cycle Puberty Obstetrics Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Massage Sexual arousal Child sexuality Urinary incontinence Birth control Androgen insensitivity syndrome Vibrator Human sexual behavior Strap-on dildo Abortion debate Female ejaculation Abortion Prostate cancer Premature birth Keynesian economics Anal sex Premature ejaculation National Football League Friends Sex and the City Induction (birth) Paroxetine Nipple piercing Anal masturbation Sexual dysfunction Sex organ Miscarriage Anorgasmia Breech birth Sexual intercourse Sexual differentiation Prenatal diagnosis Transsexuality Skeletal muscle John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Sexual orientation Action potential Gender role Britney Spears Rod Stewart Menstrual cycle Nudity Labor theory of value Zoophilia Wealth Goodness and value theory Drawn Together Hypopituitarism Law of value Equine conformation Male reproductive system (human) Wilhelm Reich Erogenous zone Wound healing phases Bondage (BDSM) Supply and demand Sauna Masters and Johnson Coffee Twin Sexual reproduction Cerebral palsy Happiness Glucocorticoid Sybian Infant Weight training Vernon Schillinger Testicle Eye Electroconvulsive therapy Out-of-body experience Marriage Muscle Elephant Platypus John Money Unemployment Crystal methamphetamine and sex Anarchism and capitalism Methamphetamine Myasthenia gravis Minimum wage Traditional animation
