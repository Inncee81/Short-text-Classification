my period is due in just under weeks over the last few days i have been having brown spotting stomach cramps and today have been a bit burby and feeling like i have had heartburn i have looked on a lot of websites and this can seem to pointing towards pregnancy especially when thelast time i had sex although on the pill would be the day i started ovulating am getting worried as although in a relationship i am not ready for children yet i had brown spotting as well when i was supposed to get my 'regular' period i had some light pink too and i am pregnant weeks now i had been with my boyfriend for only a couple of months when we found out and now we are pregnant and he's happy and everything so my advice to you is to take a pregnancy test when the spotting is gone and then talk to him if you are pregnant but please don't have an abortion i was thinking about it when i first found out thru a preg test but when i went to the doctor and found out i was weeks and days pregnant and i saw my baby's heartbeat and heard it omg it's the most amazing thing and i felt bad for my previous thoughts and fears our financial situation is tight but we can work things out and make it better for our baby it's okay even if it doesn't work out between me and my boyfriend the most important thing right now is my baby i waited weeks after my 'weird' period to take the test and it showed positive then i took another one because i couldn't believe it and it was positive too cool huh Pregnancy EastEnders Friends Neighbours Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Miscarriage Abortion debate Sex and the City Prenatal diagnosis Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Social rule Breastfeeding Marilyn Monroe Laura Schlessinger Stomach cancer Birth control Oral contraceptive The Ashlee Simpson Show One Tree Hill (TV series) Teenage pregnancy Pregnancy test Days of our Lives Child sexuality Cool (song) Charmed Kodocha Childbirth In vitro fertilisation Abortion Phoebe Halliwell Everwood Blood on the Tracks Shaggy dog story Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Boston Public Gastroesophageal reflux disease Jam (TV series) Obstetrics Emergency contraception The Emancipation of Mimi History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Philosophical skepticism Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Big Brother UK series 6 Jon Secada Elvis and Me 1957 World Series Joy (novel) One Life to Live Drawn Together The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Kurt Cobain The Inside B3ta Gonorrhoea Earth Girl Arjuna Hall & Oates Year of the Spider StarCraft: Uprising Boom Town (Doctor Who) Sharon Tate Soap opera The Apprentice 2 Jennifer Lopez Infantilism Humphrey Bogart The Sims 2 The Smoking Room Sami Brady Milton H.
