stretchmarks how soon i'm weeks pregnant and haven't gotten any stretchmarks yet i'm just wondering how far along all of you were when and if you got them i don't think i'll have any though crosses fingers my mother didn't get any i never got any my mother didn't either and my doctor said that's it's usually hereditary so you're probably safe too my friend started getting them at weeks i did get a few really light ones on the lower part of my breasts and i didn't see them until after i had been nursing for a few weeks but those weren't a big deal Milton H.
