what is the first sign of a dog being pregnant a doggie biscuit in the oven the next logical question is how can you tell if your dog is in the family way confirming pregnancy necessitates a trip to the veterinary office the earliest method of pregnancy detection is ultrasound a nice test because it is noninvasive and very reliable fetal heartbeats can be detected at around the th day from first breeding this is not however considered a reliable way to determine fetal number one interesting fact about the canine reproductive cycle is that the dog goes through roughly the same hormonal changes whether or not she is pregnant for this reason there is no progesterone blood or urine test to diagnose pregnancy in dogs there is however a blood test that will detect relaxin a hormone that is produced in pregnant dogs but is not found in non pregnant dogs this test may be performed mid gestation which occurs at around the same time that your veterinarian can palpate the fetuses most experienced veterinarians can determine pregnancy by simply feeling the dog s abdomen during a certain a window of time about days after conception during this time period there is uterine swelling around the placental sites that feels like firm and discrete lumps after days the uterine swelling is more diffuse and it is difficult to distinguish the gravid uterus from the feel of the intestinal tract dogs that are very large or obese may be difficult to examine in any stage however a third way to detect pregnancy is by taking x rays fetal skeletons can be visualized at about days of pregnancy this test cannot be done until late in gestation but it is nice to know about how many of the little creatures you can expect once the actual birthing occurs http www pets ca articles article dogpregnant htm early signs decreased appetite is usually one of the earliest signs that your bitch might be pregnant not all females go through this doggie version of morning sickness but a small percentage will eat less during the first few weeks of gestation usually making up for it later in the pregnancy a sudden decrease in activity can indicate that your bitch is pregnant just like some women canines may also experience feelings of exhaustion as their hormone levels change to support embryo production nipple growth is a good indicator that your bitch's body is going through pregnancy changes the nipples of an unbred female are usually quite small and the area immediately beneath them will feel flat however once a pregnancy is in progress breast material will develop beneath the nipples which will also increase slightly in preparation for eventual milk production behavioral changes may also be noticed with either an increase in affectionate behavior or an expressed desire to be left alone progressing signs as the pregnancy progresses you will notice further changes an increase in appetite is usually noted about three to four weeks into the pregnancy and is especially noticeable if your female slacked off her food after her heat cycle ended weight gain should be noticeable by one month into the pregnancy the bitch's abdomen will thicken and gentle examination of the belly will reveal a firm rather than fat feeling to the area edit late term signs the signs of dog pregnancy will increase dramatically in the last weeks of gestation a definite increase in abdomen size will be hard to miss if your bitch is carrying the average size litter for her breed however if there are only one or two pups the abdomen may seem only slightly increased but still be firmer than her pre pregnancy condition a lot depends on the size breed of the dog involved larger dogs have more room to carry pups and if the litter is small they won't show as much smaller breeds usually show more since they don't have as large an area to house the pups and some small breeds' abdomens will literally drag the ground near the end of the pregnancy puppy movement can be felt and seen during the last weeks of pregnancy with a definite increase in movement a few days before delivery as the pups get into position for birth milk production begins in earnest and colostrum the first milk can be gently expressed from the nipples sometimes leaking a bit on its own as the time for delivery draws near edit signs delivery is imminent nesting behavior is usually displayed by a bitch in the hours proceeding delivery although some females begin a little sooner you'll notice a general restlessness and she will likely prepare the area where she intends to deliver the pups by scrunching up blankets newspapers and such if you haven't provided your bitch with a suitable whelping box you're likely going to suffer some household damage as she may decide your bed or couch cushion seems like the perfect place and tear it up accordingly if this happens blame yourself but don't punish your bitch for this perfectly normal behavior she is simply operating on instinct a temperature drop down to degrees fahrenheit and held for two readings taken twelve hours apart signals impending delivery within the next hours a normal dog temperature hovers around degrees fahrenheit so if you begin taking your bitch's temperature daily from about days gestation you will be able to establish her normal temperature as well as when the drop takes place about false pregnancy sometimes a bitch will display general signs of dog pregnancy without actually being pregnant this will happen as she comes off a heat cycle and it doesn't seem to matter whether or not there was any breeding activity rather it seems to be brought on psychologically and the symptoms usually subside within about a month your bitch may also decide to adopt some babies to fill the void during this time this may be puppies from another litter on the premises or she may substitute objects such as toys or stuffed animals borrowing puppies from another bitch can lead a potentially dangerous situation and calls for your intervention however if she is only playing mom with toys give her time to come to terms with the situation on her own before removing the items then try to get her focused on other activities http dogs lovetoknow com wiki signs of dog pregnancy Shark Endometrial cancer Fetus Cytomegalovirus Animal testing Tobacco smoking Ferret Sleep Ovarian cancer Coeliac
