why do people have children that are going to grow up spend all your money worry you half to death never say thanks smoke pot with their underage pregnant girlfriend and constantly drive you crazy by listening to loud music that sounds similar to a large steel pipe rolling down concrete stairs in a tunnel and more than likely will send you into an early grave why what is in it for you i cant see why do you feel that you deserve such punishment well mine wont be raised that way is not a answer its typically the kids that are not raised to do this that do this and are generally the worst offenders out the whole lot spoilt little shi brats wow most of the other people who answered this seem pretty defensive i love how the mommy of a year old thinks she can provide a legitimate opinion about raising a teenager unfortunately the desire to have children is not really within our control it's highly dependent on hormones which take the form in women of a voice that says i want to have a baby even when you can't afford it don't have time for it etc most people either get pregnant by accident or cannot distinguish what they actually want from what their hormones are telling them to do true some actually want children above and beyond the hormones but i think very few actually realize what they're getting themselves into i'm not saying they wouldn't do it if they knew just that the one thing all parents have in common is they all say they had no idea how hard it would be if the situation you mentioned describes your own son he needs to get a job and get out of your house give him weeks to find a job and weeks after that to find an apartment if he doesn't comply pack up his stuff and set it outside along with directions to the nearest homeless shelter Friends EastEnders Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Avenue Q Shaggy dog story Theory of conduct Humphrey Bogart Knots Landing Kodocha One Tree Hill (TV series) Good Times Social rule Infantilism Trailer Park Boys Microeconomics Simone Weil Something Positive Hey Jude Little Britain Buddy Guy Daredevil Transsexuality Badly Drawn Kitties Poker jargon Sexual orientation Futurama (TV series - season 5) Pregnancy Married... with Children Prostate cancer The Catcher in the Rye Abortion debate Time Out of Mind She Loves You Sin City Charmed George Costanza Breastfeeding Abortion Property (ownership right) Garth Brooks About a Boy The Death Gate Cycle Desire (album) Blood on the Tracks U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Phoebe Halliwell Socrates Philip J.
