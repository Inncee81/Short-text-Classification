a friend that won't seek prenatal care i friend of mine is pregnant and i mean really pregnant but she won't go to the doctor i understand that the pregnancy was unplanned and that she is not married but i still think she needs to get checked out she doesn't even know when her baby is due she is already having contractions and her belly is huge every time i ask her about it she just says that she is praying and that god will take care of everything i've even offered to go with her to the doctor and yes she does have health insurance is there any way i can convince her to get some prenatal care you can buy her some good books on pregnancy and birth and i suppose that's about it pre natal care is a bit over rated anyway the odds that she genuinely needs a doctor are low the odds of anything being wrong with the baby that a doctor could fix are ridiculously low you could also haul her off to a pharmacy and stick her arm in one of those blood pressure testing machines and buy some urine test strips while you're there get her to check her glucose and protein levels oh and some pre natal vitamins and you've pretty much covered pre natal care for an uncomplicated pregnancy ultrasounds and all the other hoo hah of seeing a doctor incessantly are fantastic if you have problems but pretty meaningless to pregnancy outcomes otherwise well that's not entirely true statistically pre natal care does improve the condition of babies but there's very little cause and effect basically women who take care of themselves have healthy babies and most women who take care of themselves get pre natal care there's nothing magic done at the doctor's office though Obstetrics Prenatal diagnosis Pregnancy Prenatal care Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Midwifery Childbirth Prostate cancer Teenage pregnancy Folic acid Urinary incontinence Diabetes mellitus Miscarriage In vitro fertilisation Postpartum depression Cytomegalovirus Insulin Health insurance Psoriasis Hypertension Humphrey Bogart Tocopherol Coeliac disease Abortion Androgen insensitivity syndrome Stroke Friends Premature birth Stomach cancer Insurance Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Oral contraceptive Medicine Prolactinoma Abortion debate Down syndrome Left-handed Glycogen storage disease type I Birth weight Eugenics Endometriosis Cancer Breech birth Theory of conduct Cholesterol Fertility awareness Paradox Transsexuality Anorexia nervosa Guinea pig Publicly funded medicine Poker jargon HIV test Blackjack Marilyn Monroe Turner syndrome Medicare (Canada) Menstrual cycle Health issues and the effects of cannabis Spina bifida Gonorrhoea Alternative medicine Roe v.
