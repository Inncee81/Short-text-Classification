how far along were you when you felt movement for the first time hello i just wanted to ask what week were you when you felt your baby move for the first time i was just curious i am currently weeks i know that it's still early for me to feel anything but i also know that it is entirely possible i also know that for first time pregers it's harder for us to tell that what we are feeling is actually the baby since we've never felt it before i am pretty little lbs so i'm hoping that will help in causing me to feel my little peanut sooner rather than later but what about you how far along were you when you felt your baby move the first time thanks i was weeks when i felt the first little twitches but they were few and far between now i'm weeks and i feel kicks more consistently for me at first it felt like muscle twitches or bubbles popping but it's hard to explain when you feel it you'll just know it's the baby congrats and good luck with your pregnancy Pregnancy Breech birth Britney Spears Spice Girls Muscle Miscarriage Breastfeeding EastEnders Bubble Bobble Rod Stewart Sharon Tate Urinary incontinence Knots Landing Muscle contraction Cliff Richard Obstetrics Abortion House music Twitch City Eclampsia Androgen insensitivity syndrome Janet Jackson Crazy in Love Cool (song) Cephalic disorder Abortion in the United States Jethro Tull (band) Fetal development Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Childbirth Boston Public Iggy Pop Donna Summer Professional wrestling slang Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Search for Tomorrow Myoclonus Aikido Abortion debate Beatles for Sale Fecal incontinence U2 (band) The Beatles discography Alice Cooper Kodocha Gwen Stefani Electroconvulsive therapy Out-of-body experience Bleed Like Me Jon Secada 2000 Australian Grand Prix Sam Cooke Pitaten Luck ...Baby One More Time (song) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Infantilism One Life to Live Swimming Good Times Princess Marie-Th__r__se-Charlotte Mary Wells Condom Ashanti (singer) The Ashlee Simpson Show Baby One More Time First Battle of the Atlantic The Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation Big Brother (USA TV series) Vernon Schillinger Menstrual cycle Situation comedy Prostate cancer Chinese martial arts The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy The Waterboys Big Brother UK series 6 Care Bears Middle distance track event Equine conformation Motor cortex Lyme disease Backstroke Restless legs syndrome R.E.M.
