does this sound like gas heartburn or something else obviously i would ask my doctor but it's too late in the day to call so i just wanted some hopefully reassurance before then i'm fourteen weeks pregnant last night i had this terrible tightness slight pain in my upper back which eventually stretched around to my rib cage too it was so uncomfortable i felt like i was suffocating and ended up throwing up which actually made me feel better the pain in the back came again about six hours later but didn't get that bad and i was able to fall asleep again my only experience with heartburn is a burning type sensation acidy in my through and chest and my only experience with gas is either sharp pains or in my stomach has somebody else experienced this it does sound like a bit of reflux and or heartburn but it really really sounds like trapped gas to me i had the exact same thing try laying on a heating pad on low for minutes at a time to relieve the pain if it comes back again my doctor suggested this when i was weeks along and had a pinched sciatic nerve so it's ok in combination with the digestive problems there may be other things going on that occur in most normal pregnancies here is an article that i found on webmd for you during pregnancy a woman's center of gravity shifts forward stressing her spine and pelvis at the same time hormonal changes occur which prepare the uterus for childbirth these hormones also cause the ligaments that support the spine and pelvis to relax so that the birth canal can widen allowing the baby to pass out into the world this relaxation of spinal ligaments results in a loss of spinal stability thereby stressing the joints and muscles of the spine and causing back pain these postural and hormonal changes can cause not only lower back pain but may also result in upper emphasis added back pain neck pain and headaches hang in there there will be more good days than bad congrats on your pregnancy hope you feel better soon Childbirth Obstetrics Pregnancy Gastroesophageal reflux disease Professional wrestling holds Spina bifida Chronic fatigue syndrome Prostate cancer Miscarriage Chiropractic Osteoarthritis Carpal tunnel syndrome Weight training Heartburn Androgen insensitivity syndrome Massage First aid Fecal incontinence Paget's disease of bone Fertility awareness Endometriosis Asthma Stomach cancer Traumatic brain injury Abortion Sciatica Syringomyelia Repetitive strain injury Coeliac disease Insulin Angina Vertebral column Pelvis Sleep Clinical depression Tightlacing Multiple sclerosis Folic acid Scapula Muscle Back pain Orgasm Migraine Mattress Premature birth Tetrapod Pneumonia Autonomic nervous system Myocardial infarction Mandible Cancer Autoimmune diseases Professional wrestling throws Cephalic disorder Spinal stenosis Progesterone Urination Spinal cord injury Breast Anxiety Cat Tocopherol Psoriasis Ectopic pregnancy Post Polio syndrome Duchenne muscular dystrophy Cervix Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders EastEnders Diabetic neuropathy Transsexuality In vitro fertilisation Cryptorchidism Osteoporosis Hypoglycemia Spinal cord Milton H.
