abortion i think that abortion is murder but if the baby poses a health risk to the mom i think that the mother should be able to abort for her sake who agrees i agree with you because if you are at a serious risk death or severe complications then why would you want to continue with the pregnancy if the mom were to die there is a small chance the baby will survive through the circumstances so why have two people die i also do not agree with abortion i think it's horrible but i couldn't leave my husband alone in this world without a baby or a wife if such circumstances arose i am weeks pregnant and very healthy and have never considered an abortion but a lot can change if a person is put into that position if one believes in heaven then that innocent soul will be given another chance and so will the mom Abortion debate Abortion Pregnancy EastEnders Miscarriage Partial-birth abortion Knots Landing Premature birth Days of our Lives Abortion in the United States Religion and abortion Pro-choice Birth control Roe v.
