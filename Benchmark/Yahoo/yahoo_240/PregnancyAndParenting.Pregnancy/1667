how do they tell if you're overdue i have had questions as far as my due date since the beginning of my pregnancy the early ultrasounds all go right along with what i believe my lmp and conception date was but this is my first baby and i worry about everything i have had complications so i go get my fluids checked on an ultrasound machine every week since week weeks now i guess my question here is would the doctor ultrasound tech be able to tell if i were actually overdue by at least a week well i had several different due dates and in my th week i went for an ultrasound for my fluid to be checked and to see if my due date was correct because i was so big and my belly was measuring that i was overdue the ultrasound confirmed that my first due date was correct the one i had assumed the technician also told me that the ultrasounds in early pregnancy are most likely correct because there is more space and they can see the baby properly you can go up to weeks before they induce you but you may be induced earlier if you fluid gets low i had a lot of similar issues and worries but that is normal and everything will be fine and gl and congrats Pregnancy Obstetrics Miscarriage Abortion Prenatal diagnosis Childbirth Medical ultrasonography Intact dilation and extraction Birth weight Prenatal care Breech birth Androgen insensitivity syndrome Dialysis Prostate cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) In vitro fertilisation Spina bifida Intraocular lens Fertility awareness Cephalic disorder Amniotic sac Turner syndrome Abortion in the United States Stillbirth Killian documents Breastfeeding Ovarian cyst Wheel of Fortune Loudspeaker Chiropractic Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Stroke EastEnders Traumatic brain injury Cirrhosis Urinary incontinence Scientology beliefs and practices Pregnancy fetishism Medical prescription Birth control Mach kernel Cryptorchidism Carburetor Puberty Midwifery Insulin CPU cache Stomach cancer Medicine Ultrasound Endometriosis Hypertension Glycogen storage disease type I 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, vote suppression House Mouse Chemical abortion Jordan (model) Person Abortion debate Endometrial cancer Nuclear fission Quantum computer Equine conformation Blood pressure Premature birth Iliotibial band syndrome NX bit Guinea pig Extreme Programming Financial audit HIV test Crohn's disease Aortic dissection Year 2000 problem Gastroparesis Diabetes mellitus Gravis Ultrasound Erectile dysfunction Infantilism Acute respiratory distress syndrome Superconductivity Condom Extrasolar planet Prolactinoma The Parting of the Ways Physical paradox Vorticity Ascites Species Physics Drug test Friends Theory of conduct Luminiferous aether Polycystic ovary syndrome History of intersex surgery Sonoluminescence Britney Spears Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Radiation therapy
