is my bank making this up or is this true i went in today to sign up for a checking account the main point of this was to get a debit card so i can buy stuff online without having my parent's credit card and also to bring around so i don't have to carry lots of cash i have a job so i'd just deposit my checks into there well i go in and they say i can't get one since i'm only and you have to be which i think is a load of crap because lots of my friends have their own cards in their name my mom is even on the account with me but they still won't let me get one but my mom was able to get one they said we could both us it but how if the card is in her name how can i use it i can see how to use it for atms and online because all i need is a pin but how would i use it in the store if it's in her name them how can i use it in the store the bank is right to have any single bank account you must be or over if you are younger than you can get a joint account with someone or older a joint account works quite easily you both will have access to the account in your case you each should receive a debit card with your name on it or you both may get one with both your names on it as long as you have a photo id you won't have any problems Debit card Automatic teller machine EFTPOS Bank fraud Credit card Internet fraud Octopus card Password MetroCard Electronic money Surveillance Cheque Credit card fraud Identity theft Two-factor authentication SmartRider Money Craps E-ZPass Oyster card Double-entry book-keeping Loyalty program Money supply London Underground Personal finance Ulster Bank Stored-value card Bank of America Neopets MapleStory Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Interac Bank of China (Hong Kong) Citigroup Automated Clearing House Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Popular, Inc Schabir Shaik Trial Online gambling Small business Blackjack The Amazing Race Slot machine Steam (content delivery) Online shop Electronic commerce RFID Betting (poker) Scrip Asset Discover Card Financial audit Filling station Authentication Magnet Euro Finance VISA (credit card) Shit Credit union Cruising (maritime) E-mail MTR Best Buy Sears Holdings Corporation Windows XP CPU cache Phishing Tesco Draw poker Identity document Financial services President's Choice Financial Wheel of Fortune Frank Abagnale Mutual fund ITunes Music Store Wall Street TransUnion Gold standard Margin (finance) Charles Ponzi Star Trek Customizable Card Game Playing card Poker jargon Economy of Chile Commodore 64 Monetary policy David Beckham AmigaOS Digital photography Rail terminology BancNet Liberty Dollar Transaction processing Enron Corporation
