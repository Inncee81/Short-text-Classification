can i cancel a loan check that has been issued i applied for a student loan through ge money and i did not realize just how much money it would cost me in the long run to pay it off it's like for i haven't cashed the check is it possible to cancel the whole affair is the funds have not been officially accessed am i likely to have to pay the origination fee please i need to know grrr damnn the lenders they're not open on the weekend so it's on my head and i can't get an answer so that's why i ask here obviously the responses will vary but thanks for the input anyway you should call ge money rather than ask yahoo answers usually you can pay back the entire loan even if you cash the check if you send it all back to them right away i would assume not cashing the check works the same way you may still have to pay a fee but again nobody on here can answer this question the way your lenders can because ge money wrote the contract so ask them about the details good luck Student loan Mortgage Insurance Credit card Bond Predatory lending Life insurance Corporation Monetary policy Education in the United States Short selling Financial markets Cheque Money supply Annuity Unemployment benefit SCO-Linux controversies National Kidney Foundation Singapore Microeconomics Gold standard Citigroup Deflation (economics) Finance Debt Privatization Usury Internet fraud Betting (poker) Tax Graduate school United States Postal Service Inflation Repurchase agreement Interest Higher Education Bill Payday loan Federal National Mortgage Association Schabir Shaik Trial 2003 California recall Interest rate Annual percentage rate $ale of the Century Central bank Islamic economics Economy of Russia Tuition Tertiary education fees in Australia Virgin Mobile Rational pricing Stock Hyperinflation Bank fraud Variable universal life insurance SmartRider Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?
