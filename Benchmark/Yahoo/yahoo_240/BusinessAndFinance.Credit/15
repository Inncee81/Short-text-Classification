minor can ruin their credit nco is evil when i was i forgot to pay a couple of bills which was placed on my credit is this possible the charges started in january i was my birthday was in may and the debt was put on my account in october shouldnt this be taken of my credit since i was only when the charges were incurred i have already paid the debt it was for but they put it on my account as like or times even though it shows up on my report it shows as paid which is just as bad surprisingly itonly shows on my experian my trans union and equifax are clean it was for a website that i registerd to do a project after i was done with it i forgot to cancel it and they kept billing me for like months and i saw a letter in the mail saying i owed and now its showing on my report as nco fin the domain people were and internet and the worse thing is it doesnt show up once as it shows up times as or so a collection agency cannot legally place more than one trade line for the same account on your credit reports by placing it on your reports or times they are seriously violating your rights it seems nco does not care if they violate the fcra and fdcpa even after they had to pay out million for their fcra violations experian is evil and very hard to deal with but you should try and dispute the accounts on one page list each account name of account account number reporting reported by nco etc then say that they are duplicate accounts they are violating your rights by being reported and that you are requesting deletion of all of the accounts do not include in that dispute that it is your account that it should be reported as not that the account is paid etc in other words never offer any info that would show that it is your account offering info that the account is yours will make it harder for you to make ex do what they are supposed to do what may happen is that nco may delete all of them may not verify them and ex will have to delete may verify all of them may correct the amount and remove all but one if nco verifies all of the accounts then file complaints with the bbb the ftc your ag and nco's ag wait a few days to give nco the chance to realize you had filed those complaints then file another dispute with ex and include a copy of your ftc complaint with your dispute send all of your disputes to ex by certified mail keep copies of everything create a paper trail since you had already paid the account nco cannot sue you for it but you sure can sue nco for the violations if they keep all of them on your report Credit repair SCO-Linux controversies Experian Internet fraud 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities Credit score Neopets Florida Central Voter File Credit card ITunes Advance fee fraud Stopping e-mail abuse Wal-Mart United States Postal Service SCO v.
