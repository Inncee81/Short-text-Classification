what is a good way to improve credit for a year old with bad credi and a credit score the reason why my score is so low is when i was i signed up for a website from and internet for a project when i was done i forgot to cancel and i kept getting billed for a month for months now i have nco on my reporting as a paid debt but its still just as bad and even though i paid in debt it shows up on my report times each or so right now i have a bank of america secured card every month i use about on it and when its due i pay the whole each time ive had it since may updated based on your details it sounds like your focus should be on the bad marks on your account if you're sure that the company shows the account as paid and closed you can simply contest the entries with the three credit bureaus and see what happens often the company that posted those bad marks won't respond and they will be removed this might also remove that entire account from your credit report which probably won't hurt you you might also try begging and pleading with the company that left the bad marks explain that it was a mistake that you did the right thing and paid in full and that this is hurting you financially now you may have to go through several people there before you find one who can or will help you worst case might be that you keep the bad marks but put a statement on each of your credit reports explaining them the nolo page in the url below explains all of this Credit card Plame affair Student loan Internet fraud Debt Phishing Unemployment United Kingdom corporation tax Deflation (economics) Mortgage Financial audit Social Security (United States) Credit repair GameFAQs Mutual fund Bank fraud Star Trek: Enterprise Babe Ruth H2G2 Sydney Riot of 1879 Schabir Shaik Trial U.S. public debt Theory of conduct Corporate governance The Amazing Race Temasek Holdings Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Pittsburgh Steelers Credit history Money U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Hyperinflation Ford Motor Company Neopets Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Financial services 1957 World Series Inflation Annuity Enron Corporation Open Directory Project Gold standard Economy of Russia America Online Poker jargon Bank 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Search engine optimization Personal finance Citigroup Octopus card Mail Cindy Sheehan Interest Dave Ramsey Bank of America Web crawler Mergers and acquisitions Microeconomics Whose Line Is It Anyway?
