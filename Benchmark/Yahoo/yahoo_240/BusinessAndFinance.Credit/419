credit cards i owe two credit cards and they are about each there is one that charges more interest than the other one so my question should i pay them equally or pay more money to the one that has the higher interest i would pay more money to the higher interest rate and still make my regular payments on the other one try to get them back down then only use them for emergencies or when you know you can pay off the entire bill when it comes due why should you give the credit card companies more of your hard earned money than you have to Credit card Bond Bank Student loan Debt Money Taxation in the United States Credit score Insurance Mortgage Interest Mutual fund FairTax Internet fraud 401(k) Life insurance Derivative (finance) Minimum wage Deflation (economics) PE ratio Monetary policy Dividend Citigroup Primerica Financial Services Tax Interest rate Gold standard Credit card fraud Salary cap Microeconomics Government debt Health insurance EFTPOS Predatory lending Islamic banking Phone sex Capitalism Wachovia Financial services Poker jargon Cheque Baccarat Publicly funded medicine Currency Micropayment Telephone booth Annuity Social Security (United States) Anarchism and capitalism United Kingdom corporation tax Fixed income Bretton Woods system Tom DeLay Article One of the United States Constitution Card Sharks Fiat money Schabir Shaik Trial National Football League Abramoff-Reed Indian Gambling Scandal Betting (poker) Credit union American Express Octopus card Electronic money Security (finance) Debit card Ponzi scheme Corporation Filling station Finance Hyperinflation High-yield debt Tertiary education fees in Australia Auto insurance Debt consolidation Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Flat tax Smart card National Insurance Supply-side economics U.S. public debt Government National Mortgage Association Health care in the United States Scrip Collateralized debt obligation Refinancing Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Individual Savings Account Tax resistance Legal tender Labor theory of value Inflation Xerox Federal Reserve Public policy Topps Mail fraud Short selling
