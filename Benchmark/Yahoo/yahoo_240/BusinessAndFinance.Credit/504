can i cancel my credit card i have one credit card i have to pay annual now i want to cancel this card after i get one good card with no annual feel is it possible to cancel the card you can always cancel your credit cards but i'd say don't cancel before you get that good card and don't transfer balances i worked for a credit card company and they get you with the balance transfer offers don't do them what happens is you transfer your balance and if you buy something when you make your payments you payments go to the highest apr so say your regular apr is and you have your balance transfer at which usually is only at that for a months untill you pay off your balance you whole payments will be put toward the big purchases which means when your is over that whole balance that you transfered is now at and none of you payments went to that amount you transfered so your min monthly payments go up since your bal is higher i hope that made sense and i hope it helps Credit card Refinancing Bank Mortgage Credit score Internet fraud Credit card fraud Student loan Bond Annuity Surveillance Personal finance Oyster card EFTPOS Credit history Mutual fund Poker jargon Interest Debt MetroCard Credit derivative Insurance Life insurance Baccarat Public transport Food Stamp Program Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Betting (poker) Bank fraud Gross domestic product Primerica Financial Services Surplus value Electronic money Cheque Amway Annual percentage rate Dividend 401(k) Micropayment Tax Money Electronic commerce Futures contract Copyleft Auto insurance Predatory lending Taxation in the United States Anarchist economics Hire purchase Short selling Pension Sears Holdings Corporation Collateralized debt obligation Lottery Security (finance) National Insurance Legal tender Monetary policy Warren Buffett Treaty of Versailles Citigroup Monopoly (game) Islamic banking Online shop Leasing Minimum wage Common Agricultural Policy The Amazing Race Schabir Shaik Trial United Kingdom corporation tax Bretton Woods system Microeconomics Smart card Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) Virgin Mobile Topps Double-entry book-keeping Deflation (economics) Mail Salary cap Social Credit National Football League Great Depression Deficit spending Debit card Government National Mortgage Association Gold standard Identity theft SCO-Linux controversies Wheel of Fortune Donald Trump Wachovia Balance of payments Home Box Office Filling station Social Security (United States)
