need help figuring out a term when looking for credit cards alright seeing as the popularity of credit cards is growing i'm taking intrest however some stores that i like local ones don't take credit cards so i was wondering if anyone knew the term for this type of service you can go to an atm thing and it'll give you cash if you put in your credit card like if i needed for shopping i could just go and put my credit card into the machine and tell it how much i need and it'll give it to me right away instead of using my debit card this service would be really helpful and so if anyone knows any credit cards that do it please share thanks in advance its called cash advance there's a charge for this which can vary depending on the card provider it is either a amount of the cash you take out or a flat fee again depending on the card company on top of that though the amount you take out will actually be amount you'd need to repay so there's interest on the balance as well that is if the balance you owe goes past what they call the grace period which is the amount of time where interest isn't added onto what you have to pay back what i would recommend you do instead of major credit cards is to get a debit card from a checking account there's no interest on them plus nearly all of them have major logos on them visa mastercard you can use them at all atm's and even use them for things like airline tickets hotel reservations and rental cars make sure to read all the fine print on any credit card you're thinking about getting too because there is a ton of hidden fees its probably one of if not the most sketchy industries out there Debit card Bank EFTPOS Octopus card Citigroup Insurance SmartRider Internet fraud Discover Card Surveillance Mutual fund Oyster card MasterCard Interest E-ZPass Financial services Filling station Slot machine Monopoly (game) Bond Public transport Mortgage MetroCard Personal finance Taxation in the United States The Amazing Race Double-entry book-keeping Ulster Bank Betting (poker) Poker jargon Money supply Annuity Cheque Predatory lending EasyGroup Electronic money Schabir Shaik Trial Scrip Debt Wheel of Fortune United Kingdom corporation tax Stock Stored-value card Identity theft MapleStory Donald Trump Virgin Mobile Tax Mainframe computer Chip and PIN Loyalty program Leasing Postage stamp Money creation Monetary policy Financial audit Advance fee fraud Let's Make a Deal Primerica Financial Services Microeconomics Interac Tarot Textile manufacturing Toll road Marshall Plan Tesco Economy of Chile FairTax Euro CPU design Aldi Sears Holdings Corporation Inflation Islamic banking Cooperative Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Accounting methods Alcohol fuel Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks National Kidney Foundation Singapore Life insurance Cruising (maritime) Short selling Floppy disk Rafic Hariri International Airport
