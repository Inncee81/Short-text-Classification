will it show on my credit report that i settled with a collection agency i want to settle a payment but wanted to know if it will continue to affect my credit will it show on my credit that i settled with a collection agency yes it will anything that is negative on your credit will continue to show on your report for up to seven years however it is much better for you that your account shows as a paid collection account rather than an open collection account which will stay on your account until it's paid and then another seven years from the date that it is paid you can ask the collection agency if they would be willing to remove it from your credit if you pay but most likely they will not do that assuming that you pay this debt now and it continues to show on your credit but now as a paid account rather than an open account you can consider writing to the collection agency in a few years and ask them to remove it from your credit even though a negative mark can stay on your credit for up to seven years ten years if it's a bakruptcy case it doesn't have to stay on that long and many companies are willing to remove this earlier if you write to them requesting that and the account was paid in full years before hope this helps Bond Credit score Credit card Taxation in the United States Annuity Social Security (United States) United Kingdom corporation tax Debt Credit repair Child support Credit default swap Student loan Identity theft Insurance Article One of the United States Constitution Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus FairTax Life insurance Pension Deflation (economics) Bank fraud Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Debt levels and flows Microeconomics Money Primerica Financial Services Municipal bond Estoppel Euro Gold standard Credit history Short selling Mensal__o scandal Credit risk Derivative (finance) Billboard Hot 100 Government debt Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Mortgage Advance fee fraud Financial audit Drug test Surveillance Schabir Shaik Trial Financial services Temasek Holdings Citigroup Internet fraud Screenplay Bank Cheque Delta Goodrem Finance Payroll High-yield debt Externality Futures contract Lloyd's of London Credit rating agency Credit card fraud Trade union The Amazing Race Commodity markets Toll road Monetary policy U.S. generally accepted accounting principles Corporate governance Minimum wage Legal tender Mutual fund Oakland Athletics Individual Savings Account Corporate finance Hurricane Katrina timeline Plame affair Security (finance) Bretton Woods system Opera (web browser) Spyware Personal finance Dividend Health insurance Electronic toll collection National Insurance Secretar__a de Inteligencia Depreciation Economy of the United States Wachovia Accounting methods Poker jargon Economy of Sri Lanka Fiat money Credit union Technocratic movement Copyleft Currency United States Department of the Treasury GNU General Public License Tax
