i just looked at my credit report the hospital claimed that i owed them money but never really sent me a bill they were also told the truth don't bill me because my mom is responsible for my bills i see that they have put a mark on my credit i want to dispute this i wrote the ftc and filed a complaint against them is it possible to get this taken off my credit how do i find out my credit score for free this is driving me crazy does the majority of the public have a perfect score or what is the normal score i don't just want a free report i want the score i was when this went on if you were over when the services were rendered you are responsible for the medical bills regardless of what you and your mother told the hospital if you were under then it should be removed because you were not of age to contract and your mother would be responsible the best way to handle this is to write to each of the three major bureaus trans union experian and equifax disputing the debt as not mine if you were under i would include proof of your age at the time services were rendered if it shows you were a minor now if you were over you could dispute the date of services the amount owed or any other factors that may be inaccurate the hospital has days to verify the information as accurate i have to tell you that this is probably an uphill battle for you because if the information is accurate nobody can legitimately have it removed as for most people's scores i have never seen a perfect score an average score is in the mid to high six hundreds credit bureaus have to give you a free credit report every year but can charge you for your scores also those credit reports that include all three bureaus may give you a score but they are never accurate the system has really turned ino a major rip off anyway that's pretty much what you can expect sorry i couldnt give you more info Credit score TransUnion Credit card Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Killian documents Plame affair SCO-Linux controversies Credit repair E-mail spam Insurance EastEnders Publicly funded medicine Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Tom DeLay Bond United States Postal Service Medical malpractice Days of our Lives Contract bridge Surveillance National Health Service Stopping e-mail abuse Cheating in Counter-Strike Mumia Abu-Jamal Taxation in the United States SAT Microeconomics Child support Intelligence quotient Slander and libel ELO rating system Internet fraud British national identity card Kurt Cobain Medicare (Canada) United Kingdom corporation tax SCO v.
