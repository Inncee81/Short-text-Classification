when you go through your own credit report does something about the way they collect information on your life seem quite sinister there is nothing sinister about what they do they collect what others send them the problem imho is that there are no checks and balances when bad data is either re reported that has been proved to be false or has been removed from the bureau's records and just any responsibility on their part for anything on your file the creditors are the ones that report information to the credit bureaus they may or may not send information to all three major bureaus when information is dropped corrected closed etc sometimes this gets to some of the bureaus correctly but maybe one still carries the information wrong love it then you are responsible to get this corrected at that one bureau it all falls back on the consumer to manage and monitor what others are sending in and maintaining on their credit history why should we have to fight so hard when there are no real policies in place for consistent file set up data storage transmissions reporting functions etc and if you get it straighten out once there is no guarantee that it will remain that way not sinister just not well thought out and a pain to the consumer Pretty Good Privacy Surveillance C programming language File format Error correction and detection Windows 2000 Debugging Information Technology Infrastructure Library Trademark Corporate governance Modem Web crawler CPU cache Scientology beliefs and practices Domain Name System Halting problem Redundant array of independent disks Digital circuit RFID Credit repair Password Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Hubble Space Telescope Bank fraud Embedded system FidoNet Probation officer Linked list Windows XP Plame affair Economy of Russia Freenet MDAC Objective-C Medical prescription Federal Standard 1037C Universal Serial Bus Computer Computer insecurity System/34 Deflation (economics) Data recovery Equine conformation Hard disk Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act TransUnion Economics Credit card Oracle database Garbage collection (computer science) Musical Instrument Digital Interface Anonymous remailer Year 2000 problem Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Computer virus Expert system Datatype Object-oriented programming Transmission Control Protocol Artificial neural network Virtual memory Tom DeLay XML Identity theft Quantum cryptography Domestic violence Credit history EMule Abortion Financial audit Token ring Gmail United States Postal Service Bank Microsoft Jet Database Engine Digital rights management Customer relationship management Streaming media Digital photography Buffer overflow Database Police system of Japan Distributed hash table HIPAA United States Department of State Hong Kong Police Force Oscilloscope System/36 Btrieve Call centre G__del's incompleteness theorem Brainfuck Mathematical model Database management system Management information system Computer security Hash function
