what is the best way to deal with credit cards that have been written off any personal experiences do you contact any organizations or is it better to just ride it out i've heard that if you contact the collection agencies after a certain amount of time that it resets the clock in terms of how long they can harass you for i'd prefer personal experiences rather than negative insults or judgements i know i screwed up and i'm trying to fix it thank you if you just contact the collection agencies it will not reset any clocks what will reset the clock is if you make a written promise to pay or actually make a payment they can never harass you but they can make reasonable attempt to collect the debt until it is paid if they do harrass you they could be in violation of the fair debt collection practices act fdcpa you could then turn around and sue them for the violation a negative item can only be reported for years from the date of the negative item so for charge offs that is years from the date of the last delinquency if you have passed that date it can no appear on your credit report there is another time limit called the statute of limitations this varies by state but is between years for credit card debt once you are outside of this they can no longer take any legal action sue to get you to pay if you are no where near either of these you will first want to send them a request to validate the debt by certified mail they have days to do this and if they do not you can have it removed from your credit report if they do validate the debt you should negociate with them that if you pay off the account they will remove the colllection account do this by mail making sure you list the amount to be paid and the dates it is to be paid on do not send them any money until you have a written aggrement from them as to the amount and that they will remove the information Bond Credit card Article One of the United States Constitution Contract Child support Annuity United States Postal Service Fair Game (Scientology) Appeal Plame affair Surveillance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Credit repair E-mail spam Taxation in the United States Daylight saving time Microeconomics Animal Crossing Credit score Student loan Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Supreme Court of the United States Estoppel Copyright Social Security (United States) Copyright law of the United Kingdom Internet fraud Health insurance Mail fraud Legal tender Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 FairTax Drug test Betting (poker) Trust (Law) USA Monetary policy Life insurance Postage stamp GNU General Public License Insurance Minimum wage Corporation Money Poker jargon USA PATRIOT Act Interest Tax protester Octopus card Derivative (finance) Bank fraud Personal finance Tom DeLay Gold standard Stopping e-mail abuse United States Constitution 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, vote suppression Data retention Spam (electronic) Deflation (economics) Fiat money Electronic toll collection 1995 Quebec referendum Debt 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities Trade union Public domain Deprogramming Economy of the United States Security (finance) SCO-Linux controversies Mail Administrative law of the United States Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution Blackjack Constitution Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Divorce Public-key cryptography Slander and libel Credit card fraud Schabir Shaik Trial Government debt Pirate decryption Bank Public transport Gmail Debt levels and flows
