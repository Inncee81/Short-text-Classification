he's returning the car will it give him bad credit my boyfriend currently lost his job and cannot afford to pay the car that he took out a loan for about months ago he wants to return the car but isn't sure on if it will give him bad credit is it worse to have it repo'd or if he simply returns it what will end up happening does anyone know it's a dodge charger and it cost somewhere between i can answer that question from my own experience a voluntary repossession will show up on his credit report the loan carrier will sell his vehicle for far under it's value and that amount subtracted from the loan value he will still owe expect that amount to be in the thousands of dollars and the loan company to aggressively pursue that amount owed even if the statue of limitations runs out on the loan and they do not manage to sue him by them it will remain on his credit report causing great damage to his credit rating for a long time years i'm not sure if it will help but he can try and contact the creditor now and explain his situation he may be able to negotiate something with him to avoid a repossession it'd would be by far in his best interests another alternative is to advertise the vehicle in the paper or auto trader as a take over payments only sale do so quickly because once the loan defaults he will certainly wake up one morning without a vehicle Insurance Corporation Credit card Mortgage Student loan Bond Great Depression Interest Life insurance Deflation (economics) Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Hyperinflation Annuity Bank Government debt Auto insurance Bretton Woods system Derivative (finance) Microeconomics Monetary policy Economy of Russia Citigroup 401(k) Taxation in the United States Dodge Charger Arbitrage Gold standard Short selling Credit score Money Primerica Financial Services Chrysler Corporation Capital accumulation Social Security (United States) Mergers and acquisitions Internet fraud E85 Grand Theft Auto (game) Air America Radio United Kingdom corporation tax Ford Motor Company Automobile Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Audi Pound sterling History of the United States (1918-1945) Credit derivative Bank fraud Sport utility vehicle Steve Jobs Weimar Republic Inflation Repurchase agreement Microcredit Kyoto Protocol Stock Schabir Shaik Trial Toyota Prius Privatization American Motors Babylonian law Money supply Estoppel Hire purchase Tire Economy of Argentina Yield curve Credit default swap Marshall Plan Futures contract Battery electric vehicle Enron Corporation Economy of Romania Personal finance Security (finance) Pharmaceutical company Health insurance Henry Ford Islamic economics Air America-Gloria Wise loan controversy Real estate broker U.S. public debt Filling station Tort reform Amtrak Muscle car MG Rover Group Call centre Unemployment Canadian Pacific Railway Capitalism
