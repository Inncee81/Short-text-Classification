will it hurt my credit to exceed my credit limit i have no credit but was issued a credit card through my work i'm a cashier at a department store in order to receive my discount on the merchandise i buy my credit limit is and i went over by this month will this hurt my credit and will there be a fee also how long do i have to wait to request that my credit limit be increased is such a small amount and with the paychecks i earn i can surely afford to spend more than that i get paid tomorrow and plan on paying the bill in full asap mangamaniaciam paying my bill off in montly payments would result in hefty interest charges my current balance is and the interest rate is so i'm definitely paying it off in full if they choose to drop me from their credit company then good for them i won't shop in their store regardless of whether i work there or not the phamplet i got with my credit card states that there is overlimit fee so i suppose this is a good thing the credit card terms vary but most will charge an overlimit fee to pay the account down before you get the statement or due date won't help going over your limit won't be reported to the credit bureau so isn't what hurts your score the ratio of debt to available credit is a big part of your credit score anything over debt kills your score with a limit it won't take much to go over the best way to increase that credit limit is to pay the account in full and on time every month be sure not to go over you limit again it might take months to a year before they increase your limit Credit card Bond Student loan Wal-Mart Social Security (United States) Bank FairTax Insurance Mutual fund Debt Mortgage Credit score Annuity Personal finance Sears Holdings Corporation Internet fraud Futures contract Neopets Microeconomics Octopus card Gold standard United Kingdom corporation tax Mergers and acquisitions Primerica Financial Services Taxation in the United States Life insurance Deflation (economics) Debt consolidation PE ratio London Congestion Charge Betting (poker) Filling station Economy of Russia Credit card fraud Finance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Tax Money Tertiary education fees in Australia Poker jargon Social Security debate (United States) Credit history Legal tender Financial audit Interest Capitalism Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Publicly funded medicine Monetary policy Auto insurance Gross domestic product Salary cap Short selling Public transport Best Buy Economy of the United States Financial services Cheque Minimum wage Treasury security Food Stamp Program Education in the United States Intellectual property Deficit spending Member of the European Parliament Government debt EFTPOS Stock Schabir Shaik Trial U.S. public debt Euro Variable universal life insurance Fiat money Higher Education Bill Hyperinflation Capital accumulation Islamic banking Corporation Double-entry book-keeping Child support Dividend History of the United States (1918-1945) Graduate school Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Cable television Tom DeLay Electronic commerce Article One of the United States Constitution Security (finance) MetroCard Bretton Woods system 401(k) Arbitrage Estoppel
