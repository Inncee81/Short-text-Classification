i'm hesistant to check my credit score because i heard it will affect my score is this true or not as with all things credit this issue is a hell of a lot more complicated than people think it is and there is a lot of misinformation floating around about this you are going to have to read this carefully as it gets very complex ok first of all you can get both hard and soft inquiries a soft inquiry occurs when you check your credit yourself this can be done directly via the credit bureau's although you would have to do it seperate times one for each bureau you can also do this via myfico com freecreditreport com etc however there are a few problems with this these companies are out to sell you all kinds of crap you don't need they are constantly bombarding you trying to get you to buy all kinds of non sense products things such as indetity theft protection which is something you do not need the credit scores that they give you are fako's and not fico's which are the real credit scores that lenders use you could get your fako and then apply for a mortgage and be really shocked by how much higher lower your fako is compared to your real fico there are hard inquiries which are done by auto dealers mortgage company's credit card companies and others these kind of inquiries can and do reduce your fico who knows what they do to fako ha and decrease can be any place between about points depending on a very wide variety of other factors the average is about points or so ok finally i will end by busting a widely held myth people claim that you can run your credit for the purposes of getting a mortgage for a period of days and have it not decrease your credit score this can be true but is usually not true and is just a selling point that mortgage brokers and bankers use to sell loans the thing is this mortgage companies run their credit via a rd party company the rd party companies takes data for all of the bureau's and merge them into what is called a tri merged report this is the grand daddy of them all and this is what mortgage lenders use and this is considered your most complete and accurate credit report this is also the only place where you can get your real credit scores ok there is some software that can be used that will put the day rule mentioned above into effect soft ware used by the rd party companies however it cost thousands and thousands of dollars to buy this soft ware and the vast majority of rd party companies either can not afford it or just do no wish to buy it because it is too costly as such most of the time when you run your credit for a mortage your fico will decrease i hope this helps Mortgage Insurance Credit score Predatory lending Bond Blackjack Illegal drug trade Life insurance Deflation (economics) Citigroup Capitalism Bank Debt Capital accumulation Supply and demand Short selling Identity theft Student loan Microeconomics Inflation Mergers and acquisitions Mutual fund Title insurance Arguments for and against drug prohibition Primerica Financial Services Surplus value Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Central processing unit Credit card History of the United States (1918-1945) Surveillance Gold standard Islamic banking Grand Theft Auto (game) Wood FairTax Taxation in the United States Bulk vending Poker jargon Bretton Woods system Donald Trump Model (economics) Intellectual property Annuity Federal National Mortgage Association Redundant array of independent disks Flat tax Derivative (finance) Construction CPU design Annual percentage rate Public-key cryptography Finance Central bank Digital photography Internet fraud Money supply Hyperinflation Appeal Hard disk Economy of Russia Government National Mortgage Association Microcredit Asian financial crisis Hearts (game) TransUnion Interest Auto insurance Warez Pornography MP3 Floppy disk Economic inequality Reliability engineering Great Depression Economy of the United States Subsidy Mach kernel Yield curve Theory of conduct Credit history Tesco Law of value Sears Holdings Corporation Explosive material RISC Baccarat Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Bank fraud Personal finance Call centre Ford Motor Company
