does anyone know how to improve your credit score in a short time i need to refinance my house but my credit score is i need it at minimum to be able to refi with a good rate and get cash out does anyone know how to get a score up that much in a short amount of time i know i owe about on credit cards and i have some lates on there i am going to pay the credit cards off but does anyone know how i can get that score up within mths or so pay the credit cards early don't wait until the last day try paying them three weeks early if you only have in debt there's not much you can do because that's actually pretty low it's the lates that are hurting you and they don't improve until months go by don't open a new credit card because that takes about months until it doesn't affect your credit if your debts are more than of your limit ask the credit card companies to up your limit so that your percentage of debt is smaller if you have it all on one card and that makes it go over put some on another card you could also improve your credit by putting money in a bank or credit union and taking out a secured loan for the same amount secured because the money is held by the bank and then paying it off quickly to show you're responsible that would help Credit card Bond Student loan Debt Credit score Mortgage Deflation (economics) Bank Poker jargon Money supply Interest Monetary policy Internet fraud Hyperinflation Credit history Government debt Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Security (finance) U.S. public debt Federal Reserve Personal finance Bank fraud Betting (poker) Derivative (finance) Slot machine Debit card FairTax Corporate finance Keynesian economics Annuity Social Security (United States) Jeopardy!
