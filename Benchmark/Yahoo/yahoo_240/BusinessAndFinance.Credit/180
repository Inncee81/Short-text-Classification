can i pay off my loan and credit card with my store card i'm with good credit so far and i don't want to screw it up i'm very responsible with my bills but i was out of work for a month and i got really behind with my rent car payments insurance cell phone etc that i only was paying the minimum amount due i have a loan and another credit card that has the whole no payments for months then the interest is super high and i haven't paid a dime on them and the time is coming i was wondering if i could use my store credit card to pay those bills off i would rather pay the lower interest rate on card verses all three is this possible and how would i go about doing that i have a low cash advance amount on my card otherwse i would just withdrawl it from an atm and put it in my bank account somebody please help my store card is a visa is your store credit card actually a visa or mastercard if so you can probably transfer the loan and other credit card balance provided you have sufficient credit limit if it's just a store credit card it's only good in that particular store and you won't be able to do a balance transfer by the way when the month's is up you are going to be billed interest for the whole six month's the only way to avoid all that high interest is to pay them off in full before the months it also sounds like you should rethink your spending habits if you make a major purchase pay it off before you finance another one Credit card Bank Mortgage Student loan Octopus card Money Auto insurance Bond Smart card Bank fraud Monetary policy Automatic teller machine Credit card fraud EFTPOS Interest Filling station Citigroup Deflation (economics) Debt Economy of Russia Personal finance Predatory lending VISA (credit card) Food Stamp Program Credit score Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Life insurance Annuity Taxation in the United States Surveillance Gold standard Islamic banking Collateralized debt obligation Government debt Health insurance Cheque Primerica Financial Services Security (finance) Economy of the Philippines Electronic money Wal-Mart History of the United States (1918-1945) Money supply Finance Bretton Woods system Refinancing Social Security (United States) Great Depression Estoppel Discover Card Corporate finance Financial services Electronic commerce Mutual fund Leasing Microeconomics Tax Bank of America Toronto-Dominion Bank Betting (poker) Schabir Shaik Trial 401(k) Education in the United States Poker jargon Public transport Capital accumulation Derivative (finance) MetroCard Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Identity theft Publicly funded medicine Reserve Bank of New Zealand Inflation Payday loan Debt consolidation Unemployment Stock Weimar Republic Keynesian economics Deficit spending Capitalism Variable universal life insurance Wachovia Compensation of employees Pension Credit derivative Arthur Laffer Blackjack
