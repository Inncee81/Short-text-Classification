how do i get a judgement off my credit report if i was told i was never there yet it is and i paid it years ago from medical disability i defaulted on a credit card well i paid it off completely after being threatened with a judgement and now i get my report and see that the judgement is there and i was never told it was real i have since paid the debt in full and this is still on my report how do i get this off i was never told any real files were done or anything just threatened by the creditor any ideas some pretty good answers except never send anything showing proof of payment to the cra's it will only cement it to your report if you paid the creditor collector directly they should have reported the payment to the court clerk and had the information placed in your file go to your county court clerk and request to see your file check to see if the payment was entered if it wasn't and you have the papers to show it was paid you request the court clerk enter it into your files if you have no paperwork make the creditor collectors life miserable until it is entered even if you have to file complaints with the bbb the ftc your ag and the creditors collectors ag if it is entered or after you request that it be entered giving them the proof that it is paid request a certified court stamped copy of the payment paper showing it was paid from your county court clerk if the cra's are reporting a dollar figure still being owed on the judgment file a dispute with the cra's saying that you have no such judgment for the amount being reported and request deletion since you paid you no longer owe what they are reporting and so they are reporting incorrectly do not send them that payment copy that you received from the county court clerk if the judgment is verified and remains without being corrected file complaints with the ftc and your ag claiming that the cra's are reporting inaccurately and that the inaccuracy was verified by whoever the cra claims verified it explain that they are violating your rights and damaging your credit since the judgment had been paid yet they continue to report it as unpaid include a copy of the certified payment paper you received from the court clerk with your dispute cra's never request verification from the courts they get their verification from rd parties such as the creditor collector lexis nexis pacer etc though many times they will claim the court verified which is an unprovable lie then redispute with the cra's include a copy of your complaint to the ftc and demand deletion of the account the ftc normally does not do much on a case by case basis they generally wait until they have numerous complaints concerning the same issue and then they may go after the offender by way of class action with that said even though the ftc probably will do nothing to intercede for you with the cra's the cra's do not like to see complaints filed against them and will generally do whatever they can to resolve the issue Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Credit card SCO-Linux controversies Appeal Probation officer Child support Estoppel Lawsuit Internet fraud 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities Contract E-mail spam 2004 U.S. election voting controversies, Ohio Notary public Public-key cryptography Schabir Shaik Trial Plame affair Killian documents GNU General Public License Annuity Bond Slander and libel Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act United Kingdom corporation tax Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Terri Schiavo SCO v.
