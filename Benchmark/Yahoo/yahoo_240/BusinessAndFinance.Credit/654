how do i build my credit score how do i build my credit score and make it really strong well i definitely agree with a lot of the first poster said but to really know how to build your score it helps to have an idea on what makes up your score so i'll break that down for you payment history total debt vs available credit length of time establishing credit types of accounts established inquiries and new accounts now having said that as you can see that payment history and total debt vs available credit are the most important factors one missed payment can end up costing you that's why it's important to pay on time you can do this by equipping yourself with the most powerful tool to build credit a checking account by establishing a banking relationship by opening up a checking and savings account you not only make yourself more available to other products the bank offers but you provide yourself a means of paying on time which is the single most important part of building credit the majority of banks offer online billpay that help deliver your payments quickly another benefit by opening up a checking account is that by being an accountholder it makes it easy to get a secured credit card if the bank offers them you can think of a secured credit card as building credit with a savings account because that's basically how they work a deposit is placed upfront usually tied to a savings account used as collateral for a credit line the same amount of the deposit for example if the deposit is then the credit line would be the deposit isn't used to pay the minimum payment or amount owed unless the account becomes delinquent to where it has to be used major benefits of secured cards are that the credit line can be increased by adding to the deposit and the deposit also gains interest while credit is being established depending on the credit card company usually after months of paying on time and keeping the balance low by making small purchases the card either changes to a regular card or a better card's offered altogether and best of all the deposit is no longer needed and given back with interest included it also helps your credit score if you're able to increase the credit line as high as possible since having high limits and low balances really help your score another way to build credit with your bank account is by taking out a small loan like by using a savings account or a certificate of deposit cd as collateral then take the proceeds of the loan and open another certificate of deposit long enough where it's slightly shorter than the length of the loan itself this way not only you're still gaining interest on the collateral but on what you borrowed too you also insure that the money to repay the loan is readily available if necessary after paying the loan's paid off repeat the process several months later to establish different types of credit an example of a balanced mixture of credit would be revolving credit cards and installment accounts by opening secured credit cards one department store card and the loan would be a good start to building credit lastly enroll with prbc prbc is america's alternative credit bureau
