is a an okay credit score how can i make it better i only have account which is my car i got pre approved for a credit card but then when i applied for it online i was declined i would really like to better my credit score i need some advice i hate to break it to you but that is a really bad score it is below average for all americans and that speaks volumes think about your average american this is a hypothetical person who is way over their head in debt has been known to pick and chose which bills he she pays borrows irresponsibly sums of money which he she has no reasonable way of repaying with certainty etc now i am not saying this is you what i am saying is that with a rating like that that is what your score is saying to potential creditors what does that mean in the great american tradition of debt financing creditors will probably still lend you money i e extend credit but now they have an excuse to rip you off on horrible terms they will charge you ridiculous rates of interest stick you with bs fees and surcharges etc they justify ripping you off because now you are a high credit risk never mind that they are making money on you hand over fist you really want to be well north of on your credit score average among americans is actually quite poor when it comes to fiscal responsibility don't make mediocrity your goal that will take time and an almost religious dedication to paying all your bills on time everytime every little slip up fair or not will cost you dearly that means living much more modestly before you charge something on a credit card think am i paying with my money or with money i don't have if you couldn't cover it with money you already have in the bank don't buy it period it is hard but in my humble opinion it is worth it also consider your car payment a fixed expense when you make money before you spend it on yourself pay the car payment think of it this way when you owe money the money you make is not yours until you pay the guy you owe i know i am not pitching some quick credit repair scheme that is not me and you should be wary of those who do there really are no shortcuts to success in life Credit card Mortgage Student loan Bond Debt Government debt Bank Deflation (economics) Insurance Predatory lending Interest Finance Money Bretton Woods system Monetary policy Microeconomics Life insurance Islamic banking Inflation Estoppel Personal finance Capital accumulation Security (finance) Hyperinflation FairTax Mutual fund Developing countries' debt Usury Great Depression Corporation Social Security (United States) Economy of Pakistan Derivative (finance) Tax Short selling Internet fraud Economy of the United States Stock Taxation in the United States Gold standard Microcredit Bank fraud History of the United States (1918-1945) Corporate finance Health insurance Schabir Shaik Trial Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus U.S. public debt United Kingdom corporation tax Arbitrage Economy of India Debt levels and flows Poker jargon Fiat money Publicly funded medicine Keynesian economics Fractional-reserve banking Social Credit Legal tender Argentine Currency Board Arthur Laffer Micropayment Advance fee fraud Education in the United States Money supply Bankruptcy Gambling Unemployment benefit Babe Ruth Article One of the United States Constitution Leeds United F.C.
