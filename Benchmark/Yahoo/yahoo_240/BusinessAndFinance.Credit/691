is it better or worse to apply for a car loan with a co signer i am about to apply for a car loan via the internet and even though my credit is not so good my cash is so anyhow i was wondering if applying with a cosigner has a more positive affect than negative in other words will it ruin my chances of obtaining the loan or make them a little better now to actually answer your question auto finance is what i do for a living and using a co signer makes sense in three cases first if your credit is bad you need a good co signer to get approved for the loan second would be if your income is not enough to qualify for the payment third would be if you had a open auto loan on your report that you were not trading in and needed the co signer to qualify for another open auto either way you both get the exact same credit for the loan when someone looks at your credit in the future all they will see is either a j for joint or a c for co sign no one will know who is the primary and who is the secondary signer if the loan is paid as agreed you both gain from it if it's not you both lose from it Bond Student loan Kyoto Protocol Monetary policy Credit score Life insurance Derivative (finance) United Kingdom corporation tax Money Predatory lending Debt Great Depression Insurance Interest Deflation (economics) Taxation in the United States Mortgage Microeconomics Internet fraud Marshall Plan Auto insurance Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe Contract Schabir Shaik Trial Short selling Personal finance Islamic banking Credit card Notary public Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Real estate broker 401(k) Corporation FairTax Futures contract Government debt Article One of the United States Constitution Bank fraud Estoppel Collateralized debt obligation Trademark Economy of the Philippines Capitalism Corporate finance Productive and unproductive labour Security (finance) Annuity Citigroup Social Credit Economy of Russia Tariff Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Tertiary education fees in Australia Stock Inflation Financial markets Israeli settlement Education in the United States Commodity markets Education in the People's Republic of China Gold standard Credit union Mortgage-backed security Bank 2000 Australian Grand Prix Hyperinflation Audi Tax Henry Ford Municipal bond Plame affair Copyright Finance Babe Ruth Unemployment benefit Payday loan Donald Trump Bretton Woods system Blackjack Arbitrage Mensal__o scandal Fractional-reserve banking Islamic economics Economy of Africa National Certificate of Educational Achievement History of post-Soviet Russia Privatization Credit derivative Margin (finance) Abortion debate Feudalism Venezuelan recall referendum, 2004 Money supply Autograph Ra (board game) Microcredit Social Security (United States) Economy of El Salvador
