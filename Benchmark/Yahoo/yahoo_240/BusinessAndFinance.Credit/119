how do i get a bad rating off my credit report i was irresponsible when i was young i allowed two credit cards go to collections i was able to pay it off years ago in full now it's biting me in the rear no big suprise there i've been told by several people whats the point if you can't get off your credit report is there any way to get if off negative items will remain on your record for years from the date of the negative item so in the case of the charge off of your accounts that will be years from the date of last delinquency not from the date you paid it off for example if you went delinquent in and paid it off in it will be removed in you won't be able to get the original creditor charge off off of your report until the years has passed however if there is still the collection account on there you might be able to get it off to do this send a dispute to the credit reporting agency transunion experian equifax requesting verification of the debt there is a good but not guaranteed chance that the collection agency will not verify the debt if they do not verify the debt it will be removed Credit card Credit score Debt consolidation Bond Mortgage Debt TransUnion Credit repair Student loan United Kingdom corporation tax Financial audit Experian Surveillance Estoppel Plame affair Taxation in the United States Tom DeLay Debt levels and flows Credit rating agency Money Annuity Deflation (economics) FairTax Islamic banking Credit card fraud Craps Bank fraud Poker jargon Bank Internet fraud E-mail spam Commodity markets Child support Article One of the United States Constitution Evan Mecham Corporation Government debt Animal Crossing Divorce Insurance Barbara Boxer Flat tax Economy of Russia Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Betting (poker) Florida Central Voter File Credit history Enron Corporation Identity theft Fair Isaac Corporation Gold standard Life insurance Primerica Financial Services United States Postal Service Blackjack Teen Girl Squad Driver's license Probation officer Interest IP (complexity) Tax protester Iraq and weapons of mass destruction Corporate governance Fiat money Double-entry book-keeping Pok__mon Trading Card Game Union shop Public-key cryptography Octopus card Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Legal tender British national identity card Government of Maryland Derivative (finance) Fractional-reserve banking Cheque Financial services 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities Virgin Mobile Universal Serial Bus Credit derivative Billboard Hot 100 Bankruptcy in the United States Brady Bonds Social Credit Paul Martin Health insurance Electronic toll collection Oakland Athletics Toll road RuneScape Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Secretar__a de Inteligencia Credit union Accountancy Babylonian law The Amazing Race Phone sex Numerology
