is this a stupid decision concerning my credit i'm and my credit score is transunion and with the other two i have a honda accord that my dad got me but both of our names are on it we pay for the most part on time stupidly i got a credit card with a limit and just about used up the entire limit but don't have the money to pay it back i didn't buy clothes and stuff but i bought stuff for college and stuff i'm trying to get a job within the next week or so my question is would it be stupid to get a loan and pay off the credit card and since i will be getting a job soon pay off the monthly payments of the loan so my credit card won't default i saw that if it did and it's turned over to a collection agency that it would affect my credit score negatively anywhere from pts i was thinking the loan would help b c with the credit card the apr is pretty high and would accumulate interest i'm just assuming it would be easier and less costly to pay off a loan than a credit card thanks make the minimum payment and open another credit card to pay the minimum payment using the new card your credit will jump even higher just don't max out the new card only transfer from one the other be payments get the job and pay down the cards you are in a great position an don't close the cards always keep two open it looks good on credit to have open accounts just not maxed out Credit card Student loan Credit score Mortgage Minimum wage Bank Betting (poker) Deflation (economics) Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Personal finance Interest Bretton Woods system Predatory lending Insurance Monetary policy Refinancing Derivative (finance) Money Short selling Baccarat Economy of the United States Life insurance Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Bank fraud Capitalism Islamic banking Economy of Russia 401(k) Microeconomics Internet fraud Social Security (United States) Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Estoppel Citigroup Schabir Shaik Trial EFTPOS Doomtown Credit history Octopus card Primerica Financial Services National Football League Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus FairTax Government debt Education in the People's Republic of China Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Fiat money Gold standard Money supply Blackjack Social Credit Micropayment TransUnion Annual percentage rate Education in the United States Corporate finance Health insurance Credit card fraud DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Capital accumulation Keynesian economics Leeds United F.C.
