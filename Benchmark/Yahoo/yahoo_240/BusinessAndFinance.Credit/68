should i cancel my credit card for this reason i have my credit card all paid off but they keep charging me these stupid and cent fees i hear you are not supposed to cancel a credit card because it will lower your credit rating but i am sick of paying these stupid fees i have never been late on a payment or anything i don't know why i am being charged this crap the reason canceling a credit card can lower your score is that it can disrupt your open credit ratio of your credit score is calculated by looking at how much credit you have available compared to how much you have used if you have a card completely paid off and a card with a balance you have used of your available credit used of a total of credit if you close the card your used credit will be or of total credit in general you want to keep your used credit under of your total available credit so you will have to look at your personal situation to determine if closing this card will help or hurt you call your credit card company and ask about the fees they sound like some sort of monthly maintenance fees ask them to stop charging the fees or ask if they have a different card with better terms Credit card Insurance Mortgage Credit score Mutual fund Virgin Mobile PE ratio Bank United States Postal Service Credit card fraud Citigroup Annuity Micropayment Interest Microeconomics Debt Credit history Taxation in the United States Predatory lending Deflation (economics) Craps Poker jargon Inflation EFTPOS Primerica Financial Services Tax Octopus card Health insurance Dividend Blackjack Life insurance Annual percentage rate SmartRider Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Telephone card Wal-Mart Personal finance Copyleft Cable television Bond National Insurance Refinancing Surveillance United Kingdom corporation tax Internet fraud Hearts (game) FairTax Skype Filling station Publicly funded medicine Debt consolidation America Online Government debt Euro American Express Bretton Woods system Payphone London Congestion Charge Debit card Money Auto insurance Unemployment benefit Managed care Sears Holdings Corporation Short selling GSM services Donald Trump Xbox Live Cribbage Schabir Shaik Trial Game programmer London Underground Tuition Television licence Impedance E-ZPass Tertiary education fees in Australia Baccarat Loudspeaker Dice Economy of Russia Space Shuttle program Public domain British national identity card Credit default swap Finance Topps Toll road Credit derivative Mainframe computer Social Security (United States) Corporate finance Card game Betting (poker) Punch card Slot machine Leasing
