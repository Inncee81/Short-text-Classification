is it better to pay a credit card bill when it comes in the mail or can you make a payment sooner i just recently got a credit card after having bad credit for a long time i used most of the available credit paying some bill and things but i am able to make a payment on the card now i haven't received my first bill yet should i wait until the bill comes or will paying it sooner affect my credit the same be careful some credit card companies won't credit your payment properly until your statment closing date if you pay the entire balance in full this shouldn't matter but if you are making a partial payment and send it to them before they generate the bill it won't be applied towards the upcoming payment that's due if you assume it will you can wind up being hit with a late payment fee i always try to pay as soon as possible over the web but i wait until the the website for the card claims i have a payment due on some upcoming date usually days after the statement closes if it says no payment is due then i either pay the balance in full or remind myself that i'll need to make another payment in a week or two Credit card Internet fraud Credit score United Kingdom corporation tax Student loan Mail Health insurance Surveillance Primerica Financial Services Insurance MetroCard Abramoff-Reed Indian Gambling Scandal Mail fraud Advance fee fraud Publicly funded medicine Phishing Identity theft Billboard Hot 100 Article One of the United States Constitution Bank fraud Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Bond Social Security (United States) Baccarat Copyleft Minimum wage Micropayment Life insurance Data retention Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Financial audit Tom DeLay Taxation in the United States Virgin Mobile Opera (web browser) Betting (poker) Unemployment benefit Mortgage Debt consolidation Public-key cryptography Poker jargon Debt The Amazing Race Blackjack Food Stamp Program Bank Deflation (economics) Refinancing Municipal bond Schabir Shaik Trial Centrelink Rick Santorum Octopus card Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Microeconomics United States Postal Service Wal-Mart London Congestion Charge Appeal Wachovia Postage stamp Accounting methods Personal finance Draw poker Keynesian economics U.S. presidential election, 2008 Neopets GSM services Electronic money Animal Crossing Collateralized debt obligation Television in the United States Walt Disney World College Program Credit default swap Theory of conduct Citigroup Cheque H-1B visa Scrip Leasehold estate Finance Dividend Estoppel Slot machine Medicare (Canada) Oakland Athletics Plame affair Islamic banking Auto insurance Mutual fund Ponzi scheme Saga (band) EFTPOS Telephone card Credit history Tertiary education fees in Australia FairTax Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji)
