how long do credit scores stay down due to inquiry if you do not get approved for the loan i applied for a credit card but got denied my credit score went down inquiries are reported for years from the date of the inquiry however in terms of scoring it only effects it for year with most of the negative hit in the first months it is not the fact that you got declined that causes the effect the inquiry would have the same effect even if you were approved you did not say how much it dropped but if this was your only recent inquiry your score should not have dropped more than a few points which can easily be made up if your score dropped dramatically or more there is probably something else that caused the drop Credit score Student loan Credit history Deflation (economics) National Certificate of Educational Achievement Identity theft Credit card 1995 Quebec referendum Contract bridge Billboard Hot 100 Asian financial crisis Toronto Computer Leasing Inquiry Bond Grade (education) SAT West Bromwich Albion F.C.
