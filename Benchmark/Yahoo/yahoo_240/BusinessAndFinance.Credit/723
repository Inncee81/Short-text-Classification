i have awful credit and cannot afford to pay everything off what should i focus on to better my credit i have quite a bit of old debt a large amount is medical but as a young adult i really messed up my credit i have repo's owe apartment complexes utility companies cell phone and a lot of medical almost all is in collection agencies i do however have one credit card and it is in good standing i would like to improve my credit but what do i pay first i cannot afford to do a debt consolidation and i need to figure out what will make the most impact and improve my credit certain things are getting ready to fall off such as the apartment complexes but i need any suggestions on what to tackle first all help is appreciated make a list of your debts their balances and their requested minimum payments figure out which debts will disappear the fastest by making the minimum payments and put them in order make a budget and figure out how much you can allocate toward your debts every month start at the top of the list and as you pay off your accounts one by one you will be able to allocate that monthly payment to the next debt but remember to always put priority on your accounts in good standing never let them fall behind when dealing with the collection agencies it is best to know exactly what you can afford to pay them so they don't end up pressuring you into paying them more and making your other bills suffer take the amount you have for your debts each month subtract the monthly payments for your accounts that are not in collections you must keep these from going to collections and then take the remainder and divide it among the various collection agencies even if you are only sending them a month at least little by little you will be reducing your debts i have a collection debt for a medical bill that was about i have been sending as much as i can each month to them every month they send me a letter stating that my small payment was appreciated but partial payments will no longer be acceptable and they want the balance in full but every time i send them a small payment they apply it to my balance so apparently every little bit counts as far as the stuff that is about to fall off it can only be on your record for years after the date of first delinquency it is up to you to decide if not paying these debts fits in with your own moral standards financially i would not place emphasis on the oldest ones right now if i were you Credit card Debt Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Bond United Kingdom corporation tax Economy of Russia Microeconomics Unemployment Insurance Credit score Personal finance Health insurance Student loan Government debt Corporate finance Deflation (economics) Taxation in the United States Schabir Shaik Trial Social Security (United States) Advance fee fraud Economy of India Money Bretton Woods system Mortgage Life insurance Bank Internet fraud Virgin Mobile Financial audit Food Stamp Program Surveillance Security (finance) Arthur Laffer Baccarat History of the United States (1918-1945) Tax Keynesian economics United States Postal Service U.S. public debt Betting (poker) Education in the People's Republic of China Divorce Child support Bank fraud Great Depression Salary cap Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Public transport Corporation Collateralized debt obligation Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Interest Article One of the United States Constitution Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Common Agricultural Policy Economy of the United States Monetary policy Capitalism Primerica Financial Services Euro Estoppel Credit history Money supply Capital accumulation Cheque Paul Martin Copyleft Education in Germany Economy of Pakistan Arbitrage National Insurance Jehovah's Witnesses Mail Marshall Plan Weimar Republic Social Security debate (United States) Islamic banking Oil-for-Food Programme Law of value Corporate governance Plame affair Explosive material Economy of Romania Economics Tai Chi Chuan
