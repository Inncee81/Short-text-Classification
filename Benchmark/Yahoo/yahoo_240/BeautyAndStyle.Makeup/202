help with picture day hey guys so i have picture day tomorrow except i have one slight problem i broke out badly along my forehead d what are somethings i can do to make the acne less noticable i know this is different and hard to take in but instead of making it worst i suggest you drink plenty of water and sleep early before you sleep tho and after you wash your face i want you to put hot but not too hot water on your face this will open up your pores and take out the gunk oil and waste in your face and do not put anything else on it go right to bed if you cover up you will make it worst believe me you will and it might lead to acne but just listen to me do that and your pimples will be less noticeable the next day Humphrey Bogart Water Sento Mattress Town gas Cleanser Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Rod Stewart Wood Shaggy dog story Roxette Rosacea Avenue Q Equine conformation Social rule Dishwasher Textile manufacturing Thermal power station Hard water Nineteen Eighty-Four Hey Jude Puberty Naval mine Daylight saving time Dairy Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Pebble bed reactor Sin City 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake Hey Arnold!
