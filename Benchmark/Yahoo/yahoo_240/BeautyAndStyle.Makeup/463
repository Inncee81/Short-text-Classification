whats better liquid eyeliner or regular eyeliner i have liquid eyeliner but i wonder if regular eyeliner looks better thanks in advance it all depends upon the look your going for and the time of day night makeup and stuff can be a little more daring however if your going for a more natural look you should consider a pencil liner i actually have a liner that is a cream from clinique it is much easier than liquid but has the staying power of the liquid and the ease of a pencil with the correct application also consider the color you're using black is typical but is more bold than the browns a dark or medium brown is way more natural Cosmetics Cat coat genetics Lead Liquid crystal display Hydrogen economy Gothic fashion Liquid crystal Coal Wu-Tang Clan affiliates Drawing Sewage treatment Death rock fashion Cheetah Color theory Typewriter Wiki Thulium Textile manufacturing Paint Solar power Pencil Magnetic resonance imaging Alum Empire Burlesque Polarization Color Leopard Uranium GED Rubidium Chromatography Brewery Stereoscopy Items in the Metroid series Gas metal arc welding Xenon Floppy disk Chao (Sonic the Hedgehog) Laser Silicon Circuit design Fecal incontinence Traditional animation Monster (album) Bicycle Gasoline Gameplay of StarCraft Electrical resistance Eisner Award Plastic Explosive material Jim Aparo Ice cream Stirling engine R.E.M.
