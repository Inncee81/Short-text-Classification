whats the right kind of makeup i have light skin blue green eyes blonde hair with brown streaks through it and i was wondering what color blush eyeshadow lipgloss and eye liner would look good on me thanks for eyes try soft nudes sands taupes browns and deeper greens gold and creams with shimmer are good too even soft plums and berrys can work for liner stick to something like a deep brown soft grey or deep green or plum black looks too harsh on a fair skinned blonde try pinks and rose or soft peach tones for your cheeks a soft bronzer will give you a warm sun kissed glow pink rose nudes and bronzes for your lips if you go dramatic with eyes keep the lips soft and neutral if you go soft with the eyes you can play up the lips keep blush soft and natural looking to avoid the clown look Cosmetics Hair color Dragon Booster Color James McNeill Whistler Physical attractiveness Fluorescent lamp Cat Fanta Eye color Potato Peach Diamond Blushing Melanin Plum Beret The Rasmus Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water Academy Award for Original Music Score Marilyn Monroe Human skin color Physical characteristics of the Buddha Comanche Death rock fashion Color theory Sunglasses Tofu Acne Pysanka Leopard Nudity Blond Rose Minor Harry Potter Beasts Tattoo Reservoir Dogs Pubic hair Light-emitting diode Garnet Laser hair removal Ultraviolet The Flaming Lips Leaf Mario series enemies Koopa Kid Red hair Hair My Little Pony The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll Rock (music) Massage Snooker Yoshi Vulva Trumpet Drawing The Legend of Zelda series enemies Cat coat genetics Race of Jesus Mango Pyramus and Thisbe Peafowl Meriones unguiculatus Rosacea Titanic (1997 film) Pink Lightsaber Griffon Bruxellois W.I.T.C.H.
