whats powder liner what exactly is it and does it work well with oily skin which powder liner would you suggest to use i have oily eyelids it's almost like an eyeshadow type powder that you apply along the rim of your eye the same as with stick eyeliner with a thin brush i don't like it that much but when i do wear it i get compliments it should work well with your eyelids as it is only for the rim of your eye and not your eyelids it might even be better for you than stick liner get a really cheap powder and try it out if you don't like it you're not out an insane amount of money and you can always get a better product if you like the cheap stuff Cosmetics Snake Bullet Bubblegum Tattoo Dry cleaning Philosopher's stone Face Gas metal arc welding Japanese tea ceremony Internal ballistics Eye Explosive material Welding Krag-J__rgensen Empire Burlesque Bulk vending Cartridge (firearms) Brazing The Legend of Zelda series enemies Handloading Ganguro Magnesium Cleanser Paint Pencil Conjunctivitis Embalming Koopa Kid Plastic Arc welding Gramophone record Leviathan Glaze Tooth Rosacea Onion Death rock fashion Knife Motorcycle helmet Tears Typewriter Tobacco Tea Teen Girl Squad Titanium Blepharitis Myasthenia gravis Ramen Powder metallurgy Aluminium Use of poison gas in World War I Bicycle brake systems Pottery Fluorescent lamp Hand grenade Shotgun shell Sebaceous gland Aqua Teen Hunger Force Korean pottery M60 machine gun Tofu Illegal drug trade Plastic surgery Manual transmission Eyepiece Glacier Eye contact Gong Methamphetamine Bread Bicycle lighting Brewery Professional wrestling slang .303 British Glass harmonica Hamster Sonic Youth Rice Baby bottle Chalazion Diving suit Noonan syndrome Tire M16 (rifle) Clothing Geology of the Moon Eye examination Carbon nanotube Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March M1 Helmet Motorcycle Vulcan (Star Trek) Chemical warfare Dairy Curling Headgear Drill bit
