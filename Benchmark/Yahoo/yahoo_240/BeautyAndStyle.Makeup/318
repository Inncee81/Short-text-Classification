i want to have dewy looking makeup but my skin is oily i really love the glowy dewy look for makeup as opposed to the completely matte look but the problem is my skin is oily and i have to use powder on my face to keep the shine from becoming horrible after only a couple hours doing so makes my face matte which i don't absolutely hate but i just really want the healthy glowy look with my makeup does anyone know a way that i can achieve that look with my skin type you're lucky to have oily skin believe it or not i have oily skin and have been told that it keeps the wrinkles at bay longer i use cover girl trublend mineral powder it has a sheen that makes you look glowy but you're not all greasy feeling those don't give off a lot of color but if you're going for a really natural beachy look you can just use the cover girl mineral powder by itself i usually put a mineral bronzer or a whipped blush on underneath it to give me a little color actually i use whipped or liquid foundation and whipped blush seems bad for oily skin but you don't want to pile on the powder and then everything else is mineral powder to control the oil that might be brought out from the liquid base i put on it doesn't make you all matte looking or cakey and it works better with your skin to bring out the natural beauty that oily skin has it's easier for you to get a dewy look then for someone with dry skin and don't cover your oiliness with powder a lot use those oil blotting papers they don't take off your makeup but they get rid of the oil really well Cosmetics Fecal incontinence Psoriasis Dandruff Little Britain Fire extinguisher Theory of conduct Transformer Potassium Printmaking Titanium Pottery Cantonese cuisine Cleanser Japanese tea ceremony Tofu Tempera Dragon Booster Smoke-screen Hindenburg disaster Eczema Compost Brewery Copper extraction Essential oil Chocolate Frankie Laine Oily fish Sterilization (microbiology) Comanche Rose Use of poison gas in World War I Sulfuric acid Leather Shampoo The Legend of Zelda series enemies K' Real Love (song) W.I.T.C.H.
