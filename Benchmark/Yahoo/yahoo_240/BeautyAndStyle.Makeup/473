what kind of makeup is this i went to the dermatologist a few days ago he told me to use a foundation that is non i can't remember what word came after non lol it was a big word does anyone have any idea about what i am talking about non comedogenic cosmetics non comedogenic cosmetics are skin care products which have been tested on the oily skins of human volunteers or inside rabbit ears these products are less likely to cause blackheads open comedones or whiteheads closed comedones in patients however no single product is non comedogenic for everyone for example a person with very oily skin may still get skin breakouts from products that another person with mildly oily skin may find non comedogenic a better term may be non acnegenic rather than non comedogenic but this is not so widely used it is important to test a new product on your own skin rather than rely on the label before using it freely foundations foundations for acne prone skin are often formulated to be like a shake lotion the color contents settle on the bottom while the opaque or clear solution is on the top the bottle is shaken before the foundation is applied these are the least elegant oil free cosmetics most foundations remain mixed together but are not heavy or thick it is not necessary to have poor coverage in foundations for oily or acne prone skin titanium dioxide is the ingredient which allows for better coverage and that ingredient is not oily varying amounts of starch and kaolin will thicken up the products without causing acne for patients who actually have acne prone skin the addition of salicylic acid may be partially therapeutic for patients who need a blotter for the excess oil in their skin extra amounts of starch kaolin and polymers which absorb sebum may be added Acne Cosmetics Skin Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Sunscreen Psoriasis Beer Tofu Scar Tattoo Androgen insensitivity syndrome Isotretinoin Malignant melanoma Animal testing Polyethylene terephthalate Starch Paint Soap Veganism Rosacea Brewing Dandruff Omega-3 fatty acid Brewery Motor oil Hypoglycemia Carbon dioxide Essential oil Mercury (element) Explosive material E number Moisturizer Sulfuric acid Ultraviolet Olive oil Hydrochloric acid Glass Keloid Tocopherol Corrosion Alcohol fuel Insulin Paracetamol Medical prescription Sebaceous gland Hydrogen peroxide Iron Contact lens Chocolate Embalming Hemp Alcoholic beverage Zinc Food and Drug Administration Homeopathy Soy milk Urinary incontinence Bread Domestic rabbit Eczema Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cleanser Retinol Sunlight Methamphetamine Plastic surgery Baldness treatments Rebreather Manicure Welding Amineptine Sake Staining (biology) Massage Ammonia LSD Smoke-screen Hamster Champagne (beverage) Portland cement Bong General relativity Seismic retrofit Melanin Plastic Vitamin C Polycystic ovary syndrome Urea Food Sugar Fire extinguisher Nutrition Mosquito
