rules for eyeshadow hi i generally know what i'm doing re makeup and i think that i choose colours that work well with my skin tone and age however i do like experimenting with new colours and combinations and have been pleasantly surprised in the past does anyone know of any websites that advise about eyeshadow colours that suit i'm particularly interested in the brighter out there colours how to use them properly i use a few here and there but only subtley i'm interested in rules but not 'old style' ones like blue and green should never be seen i'm also trying to suss out something different for a special night that i'm wearing soft gold but using gold metallic tones for eyeshadow i'm afraid would be to matchy matchy if you know what i mean i'm brown hair hazel eyes yellow skin tones thanks for your help i tend to wear layers of eyeshadow not extremley heavy i would use a shimmery brown on the botton part of the eyelid and combine that with a good dark brown eye liner and on the top part of the eyelid use a shimmery gold colour dont go to crazy or you will end up like a drag queen p usually with gold any soft beige light dark browns and really soft golds work well just experiment with the colours and see what works if you need any more advice you know how to contact me goodluck Cosmetics Eye Color Death rock fashion Skinhead Beret Iris (anatomy) Dragon Booster Diving suit Snooker Color theory Camouflage Bicycle lighting Buckingham Palace Colours, standards and guidons Political colour Order of the Garter Kimono Drawing Human skin color Tincture (heraldry) My Little Pony Horse Eye color Sunglasses Heavy metal music Eye contact Red hair Tofu Violin Mattress Casting Covenant Elite Acne Staining (biology) Gramophone record ABBA Bullet Power Rangers Donovan Dog Primary color Collectibles in Bionicle Hair Tattoo Traffic sign Japanese tea ceremony Christmas tree Lighting Textile manufacturing terminology Arsenal F.C.
