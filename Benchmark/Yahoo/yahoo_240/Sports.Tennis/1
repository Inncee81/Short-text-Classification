second serve american twist serve kick serve hello i play tennis pretty well but my second serve is just not satisfying me i would like to know how to hit an american twist serve or kick serve because i have heard that they are pretty effective second serves thanks people don't need twist serves as second serves but if one practices topspin serves enough they might eventually get a twist serve first know that this probably won't be a comfortable serve to use at first second learn to hit a consistent slice serve first so you understand how to spin a serve well next know this the farther to your dominant side right for righties you throw it the more slice you get the farther to your non dominant side left for righties you throw it the more topspin you get i heard there is supposed to be a magic spot somewhere in there more towards the non dominant side that generates a perfect twist spin every time this is relative to the perfect flat serve toss which can vary from person to person it turned out to be true but it might have just been me hitting multiple serves from the same toss requires wrist manipulation just to clarify that wrist manipulation also affects the direction of the serve since it can change the racket angle without modifying pretty much anything else which is ideal for serving since the opponent can't read your serve from the movement if the toss is the same you shouldn't change the position of your feet or your motion when you intend to serve to a different direction just the wrist and the direction and how you hit through the ball all right now that is clarified time to teach you about kick serves bend your knees and look up generally if you had a line that went straight up from your feet your head would be on the opposite side of the line from the knees whereas most first serves end up with the head on that line this is the position you want to be in after you toss the ball trophy position with the head looking up instead of forward and to the side which will allow you to hit the ball on your non dominant side for the toss normally righties toss for a slice serve at around or o'clock well on their right for a kick serve you toss around o'clock for a topspin or sometimes flat serve o'clock for more topspin and height giving more kick or o'clock which is an extreme some people can hit slices from all of these tosses but they are just either experienced or one of the best servers in the area generally try starting with something around if you are right handed then try if those don't work try remember the more to the non dominant side the more topspin will generally be created now imagine your body is a point on a line parallel to the baseline if you toss behind that line you will be able to get more hight on the ball and will generally be more forced to spin it in making it a little safer to get in since it has a higher margin of error if you toss in front of that you will get one closer to what the pros hit if you can get good kick on it since it allows you to put much more pace on it but the height at which it clears the net is severely reduced pros don't actually have a lot of clearance on their second serve but they are so consistent with it it doesn't matter and because of the spin they can generate the ball will still kick as high if not higher than an amateur tossing behind the line to generate a very high kicker i use the toss in front so even though my second serve clears the net by maybe a foot on rare occasions it can clear it by as much as feet and lands short it kicks over the shoulders and has pace on it making it a more agressive second serve if i warm up my serves this is just as consistent as one with a toss behind that line now for the motion i've read that if you've mastered a slice serve all you do is use a kick serve toss and try to slice it with that toss it is a hard thing to do at first but it does make sense i haven't tried it but it's common knowledge that hitting a kick serve is just like hitting a slice serve if you had your body floating in the air sideways instead of standing upright because you change the direction of the spin by degrees turning slice to topspin if you do this you want to focus on that brushing noise now i admit i do it like that but i have a different mindset i think about brushing straight up on the ball obviously it isn't exactly straight up or else it wouldn't be twisting with as much racket head speed as possible this makes sure i get the ball over the net but the topspin brings it down earlier than a normal serve so it drops down and ends up barely clearing the net if you go to official grand slam sites and look at the point tracker feature to look at second serves you notice the clearance over the net is the exact same as a first serve but it has much more arc on it which is why the clearance is the same you also want to use your legs and reach up for the serve while also brushing up and past the ball or else you will dunk it into the net because you would end up trying to spin it in reducing net clearance you want to swing straight up because the topspin will bring it down into the court and get it to kick higher your first time doing this you don't want to make a lot of contact with the ball brush up on it don't forget to use your wrist to help brush up the ball you also want to let yourself go forward into the court instead of holding your body back behind the baseline because this will make the serve even better and more natural i actually go maybe a foot or inside the court maybe more on all of my serves when i land also make sure you aren't falling backwards if you are you have to move the toss closer to your body i don't think i can hit a kick serve with a toss but i can comfortably hit it with a or toss but some people might be the opposite patrick rafter had a toss very far behind the head and had a great kick serve easily in the top in my opinion also if you keep your body sideways at contact instead of facing the net at contact which is normal for a first serve you generally will be able to create a twist spin if the body opens up it turns into a heavy topspin slice it's still very useful since it still hops high and can be used to go to the forehand side but the regular kicker is better overall since it can be used to go out wide to the backhand which would generate more free points and easy balls if you are generating a lot of topspin but without much twist swing more like a slice while still hitting up on the ball that will generally fix it i don't need to do that though the finish if you did this right will have your racket hand on the dominant side of your body so me being a right hander will have my racket hand finish on the right of my body sometimes the racket as well a good consistent toss is very important you want to find out where the toss works best for you and get the toss there everytime you hit a kick serve also not everybody hits a kick serve with the toss on the left richard gasquet actually has more of a slice serve toss for his kick serve but it changes directions just as well but i don't know how high it kicks but it's probably good or else it would get killed all day long i've hit twist serves off a first serve toss as well but it wasn't very comfortable and my wrist was doing most of the work it was a nice twist with some good kick but i didn't feel like it would suit me or work for me in the long run now some clarification on why i keep refering twist serves and kick serves differently all twist serves are kick serves but not all kick serves are twist serves kick serves refer to topspin serves and twist serves kick serve used to originally only refer to twist serves but they changed it if i had my way on this i would call all topspin serves kick serves and all twist serves would only be called twist serves because every serve has a cool second name except for the topspin serve cannonball serve slider serve kick serve twist serve why should one serve own two of those names and leave the topspin serve out of it and kick serves are effective second serves if you are really confident in them they will be really consistent and visa versa which creates a never ending chain of perfect second serves if you get nervous and let up on a kick serve it will go into the net because you tried to keep it down and away from the service line or long because you didn't put much spin on it the best ways to use this serve obviously other than as a second serve is as a change up to mess with the returner but don't do this too unless your kick serve is that good keep it on the backhand side or the side that can't handle high balls well which is usually the backhand if you can hit a twist then it get's even better because it causes more problems for the returner's backhand and can be sent out wide on the ad court to drag the returner wide of the doubles line and open up the court serving and volleying with kickers works well because it is hard to consistently get a very agressive return unless you are a pro at a very high level assuming the kicker is really good if it isn't then it will be attacked so you can close into the net tighter than normal because the serve is usually slower than first serves and as another bonus most people who aren't at very high levels will send back a floating return waiting to be killed a twist serve can also be used to jam the reciever very nicely when the returner starts guarding his backhand side you now have easy access to more of the service box opening up the forehand side however you still want to keep the amount of kick serves to the forehand to a minimum unless you can get it to slide well like a slice serve without twisting because that loss in pace with a high bounce to the forehand can get killed or hurt you but this depends on the opposing player and how good your kick serve is in terms of kick and pace for me i get a lot of floating returns even on the forehand when some people try to kill my kick serve with a forehand and they get a strong return i can still get to the ball and bring the rally back to my favor but they miss more forehand long than they hit them in and some go into the net the reason is that the height makes it hard to come over the ball and put topspin on it and the pace makes it harder to time the shot and gives them less time to react and the reverse bounce jams their forehand half of the time which is why some returns go into the net regardless be careful about when you send a kick serve to the returner's forehand a great kick serve is the in my opinion the best serve in the game also check this out http www tennis com messageboard forums thread view asp tid posts mid oh yeah and use either a continental grip or an eastern backhand grip or you won't get good results i use a continental grip on all serves but i used to use an eastern backhand on kick serves which i would reccomend you trying to start out with for the kick serve
