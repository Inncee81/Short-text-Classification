graff or henin both good backhands it they played who would win i would bet on steffi graf for more than one reason but because you mentioned here only backhand his is the only shot i'm going to consider for start it's seams to me that graf had a better control on his one handed backhand than hennin has rarely you saw her hitting the ball with the frame and that's happening to hennin almost every game on the other side hennin seams to be more flexible she can easily find very sharp angles and her backhand it's so beautiful at the end let's not forget that hennin has a big weakness her serve she really struggles sometime to keep her serve hennin just didn't reached yet the same level of play graf had but that's just what i think and it comes from somebody who was a big steffi graf fan and now is hennin's fan Squash tennis Badminton Real tennis Racquets (sport) Racquetball Tennis Roger Federer Table tennis HyperText Transfer Protocol Gag (BDSM) Turing machine Twin Peaks Racquet and Tennis Club Seishun Academy Middle School Floppy disk Hard disk Philadelphia Phillies Expanded Universe (Star Wars) Violin Aerial (dance move) Compact audio cassette Serve (tennis) Sampling (music) Menstrual cup Pete Sampras Tire Drill bit Gramophone record Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Bicycle lighting Volleyball Audio tape length and thickness Hamster Mixtape Hey Jude Strap-on dildo Internal ballistics Goofy Shoe Equine conformation Blackadder Knife Skateboarding trick Table saw Plough Mad Money Condom Printed circuit board Billiards Lee "Scratch" Perry Stairway Reel-to-reel audio tape recording Uniform Resource Locator HTML St. Louis Cardinals Humphrey Bogart Copyleft USB flash drive Chopsticks Character encodings in HTML Four square Flag of India Mario Diving suit Duct tape I Want to Hold Your Hand Dai shogi Opera (web browser) Sears Catalog Home Stick__ Toad (Nintendo) Shaggy dog story Bong Skateboard Chair E-Reader Pop Will Eat Itself China at the 2004 Summer Olympics Knots Landing Control character Drag racing Reservoir Dogs Cliff Richard Vegeta Tennis shots Bulk vending Inkjet printer Textile manufacturing Slazenger Charles Goodyear Grip (tennis) Seabiscuit The Ashlee Simpson Show Handloading Boston Red Sox Enterprise content management Marilyn Monroe Time Out of Mind
