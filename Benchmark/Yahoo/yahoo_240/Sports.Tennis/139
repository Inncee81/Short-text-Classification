how do points work in the atp how do points work i was watching the rogers cup and the announcers were talking about richard gasquet doing so well last year finals and lost to roger federer and this year he got eliminated in the second round and the announcers were saying this was going to affect the points he got from last years rogers cup or did i misunderstand you heard correctly the scoring in the atp works based on calculating for each player his total points from the 'mandatory' events the four grand slams and the nine atp masters series tournaments and his best five results from all eligible international series tournaments from the past weeks since the rankings are recalculated after each event in the year if a player did really well in a tournament the year before and if he doesn't do as well the next year he loses the points that he won from the previous year this therefore means many of players have to play in the same tournaments that they did well in in order to defend the points they received the year before Justine Henin-Hardenne Andre Agassi Kim Clijsters Roger Federer Bj__rn Borg Elena Dementieva Martina Hingis Gustavo Kuerten Tennis Boris Becker Pete Sampras Steffi Graf John McEnroe Heir Apparent Lleyton Hewitt Hollyoaks Women's Tennis Association Tennis at the 2004 Summer Olympics Ai Sugiyama Association of Tennis Professionals Jennifer Capriati Characters from Arrested Development Am__lie Mauresmo Martina Navratilova Monica Seles Volleyball Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh Carlos Moy__ Ivan Lendl Lottie Dod EastEnders Badminton Texas Longhorn Athletics French Open 24 Hours of Le Mans Virginia Ruano Pascual Jimmy Connors Paul Is Dead Marie Antoinette Friends Michael Schumacher Kodocha Chris Evert Juan Carlos Ferrero Venus Williams Knots Landing Suzanne Lenglen Arantxa S__nchez Vicario Billie Jean King Family Janet Jackson Ravi Shastri Big Brother (USA TV series) Joke Lindsay Davenport University of Texas at Austin Tiger Woods The Open Championship Malcolm in the Middle Family name Diana, Princess of Wales R.S.C.
