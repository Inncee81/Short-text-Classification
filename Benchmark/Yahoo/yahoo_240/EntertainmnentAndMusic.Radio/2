pros and cons of xm satelite radio there are several pros and cons of owning xm satellite radio pros you have more access to more music and other radio channels than with regular am fm stations there are more channels dedicated to various genres of music such as rock and roll classical jazz r b hip hop rap country easy listening etc there are several talk channels including a handful of comedy channels that play various comedians and various forms of comedy you will be able to listen to xm radio anywhere you have a clear shot of the southern sky since that is where the satellite is located this means if you are taking a road trip to your relatives in another state or on the other side of the state where you cannot pick up your favorite am fm station it's xm to the rescue the only downside to this is if you have a lot of trees in the area that can mess things up a bit you can buy equipment that allow you to take your receiver from the house to your car to your office and vice versa you can listen to the same stations both on your radio receiver and online at xmradio com most songs on xm radio stations are unedited so not only might you hear vulgarity if it's in the song but you might hear a lyric or two that was cut out in order to allow for radio play on am fm less commercials some stations might play a few minutes' worth of commercials now and then but for the most part there are none most music stations play no commercials except maybe a to second station id bumper and that's it most commercials are reserved for the talk stations no djs sure it's nice to have someone you can call and request a song to but djs require money which require adspace to be sold in order to keep costs to subscribers down why do you think am fm stations play what seems like minutes of commercials within an hour if a group of songs on a single album are meant to be played together unlike most radio stations xm may play those two or three songs together for example the beatles' songs sgt pepper's lonely hearts club band and a little help from my friends are meant to be played together some radio stations on fm or am play these two songs together but some do not xm always does am fm radio station djs don't always tell you the name of the artist or song they just played they may tell you to go to our website and click on 'last songs played' to find the songs you heard and don't know the name to xm radio receivers all have a display that will display the name of the artist and the song speaking of displays the display on the receiver can be changed to your preferences some have different backlight colors to choose from and how the display will read i have mine set to show only the artist and song title if you are into the stock market you can even set it to display a stock ticker with whichever symbols you want cons price the equipment at the moment is fairly expensive it won't cost thousands or hundreds of dollars unless you buy any accessories such as adapters or installation kits so you can listen to xm on your home theater system in your car or in the office there is a boombox style player you can buy for the roadyxt and another model that allows you to listen to it in the office or elsewhere subscription fees are fairly high it's around or so per quarter or a month satellite receiver you must have a clear view of the southern sky if you have xm in your vehicle you may experience some blackouts or signal loss especially when driving under an overpass or in a tunnel more modern cars all come with am fm xm or sirius receivers i've never messed with these but i believe they may get a stronger signal one good thing i can say about xm is that the signal for them is stronger than satellite tv so even during a heavy thunderstorm you have a better chance at receiving xm radio than you would receiving directtv or dish network satellite tv setup it takes a while to set up your satellite receiver you have to call an number to activate your receiver and of course set up a subscription service once you have activated you should begin receiving stations you will be instructed once you have received three specific stations your service is in full installation in car the best way xm recommends installing the receiver in your car is via the tape deck if you do not have a tape deck you can set the built in fm modulator on the receiver the biggest downside to this is if you live in a rural area in one spot you might not receive a signal on a certain fm setting that you know receives no signals but in another spot you might from some local or far away station you can buy an fm modulator for about that will have to be professionally installed using the fm modulator produces a poor signal so you are more prone to static or blackouts merger there have been talks and it is confirmed that xm and sirius will merge later this year they have said it will not affect your receivers but it may affect pricing and it may affect what stations you will receive if you listened to an xm station before and after the merger the station is no longer there you will have to find another station similar to it
