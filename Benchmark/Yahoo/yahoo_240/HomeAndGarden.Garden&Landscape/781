good fertilizer for red apple ice plant im having a hard time keeping my red apple ice plant happy it looks dead what can i do to keep it green and healthy its old its gets min of h o every other day it gets lots of sun i think the problem may be too much water ice plants have succulent foliage which means they store a lot of water in the leaves they definitely do not need as much water as you're giving them i'd only water them once a week at the most and only if it doesn't rain that week if you want to fertilize still i'd recommend organic fertilizer you could mulch it and your whole bed or garden with compost or composted cow manure compost is sometimes available from the city if you don't want to do that for whatever reason slow release fertilizers are usually good just don't add too much especially since i really don't think this is a problem with fertilization also if you do decide to fertilize it don't do it while the plant still looks stressed from too much water wait until it starts perking up again first Compost Vermicompost Houseplant Comfrey Earthworm Fertilizer Biodynamic agriculture Dairy Weed control Organic gardening Manure Leaf Tea Garden Strawberry Permaculture Bonsai Irrigation Physiological plant disorders Organic farming Sewage treatment Humus Organic horticulture Composting toilet Gardening Coffee Apple Carbon dioxide Moss RuneScape quests Perk__nas Friends Hemp Green manure Gypsy moth No-dig gardening Livestock Soil Flowering plant Carnivorous plant Pine Good King Henry Gooseberry The Beatles discography Autonomous building Pysanka Peach Renewable energy Tobacco Guinea pig Hamster Eutrophication Water Waste management Social rule Dietary fiber Soil life Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Christmas tree Erosion Theory of conduct Pachypodium Donovan Natural gas Discus (fish) Maize Nutrient Organic food The Ashlee Simpson Show Extreme Programming Agriculture Pitaten Fish farming Spearmint Phoebe Buffay's songs Chernobyl accident Tillandsia Olive Drag racing Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Elis Prefecture Urinary incontinence Masanobu Fukuoka Veganism Unreal Morphology of Pachypodium Thermal power station Lake Oat Eucalyptus Tomato Potato Weed Survivor (novel) STS-59 Algae Dead Sea Environmental concerns with electricity generation Watermelon
