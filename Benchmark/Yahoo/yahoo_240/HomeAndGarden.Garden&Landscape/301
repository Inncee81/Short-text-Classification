what flower plant should i use i am going to dig all down both sides of my path about a foot wide and want to put some nice smelling but not to powerful plants in it so it looks nice what should i use i have no preference for colour or anything but a strong plant flower would be good as it gets very windy in my garden i dont want to put in a trellis so climbing plants are out i would plant the miniature variety of lavender but avoid rosemary because it becomes very leggy after a while and will grow across the path thyme is also a good low growing herb which will smell lovely every time your foot brushes against it another one to try is feverfew it has lovely lime green leaves and pretty white daisy flowers and smells quite sweet too if you don't like any of my suggestions ask at your local garden centre their advice can be invaluable Flower Sage Flowering plant Essential oil Perfume Rose Pansy Comfrey Cannabis cultivation Honey Rosemary Chrysanthemum Hamster Cauliflower Japanese tea ceremony Potato Lavender Plant Chatsworth House Hemp Hop (plant) Mango Cuisine of Denmark Pachypodium ambongense Yarrow Garden Strawberry Basil Soil pH Coffea arabica Iris (plant) Vanilla Hydrangea Shrub Tobacco Maize Apple Roxette Bamboo Anemone Coriander Herbal tea Garden Thyme Gooseberry Orchidaceae Mint Peach Banana Clover Monofloral honey Nepeta Coca Pachypodium bicolor Lime (fruit) Tofu Sweet potato Tea Elm Citrus Watermelon RuneScape quests Mugwort Cannabis Lawn Wine Red Valerian The Lovely Bones Stinging nettle Garlic Pea Violet (plant) Fennel Ant Coffee Elderberry Sea-lavender Tomato Weed control Eucalyptus Brooklyn Botanic Garden Pachypodium baronii Loganberry Beetle Cuisine of Laos Conium Ragwort Tillandsia The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy The Pet Sounds Sessions Food Plantain Pottery The Jam Date cultivation in Dar al-Manasir Plum Cucumber Carnivorous plant Begonia Christmas tree Capsicum
