question about radishes so i bought a seed packet of radishes and planted them to the recommendations on the package i watered them and weeded them but i kind of forgot they're supposed to be radishes now there are these long plants stalks growing with little white flowers on top the radishes i buy at the store have shorts green leaves i pulled one today to see if it looked like a radish and it didn't the root area was radish colored but it looked just like a root not a radish i'm a first time gardener and the basil i planted came out okay so i don't think it's something i did but i don't know i didn't fertilize them because i was afraid of accidentally poisioning myself again first time gardener if anyone has any input i would greatly appreciate it radishes need loose soil to develop out also they may be seeding out because it is too hot now to plant this is called bolting radishes do not like to be crowded and will not bulb properly if overcrowded by other radishes or weeds weeding is also important to proper bulb growth most growers don't give much thought to weeding because of their quick growth but it is important for proper bulb growth this was copied and pasted from this link Weed control Hemp Houseplant Weed Cannabis cultivation Flowering plant Seed Onion Sugar beet Hippeastrum Tobacco Turnip (brassica rapa) Garlic Fruit Plant Bonsai Green Revolution Jute Organic farming Orchidaceae Garden Strawberry Peanut Herbicide Hydroponics Alfalfa Loganberry Flower Quinoa Tulip Christmas tree Iris (plant) Organic food Cannabis (drug) Leaf Auxin Organic gardening Textile manufacturing Tree Agricultural machinery Fruit tree propagation Root Coriander Deforestation Comfrey Absinth Wormwood Flax Banana Broccoli Potato Pansy Botany Ginkgo Xeriscaping Black pepper Plant stem Kudzu Fertilizer Vegeta Fish farming Bamboo Moss Compost Dandelion Banksia Creeping Charlie Burdock Pachypodium Basil Pollination Soil pH Pruning fruit trees Irrigation Peach Pumpkin Rumex Root vegetable Apple Norman Borlaug Acorn Ragwort Gooseberry Biodynamic agriculture Lawn Tiberium Pachypodium ambongense Olive Fennel Economics Wisteria Nutrient Purple loosestrife Coffee Lighting
