how do they make seedless fruits iv allways wanted to know how they do it plants have the ability to cross fertilize and produce sterile offspring just as mammals do think mules since fruit is the product of the flowers reproductive center it grows around the seed after pollination however if no mature seed develops from the fertilized egg it is considered seedless many times immature seeds are present but easily ignored like the black specks in bananas or the soft shriveled white things in watermelon to grow more plants you have to use the same parents or vegetatively clone the seedless cultivar seedless crosses occur naturally but would dead end for lack of the next generation except humans have been used by the plants to provide support in creating subsequent generations this is a nice case of symbiosis we get to eat seedless fruit but the plant continues and spreads seedless watermelons have been with us since they occur because of something only plants can do plants can go from diploid to tetraploid two set of genes to four sets this has occurred spontaneously throughout history but can be induced in the lab now if you cross a diploid with a tetraploid you get a mule in the same way a jack donkey covering a mare produces a mule the chromosomal pairs cannot align properly during meiosis but the normal sequence is unimpaired for mitosis so the mule or the triploid plant can grow normally it just cannot produce the next generation since the triploid plants can t produce the gametes for the next generation themselves they are pollinated by diploid father plants the act of pollination triggers the fruit to grow without a fertile egg present in the scottish immigrant william thompson developed the seedless grape we still call the thompson grape it had come to be by some natural process it was a mutant diploid seedless grape growing wild it was discovered and propagated by humans by grafting cuts onto other rootstocks thompson continued grafting until he developed the line that we still use the same is true of seedless oranges they are also all graft descendants from one wild seedless plant so all seedless plants are dependant on humans for propagation by alternated means Reproduction Colchicine Apple Cell growth Species Alternation of generations Flowering plant Banana Sexual reproduction Chromosome Gamete Mitosis Cell (biology) Hybrid Plant Chlorophyta Grafting Strawberry Agriculture Grape Date Palm Rambutan Barbara McClintock Gene Wheat Plant breeding Cannabis sativa Peanut Fertilisation Vegetative reproduction Chimera (genetics) Sex Cloning Genetic engineering Orange (fruit) Kiwifruit Olive Fruit tree pollination Potato Y chromosome Cucumber Lac operon Ovum Biological dispersal Cannabis cultivation Orchidaceae Cancer Malus Seed Donkey Pollination management Dominance relationship Honeybee Illegal drug trade Ginkgo Eukaryote Weed control Pumpkin Banksia Pollen Moss Alfalfa Hamster Human cloning Fern Botany Ovulation Carnivorous plant Apricot F1 hybrid Animal Fig Aphid Cellular differentiation Black pepper Chicken Intersexuality Loganberry Raisin Tomato Comfrey Sunflower Created kind Vanilla
