question about pruning rose bushes i have just bought a few rose bushes and was wondering how to prune them they have some dead flowers on them and the stem were the dried up flowers are has turned brown dead i guess too do i just cut right under the brown part i not real sure how and where to cut at any help would be great that for your time and information i really don't know alot about roses but i think they are so pretty and i wanted to at their beauty to my gardens so i would love any info on how to keep the beautiful and to continue to bloom thank you don't do any real pruning this time of year just snip off the dead stuff and plant the bushes you do need to cut into the green portion slightly since they are new you probably won't need to prune them for the first year remove dead flowers when they fade while the plant is blooming this will keep the plant from setting seed and triggering the plant to quit blooming after they have bloomed next spring summer then you will want to prune them properly cut away any dead material also remove any stems branches that point inward into the body of the bush rather than outward be sure to use a systemic fungicide on your roses as well as bone meal if your soil needs it the best people to talk to are those at a local nursery they will know about the needs of roses in your area of the country enjoy Pruning fruit trees Flower Bonsai Tobacco Wisteria Apple Bamboo Pansy Leaf Cannabis cultivation Flowering plant Orchidaceae Olive Grafting Plum Peanut Guns N' Roses Hemp Pachypodium brevicaule U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Weed control Sunflower Stratification (botany) Wood Loganberry Banana Pasadena, California Kudzu Fruit tree propagation Hellebore Bladderwort Pachypodium ambongense Fecal incontinence Jute Little Shop of Horrors Alfalfa Pachypodium bicolor Tournament of Roses Parade Japanese tea ceremony Garden Strawberry Hydrangea Ragweed Textile manufacturing Paul Is Dead Absinth Wormwood Pachypodium baronii Flax Hippeastrum Bon Jovi Shrub Pea Horse Coffea Banksia Nuggets: Original Artyfacts from the First Psychedelic Era, 1965-1968 Garden Biological pest control Perfume The Amber Spyglass Pine Stem cell Biodynamic agriculture Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Apical dominance Elis Prefecture Timeline of alternative rock Potato Lawn Cuscuta Morning glory Black pepper The Ashlee Simpson Show Wars of the Roses Marilyn Monroe Eucalyptus Lilac Watermelon Joker (comics) Sin City Donna Summer Coffea arabica Jeb Bush Hop (plant) Rooibos Rosemary The Tale of Genji Desert Luther Burbank Gorse 613 mitzvot Allan Bloom
