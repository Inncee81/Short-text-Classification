is brazillian pine supposed to be used for fencing my fence around my new house is already falling apart my house is months old the builder used brazilian pine to build the fence i had it stained immediately after moving in but the boards are still warping and pulling loose is there a resource that discusses uses for brazilian pine is fencing a good use for this wood looks to me like it isn't and i cannot get the builder to replace it i can't imagine why anyone would use pine for outside construction for anything brazilian pine is mostly used for inside things like cabinets and furniture it is not a hard wood but handy in construction because it's light stains well and holds nails and screws well but you don't often see people building pine fencing i bet even that builder wouldn't use it for his own house my guess is that perhaps it's cheaper than hard wood and or it was leftover from another project i can't imagine the thinking behind using it for a fence besides cost savings unsealed wood will not last long if you get nowhere with replacing you might buy some time by making a few small repairs and then sealing the whole thing it won't make it good but will definitely turn into compost slower than if it's unsealed Upholstery Poker jargon Wood Violin Woodworking Autonomous building Drill bit Tire Construction Humphrey Bogart Happy Tree Friends Rail tracks Mattress Table saw Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown) Bong Equine conformation Wood carving Screw Jean-Luc Picard Theory of conduct The nature of God in Western theology Barbed wire Pennsylvania Railroad Boat building Milton H.
