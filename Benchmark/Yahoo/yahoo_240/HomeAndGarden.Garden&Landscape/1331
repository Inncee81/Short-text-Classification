how would i go about getting a koi pond built in my yard and what would the cost be ok first you need to think of what yoyu want if there are predators in the area you should make a deep pond and line it yourself if there's nothing that will eat the fish you can by one of those pre made plastic tubs you need a hole dug duh you could dig it yourself or have someone come to dig it if you choose the self liner way you can get some decorative flat rocks to hide the top of the liner then you can fill the pond with water yourself or have a water truck come and deliver it then if there's chlorine in the water you need to do some water prep with pre bought kits then you should get a water lily lily pad plant all water plants put oxygen into the water which helps for a healthy ecosystem don't forget you need a pump with a built in filter for good cleaning depending on the size of your pond sometimes more and a net fish prices vary you can get aaa koi about for each full grown or for each tiny baby aa cheaper a cheaper yet and then pond quality which is about for each baby koi then there's gold fish my favourite are the comets that's what i have the babies are only a little more that each the middle size are about then the which are each don't forget all the babies will grow to be the size of the large ones it just takes a few years each summer they'll grow a few more inches you need fish food pretty cheap when bought bulk and you don't feed the fishin the winter if you live somewhere that gets cold Koi Dairy Aquarium Fish farming Sea-Monkey Shrimp farm Sewage treatment Water garden Plastic Ecology E85 Solar power Hamster Solar cell Frog Hydrogen economy Fossil fuel power plant Water purification Textile manufacturing Ice cream Dam Petroleum Irrigation Alcohol fuel Chinook salmon Tilapia Carburetor Bong Mattress Customs and etiquette of Japan Antarctic krill Ozone depletion Humphrey Bogart Tofu Animal Crossing Energy development Wood Hydroponics Water (molecule) Hemp Illegal drug trade Japanese tea ceremony Drill bit Ozone hole Thermal power station Marine aquarium Floppy disk Potato Swimming pool United States Postal Service Glossary of firefighting equipment Bulk vending Aquaculture Chatsworth House Violin Smelt Rathfarnham Opportunity rover Lake Organic farming Air conditioning Coconut crab Filling station Marine biology Fountain Diesel engine Digital photography Water Shark Ernest Harmon Air Force Base Krill Tire Environmental concerns with electricity generation Milk Gray Wolf Poker jargon Cuisine of Denmark Gasoline Leather Gardening Economy of the United States Tooth Polychlorinated biphenyl Renewable energy Angling Salmon Drainage Corrosion Murray River Scale model Cannabis cultivation Dundas Square Wetland
