raised bed herb garden plant spacing how close together can i plant herbs in a raised bed i know one of the advantages to a raised bed garden is that things can be grown closer together but i don't know how much closer i want to grow things like sage parsley oregano marjoram basil rosemary etc much of it would depend on the size of your raised bed and whether you're growing herbs for culinary use or as ornamentals from the herbs you listed i would allow the most space for the sage plant sage is a relatively slow growing woody perenniel shrub so the first year you can plant annual herbs quite close to it after a few seasons it will require more room my sage came in a pitiful pot but over the next years it's grown to over feet wide if you harvest the leaves and give it an ocassional trim it will probably stay smaller for your space rosemary also likes a bit of room maybe or more if it's perenniel in your zone i'm in zone so my rosemary only lasts the one season and i usually just crowd it in with the annual herbs oregano and marjoram would be happy near the edge of the raised bed since they both like to spill over into adjacent territories and you would be saving space by allowing them to cascade over the edge of the bed this also keep the marjoram leaves cleaner with fewer mud splatters to rinse off common basil would probably tolerate a spacing try harvesting the new growth shoots often to encourage more branching parsley can be tucked away into just about any space that's left since it's bienniel the best leaf growth will be the first year the second year it just goes to seed i you have any room left try a few other short season herbs such as dill or coriander cilantro these are both easy to start from seed and can be used to fill in the spaces until your other plants mature Coriander Oregano Plant Sage Comfrey Weed control Rosemary Essential oil Wood Pine Hemp Bamboo Bonsai Flowering plant Fish farming Brewery Peanut Cannabis cultivation The Herbs Kudzu Irrigation Sugar beet Parsley Tobacco Basil Carnivorous plant Polish cuisine Deforestation Perfume Gooseberry Tomato Banksia Garden Japanese tea ceremony Orchidaceae Fruit tree propagation Dill Cuisine of Denmark Tea Equine conformation Acorn Yerba mate Italian cuisine Pachypodium Hydroponics Cuisine of Laos Coast Douglas-fir Ginkgo Vinegar Ragwort Chatsworth House Apple Pea Shrub Vermicompost Pinophyta Fast bowling Broom (shrub) Tansy Kitchen German cuisine Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Toxicodendron Hop (plant) Olive Conifer cones Turnip (brassica rapa) Pachypodium ambongense Nepeta Coffea arabica Tree Seed Sailing Zoning Potato Leaf Araucaria araucana Wound healing phases Eucalyptus Fennel Gypsy moth Herbicide European Beech Alfalfa Black pepper Houseplant Mattress Peruvian cuisine Absinth Wormwood
