soil improvers just moved into very neglected garden have been weeding and digging over the beds but soil is very clumpy what should i use to improve for the next seasons plantint clumpy can be good or bad depending on what is holding the clump together loam has humus that holds the soil in aggregates but clay can also cause lumps you can do a visual soil survey by digging a small hole first look at the hole and take some soil in hand check your soil's texture by picking up a handful and squeeze gently if it feels sticky and stays in a tight mass your soil is likely too high in clay if it feels harsh or gritty and won't hold any shape or crumbles it is likely too high in sand if it feels silky smooth or floury and won't hold any shape it's likely too high in silt if it molds into your hand yet crumbles apart when squeezed it has the perfect texture it is loam if it formed a sticky ball try to squeeze it upward to form a ribbon measure the length of the ribbon now wet the soil in your palm til muddy rub the soil against your palm with your other fingertips is it smooth gritty or both gritty ribbon is sandy loam smooth ribbon is silty loam both is loam gritty ribbon is sandy clay loam smooth ribbon is silty clay loam both is clay loam gt gritty ribbon is sandy clay gt smooth ribbon is silty clay gt both is clay black color indicates high organic matter gray indicates medium organic matter red tan or blue color indicates little organic matter and high clay blue color indicates that there is no oxygen in the clay therefore no roots will grow in blue clay normally the organic matter is mainly in the topsoil forest soils have a one to four inch thick layer of dark organic matter on top of mineral soil a general recommendation is add as much composted rotted organic material as you can afford it is almost impossible to add too much organics should make up of your soil the rest being minerals air and water organics include anything that is well rotted manure yard waste wood chips or mixed compost the only time you do not add more organics is if you live in peat rich or boggy areas peaty soil already has as much as organic material next you need to determine your nitrogen phosphorus potassium concentrations with the soil's ph these come from a soil test if you send a soil sample to a local extension agent they will test it for nutrients and ph or you can buy a kit just use distilled water not tap water or you will be testing the water's contents not the soil's the results will tell you exactly what you need to add to bring your soil to optimum fertility with no wasted money amendments are best applied by evenly covering the surface of the area till in as deeply as possible this once future amendments can be applied by topdressing Pottery Houseplant Comfrey Drainage Anchor Wood Carnivorous plant Earthworm Casting Bonsai Organic gardening Hydroponics Biodynamic agriculture Peat Desert Garden Strawberry Hemp Humus Organic farming Explosive material Mattress Soils retrogression and degradation Sugar beet Caliche Brewery Bong Leaf Concrete Flax Leather Drill bit Architecture of the California missions Organic horticulture Solar cell Strap-on dildo Soil life Dune Ecology Hamster Lake Upholstery Agriculture Irrigation Mulch Geology of the Moon Glass Seismic retrofit Textile manufacturing Eutrophication Poker jargon Knife Plastic Balikpapan Tobacco Iron Waste management Portland cement No-dig gardening Tillage Erosion Deforestation Diamond Manure Pachypodium habitats Carbon dioxide Geology of the Grand Canyon area Drawing Coffee Golf Glacier Fire extinguisher Geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area Green Revolution Campfire Hardpan Soap Pansy Carbon dioxide sink Carburetor Sedimentary rock Stucco Avalanche Tire Chlorophyta Mouse (computing) Global warming and agriculture Sorghum Sand
