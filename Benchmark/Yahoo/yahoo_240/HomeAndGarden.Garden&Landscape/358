how can i create an escape ramp for animals that fall into a nearby disused swimming pool i live in the country and on some property nearby there is a disused swimming pool that is filled with dead animals that fall in and drown the owner refuses to cover it or fill it in and won't put up a fence either he will allow me to put somthing in that will help them get out but i am completely at a loss for how to build something that will work for creatures as small as frogs and large as deer i can't tell how deep the water is as it's all disgustingly gooey with dead things any ideas gratefully appreciated as i am worried sick about pets and children in the area and yes i have already notified every authority and there is no one who can force him to fix the problem wow that's nasty i would keep pressing the issue with officials i would also see if the local news would publish the problem do you get along with the neighbor where do you live for small animals you can simply throw a decent sized rope across the pool tie it securely on each side but let it lay on top of the water small animals can climb the rope for larger animals you could get a sheet of plywood take small planks of wood like inch by inch about feet long and nail them in a ladder formation onto the plywood then i just would slide the plywood into the pool at about a degree angle you would have to brace it so that it doesn't slide in completely and disappear forever you could nail it to a pole you sink in the ground but really don't become part of the problem if a child falls in you might be liable because you attempted to make adjustments to the pool you need to go to your mayor your fire department your health and safety department whatever the local news could embarrass your officials enough to do something Seismic retrofit Drill bit Mattress Sailing Equine conformation Professional wrestling aerial techniques View camera Swimming pool Stairway Glossary of climbing terms Glossary of nautical terms Diving Campfire Wood Sento Aerial (dance move) Rigging Glossary of firefighting equipment Professional wrestling holds Breaststroke Softball Blood (computer game) Hamster Drowning Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Poker jargon Dog agility Skateboarding trick Swimming Cranford, New Jersey Billiards Education in the United States Sail-plan Textile manufacturing Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Comanche Pikmin Shaggy dog story Long Path RuneScape quests Tag Mountaineering Boat building Heinkel He 112 Trapping Glacier Nine Inch Nails Floppy disk GunZ The Duel Climbing Fountain Table saw Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Wrigley Field Eddie Guerrero Happy Tree Friends Personal flotation device Narnia Barbed wire Roof Geodesic dome Firefighter Violin Baseball Kurt Angle SS Andrea Doria Dog Canal lock Yosemite National Park Landmarks of Hoboken, New Jersey Royal Marines Terminal ballistics Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Mixed martial arts Skateboarding Light pollution Gramophone record Conker's Bad Fur Day Battles of Lexington and Concord Niagara Falls Paragliding Backstroke Medical prescription Second Battle of the Atlantic Knife Slide Mountain (New York) Climbing equipment Slide rule USS Trigger (SS-237) Worms weapons and tools Night (book)
