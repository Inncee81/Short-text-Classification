how long do raspberry blooms take to open i read on a few sites that raspberries don't produce until their second year as i had some small stalks from last year that produced berries by the beginning of july and not even a flower on my new stalks this year i was resigned to wait till next year for berries however in the last two weeks my new tall stalks from this year have developed a ton of little buds they look ready to open but they've been there for over a week and haven't opened will i get some berries this year yes it looks like it just be patient they'll open in a few days or so and then the bees will pollinate them they'll grow for awhile and after that they will ripen in a few days more be ready to pick them when they ripen the birds are waiting too Fruit Rambutan Pollination Flower Coffea arabica Orchidaceae Garden Strawberry Sunflower Apple Capercaillie Alder Berry Apricot Rowan Tobacco Tomato Avocado Sugarcane Pinophyta Date Palm Blackberry Durian Raspberry Dewberry Pollen Vanilla Berberis Hemp Pollinator decline Bee Conifer cones Black pepper Pachypodium brevicaule Auxin Almond Pruning fruit trees Alfalfa Titan arum Partridge Berry Peanut Fig Ivy Honey Diseases of the honeybee Insect Pachypodium bicolor Mango Thimbleberry Prunus Elderberry Cloudberry Vanilla (orchid) Cucumber Pachypodium baronii Anemone Fruit tree pollination Textile manufacturing Blueberry Pawpaw Snowdrop Holly R.E.M.
