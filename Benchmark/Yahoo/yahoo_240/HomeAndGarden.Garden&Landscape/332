does diazinon have an expiration period i have a bottle of diazinon that is a few years old and am wondering if it is still effective i need to spray my lawn as it is being chewed up from underneath is there a better solution to use than diazinon as far as the chemical goes it is probably still effective but for your information diazinon has not been sold for residential use since it was taken off the market for non commercial applications because of its multiple negative effects if i was you i would get something else to use since your bottle is more then three years old and probably illegal for you to use you can get something a little safer for your yard especially if you have kids or pets Diazinon Plastic Insecticide Water Hydrogen peroxide Bottled water Nuclear magnetic resonance Cocaine Irrigation Waste management Hydrochloric acid Domestic rabbit Hamster Intravenous therapy Milk Acetic acid Arguments for and against drug prohibition Trademark Pepper spray Pet skunk Patent medicine Prohibition Monsanto Dundas Square Gypsy moth Paracetamol Cyanide Sport utility vehicle Methamphetamine Scotch whisky Mercury (element) Breastfeeding Alcoholic beverage Solar cell Organic farming Medical prescription Cannabis (drug) Bond Chloroform Intellectual property Moe Szyslak Cigarette Convention on Psychotropic Substances Lumber Pharmaceutical company Wayne Corporation Bicycle helmet RISC Tobacco smoking Fuel injection Digital rights management Oplan Bojinka Public domain Incandescent light bulb Silver Organic food Polyethylene terephthalate Paint Bicycle lighting Fire extinguisher Redundant array of independent disks Advertising Siphon Digital photography Riot control agent Bong New Coke Illegal drug trade Nestl__ Fireworks Agriculture Topps White phosphorus incendiary Resident Evil Outbreak Coca eradication Chewing gum Texas Instruments Nickel-cadmium battery Dumpster diving Chemical warfare Solar power Fire fighting Harm reduction Recycling Water purification Photography Goat Dollar store Sewage treatment Carbon nanotube Federal assault weapons ban Urbanization Hydroponics Tooth enamel Service economy Wine bottle Instant coffee Psilocybin
