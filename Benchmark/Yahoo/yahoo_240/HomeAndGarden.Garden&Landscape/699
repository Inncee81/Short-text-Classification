anyone know how to keep nut grass down i have lots and lots of nutgrass i pull and also spray with a product called image i use roundup too mostly i pull the nutgrass up and discard its only in my flowerbeds or if its in the lawn the mower takes care of it it was either in soil that we brought or in flowers i moved from other areas in researching the web other countries will levy fines on people or companies that spread this stuff and i can understand why if i give away a plant i clean the roots until i know no nuts are hitching a ride to some other poor souls yard nut grass or purple nutsedge cyperus rotundus is very difficult to control once established with this weed you need to have a zero tolerance and control when young control via digging is difficult because of very aggressive rhizomes metolachlor pennant is an effective preemergence control for nutsedge image is a postemergence for the control of purple nutsedge halosulfuron manage sedge hammer is a postemergence control for both yellow purple nutsedge plan on at least two split applications if attempting to control established plants with the above postemergence products roundup can work but it will require several applications and works best when plants are young and not yet flowering d with multiple applications can control nutsedge in turf if applied at the appropriate time most systemics work best in late summer or early fall when weeds are actively growing and directing the storage of manufactured sugars to roots rhizomes corms bulbs tubers nutlets etc unfortunately nutsedge is next to impossible to control with a postemergence systemic once their tubers form in july august also do not try to control nutsedge with a systemic postemergence in early spring because the plant s focus is on supplying nutrients to top growth and you have insufficient leaf surface to deliver a knockout blow typical postemergence applications should be made weeks after emergence but before tubers develop tubers develop quickly in july august in illinois and therefore late june would be the best time for postemergence applications here is good link that discusses the application of basagran image and halosulfuron for the control of nutsedge in ornamental beds http pubs caes uga edu caespubs pubcd c htm pulling or cutting the tops off established nutsedge when there are to leaves and doing this repeatedly will eventually deplete the established nutsedge tubers of their energy to reproduce new plants so your best control procedure would be the use of a preemergence to prevent nutsedge if you miss this opportunity apply split postemergence applications in june and repeatedly pull the tops off any established nutsedge that survives your postemergence applications nutsedges nut grass like full sun if you can reconfigure your garden to shade the areas with nut grass you can keep this very aggressive plant down Weed control Herbicide Carnivorous plant Agriculture Orchidaceae Comfrey Bamboo Irrigation Kudzu Root Potato Organic farming Pesticide Hemp Weed Diseases of the honeybee Sugar beet Brewery European Beech Wetland Solar power Sweet potato Gypsy moth Tobacco Perfume Lawn mower Illegal drug trade Desertification Auxin Xeriscaping Genetically modified food Konica Minolta Poker jargon Flax Flowering plant Hamster Leaf Root vegetable Fruit tree propagation Yosemite National Park Peanut Cyperus esculentus Fast bowling Garlic Agriculture in Australia Cannabis cultivation Breastfeeding Computer Houseplant Hydroponics Tick Dune Vegetative reproduction Deforestation Compost Equine conformation Casting Japanese tea ceremony Green Revolution Plant stem Fen Christmas tree Cell (biology) Screw Sugarcane Textile manufacturing Pollinator decline Lighting Broom (shrub) Drill bit Fish farming Iron Olduwan RISC Golf Cyperus papyrus Opportunity rover Photosynthesis Pansy Rail terminology Papyrus Plough Battery (electricity) Rhizome Nutrient
