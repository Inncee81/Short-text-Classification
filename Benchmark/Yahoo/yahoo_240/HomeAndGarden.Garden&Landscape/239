how do you build a waterfall for a pond could you do it with rocks you find in your yard and just put them in apile near your pond i need help making the water come down the waterfall please give step by step instructions outdoor waterfalls come in all shapes and sizes and make for emphatic focal points when mulling over your design options the main consideration is how to achieve the necessary height for the waterfall often a landscape designer exploits a slope on the property or else if the whole property is level ground erects a berm i e an artificial slope to create such an area behind the pond either way it means a lot of work and it won't be cheap either when building such large outdoor waterfalls you must lay down a flexible liner on the ground between the top of the waterfall and the pond to channel the water boulders are then placed on the liner to hide it and hold it down unless you're building an outdoor waterfall of large dimensions such work and expense are unnecessary indeed many homeowners with small spaces in which to landscape would prefer a smaller waterfall as long as it brings the wonderfully soothing sound that results from water striking water one alternative is to use pre cast concrete forms that mimic stone for the cascading structure they're compact and easy to install as they're simply stacked up over the edge of the pond but they cost money if you have access to natural rocks why not take advantage of a free resource that's the route i take in this outdoor waterfall project supplies needed to build outdoor waterfalls the cheap way rocks submersible pump tubing to run from pump to top of waterfall large plastic flower pot or similar to house tubing rigid pond liner carpenter's level shovel sand garden hose you should be able to buy the pump tubing and rigid pond liner that you'll need to build outdoor waterfalls at major hardware chains the use of the flower pot will be explained later in the article but to gain a hint on its use click the waterfall photo above right to open the photo gallery see if you can find rocks a mixture of sizes and shapes is fine but include at least a few large flat rocks this is a drywall project so it is certainly to your advantage to have flatter rocks where there's a choice they're easier to stabilize i collected several additional smaller stones to place around the edge of my pond to hide the plastic edge as decorative elements the pump i used is a little giant submersible pump with a ' cord it's a gph pump which means it displaces gallons of water per hour sufficient for such a small garden pond the width of the tubing that fits this particular pump is inch i used a small cheap rigid plastic pond liner also called a preformed liner that is ' in diameter and deep you'll use the sand to supply adjustable flooring for your rigid plastic pond liner along with a carpenter's level this will come in handy when you attempt to get your pond liner to sit level in its hole but before doing any digging for outdoor waterfalls have a certified electrician install a gfci ground fault circuit interrupter outlet near where the pond and waterfall will be if you don't already have one since the cord length of the pump i selected was ' i determined a location for mine that would be within ' of the outlet an ideal location in your landscaping for a waterfall is near a patio where you can enjoy its soothing sounds there's another matter to attend to even before contacting an electrician you should contact your local utility companies to make sure your digging for an outdoor waterfall and pond won't damage any buried utility lines Drill bit Bong Glacier Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Chatsworth House Gramophone record Floppy disk Glossary of firefighting equipment Loudspeaker Solar cell Gas metal arc welding Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Radio controlled airplane Knife Opportunity rover Bicycle frame Equine conformation Carburetor Casting Mouse (computing) Naval mine Hydraulic machinery CPU design Siphon Scuba set Textile manufacturing Thermal power station Electrical wiring Concrete Electrophysiology Screw Combine (Half-Life 2) CPU cache Tire Guitar Central processing unit Zuiderzee Works Lighting Violin Dundas Square Golf Whitewater Amateur telescope making Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Avalanche Strap-on dildo Anchor Bass guitar Rathfarnham View camera Bicycle Hamster RuneScape quests Hard disk Glossary of climbing terms Chair Volleyball Yosemite National Park E85 Dog agility Marching band Explosive material Energy development Waterfall RISC Glossary of wildland fire terms Action potential Microeconomics Timpani King Khalid International Airport Shotgun Eifel Aqueduct Billiards Glossary of firefighting terms Cascading Style Sheets Pile Clarinet Christmas tree M16 (rifle) Hydrogen economy Poker jargon Swimming pool Elevator Artificial neural network Tesla coil Panama Canal Construction Microphone Computer
