vegetable garden design g'day just moved to central florida and am itching to get a raised veggie garden going any hints or tips pests and disease avoidance would be very appreciated i just built a raised vegetable garden in michigan and i absolutely love it my raised garden is quite large ' x ' i purchased treated x 's at home depot stacked two high inches and secured them with stainless steel brackets and large screws then i used simple lattice as a fence which i reinforced at the top and bottom and attached inside the x 's with my size garden it took yards of soil to fill it i was wheelbarreling dirt for days straight over memorial day weekend not fun where we live the lattice is sufficient for keeping critters out we've had zero damage so far knocking on wood but i did purchase a wire fence to go inside the lattice just in case but so far i haven't had to also before i put the soil in i put a layer of compost for a base most cities in michigan produce and give free compost away which is nice you should check with your local city to see if they offer free compost we couldn't be happier with the garden the veggies are going crazy have fun with it whatever you end up doing it's a fantastic hobby Seismic retrofit Vermicompost Knife Organic gardening Screw Drill bit Hamster Compost Lumber Mattress San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Thermal power station Poker jargon Upholstery Comfrey Brewery Radio masts and towers Naval mine Fecal incontinence Tire Violin Wrigley Field Barbed wire Wind turbine Agriculture Cannabis cultivation Houseplant Radiation hardening Table saw Sewage treatment Guitar Air-raid shelter Bong CPU cache Shotgun Top-bar hive Semiconductor Truss bridge Textile manufacturing Solar cell Bicycle frame Fountain Weed control View camera Autonomous building Carnegie Mellon University Langstroth hive Straw-bale construction Fire fighting Gas metal arc welding Masonry Stainless steel Drainage Dundas Square Maize Bonsai Internal ballistics Dislocation Composting toilet Domestic rabbit Organic farming Combine (Half-Life 2) Floppy disk Buckingham Palace Equine conformation Retaining wall Elevator Stairway Campfire New York Giants Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Hydroponics Beekeeping Draw poker Rachel Corrie Tag Professional wrestling match types Electrophysiology Dinghy Fancy rat Kasparov versus The World Earthworm Gypsy moth Hangi Boat building Toilet Windows XP U.S. Highway 1 Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Crystallographic defect Radio controlled airplane Waste management Christmas tree Liquid crystal Pea Hard disk
