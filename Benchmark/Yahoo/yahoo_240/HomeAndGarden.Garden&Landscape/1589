what is the best way to bonsai a tree and what should i use as a original pot i have bonsai'd a number of trees i live in a very hot and humid tropical environment so the location could have an impact in a cooler and dryer place you may want to make an inside greenhouse out of plastic or bis queen and keep it warm and humid i use natural rocks and pieces of coral that have pockets or dips in them these never crack like pots do they hold the moisture good look natural because they are natural are free and you never have to worry about them i plant the small tree with a little soil in the pocket or dip then i pack fine gravel on top of the soil to hold it in place once it starts to root you on on your way it usually takes about months to get started the key to bonsai is to deprive the tree of soil and root space to grow it's the same concept as having a tree in a small pot the tree only grows so much if you remove the tree from the pot and plant it in the ground it takes off like a rocket hope this helps try it out its free and fun and after a few years you bonsai fetches a great price Bonsai Desert Hydroponics Coconut Deforestation Florida Keys Carnivorous plant Tree Devonian Pachypodium Fruit tree propagation Jute Biome Soil Greenhouse Casting Desertification Erosion Tobacco Greenhouse effect Stratification (botany) Pottery Vegetation Cannabis cultivation Global warming and agriculture Hippeastrum Water Plant Pachypodium habitats Root Comanche Citrus Campfire Drainage Orchidaceae Wood Yosemite National Park Christmas tree Sugar Geology of the Grand Canyon area Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University Weed Billiards Leaf Snooker Miami, Florida Biodiversity Cheese Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Espresso Carbon dioxide sink Tea Gardening Glacier The Karate Kid, Part III Hamster Prosopis cineraria Acorn Pea Garden Strawberry Lichen Gardenia Black pepper Ginkgo Hemp Gypsy moth Soil life Caatinga Geothermal areas of Yellowstone Knife Saitama Prefecture Sorghum Giant Sequoia Fertilizer Japanese tea ceremony Garden Old growth forest Geography of Brazil Textile manufacturing Logging Groundwater Ozone depletion Wildfire Teapot Venus Flytrap Woodworking Environmental concerns with electricity generation Flax
