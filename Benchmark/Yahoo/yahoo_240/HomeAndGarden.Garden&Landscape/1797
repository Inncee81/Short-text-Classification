how do you build a gravel walkway it's in the backyard covered in st augustine grass what would all my steps be to do this job right make it last a lot of factors come into play such as soil moisture tree and plant roots etc but here we go first determine where you want to put it if the path will be used for a variety of uses like moving a mower make it fairly wide feet is good if it is more of a garden path ' is fine mark it out with something i use marking paint but a garden hose or rope is fine remove the grass that is there if its a large area rent a sod cutter next you should determine what to use as some sort of edging this is important as the grass will quickly travel into the path unless its blocked off steel edging or aluminum edging is easy to work with and will last forever but railroad ties or even x treated lumber will be effective i reccomend the steel edging so that you can get nice smooth curves it is available at most landscape supply stores stay away from plastic edging it doesnt last so install the edging of your choice and determine what type of gravel you want to fill it with if it is a really wet area you may want to use a large crushed stone like trap rock or crushed blue stone to fill up about way up the edging use a heavy duty landscape fabric on top of that to keep the next layer from settling in then pile on what ever stone you wish to use another product to use is what is called quarry process or blue stone dust this can be compacted to almost as hard as concrete and can be easily topped off if necessary every few years but all in all use a good edging for what ever you use this will keep it all in place Mattress Irrigation Drill bit Lawn mower Casting Knife Gravel Plastic Thermal power station Seismic retrofit Fast bowling Glacier Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Upholstery Textile manufacturing terminology Anchor Glossary of wildland fire terms Chatsworth House Desert Hemp Building material Deforestation Concrete Campfire Welding Wood Woodworking Opportunity rover Textile manufacturing Lechaina Pottery King Khalid International Airport Cookware and bakeware Compost Golf Collecting fossils Brewery Bong Pavement (material) Diving suit Avalanche Leaf Laser engraving Rail tracks Rail transport modelling Professional wrestling throws Glossary of climbing terms Air-raid shelter Drawing Internal ballistics Soil Vegetation Desertification Naval mine Suspension bridge Grand Teton National Park Bicycle frame Logging Coffee Curling Retaining wall Sword making Boat building Jute Screw Waste management Flax Gramophone record Road Christo and Jeanne-Claude Vermicompost Tag Land mine Pok__mon Abilities Masonry Pachypodium Erie Canal Pachypodium habitats Roof Erosion Hamster Fire extinguisher Landmarks of Hoboken, New Jersey Handloading Sod Mulch Dundas Square Cheese Violin Sundial CPU cache Geology of the Moon Lake District Great Pyramid of Giza
