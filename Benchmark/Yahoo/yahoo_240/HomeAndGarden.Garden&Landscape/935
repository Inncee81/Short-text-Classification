i was considering planting a weeping willow in my front yard i really miss the willow trees i used to see in the mountains of nc i'm stuck in florida for the next or so years and would like to plant a weeping willow in my front yard it will be ft from the house and driveway my question is how do willows do in florida i'm in zone they are fast growing and messy dropping leaves and small branches all the time due to the shade they cast and their shallow water gobbling roots it is difficult to grow grass or other plants under them at maturity it will spread to ft so will be very close to your house and will dominate if not fill your front yard if you miss the mountains consider getting a painting or photo of them and willow trees you should also be able to find public parks with graceful trees in florida Willow Flowering plant Gypsy moth Tree Grand Teton National Park Zion National Park Pine Chatsworth House Leaf Wood Wildfire Biology of the Sierra Nevada Bamboo Desert Pachypodium John the Baptist Plant Magic Kingdom Pinophyta Capercaillie 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Dutch elm disease European Beech Bonsai Weed control Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir Aspen Beaver Hazeltine National Golf Club White Willow Coast Douglas-fir Moss Walt Disney World Resort Yosemite National Park Eucalyptus Elis Prefecture Japanese tea ceremony Liriodendron Andravida Pysanka Black pepper Coffea arabica Mediterranean Basin Rondane National Park Grand Central Terminal Deforestation Viva La Bam Tick Juniper Elm New York Giants Ivy Ginkgo Everglades Aztalan State Park, Wisconsin Peach Sequoia Glossary of wildland fire terms Southern live oak Archaeopteris RuneScape skills Oak Hydroponics Flax Florida Keys Somerset Levels Identification key Glacier National Park (US) Carnivorous plant Rowan Houseplant One Tree Hill (TV series) Henry W.
