what color landscaping rock and flower colors would you recommend for a cream colored home with blue shutters we're changing our red mulch to rock and are trying to figure out what color type of rock would go best with our home we're also adding concrete edging and some more flowers we're in minnesota i'm so bad at this and would love some expert opinions our house is cream linen with blue shutters and a weathered gray roof which is actually dark brown looking we were considering lava rock pebbles burnt red colorado sunrise stone creams whites and browns or mountain blend stone mix with slight reds tans grays but we haven't really looked at places with a ton of selection and aren't set on anything for flowers i was thinking reds yellows and blues purples however a neighbor had a mx of pinks whites yellows and purples that looked cute and cheery also the edging can have several colors in it so i want to tie it in with everything any suggestions help any advice is truly appreciated the best answer gets a batch of layer bars sent to them if you want a picture of our home i can e mail it to you i really will send some layer bars to the person who has the best answer meaning suggestions for rock and flower color schemes i make awesome bars or i can make cookies or brownies for you instead this means a lot to us so thank you hi i like either the second or third rock mix not the solid red one the lava rock sounds a little harsh colored i would recommend a multi season plan here's one that i think would look lovely spring plant a bed full of all types of daffodils with patches that bloom very early early mid and late season choose some that are bright yellow some bicolors look through the bulb selections and go wild when you plant these also plant a lot of blue grape hyacinths you plant the daffies deep and then fill with dirt and poke grape hyacinths in right in among them about grape hyacinths per daffodil when this blooms it will be like a sea of blue with yellow above it's a lovely combination also the critters do not eat either of these and they multiply season after season so you can put them in spaced a bit this year next year you'll have more and the third year it'll really come into its own summer put in some perennials i would recommend some campanula bluebells in blue and white the blue will be great with your house and the whites are pretty too tuck in some pinks dianthus both the taller biennial sweet william and the perennial clove pinks which are good for the edges add a clump of iris they come in many colors and you can choose some to match your house for early summer and a clump or two of daylilies for late try a yellow patch with the tall hyperion scented in back and the shorter reblooming stella de oro in front or go for cream and pink fall make sure you buy some mums small pots of mums are a great value if you're planting for permanent gardens you can get them in summer and place them in groups then you have the blooms all autumn and every year after you can get great colors and you can change your color scheme to rusts deep burgandies harvest golds and oranges for the season add a few autumn sedum all season fill in your perennial garden with annuals you can change your colors every year if you like i love petunias for the color range and the fact that they spread out and fill areas well i adore the tall pink cosmos too for filling in the back of a garden that's newly planted all of these work in my zone new hampshire garden and should be ok in your area too Rose Color Opportunity rover Pansy Potato Color theory Geology of the Grand Canyon area Houseplant Dog Light-emitting diode Iris (plant) Kigo Tuff Flower Sage Black pepper Stage lighting Comfrey Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Pysanka Billiards Iris (anatomy) Dragon Booster Tea Coffee Peach Lighting Flower album Perennial plant Geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area Sakura Wars Textile manufacturing Tobacco Maize Mattress Britpop Pittsburgh Steelers CIE 1931 color space Piet Mondrian Autumn Koi Chatsworth House M&M's Death Valley National Park Poker jargon Zion National Park Monofloral honey Apple Hamster Wrigley Field Wood carving James McNeill Whistler Garnet Peanut Wine Thomas Cole Bob and George Traffic sign Donovan Dianthus Tofu Sedum Tomato Christmas tree The Time Machine Chocolate Atari 8-bit family Flowering plant Color space Cat Desert Pump It Up Daylily Colorado Plateau Violet (plant) RuneScape quests Gray Wolf Comanche Chaos Emerald Wassily Kandinsky Political colour New York Giants Discus (fish) Cold Stone Creamery EastEnders Blue Floppy disk
