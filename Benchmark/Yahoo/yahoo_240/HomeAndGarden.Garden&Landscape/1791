strongest weed killer for brambles i need the strongest weed killer to get rid of brambles have tried roundup but no joy i had a back fence with ' of blackberries when i discovered rats running along the fence and living in the brambles i used a product called brush b gone we sprayed it on the leaves and in hours the leaves began to wither and in about a week the stems shriveled and turned yellow and died however any plant that the spectracide gets on will ultimately die so you have to follow the instructions to the letter and not spray on a windy day or when you are expecting imminent rain it has to have a chance to work systemically then in a couple of weeks i'd give'm another shot in case the root didn't completely die off good luck Weed control Blackberry Bramble Weed Rapeseed Sin City Poker jargon Herbicide Ragweed Illegal drug trade Comfrey West Indian cricket team Pesticide Dewberry Bamboo Pansy Dandelion One Tree Hill (TV series) Cannabis cultivation Percy Schmeiser Theory of conduct Indianapolis 500 Coca eradication Cannabis (drug) The Bag On Line Adventures USS Tunny (SS-282) RuneScape quests Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Full Metal Panic?
