can u help my sweet broom my sweet broom looks bad all the leaves are gone there is no folliage an infestation of hairy caterpillars were all over it and i think they ate the whole thing so they could become lovely butterlies of course and now it looks dead will it come back it is very established and large but i am not sure if i cut the branches off to prune it if it will cause harm please gardeners let me know thank you are the stems still green if so the plant is still photosynthesizing cutting back now is risky as the plants are going dormant they start earlier than most people believe cutting back might stimulate new growth that will be killed in the cold weather coming still who wants naked stems so some trimming back if fine for beauty even though you really want to cut it way back don't hopefully the damage done was after the plant had stored away enough energy and next spring leaves will return and all will be well brooms tend to get a little leafless naturally that's why i asked about the stems Leaf Plant Bamboo Pruning fruit trees Olive Bonsai Hop (plant) Flowering plant Gooseberry Tea Bud Carnivorous plant Biological pest control Cuscuta The Amber Spyglass Tomato Wood Rose Kudzu Broom (shrub) Banana Photosynthesis Hamster Tobacco Pansy Apple Pine Cannabis cultivation Aloe Orchidaceae Grafting Ant Cigarette Auxin Date Palm Sorghum Apical dominance Coffea arabica Green tea Fruit tree propagation Plant stem Coffee Ragwort Apricot Shrub Goldenrod Potato Diseases of the honeybee Cereal Comfrey Watermelon Ginkgo Beetle Garden Strawberry Pea Chlorophyta Weed Canna lily Pinophyta Hashish Capercaillie Flower Essential oil Banksia Japanese tea ceremony Alfalfa Hair Moss Plum Piccolo Junior Saga Yarrow Black pepper Ecology Hemp Beet Dandelion Lettuce Lawn Rainforest Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Chocolate Pachypodium baronii Rosemary Collard greens Renewable energy Loganberry Physiological plant disorders Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pachypodium ambongense Rooibos Eutrophication Soil pH Pachypodium bicolor Kiwifruit Sweet potato
