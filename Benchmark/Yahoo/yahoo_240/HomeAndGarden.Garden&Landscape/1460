leaves from gourds would it be bad if i clipped some of them off for an crafts project i have a gourd plant that is living it's life on my west patios trellies i wonder if i clipped some off now would i disturb the plant from further development also i have an idea to make a bird bath out of it with cement and using the big leaves of the gourd any idea how to go about thanks it's a really big plant hi if the plant is vigoursly growing as gourds usually do then the loss of a few leaves shouldn't stunt the growth the only downside is that where the leaves are cut is a potential place for disease to enter i would find a side shoot that you don't want and cut that off instead and get all the leaves from the same place with only one cut good luck Yerba mate Bamboo Economy of Haiti Chicken Leaf Olive Ginkgo Plant Pansy Prunus Gypsy moth Garden Strawberry Hop (plant) Pine Little Shop of Horrors Auxin Banana Global warming and agriculture Carnivorous plant Equine conformation Netsuke Blooper Ta__no Fruit tree propagation Houseplant Mosquito Pow-wow Oat Plant stem Kudzu Desert Apical dominance Chayote Tick The Ashlee Simpson Show Craps My Family (television) Illegal drug trade Palakkad Loganberry Basil Gooseberry Knife Trichosanthes dioica Photosynthesis Species Dutch elm disease Bud Florida Keys Luck Ethylene Euphemism Keynesian economics Alfalfa Venus Flytrap Soil pH Old growth forest Wheat Hatake Kakashi Europe Orchidaceae Taxi Driver Manroot Moss Wayne Corporation Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Future energy development Taro Maize Mid-levels Kodocha Pysanka Synthetic diamond Fast bowling Rose (Doctor Who) Weed control Ragwort Fern Cheating in poker Pinophyta Smoking pipe Hemp I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Music of Nigeria Cigarette Canary Teen Girl Squad Nose flute Stoma Portland cement Beet Hippeastrum Logging
