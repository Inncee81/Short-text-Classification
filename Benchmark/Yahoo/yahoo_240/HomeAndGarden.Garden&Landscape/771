how do i care for a lemon tree i just received a ponderosa lemon tree not sure if they like alot of water sun and what type of soil for repotting and prunning citrus really likes sun and surprisingly enough it really likes coffee grounds if you have any put it on the surface of the soil as a kind of mulch the only other tip i have is don't re pot it right away into a really big pot it will put all its energy into rooting and won't do much else for awhile like flowering and fruiting if you see the roots coming out the bottom transplant it into a slightly bigger pot if the pot isn't heavy enough to keep the plant upright in winds then place the smaller pot into a big heavy pot that should help i keep my lemon and kumquat outdoors well it's in a greenhouse this year during the summer then in a sunny southern window during the winter the kumquat needs trimming but the lemon has been ok btw i live way up north but my lemon has survived two winters and i've gotten about three lemons from it so far ask your favorite garden center about the kind of fertilizer you should be giving it and tips for your region Citrus Bonsai Houseplant Irrigation Garden Strawberry Hippeastrum Peach Kumquat Weed control Comfrey Tea Japanese tea ceremony Geography of Albania Greenhouse Christmas tree Fanta Hamster Leaf Gardening Cannabis cultivation Poker jargon Elis Prefecture Apple Solar power European Beech Flowering plant Iris (plant) Soil Soil pH Begonia Climate of the United Kingdom Plant Flax Desert Renewable energy Agriculture Gin Orchard Soil life Fruit tree propagation Ponderosa Pine Climate of the Alps Quang Ninh Province Mulch Donovan Barbecue Weed Deforestation Gypsy moth Hydroponics Tillandsia Breakfast Fruit Vegetative reproduction Pruning fruit trees Bird migration Pine Global warming Gatorade Date Palm Orange (fruit) Permaculture Geography of Alberta Essential oil Olive Pansy Sunflower Gooseberry Black pepper Coconut Carrot Coffea arabica Lime (fruit) Honey fungus Sun Banksia Snooker Autonomous building Nepeta Berry Draw poker Sailing Geography of Russia Pysanka Ozone depletion Lawn mower Chatsworth House Betting (poker) Fertilizer Venus Flytrap Ionosphere Wind turbine Tillage Passive solar
