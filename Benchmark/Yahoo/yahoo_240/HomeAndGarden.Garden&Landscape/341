why is my chilli plant dying i have a chilli plant which i grew from a packet of seeds this year it was the only one that survived past being a shoot it is now about feet tall and was growing quickly and sprouting flowers untill a couple of days ago it has been drinking loads of water for the last couple of months about pint a day then suddenly the ends of the leaves went limp then they are starting to go brown but only just i have been giving it miracle grow in the water every now and again most of the flowers it had have now died and dropped off what can i do i have another chilli plant i bought as a seedling next to it and that seems fine they are in a window that gets sun all afternoon any ideas is it overwatered or underwatered or is something else wrong oldgringo the flowers have dropped off at the stem not at the head so there are no chillis coming will it still be possible to get some chillis this year if i let it dry out for a couple of days well its pretty normal for your chilli to drop some of its flowers as only a few make to actually seedpod stage however yours sound like one of two things bacterial leaf spot for one appears as circular to irregular water soaked lesions on leaves and stems have they become purplish gray with a black center and surrounded by a narrow yellow halo this usually begins lower on the plant where infected leaves become ragged and eventually turn brown and fall from the plant severe infections can actually result in defoliation of the plant and severe blossom drop next time plant reistant resistant varieties and disease free seed or transplants or it could very well be phytophthora root rot phytophthora root rot also called chile wilt is caused by the soil borne fungus phytophthora capsici this fungus is a serious pathogen on peppers this fungus causes a problem when soils are excessively wet so you may have over watered half a pint a day you said the capillary action of your growing medium plant it'll soak up water like a sponge when disease occurson just one particular plant this often indicates excessive watering and the spread of infective spores by over watering and may also be worsened if kept in shade which causes high humidity and slow drying favoring activity by the fungus symptoms of phytophthora root rot usually occur after heavy watering and high temps and when the foliage is dense and plants become crowded the first symptom of infected plants is severe wilting within a few days infected plants collapse due to root and stem infections and die turning straw colored or browinish in many cases plants are defoliated and severe root rot such as discolored dead roots from which the bark sheds easily also occur keep the plantpot area clean and in the sun and donot overwater think of where a plant comes from and try and mimic that environment hope this helps it sounds like one or the other or could be a combo of both when a plant is under any severe stress it will wilt and drop flowers keep at it success will come Leaf Orchidaceae Wood Phytophthora cinnamomi Chamaecyparis lawsoniana Carnivorous plant Tobacco Physiological plant disorders Flowering plant Psoriasis Myxobolus cerebralis Soil pH Hemp Sudden Oak Death Plant Pansy Coast Douglas-fir Banksia Textile manufacturing Honey fungus Comfrey Garden Strawberry Pneumonia Apple Dutch elm disease Bamboo Peanut Rose Compost Sorghum Black pepper Bladderwort Diseases of the honeybee Hippeastrum Chronic fatigue syndrome Dandruff Flax Jute Tree Sugar beet European Beech Oak Stratification (botany) San Pedro cactus Tomato Sunflower Magnaporthe grisea Pinophyta Seed Cannabis cultivation Hamster Desert Leukemia Sickle-cell disease Cotton plant Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Giant Sequoia Sewage treatment Coffee Cephalic disorder Fancy rat Common cold Carbon dioxide Botulism Pachypodium Weed control Pikmin Illegal drug trade Chlorophyta Fungus Atherosclerosis Logging Red Hot Chili Peppers Cancer Dairy Biological pest control Chile pepper AIDS Pine H5N1 Menstrual cycle Morphology of Pachypodium Capsicum Traumatic brain injury Flower Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans
