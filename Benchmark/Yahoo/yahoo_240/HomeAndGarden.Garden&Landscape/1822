does anyone have any suggestions of how to use these walls they are part of the original farmhouse i hired a landscaper to do yard work he asked me what my plans were for my back yard then told me one day he had a mason coming over to give me an estimate what i have is the stone foundation of a barn that used to be attached to my house the stone frame varies from high and consistently about wide the total length of all the walls comes to i love the looks of these stone walls and would like to have a two tier patio made by filling in the lowest levels with crushed stone then make kind of top the mason came to my home and said this is a mess the reason the wall last years was because the barn held it in place but now that i tore the barn down and because i live on a sloped property this area is level though the wall will inevitably cave he said the only thing i can do is have the wall taken apart and rebuilt that will cost once done the slope of my property and the roof of my house dripping rain water will cause it to fall eventually he said you have about in materials here but getting rid of it will cost more than i do not have to make a patio and i do not want to pay for him to take my stones away i really like the way they look there is no slope where the stone all is the slope is in the front of my proprty ' before the wall and ' after the wall my proprty drops off again i have a problem with the info given to me i see stone walls retaining bank walls and i see stone walls on properties above other properties and the walls seem stable i am going to get a few estimates from masons i select if you have water dripping from your roof redirect it away from the stone walls this way it should not do any damage to the old walls or the house foundation one thing you may want to do is cap the tops of the wall this is done by building a wooden form along the top of the wall so it can hold about inches of concrete you mix the concrete so it is not too wet but is a little stiff over fill the forms slighty and trowel the concrete so it is higher in the center make it appear to be a low roof running the length of the wall this will help to prevent water from penetrating the top of the wall and causing it to deteriorate if you are ina n area where the winter goes below freezing this is very important water that pentrates into the wall will freeze and cause the motar to crumble this will eventually make the wall unstable and unsafe if you do decide to have another contractor look at it try a masonary contractor that works with stone and does repairs to old stone walls instead of landscape contractors read below about selecting contractors selecting contractors look up local contractors first work out form the closest to your location if some you trust has had work done similar to yours ask them about the contractor they used if they were completely satisfied with their contractor s ask for their telephone number select at least your are interested do a google yahoo search on each of the contractors you are interested in look for praises check who is writing the praises to see if they have any connection to the contractor scam artists and coffident persons often work in groups google yahoo search the people giving the praise or references when you are satisfied with at least contractors per job have the give you written estimates with details of work to be done terms guarantee s cost of extras how much do they charge if they find something not covered by the contract paymant schedules if necessary and whatever else you can think of to protect yourself if the contractor tries to pressure you into signing the contract immediately with a high deposit more than reject that contractor be careful high pressure can be someone who sounds very convincing but has many reasons why you should sign on the dotted line now it is always good to have another adult with you when a contractor inspects the work to be done if you do not get at least written estimates signed by the contractor not you do not sign yet go back to repeat until you get written estimates signed by the contractor not you do not sign yet read the estimates over with some who has some knowledge of the work that has to be done this may take longer than you thought do not rush into it research resaerch research helps when you are ready choose by being
