when you transplant roses what is the best way and time to do this my father is sale our home and i want to take the roses with us because they were a gift from a friend of my mothers plus it is the only thing we have left that moma loved so when would be a good time to transplant and the the best way to do this i heard that midnight is the best time to dig them up i also heard other things so i am not sure can you help absolute best time is after the first freeze yes that's right in late autumn or all winter before the last freeze however if you have no other choice then you can move it now here are some detail instructions transplanting a rose wait until evening when temps are cooler cut the rose back to about or feet prepare the new home by digging a hold ftx ft and watering it throughly fill the hole with water and let it drain completely at least twice save the top of soil that you just dug up and set aside discard the bottom amend the soil you saved with peat bone meal and garden compost in the bottom of the hold add a layer of manure inches thick and then layers some of the amended soil on top of the manure do not set the roots directly on the manure use a shovel to cut around the rose bush about inches from the trunk all the way around moving around the rose bush again reinsert the shovel and pull down on the handle doing this all the way around will loosen the soil and begin to separate any long roots keep doing this until the rose can be easily removed don't worry too much if you break a root because roses are tougher than they look remove the rose at this point it is best to keep as much of the origional soil around the roots as possible since it is summer if you move it in the fall you can shake the soil away and trim any damaged or dying roots set rose in hole making sure the soil on the root ball is a little above the level of the new hole you want the rose to be on a small mound fill in the hole half way with the ammended soil and water once the water has run through then finish filling in the hole with the soil and water throughly now that you have transplanted your rose then make sure you give it water everyday for the next weeks be sure you water it at the base and early in the morning because roses don't like to get wet after the two weeks then you can cut back the watering to once a week good luck Drainage Comfrey Compost Textile manufacturing Casting Seismic retrofit Drill bit Hemp Houseplant Poker jargon Bong Weed control Fertilizer Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Knife Hamster Wood No-dig gardening Bread Biodynamic agriculture Volleyball Avalanche Sugar beet A151 road Bonsai Erie Canal Japanese tea ceremony Opportunity rover Soil 1957 World Series Garden Strawberry Brewery Sea ice Tofu Irrigation Mattress Tobacco Glacier Tillage Death Valley National Park Campfire Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an 2004 World Series Hydroponics Battles of Lexington and Concord Pottery Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Sewage treatment The Chemical Brothers Lateral thinking Hardpan Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Coffee Shaggy dog story Peat Animal Crossing Woodworking The Stone Roses Comanche 613 mitzvot Barbecue Desert Bamboo Tire USS Tunny (SS-282) Internal ballistics Menstrual cup Olive Screw Cheese Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Punch card Stonehenge Dialysis Fruit tree propagation Grand Teton National Park Tea The Inside Begonia Leaf Gooseberry Tooth Rose Thermal power station 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Operation Market Garden Spirit rover timeline for 2004 February CPU cache Billboard Hot 100 Rachel Corrie Glossary of nautical terms Equine conformation
