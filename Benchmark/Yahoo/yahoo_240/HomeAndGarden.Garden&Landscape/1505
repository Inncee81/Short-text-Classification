can bristle cone pine grow in ohio i have tried to grow this pine in my rock garden and it was dead by the next spring the drainage was great no clay i had a landscaper tell me to put a layer of stone or gravel under the plant then plant it i am thinking slica sand course and mix it in the soil what do you think does anyone have any ideas what is your soil ph bristlecone are found in drier soils which will be slightly acidic near neutral or even into the alkaline side if you are very acidic no go you say you don't have clay what do you have loam silty loam sandy why would you want to add sand or gravel if you don't have clay and have good drainage hmmm i'm confused in clay soils adding rock underneath impedes drainage it doesn't improve it it all has to do with surface tension and in clay adding sand is the worst thing you can do unless you add feet of sand clay particles are microscopic and it takes tons and tons of sand to do any good anything less and you make concrete try mounding your soil planting on the mound don't over plant that is sinking the root ball below the soil level more than inch use mulch to temper soil temperature fluctuations and keep moisture level constant the mound will help drain off excessive moisture the mulch will help protect the roots from deep freezes you know it may have nothing to do with the soil and have to do with the plant how it was planted whether a wire was left on to girdle the stem unlikely in a few months broken root ball at planting etc it's my favorite pine try again Desert Pachypodium habitats Drainage Soil Houseplant Soil pH Pachypodium Erosion Pottery Dune Bonsai Geothermal areas of Yellowstone Earthworm Glacier Sand Lake Water purification Sugar beet Death Valley National Park Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Vermicompost Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Seismic retrofit Aquifer Wood Bog Desertification Hydroponics Erie Canal Garden Strawberry Grand Teton National Park Carnivorous plant Pavement (material) Hemp Flax Gravel Flood geology Weathering Portland cement Mulch Caliche A151 road Peat Carbon dioxide Concrete Lumber Compost Comfrey Stratification (botany) Geography of Ireland Plant Water (molecule) Geography of Lithuania Gooseberry Reinforced concrete Swiss plateau Yosemite National Park Geology of the Appalachians Zuiderzee Works Sedimentary rock Atlanta metropolitan area Tea Gypsy moth Honey fungus Pansy Motor oil Humus Drill bit Geography of China Anchor Geography of Africa Rain Corrosion Lichen Campfire Volleyball Geography of Russia Road Deforestation Casting Dam Apple Bladderwort Soil salination Carbon dioxide sink Electrophysiology Physiological plant disorders Soil life Ross and Cromarty Geology of the Grand Canyon area
