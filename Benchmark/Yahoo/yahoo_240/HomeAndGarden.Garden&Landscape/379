where did all of my wild birds go i live in minnesota and since the spring i have had rose breasted grosebeaks chikadees woodpeckers nuthatches cardinals and finchs i was having to refill my feeder every two days all of a sudden end of july they aren't around where did they go and why the finchs are still here but not in abundance like before i also live in mn and this is a normal occurance this time of year the birds are finding other natural food that is probably closer to where they roost grossbeaks robins catbirds cardinals and many others like to eat berries and if there are any berry trees cherry grape vines honeysuckle etc near by they are probably going there nuthatches like to eat bugs and this is prime time for them to find them the finches are probably out feeding on all of the wild thistles that are going into seed no worries though they will be back closer to fall probably not the grossbeaks though as they migrate and for sure next spring one other thing that may be influencing the feeder is if there are any grackles starlings black birds or crows near by the smaller song birds tend to avoid them i am not sure what you are putting out for bird seed either to try to get some of the nuthatches and other woodpeckers back try putting out suet or if you can fat trimmings off of deer or cattle during the colder months from locals that process their own deer or beef cattle putting out the suet during the summer months is not a great idea as it spoils Atlanta metropolitan area Bird feeder Birdfeeding Bird migration Bird Gypsy moth Chicken Red Squirrel Yosemite National Park Capercaillie Acorn Ivory-billed Woodpecker Livestock Nuthatch Comanche Passerine Oak Titmouse Juniper Titmouse Kakapo Rose Seabird Clark's Nutcracker Red-cockaded Woodpecker American Black Bear Eurasian Nuthatch Beef Emberizidae Grape Montana Kashrut Extinct birds Taxus Watermelon Velvet-fronted Nuthatch Great Spotted Woodpecker Domesticated turkey Chili con carne Kosher foods Hamster Omega-3 fatty acid Brown Bear Black-capped Chickadee Breastfeeding Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir Pygmy Nuthatch Cuisine of the Southern United States Domestication Condor European Goldfinch Temerin Lineated Woodpecker Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Ozone depletion Apollo Hummingbird Hedgehog Coast Douglas-fir Pileated Woodpecker Black pepper Carolina Chickadee Lesser Spotted Woodpecker Thermoregulation Woodpecker Geography of Chile Slovenia Coffea arabica Charge (heraldry) Ozone hole AFI 100 Years series Rowan Eastern Gray Squirrel Roman eating and drinking Helm Identification Guides Weed control Animal cognition Dog Northern Flicker Acorn Woodpecker Quang Ninh Province White oak Earthworm Endangered species Egg (food) Vegetarianism Squirrel Fruit Fauna of Australia American Crow Sexual dimorphism Bat Hunting Foie gras Darwin's finches Cedar Waxwing Tomato Deer
