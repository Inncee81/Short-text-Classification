ok i painted some yogurt containers with acrylic paint i'm planning on using them outside as pots for flowers i didn't paint the inside just the outside of it to cover up the yogurt label do i need to put anything else on it to keep the paint from coming off i'm not really sure what all i need to do i've never done this before thanks if i just leave it as is without some kind of sealant or anything will the paint stay on or will it mess it up the paint will eventually crack and flake off the plastic is really not paint friendly and most paints that are would either melt the plastic or would be a pain to use not a decorative friendly dealy little clay pots are relatively cheap and they take any type of paint but use your yogurt containers and enjoy them while your decorations last why not i like to refer to those types of art projects as parishable art nice that you like to enjoy life and its little important things good for you nad Plastic Yoghurt Pottery Poker jargon Reinforced concrete Paint Houseplant Japanese tea ceremony Casting Acrylic paint Brush Culture of Korea Ice cream Art in Ancient Greece Viva La Bam Stone Age Clay Naval mine Bon Jovi Stucco Humphrey Bogart Rubber stamp Modernism The Amber Spyglass Linear Pottery culture Wassily Kandinsky Cast iron Leonardo da Vinci Urinal Christmas tree Customs and etiquette of Japan Dice Art Comanche Vitreous enamel Coffee Rammstein Geothermal areas of Yellowstone John Cage Mid-levels Rei Ayanami Snooker Pablo Picasso Glossary of climbing terms Rococo Artemisia Gentileschi Bonsai Francis Bacon (painter) Bullet Aegean civilization Stanton Macdonald-Wright Hand grenade Tofu Glaze Scale model Genericized trademark Textile manufacturing terminology Ocean's Twelve Textile manufacturing Malwa Wood carving Hush...
