new sod watering too much we have just sodded our lawn and i am wondering how much often i should water my lawn can you over do watering or will it cause no harm sod should be watered frequently with small amounts of water to encourage rooting apply water at least once per day during the first two weeks after installation use enough water to keep the sod and the soil beneath it moist but not soaking wet throughout the day be extra careful during hot dry and windy weather newly installed sod can dry out quickly as more and more roots penetrate the soil carefully lift the edges of strips in several locations to check decrease the frequency of watering but increase the total amount of water applied each time to encourage a deep and healthy root system hand watering usually allows you to regulate the amount of water applied better than using a mechanical sprinkler Irrigation Sod Lawn Climate of the United Kingdom Comfrey Sugar beet Water Breastfeeding Hamster Hydroponics Wood Seismic retrofit Drainage Root Psoriasis Carnivorous plant Weed Hiking Hyperthermia Hemp Escherichia coli O157:H7 Drill bit Campfire Drowning Sorghum Welding Hippeastrum Electrical wiring Glossary of firefighting equipment Eutrophication Textile manufacturing Glossary of firefighting terms Xeriscaping Erosion Pachypodium Gypsy moth Dishwasher Fire extinguisher Deforestation Soil pH National Weather Service Elevator Toilet paper Wind Certified Nursing Assistant Nuclear fallout Wind turbine Dieting El Ni__o Mattress Internal ballistics Soil Houseplant Desert Global warming and agriculture Wildfire Yosemite National Park Casting Cruising (maritime) Motor oil Adiabatic lapse rate Physiological plant disorders Tofu Gas metal arc welding Coffee Fertilizer Opportunity rover Tooth enamel Stall (flight) Bonsai Lawn mower Hydroelectricity Tooth Chinese food therapy 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Plough Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Dietary fiber Flax Glossary of wildland fire terms Urinary incontinence Upholstery Weed control Inflation Geography of Turkey Massage Sewage treatment Bong Bread Tobacco Garden Strawberry Weathering Agar plate Magnetic resonance imaging Carbon dioxide sink Organic farming Rice Relative humidity Perth, Western Australia Glacier
