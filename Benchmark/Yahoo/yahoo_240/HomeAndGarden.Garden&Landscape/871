tree disease should i worry how to cure it i have two evergreen trees in my backyard i live in the suburbs of st louis in missouri i do not know what their specific species is or whatever but i am pretty sure their cones shouldn't be slimy and grow strange long strands i first noticed the sliminess about or more years ago but have ignored it it was at first only on the largest tree but recently when i was cutting the lawn i noticed now that all the evergreen trees in my backyard have slimy cones with strange growths the trees don't seem to be dying i was wondering if i should be worrying about this if this was a disease and if so what it was and if so if i should do something about it and if so what should i do not knowing what kind of tree it is makes it really hard to figure what could be wrong i just trying to picture it in my mind and am wondering if it is just sap dripping off the cones could it just be sap if it is sap dripping then it could be burrowing insects like bark beetles the red pine cone beetle seems to cause this drippy sap thing or maybe its some kind of fungus Pine Giant Sequoia Wood Beetle Oak Gypsy moth Dutch elm disease Pinophyta Longleaf Pine Whitebark Pine Tomato Coast Douglas-fir Biological pest control Bristlecone pine Conifer cones Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Christmas tree Sequoia Honey fungus Wollemia Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir Red-cockaded Woodpecker Bark beetle Bamboo Banksia Eastern White Pine Humphrey Bogart Aphid Rainforest Cupressaceae Juniper Time Out of Mind European Black Pine Monster Rancher monsters Insect Cedar Fruit tree propagation Olive Thuja plicata Sitka Spruce Rubber Lebanon Cedar Taxus Lava Beds National Monument Plant Apple Botany Cryptomeria Scots Pine Fauna of Australia Spruce Red Squirrel Color Chamaecyparis lawsoniana Fir Western Hemlock Tree RuneScape quests Red Fir Limber Pine Araucaria araucana Biology Callitropsis nootkatensis Grand Teton National Park Eucalyptus Vegetation Allegheny National Forest Rice Maple syrup Ash tree Capercaillie Taxodium Chagas disease Date Palm Invasive species in Australia Netsuke Color blindness Mountain Hemlock Podocarpus Taxus baccata Forest Peach Honeybee Douglas-fir Phloem Cunninghamia RuneScape skills AFI 100 Years series Dacrydium cupressinum Monterey Pine Red Pine Wheat Milton H.
