bedding geraniums i have a wonderful show of bedding geraniums which i got from buying plug plants from a webb site what if anything can i do to save over winter or take cuttings or do i just start again next year thank you as geraniums are quite cheap its easier to start again next year but you can take cuttings or what i do is wait till flowering is finished then take the individual plants out of the pots taking care not to damage the roots shake off any excess soil and hang them out in a cool dark place and forget about them the following spring i cut off all the dead leaves and trim down the stems to inches and plant them in fresh compost one or two inevitably die but i generally get most of them to flower again feeding them with tomato food in the growing season have managed to keep one set of trailing geraniums flowering for years i have tried cuttings and although they are meant to be quite easy most of mine rot have a go don't worry if it doesn't work cos u can always buy some more next year excellent book on cuttings propagation rhs propagating plants Comfrey Houseplant Carnivorous plant Cranesbill Weed control Olive Hamster Hemp Hop (plant) Alfalfa Cannabis cultivation Garden Strawberry Organic farming Tobacco Fruit tree propagation Physiological plant disorders Grafting Bonsai Flax Japanese tea ceremony Plant Essential oil Wood Hippeastrum Begonia Dairy Flowering plant Nepeta Sugar beet Bamboo Pansy Black pepper Tomato Kudzu Compost The Lovely Bones Textile manufacturing Venus Flytrap Monarda Customs and etiquette of Japan Flower Orchidaceae Gooseberry Maize Earthworm Tillandsia Jute Comanche Soil life Iris (plant) Pachypodium baronii Brugmansia Potato Waste management Aphid Fancy rat The Amber Spyglass Leaf Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Pachypodium ambongense Sage Phalaenopsis Syphon Filter Oat Forsythia Death Valley National Park Irrigation Creeping Charlie Drainage Tea Vegetative reproduction Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Wisteria Green Revolution Pruning fruit trees Basil Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Nuclear power Cycad Coconut Apricot Ficus elastica Hay Peach Naval mine Pelargonium Desert Agriculture Garlic Sin City Deflation (economics) Thermal power station Beet European Beech Manure
