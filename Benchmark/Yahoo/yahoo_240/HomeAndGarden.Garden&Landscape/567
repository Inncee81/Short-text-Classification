what is the correct way to prepare topsoil for new seed i just installed a patio and have yards of loam to spread it will be inches deep to inches deep depending on location do i just spread this as close to the grad i want then seed it and roll a roller over it to compact it thanks hi firstly if your in the usa right now it's pretty much required that u wait a few more weeks before planting seed summer seeding for grasses grown in north america will result in less than success generally speaking the very best time of year to seed turf is between sept and oct unless you in the south if so add three to more weeks because you are spreading the material inches thick or more you will not have to airate the existing soil i would however amend the soil you are spreading with a few bags of pete moss for water retentention and manure or other organic materials it is not necessary to roll the material but it is otherwise a good idea to make sure the majority of the seed is burried lightly good luck Hemp Textile manufacturing Soil Plant Seed Flax Peanut Vermicompost Tillage Comfrey Brewery Sorghum Potato Green manure Biodynamic agriculture Agriculture Carnivorous plant Fruit tree propagation Renewable energy Garden Strawberry Lawn Opportunity rover Cannabis cultivation Wood Pachypodium Tofu Stratification (botany) Manure Tobacco Mattress Green Revolution Desert Soil pH Natural gas Earthworm Marching band Jute Drill bit 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Black pepper Sugar beet Barley Organic certification Hydroponics Moss Turnip (brassica rapa) Thermal power station Illegal drug trade Irrigation Fertilizer The Championships, Wimbledon Hay Cannabis (drug) Flowering plant Gardening Houseplant Bamboo Sustainable agriculture Japanese tea ceremony Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 March Golf Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Campfire Carbon dioxide sink Peat Sewage treatment Bread Glossary of wildland fire terms Compact disc Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina California Buckwheat Begonia Neolithic Revolution Weed Wine making Mulch Oat Gooseberry San Pedro cactus Orchidaceae Herbicide Photosynthesis Climate of the United Kingdom Alfalfa European Beech Kudzu Welding Coast Douglas-fir Laws of cricket Sowing Drainage Concrete Rice Tire Flood geology
