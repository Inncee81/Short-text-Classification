fall planting zone when i would like to put some shrubs in this fall i live in illinois but when do i buy and plant in the spring i see shrubs at all the home stores but i dont recall seeing them in the fall have i overlooked or is it hard to find shrubs in the fall do i need to wait until spring it depends on the shrubs themselves i used to work as a vendor for a large diy store in the greenhouse outdoor garden dept and our product would cycle that is what would be good for spring planting would come in in march summer would come in in may and fall would be in around july august so whatever you find in nurseries right now is good to plant right now unfortunately for fall shrubs there's not much choice in flowering plants if you want color you'll most likely have to go with a shrub whose leaves will change nicely such as a burning bush which turns a lovely brilliant red in fall this shrub should be available now but as for any other selections your best bet is to buy in late june early july to get a good choice just keep the shrub potted or bagged and watered until you want to plant or plant it immediately keep in mind that unless the shrub keeps its color flowers up until the colder months you'll really only get a good selection in spring and even then the color may only last a few months shrub roses are a good up until winter choice for something flowering right now you'll mostly find evergreens such as boxwood euonymus arborvitae and the aforementioned burning bush which is a euonymus if these are in the nurseries in your area and they should be i'm in zone myself you can plant them now good luck Rose Shrub Bonsai Hellebore Tea Forsythia Alder Plant Christmas tree Flower Autumn Climate of the Alps Eucalyptus Japanese tea ceremony King Khalid International Airport Perennial plant Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and shrub Customs and etiquette of Japan Cannabis cultivation Garden Strawberry Tick Carnivorous plant Grafting Bulk vending Pansy Wood Flowering plant Buxus Gooseberry Orchidaceae Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Animal Crossing Greenhouse Apple Poker jargon Irrigation Cranberry Maple Houseplant Berberis Banksia Cannabis (drug) Pysanka Sagebrush CPU cache Tofu Carbon dioxide Season Aucuba Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University Begonia Kigo Leaf Topiary Serviceberry Holly Broom (shrub) Kudzu Lois Hole Tomato Brooklyn Botanic Garden Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Fuchsia Cupressaceae Hippeastrum Chokeberry Elderberry Pyracantha Floristry Maize Cotoneaster Wildfire Heath (habitat) Gorse Betting (poker) Deforestation Sage Rooibos Spring (season) Pachypodium baronii Pinophyta Peach Gardenia Japanese calendar Jasmine John Forrest, 1st Baron Forrest of Bunbury Creosote bush Hydrangea Biological pest control Comfrey Guadalupe Mountains National Park Citrus Pasadena, California Watermelon Biology of the Sierra Nevada Renewable energy
