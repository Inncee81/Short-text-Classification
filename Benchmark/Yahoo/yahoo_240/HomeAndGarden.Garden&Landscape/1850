how to make raised flower beds i want to make some raised beds in my new garden and will use stone to retain soil but what should i use on the back side where the fence is to stop it rotting etc i built a raised bed right next to my deck and put mil pond liner against the deck wood to keep the dirt and water away from it so it would not rot one of the biggest advantages of using pond liner is that it roughly the thickness of a quarter so you don't lose too much space you can buy it at lowes or home depot by the foot ' x ' and it isn't too expensive i did this about years ago and have not noticed any signs of rot so far Hemp Seismic retrofit Garden Bus models used in New York City Transit Upholstery Poker jargon Rathfarnham Gramophone record Chatsworth House Ship Hamster Comfrey Textile manufacturing Equine conformation Shaggy dog story Drainage Dinghy Geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area Bed (furniture) Wrigley Field San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Autonomous building Irrigation Sin City Softball Flax History of Test cricket (1884 to 1889) Wall Punt (boat) Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Glossary of nautical terms Knife Houseplant Wood Donovan RMS Titanic Non-native pronunciations of English Skateboarding trick Capernaum Retaining wall Shoe Basement Dairy Sears Holdings Corporation Hippeastrum Climate of the Alps Sento Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Sewage treatment Laserdisc Xeriscaping Leather Stairway Deck (ship) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Campbell, California View camera Passenger car The Shining (film) Landfill Floppy disk Campfire Bladderwort Geothermal areas of Yellowstone Betting (poker) St Albans Cathedral Yosemite National Park Opportunity rover Ernest Harmon Air Force Base Flowering plant Carnivorous plant Pittsburgh Steelers SS Andrea Doria USS United States (1797) Ocean liner Pebble bed reactor Mulch Lava Beds National Monument Nuclear power Pickup truck Helicopter Fish farming Shipwreck Cloud Volleyball Four square Titanic (1997 film) Parsonsfield, Maine Angel Stadium of Anaheim Yacht Death Valley National Park Golf Assonet, Massachusetts Taxodium Violin Cremation Potomac River Hastings United FC Pond
