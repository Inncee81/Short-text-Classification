does this sound like poison ivy my son was walkin through the woods with me and i didnt even think about anything like this but then i look down and we were walking through this low viney bush it looks like the pictures of poison ivy ive looked at but the thing is its stem was like scratchy bristly almost i cant find anything about the texture of a poison ivy stem does anyone know if that is the way the stems are im not very concerned for myself but my yr old is highly allergic to a lot of things and i am wondering if on first contact that i know of if its common for kids to develop a rash help generally speaking the stem of a poison ivy plant can appear very different based on the age of the plant some vines grow over several years and will have a woody look to them while new stems look like lush green plant or vine stalks you should be most interested in the leaves in order to identify poisn ivy poison ivy is distinct with three pointed leaves to each stem at least most of the time allthough researchers can find up to nine per stem this isn't normal younger plants will be green some more mature plants will appear redish there are other plants that like like it too so you may want to look online for pictures poison ivy does in fact grow just about anywhere your son may have been exposed there would not be too much that could be done at this point strange enough some people will not have a reaction the first time they are exposed to the plant but the body may react the second time thanks i'll keep my fingers crossed Poison-ivy Vine Toxicodendron Poison Ivy (comics) Plant Leaf Tomato Creeping Charlie Flowering plant Allergy Ivy Root Mango Peanut Rash Autism Bamboo Weed control Poison Tobacco Tree Mushroom hunting Mistletoe Plant stem Jute Rooibos Black pepper Pachypodium baronii Pruning fruit trees Carbon dioxide Violin Stem cell Pachypodium ambongense Food Wisteria Pachypodium brevicaule Pachypodium bicolor Banana Pinophyta Maize Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Asperger syndrome Virginia creeper Batman Plantago Aerial root Second language acquisition Aristolochia Shrub Ragwort Kudzu Moss Dioxin Kiwifruit Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Green tea Chernobyl accident Cuscuta Textile manufacturing Mountain Gorilla Alder Latex Ginkgo Cheese Hemp Depleted uranium Mushroom Dog RuneScape skills Salad Fingers Tea University of Michigan Yarrow Honey fungus Auxin Conifer cones Loganberry Smilax Uranium Netsuke Naruto jutsu Chlorophyta Charles Ives Alcohol fuel Desert Social rule Pitaten Polygonum Orchidaceae Atlanta metropolitan area Aloe Alcohol Multiple chemical sensitivity Apple Taxus Tiberium Water (molecule)
