roses i purchased several rose bushes and two rose trees back in the early spring i planted them before the frost and and they were doing fine they had leaves on them and were healthy the weather started warming up and got really warm and then we had a horrible cold spell and they got bit i suppose after this they died and not even a leaf come back and the stalk has turned brown and looks dead should i return them or should i wait and see if they come up next spting from the root i thought they should have put out from the root already i hate to be out of all that money what can i do are they finished or is there hope please help the tree roses are without doubt grafted onto another rootstock i feel sure that the rose you desired is dead it's possible even likely that the rootstock rose will re emerge roses used as rootstock are strong but not usually desirable for their looks etc your other roses may well be grafted also look to see at the base if there is a bud union good sized bump on the main stem if so this is a graft and again the desired rose is undoubtedly dead and again the most likely undesirable rootstock rose may come up when you buy roses you can ask if they are grafted or grown on their own roots most are grafted i think it allows faster production of more mature roses that will give a lot of blooms and get larger within the first year or two there is nothing really wrong with this but a hard freeze may kill the desirable rose also i have read that the rose may not live past years or so own root roses may live years or more i have seen a 'lady banks' rose topple a large tree it was in a public garden and they think the rose was over years old there are sources that sell own root roses one is a catalogue called heirloom roses also a lot of shrub roses are grown on their own roots if you grow grafted roses it may be wise to mulch over the bud union during winter months also if you live in a cold area you plant them deeper so the bud union is nearer or partly in the ground your local nursery should be able to tell you tree roses require special care in areas with cold winters again the nursery selling them to you should be able to give you directions good luck and happy rose gardening Apple Grafting Rose Tobacco Bonsai Gypsy moth Leaf Olive Tea Johnny Appleseed Eucalyptus Wood Capercaillie Peach Poker jargon Apricot Guns N' Roses Wars of the Roses Citrus Gooseberry Hellebore Honey fungus Pachypodium Malus Kudzu Glastonbury Abbey Orchidaceae Cannabis cultivation Auxin W.I.T.C.H.
