want plant hibiscus in the yard can i get a start from another plant and what part and when plant it hibiscus can be propagated by cuttings that is to cut a section off the plant dip it in rooting compound and plant it in a container with good growing media i find that placing a plastic bag over the cuttings helps by adding humidity in the early stages i have included an informative link which covers propagating an hibiscus i caution you that taking cuttings from certain varieties or from a plant you don't own may be stealing it's good policy to pay breeders for their hard work and in many cases cheaper to buy the plant rather than going through the effort to baby and get the cutting to take root hope this helps and good luck Fruit tree propagation Illegal drug trade Hydroponics Grafting Herbal tea Tobacco Hibiscus Houseplant Cannabis cultivation Potato Plastic Kudzu Hop (plant) Flowering plant Jute Plant breeders' rights Weed control Explosive material Comfrey Nepenthes Hemp Photosynthesis Plant Black pepper Coffee Florida Keys Tooth Horseshoe Floppy disk Milk Basil Industrial engineering Garden Strawberry Textile manufacturing Knife Nuclear power phase-out Green Revolution Ficus elastica Wheat Casting Hawaiian hibiscus 2004 Democratic National Convention Watermelon Cocaine Dairy Ginkgo Intellectual property Great Depression New York City Subway Mushroom hunting Discus (fish) Bulk vending Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Monopoly (game) Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Bamboo Beet Laserdisc Cheese Wayne Corporation Leaf Cultivar Uranium Miami, Florida Hyperinflation Book Apple Sorghum Football (soccer) Wood Garlic Gooseberry Rigging Cycad Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Coconut Autopsy Music genre Sweatshop Desert RuneScape skills New Zealand flax Agar plate Clarinet Surveillance Sewage treatment Logging Vegetative reproduction Bong Rod Stewart Plant breeding Nuclear power Malvaceae Banana Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Handloading Carbon dioxide Phonograph cylinder Hamster
