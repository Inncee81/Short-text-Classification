i bought little mums and they are blossoming i heard that you are suppose to cut the first flowers if they are new to you this year i wouldn't worry about it many mums will bloom 'early' if they aren't pinched actually the pinching causes them to bush out and bloom later in the fall when we are accustomed to seeing them bloom you will probably have to pinch once in june and maybe a second pinch in july depending on where you live and how warm the summer is the second 'pinch' is tricky because if you pinch too late you may not get any flowers it's a trial and error sort of chore good luck Apricot Begonia Kigo 1957 World Series Flower Baseball Philosophical skepticism Rose Zucchini Social rule Almond Lou Gehrig Monofloral honey Bougainvillea Saint Patrick's Day The Comedy of Errors California Poppy Rambutan Hanami Loganberry Z-pinch EastEnders Kate Bush The Beach Boys Leopold Bloom Wisteria Vulcan nerve pinch Paul Wolfowitz About a Boy Sakura Indian Oil Cup 2005 Wonderland (McFly album) Pruning Little Britain Hippeastrum Plame affair timeline Orchidaceae Robin Ventura Cocaine Pollination Homecoming (tradition) Early Edition The Regina Monologues Ume 1986 World Series Zanpakut__ Heinkel He 100 Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 The Tale of Genji Modem Pansy Cruising (maritime) Amaranth Mitosis Mohamed Atta al-Sayed Spring (season) Hashish Apple Warren G.
