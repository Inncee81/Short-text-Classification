what is the best way to sow flowers inside so you can plant them out in the summer next year i'm planting loads of flowers i'm planting them all around my open field near the trees i'll probably be sowing about seeds indoors a lot of the seeds are annual foxglove hollyhocks columbine snapdragon balloon flowers zinnias penstemon and many more that i've forgotten which is the best and healthiest way to grow them inside i was thinking of getting these things called biodomes where it can fit seeds but i would need to many i might be getting a mini green house thing for indoors which has floresent lights and about rows of soil what is the best way any suggections or advice on any of these plants or on sowing them inside i live in ontario canada zone and i will be sowing them side anyway from janruary to april thanks d wow that's an awful lot of seeds dan first of all you are going to need a place with a bright light source that will reach all those seedlings i would guess that the mini greenhouses with florescent lights would be best but you might need more that one for seeds if you have a spare room you could set up some tables and place florescent fixtures with one cool and once warm florescent bulb in each above each table make it so the fixtures can be raised and lowered because they will need to be no more than inches above the seedlings at all times this is how i do it for my seedling but i only start a few hundred indoors anyhow you can get some seedling flats from garden centers fill with starting soil and plant away or you can get peat cells but can get pretty pricey you said that you would be starting the seeds in january but that will be too early you only need to start the seed weeks before your last frost start them any earlier then you will be looking at leggy plants that will suffer more stress when planted outside besides the older they get the harder they are to keep alive indoors well i hope this helped some good luck Carnivorous plant Apple Cannabis cultivation Flowering plant Wood Stratification (botany) Lighting Seed Plant Tobacco Pansy Flax Onion Orchidaceae Pinophyta Hippeastrum Oat Dundas Square Apricot Garden Strawberry Potato Tree Greenhouse Comfrey Carbon dioxide sink San Pedro cactus Leaf Christmas tree Solar power Agriculture Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Compact fluorescent lamp Gooseberry Irrigation Peanut Fluorescent lamp Watermelon Drooping Brome Cereal Bladderwort Banksia Hamster Ecology 2000 Australian Grand Prix Germination Pittsburgh Steelers Volleyball Begonia Okra Plough Japanese tea ceremony Ethylene Pachypodium bicolor Effects of global warming Passive solar Soil life Autonomous building Pachypodium ambongense Sugar beet Garden Cuscuta Loganberry Darwin from Orchids to Variation Giant Sequoia Alfalfa Tillandsia The Time Machine Rambutan Flower class corvette Barley Hashish Global warming and agriculture Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an K__ppen climate classification Olive Chatsworth House Zinnia Coffea arabica Garlic Opportunity rover Turnip (brassica rapa) Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew Cannabis (drug)
