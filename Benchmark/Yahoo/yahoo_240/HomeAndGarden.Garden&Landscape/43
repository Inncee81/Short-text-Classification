what is the difference between horticulture gardening and botany i am presuming plantlife links the three but are they related disciplines where does one draw the boundary please in simple terms between them thanks horticulture is the science of growing plants in general it covers ornamental plants and also most vegetable and orchard crops it does not include the growing of grain that's agriculture one could specialize as i do in ornamental horticulture and go into landscape design and maintenance gardening isn't a science it's a pass time one can garden for pleasure or for home orcharding or vegetable gardens but it's not a profession for those people in general all outdoor plant and lawn activity is lumped into gardening botany is a science it is the study of how plants grow and live in this science you're looking more at the 'inside' of the plant whereas in horticulture you're looking more at the 'outside' of the plant i hope that this helps Horticulture Botany Gardening Organic farming Organic horticulture Biology Lawn Landscape architecture Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University Pollination Luther Burbank Agriculture Thomas Meehan Soil science History of gardening Vegetation Ecology John Lindley Hydroponics Carlton Gardens, Melbourne Watermelon Grafting Fruit tree propagation John Claudius Loudon Geography Taro Irrigation Ethnobotany Organic food Botanical garden Coachella Valley Xeriscaping Farmer Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Maize Organic gardening Tomato Oregon State University Chatsworth House Buildings of Iowa State University Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew William Guilfoyle Brooklyn Botanic Garden Domestication Orchard Shifting cultivation San Jose, California Cultivar Cannabis cultivation New York State College of Agriculture and Life Sciences Manawatu-Wanganui Weed control David Bellamy Flower Fruit Philipp Franz von Siebold Agricultural science Beatrix Farrand Clone Uppsala University Treasury Gardens, Melbourne Agriculture in Australia Food University of California, Davis Sears Holdings Corporation Carnivorous plant Biological pest control Back to the land Flowering plant Gooseberry Pollination management Aquarium Santa Rosa, California Greenhouse Solar power Herbicide Plant breeding Fitzroy Gardens, Melbourne Fern Potato Canadian National Exhibition Lighting Bean Anarcho-primitivism Persian Gardens David Douglas Binomial nomenclature Forest gardening Root Species Oklahoma City, Oklahoma Cereal Water resources Wild rice Legume Amaranth Software engineering Butchart Gardens
