gophers ahhhhh i have a home in san diego that i rent out we just put new sod down about months ago my tenants called me a month ago and said the grass feels weird like the soil is loose underneath last night they sent me pictures we are guessing it's gophers the neighbors next door have a ton of bamboo and when i was putting in the new grass the neighbor's landscaper was telling me that they were battling gophers i'm guessing they have moved to my yard i am looking for feedback on how to get rid of them inexpensively and for good i found this website that has this stuff called shake away and is apparently is fox urine granules the scares them off does anyone have experience both good and bad helps so i know what does and doesn't work thank you the only effective gopher control i've ever experienced is outdoor kitties i'm not promoting turning indoor kitties into outdoor kitties since it's a great way to get your cat killed by a coyote or run over by a car but you might have a feral cat rescue group in your area who would be willing to relocate a few cats to your property your tenants would have to be amenable to feeding them but it is absolutely worth it if you're serious about getting rid of the gophers i used to have a severe gopher problem and couldn't grow much of anything in my garden two feral kitties have taken care of the problem and now when a new gopher tries to move in it's kitty food within a day or so Cat Domestic rabbit Hubert H.
