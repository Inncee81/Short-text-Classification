question on ethnicity ok my grandparents were born and raised in cuba they came to the us pre castro and had kids born in new york my mom and my aunt then they went back to cuba where my mom and aunt were raised and then again came to the us right before castro took over my father is from nc of english and cherokee indian his grandmother was cherokeee decent so that make me white and cuban right or what am i also my husband is mexican born there and came to the states when he was we have kids a yr old son and a yr old daughter but he says they are not cuban since they are mostly mexican my kids are american by nationality but what would be their ethnicity also i am fluent in spanish i speak it write it and read it and i also love my novelas i would lean toward hispanic mostly by marriage you live in a hispanic household which is really the only difference betwween you ethnically and many whites remember white is a state of mind not a blood line so many wide ranging groups are wrapped up in the various ethnicities that few have any real meaning whites as the term is generally accepted are europeans northern southern eastern and western those of arabic descent indian hispanic with predominently european ancestry asian with predomiently european ancestry and northern african with predomently european ancestry the same ancestry that is cuban is very close to many mediteranian ethnicities southern italian and french greek and northern african minus moorish influences not many moors made it to cuba in mexico and south america they were the bulk of the spanards basically if you'd married a white guy you'd fallen into the white ethnecity unless you were a dark cuban if you'd married a native you'd been considered native most cubans are either very eurpean or very african in ancestry they could either walk around in spain or africa depending on which and appear to be local if dressed appropriately mexican is like saying american there are so many potential ancestry groups that it's meaningless as an ethnicity most mexicans are predomiently native with some european or african stock there have been waves of european imigration to mexico and americans crossing the border have produced many mexicans that look very northern european there are many mexicans also who do not have a drop of european blood in them even those of native stock those from mayan ancestors are very distinct from those of apache and navajo blood lines so when you say mexican you've only said nationality not ethnicity the other factor is that you speak spanish fluently this tends to be a hispanic trait though which dialect s cuban spanish or the tex mex spoken in northern mexico or the central american dilect or spanish like it's spoken in spain or a south american dialect these dialects have diverged to the point where they could almost be separate languages though spanish tv is beginning to draw the dialects together over recent years if your really curious you should research your geneology and see where your various ancestors came from many cubans came from other latin american nations when revolts overthrew the rule class which was generally of spanish descent and drove most of those with strong spanish descent to places like cuba and puerto rico your ancestors might be recent arrivals from another nation also possibly only a generation or two in cuba before coming to america many americans wound up in cuba over the years and so you may have more european heritage than you suspect Spanish language African American Latin American music Mexico Afro-Latin American Black (people) Race (U.S. Census) New Mexico Africa Spain German language Cherokee Spanish in the United States Mulatto Native Americans in the United States Latin America Chinese language Cuba Puerto Rico Creole Family Peru Palestinian United States Southern United States Spanish-American War Family name Ethnic groups of the Philippines New York-New Jersey English Nationalism Demographics of the Philippines South America Arabic language French people Non-native pronunciations of English Music of Puerto Rico Spanish dialects and varieties Music of Mexico Arab Afrikaans Race Hern__n Cort__s Jew Multiracial Filipino people Coloured Standard Mandarin Language family Latin alphabet European colonization of Arizona North America South Africa Native American music Telenovela Music of Spain Christopher Columbus Fidel Castro Portuguese language Europe Dominican Republic Mexican Spanish Romance languages Miami, Florida Americas Taiwanese (linguistics) Demographics of the United States Music history of the United States Florida Creole language African American Vernacular English Semitic Yucat__n John J.
