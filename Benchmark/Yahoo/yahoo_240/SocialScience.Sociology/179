what has more impact on your life you social views or your political views and why political views are a sub set of social views socialization is the process by which we are transformed from babies who can only say go go ga ga to functioning members of society therefore social views covers everything from the religion or lack thereof in which we were raised our family values our ethnic heritage our political tendencies our national identity our friendships and views on relationships our opinions on popular culture and our conformity or non conformity to norms and mores including but not limited to lifestyle education career fashion politics are just one part of the larger societal culture so in that way i suppose i would say our social views impact one's life more because they govern not only our thoughts on politics but our behavior in our lives for instance politically you may be against abortion but that doesn't necessarily mean that in a social setting you shun your friend who happened to get an abortion your political view on gun control may be that no one should have a gun but you still talk to your uncle earl who lives out in the country and hunts ducks with his shotgun your political identity and your social reality are sometimes different it's easy to speak and believe in political ideals but in our everyday lives we rarely live up to them perhaps this is because in politics many things are starkly black or white but culturally there are various shades of gray to any ideal Social psychology Gender role Sexual abstinence Culture Liberalism Abortion debate Reality Political spectrum Sociology Ideology Abortion Nationalism Nihilism Human nature Labor theory of value Human Evangelicalism Power (sociology) Human sexual behavior Homosexuality Morality Anthroposophy Value system Narcissism Pedophilia Religion and sexuality Karl Marx Autism rights movement Friedrich Nietzsche Law of value Human rights Indigenous peoples Separation of church and state Infantilism Zoophilia Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel Ethics Meaning of life Capitalism Marriage State Black (people) Slavoj __i__ek Goodness and value theory Norm (sociology) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Heteronormativity Cross-dressing Microeconomics Human sexuality Sigmund Freud Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Free market Franz Boas Torah im Derech Eretz Rudolf Steiner Voter turnout American Conservatism Noam Chomsky Feminism Social justice Modernism Cultural relativism Culture of the United States Internet troll Generation X Social movement Class in the contemporary United States Education Afrophobia Nicomachean Ethics Feminist movement Dissociative identity disorder Communitarianism Political economy Evil Max Weber Homophobia Generation Y Philosophy of language Economics Social Culture of Lithuania Multiculturalism Trade union White nationalism
