sex and human nature i've noticed in todays world sex is always reduced to basic science when it comes to sex its always nothing more but a primal need there are so much excuse for why monogamy is unrealistic and why cheating is natural in are soceity and its always jusify with human nature it kind of feels like we've alomost waved off resposiblity we fall back on the continuous crutch of human nature to make everything ok when it comes to sex has that become a cheap excuse jusification for this lazy instant gradification culture i know sex is human nature but the way we talk about it we make it sound like its outta are control and its not natural for us to control it really i pesonally hate the human nature excuse i think its weak and i think its cheap i think as people we are here for a littel bit more but have we used that as crutch to make everything ok when it comes to thing like sex are we giving up conciousness i apologize if this a confusing question i didn't get my point out properly i know okay so far most of these answers as i guessed suck a lot i guess thats all we really are man i think it has a lot to do with self control and the way our society has evolved we are much more a science based society now rather than a full blown religious society in my opinion we lose a lot of our values and morals when this happens also when the opprotunity presents its self people dont have the self control to say stop expecially for men and really think about what they are doing i do think it is a very weak excuse to say something like oh i'm sorry but it was just my primal instincts i wasnt thinking because we as humans have the power to stop and think and contemplate our actions we are able to see the possible results of things before they happen this is why we dont have liver and onion flavored ice cream we dont need to try it we know its gonna taste like shi t and to use this primal instinct nonsense as an excuse for cheating or anything else you can think of is really an insult to our very being so i dont really have an answer to your question other then times are changing and our actions are evolving with them whether it be for better or worse who is really to say Theory of conduct The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Human Altruism God Emperor of Dune Sexual orientation Human nature Free will Meaning of life Abortion debate Social rule Human sexual behavior The nature of God in Western theology Taoism Atheism Existence of God Ecco the Dolphin Sex Pistols Amiga Power Ethics Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Supernatural Punk ideology Culture Cultural relativism Anthroposophy Atomism Religion and sexuality Agnosticism Sampling (music) Religion George Costanza Charles Darwin's views on religion Objectivist philosophy Jean Grey Utilitarianism Hip hop rivalries Creationism Simone Weil Major League Baseball television contracts Homophobia Have I Got News For You David Hume Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Birth control Rudolf Hermann Lotze Rick Santorum Oral sex The Subtle Knife Polyamory Zerg Microeconomics Theodicy Augustus De Morgan Heterosexuality Moral objectivism Shaggy dog story The Marshall Mathers LP Intelligent design N.W.A Science The X-Files (season 1) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sento Cheating in Counter-Strike Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Gender-neutral language Strap-on dildo Friedrich Schleiermacher I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Dog Determinism Nicomachean Ethics Homosexuality and Christianity Sex education K' War Quantum mechanics Jean-Jacques Rousseau Goldstein's book Philosophy Sexual revolution Meme Transcendental argument for the existence of God Socrates Unreal Monogamy Deconstruction American Psycho 2002 Gujarat violence Stomach cancer
