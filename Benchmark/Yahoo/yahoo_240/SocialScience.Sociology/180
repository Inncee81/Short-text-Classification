does aknowleging racism magnify the idea that everyone should be looked at differently i think that when we have racism awareness it just angers minorities and causes reverse racism everyone wants a scapegoat to blame their everyday inconveniences on hell i do i have personally felt the wrath of reverse racism because of people who are mad at light skinned people for being in a culturally benefited standpoint i think that people are people period who agrees i think that you bring up a great and valid point as long as we're looking for racism we're going to find it thus encouraging others to commit acts of racism if there was no plaplicity geared toward racism i think it would fade away because people would eventually lose sight of the concept everything that makes up our culture is there because we have made it the forefront i think racism exists because people need reason to hate someone for instance as a no talent at basketball white boy i might be playing a basketball game with several african americans if i am beaten horribly instead of rationalizing hey maybe they've worked hard to get where they are maybe they've been playing since they were which would justify their talents but instead because i think of us as being equal i have to come up with a reason for them being better other then their personal work and achievement therefore i might rationalize that hey they're better because they are black so i guess it's hard to say whether it's because of society or because of our own drive to try and keep things equal that when someone is better at something we are left with only the physical aspects race gender body type to rationale why they are better what do you guys think Racism Affirmative action Black (people) Patriotism American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Religion Infantilism Sexual orientation Social justice Homophobia Racial segregation Rastafari movement Sociobiology Theory of conduct A Course In Miracles Liberalism Goodness and value theory Nationalism Civil rights Human Afrocentrism Gender Multiculturalism Evil Race and intelligence Philosophy of science Modernism Homosexuality Nadir of American race relations Ethnic issues in Japan Scientific racism Reparations for slavery Franz Boas Gender-neutral language Democracy Postmodernism Racism in the United States White nationalism Abortion debate Universal pragmatics Autism Objectivist philosophy Nazism New anti-Semitism Anti-Semitism Race Falsifiability Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Hate speech Black nationalism Speciesism Equal Protection Clause Mahatma Gandhi White (people) Nigger Aesthetic Realism History of science Carl Jung Rape Peter Singer Gender role Sociocultural evolution Friedrich Schleiermacher Transactional analysis God Blacks and Mormonism Utilitarianism Simone Weil Moral objectivism Pedophilia Supernatural Meme Ghost Value system Race of Jesus Anti-Zionism Social psychology Transsexuality Freemasonry Deconstruction The nature of God in Western theology Criticism of libertarianism Scientific method Islam as a political movement The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Property (ownership right) Political philosophy Age of Enlightenment Causality Discrimination Homosexuality and Christianity Pacifism
