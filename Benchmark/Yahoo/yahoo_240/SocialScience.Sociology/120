theoretically if someone started to create a cyborg in their garage what resources could be available like theoretically if someone started working on a cyborg on the basic components of a cyborg in their home and did not live near a university what could they do to improve and develop it better websites links on electronic circuitry robotics history resources universities that specialize in this models and studies done etc you cannot create a cyborg from basic home components if you had access to highly advanced materials and components but not the knowledge i would say look at everything you can possibly find involving electronic circuitry Computer CPU design Cyborg Product Lifecycle Management Transhumanism Enterprise content management Physics Open access Computer science Cryptanalysis Person Computer-aided design Cybernetics Dynamic random access memory Outpost 2 Librarian Transformer Robot Artificial consciousness Electrical engineering Acorn Computers Android Sociocultural evolution Operational amplifier Integrated circuit Transistor Visual Basic Sound recording Electrical network Mind transfer History of science Windows 2000 Management information system Bionics Grid computing Scheme programming language Psychology Synthesizer Solar cell Electronics Digital circuit Cognitive science Economics Medical school Chemistry Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution Linguistics Electronic commerce MDAC 2Step Scientific revolution Welding Literacy Hearing aid Stars!
