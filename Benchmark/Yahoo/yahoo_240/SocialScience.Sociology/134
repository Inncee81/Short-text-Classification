what are some popular philosophies other than philosophical buddism i know of some such as nihilism and paeganism but i was wondering what other types of spirituality are popular some of my favorite philosophies are those of existentialism and philosophical tao though these have some ideas contradicting one another they all make very good points soren kierkegaard's existentialism states that every man will inevitably fall into a state of malaise but through repetition of the best past experiences and putting yourelf in new situations then you may make your life a truly free experience the philosophy of tao can truly be summed up by the tao te ching of lao tzu one must never do anything for only when nothing is done is nothing left undone tao may be compared rather closely to buddhism but they are actually quite different but read the tao te ching the sickness unto death either or and repetition for a background on both of these Taoism Tao Te Ching Philosophy Existentialism Laozi S__ren Kierkegaard I Ching Buddhism Thelema Determinism Metaphysics Atheism Martin Heidegger Goodness and value theory Eastern philosophy Postmodernism Anarchism and religion Tao Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel Leo Strauss Existence Moral objectivism Ken Wilber Alan Watts Essence Philosophy of science Modernism Deconstruction Reality Reincarnation Culture of China Sri Aurobindo Mantra Koan History of literature Free will Simone Weil Falsifiability Nihilism Jean-Paul Sartre Karl Jaspers Wu wei I-Kuan Tao Predestination Tai Chi Chuan Confucius Chinese classic texts Religion Continental philosophy Friedrich Nietzsche Force (Star Wars) Spiritual evolution Samael Aun Weor Libertarianism Karl Marx Neo-Confucianism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Lev Shestov Soul Causality Thomas Carlyle Origin belief Negative theology Zhuangzi Laws of Form Jewish philosophy Philosophy of language David Hume Socrates Fernando Pessoa Reinhold Niebuhr Advaita Vedanta The nature of God in Western theology John Cage Jiddu Krishnamurti Immanuel Kant Cultural relativism Theology Epistemology Altruism Paul Tillich History of philosophy Marxism Meditation History of Western philosophy Dialectic Arthur Schopenhauer Supernatural Consciousness A Course In Miracles Chinese philosophy Swami Vivekananda Syed Muhammad Naquib al-Attas Philosophical skepticism Philosophy of history Wang Tao 6th century BC Sant Mat Yin and yang
