people so harsh on yahoo you ever ask a question on here you thought was innocent not trying to be offensive or rude you made sure you looked it over well enough written it the best you could coherent as much as possible but some how some way all the answers you get are just unwarranted you get assaulted and made fun of and your kind of left thinking what did i say and you know its not you its you them but you still feel like a fool anybody i understand you completely but don't feel like a fool there are good people on yahoo answers who have good intentions and actually want to help people so if you don't get an answer you're looking for post the question again i figure that once school starts it will be safer to ask serious questions throughout the day and late night unfortunately a troll comes in many ages so even though they verbally assault you they still are nothing more than a troll trolls used to royally piss me off but then i got to thinking and realized how pathetic their lifes must be in order for them to sit on a computer all day insulting anyone they come across i mean i can only imagine that they really live happy full lives with their butt glued to their computer chair personally they don't bother me but make me laugh anymore we are all witnessing creativity at it's worst and what makes it funny is they actually think they're witty imagine if these losers put this much effort into their lifes but really you can't let these idiots bother you as that is their mission pay them no attention and don't feed into them as this question somewhat does expect to receive opinions froms trolls and it won't bother you as much i will tell you that as a women i have no other choice than to ignore loud mouthed fools as they are everywhere i literally dressed like a bum to my sisters birthday party because she was having it at a bar i'm not a bar type of person i dressed this way in hopes of avoiding getting hit on my husband laughed at me as i was walking out the door because i was wearing two different colored socks with sandels and my compfy sweat pants we thought they'd be a good deterant lol they weren't my sister got a good laugh though but my point is that women throughout their lifes have been and will be embarrassed by men through cat calling some women have been called every name in the book by men because they aren't appreciative of the attention they received yet amazingly we still see woman living their lives regardless of the fools around them well yahoo answers is no different keep posting your questions there are good people out there Internet troll Social rule Shaggy dog story Have I Got News For You Joke Beavis and Butt-head Dilbert Mojave people Milton H.
