why do old cartridges need to be blown into to work i know that this is a common problem with the old nes cartridges but now i'm concerned since it's now happening to my sega genesis and n cartridges as well how does this happen and why do i have to do this thanks your answers are always appreciated well have you ever hear the term oxidized metal oxidizing is the process that leads to rusting in metals too much raw oxygen comes in contact with the metal usually via some form of unneeded moisture in this case blowing on the cartridges in order to get them to work is a temporary fix that does more harm than good the electric current surging through the contacts of the cartridge is temporarily enhanced by the moisture caused by blowing into the cartridge depositing minimal amounts of saliva onto the contacts your game machine should be able to run off of this temporary boost for one good gaming session as long as you don't remove the cartridge however it is much more advised to clean your cartridges regularly with a mildly diluted alcohol which will evaporate into the air very quickly giving you the same effect while causing much less damage doing this will not fix any damage already occurred it will prevent you fom doing further harm though i hope this was of some help to you Explosive material Corrosion Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Sulfur Vacuum tube Haloalkane Internal ballistics Tin E85 Hydrogen peroxide Welding Cartridge (firearms) Sulfuric acid Rifle Nuclear weapon design Ozone depletion Terminal ballistics Fire fighting Sega Saturn Mercury (element) Gasoline Motor oil Carburetor Ozone hole Central processing unit Redox Sonic the Hedgehog (16-bit) Firearm Solar cell Stopping power Ceramics Battery (electricity) Silver Spark plug Dairy Gas metal arc welding Hydrochloric acid Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Dry cleaning Eutrophication Tooth Soldering Methamphetamine Nuclear explosion Atari 8-bit family Air pollution Floppy disk Bubble Bobble Breathing gas Water Tattoo Energy development Enzyme Water purification M16 (rifle) Handloading Brazing Motorcycle Diode Drowning Uranium Water (molecule) Nintendo M60 machine gun Fire extinguisher Sega Master System Sega Nintendo DS Ozone layer Ultraviolet Fossil fuel power plant Ion implantation GunBound Weathering Turbocharger Nuclear fuel cycle Nutrition Rust Perfume Hard disk Steel Rebreather Cocaine Hypoglycemia Arc welding Silicon Hydrogen Video game crash of 1983
