how do you catch a porygon in pokemon pearl someone said it was in the trophy garden and ive been in there for like an hour using the poke radar go to the pokemon mansion not the haunted one and go to the room on right talk to the owner of the mansion and he should tell you whats in it i suggest you save your game right before you talk to him it took me a while but i finally got him to say that porygon were in his garden once that happens go to the garden and continue using the pokeradar i always chose the grass spots that twinkled more than the normal spots though i cant exactly remember but both times when i saw a porygon i think it was without using the radar i had used the radar for a long time too and decided just to walk around also i suggest unless you have a pokemon thats lower level you should get tons of ultraballs i know this sounds stupid but i threw like some ultraballs at it the first time and never caught it without weakening it well good luck Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Fullmetal Alchemist Federal Marriage Amendment Other characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Homunculi of Fullmetal Alchemist Boolean satisfiability problem Scarlet Witch Nintendo Charmed Seiken Densetsu 3 X-Play Eskrima Craps Characters in the Smurfs Roger Ebert's most hated films Alchemy Phoebe Halliwell Paige Matthews IP (complexity) Leo Wyatt Virtual memory Fullmetal Alchemist and the Broken Angel NX bit State Military characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Resident Evil 2 Resident Evil Hansel und Gretel Square Enix Ragnarok The Animation Alignment (role-playing games) Mad scientist Northern Lights (novel) House of M EMule Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Willow Rosenberg G__del's incompleteness theorem Ultima VII Characters of Fullmetal Alchemist video games Ewoks: The Battle for Endor Winx Club Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Ouroboros Immortality Same-sex marriage in the United States Resident Evil (video game) Adult Swim Dark Phoenix Saga Jade Emperor Lupin III Incarnations of Immortality Naruto kekkei genkai Shit Narnia VIZ Media Evil eye Shinji Mikami Theodicy W.I.T.C.H.
