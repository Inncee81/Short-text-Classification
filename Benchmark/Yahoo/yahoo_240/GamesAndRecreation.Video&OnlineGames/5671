how do i play regualr xbox games on my xbox is there a way to do it without using xbox live i own a ps so i am not a great xbox fan but the xbox should be backwards compatible but if it is true that you have to download them from xbox live and so pay for them again i would seriously consider trading in the xbox and upgrading to a ps of course you won't be able to play xbox games on the ps its good but not that good the ps is such a better console in so many ways backwards compatability being just one of the advantages as for online services free and we have 'home' coming in the fall don't know what home' is check it out on youtube Pok__mon Emerald Battle Frontier Pok__mon Trading Card Game Pok__mon Hoenn Pok__mon Ruby and Sapphire Charizard Pok__mon Abilities Pok__mon (video games) Pok__mon XD: Gale of Darkness Missingno.
