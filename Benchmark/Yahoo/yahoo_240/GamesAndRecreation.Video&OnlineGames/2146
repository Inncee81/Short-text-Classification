why does counterstrike lag horribly why does counter strike or condition zero lag so horribly on my computer i have a dell e something with intel centrino core duo ghz gigs of ram a intel r g express video card and an average of about kb s download speed on good servers it's odd because even the first page that pops up after you launch counterstrike lags and it's also odd because my old ibm laptop with ghz mb of ram and kb s could run counter strike comfortably uh if youre playing on a laptop some of em arent ment for gameplaying the main reason i can think of for lag is if your downloading a large file somewhere else or maybe you have to much memory filled on it is there someone else on the internet on a different computer that might do it too Pok__mon (video games) Pok__mon Crystal Pok__mon (anime) Pok__mon Emerald Celebi Team Rocket Pok__mon FireRed and LeafGreen Pok__mon Yellow Mew (Pok__mon) Missingno.
