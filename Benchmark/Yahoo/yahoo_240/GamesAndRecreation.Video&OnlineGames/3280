plz rate my team i just started and im on the rd gym staravia lvl wing attack quick attack growl tackle monferno lvl flame wheel grass knot feint and cut shieldon stealth rock metal sound take down and iron defense geodude lvl rollout rock polish magnitude and rock smash kadabra newly caught lvl confusion teleport kinesis and disable plz tell me what moves to take out and what moves to put in what pokemon to trade for and catch by the way my name is edward and friend code is im looking for elekid and magby too you'll be wanting a water type in the near future perhaps you could train a magikarp into a gyarados staravia is a good choice especially when you start out with it i made the mistake of not having a flying pokemon from the start and had to scramble to train a murkrow before the elite geodude is fantastic in the beginning because of all the normal and flying types but in the long run it isn't fantastic my golem has been at level since i brought it to the elite the first time around and needless to say he's been replaced also geodude's moves will slowly begin to be terrible he'll gain earthquake but that's it shieldon is an interesting choice and i like it he can what geodude can and probably better the only thing is there's a chance you'll want to replace him once you catch palkia dialga kadabra is really good but needs more training and teach it psychic as soon as you can that move will help you a lot monferno is at a good level however be wary that cut is an hm and can't be deleted if you want to add in flamethrower or any other sweet move i made it through the game with using cut at the bare minimum you don't have to delete it now but keep it in mind so overall great team and unfortunately i don't have wifi so i can't trade you anything good luck Mercury Atlas 6 Extraterrestrial hypothesis Animal Crossing: Wild World UFO (TV series) Minor characters in Morrowind Piccolo Junior Saga Animal Crossing Super Mario Bros.
