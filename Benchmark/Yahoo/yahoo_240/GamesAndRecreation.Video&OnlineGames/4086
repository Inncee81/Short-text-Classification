on the game motas underneath you can chat how do u become a mod get a sign thing next to your name i have asked the mods in the chat thing they just said by not asking being a mod is a great responsibility a mod is basically an owner of this chat so you don't just barge in and ask to be a mod since a mod can also abuse the rights he has so basically a mod chooses you as a mod if you contribute a lot to the channel and make a good impression mods are only picked if new mods are needed so it's like a promotion in a company if the boss sees you slacking around and abusing other colleagues you will not get a promotion however if you do more than you are needed to do for your job the boss could consider a promotion the same is true for a mod in a channel if a normal user does especcially helpful things in the chat for a long time and other mods see you as a valuable addition to their mod team they choose you but you cannot ask them and hope to become a mod HyperText Transfer Protocol Uniform Resource Locator World Wide Web Representational State Transfer Wget Web server Wiki Half-Life 2 Internet JavaServer Pages GameSpot Website Web crawler Warez Mozilla Firefox Half-Life HTML element Cheating in Counter-Strike Ajax (programming) Web browser AOL Instant Messenger SAML Lotus Notes Common Unix Printing System BitTorrent Spyware Counter-Strike User agent Gmail HTML File Transfer Protocol Character encodings in HTML Opera (web browser) Internet Relay Chat Web page Unicode and HTML Apache HTTP Server Windows XP Wireless Application Protocol WorldWideWeb MIRC Virtual hosting Kazaa Slash (punctuation) Uniform Resource Identifier Hot Coffee mod Day of Defeat Google Web Accelerator WebDAV XML REALbasic Nicomachean Ethics Streaming media Star Wars: Galaxies Quake III Arena MD5 Mozilla Application Suite Proxy server CPAN JSON Phishing Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Digest access authentication Software agent Antidepressant Chess strategy and tactics The Star Wars Holiday Special REBOL GameFAQs Unreal Tournament Internet Explorer Cascading Style Sheets Bbc.co.uk First-person shooter Java virtual machine XHTML 400 (number) Xiaolin Showdown MIME Computer game bot Gnutella 500 (number) Transformers: Armada HyperCard Computer virus Hello world program Port numbers Uploading and downloading Team Fortress Classic HTTP cookie Filename extension Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol TOC protocol Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition Internet censorship in mainland China DJ Grandmaster Flash Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield Patch (computing) Netscape Navigator
