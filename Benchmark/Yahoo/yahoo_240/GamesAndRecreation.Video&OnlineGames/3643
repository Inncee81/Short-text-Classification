yet another random neopets question or two the first one of my accounts got frozen don't go chewing me out for this it was because i swore at someone on the neoboards not hacking or anything i really loved the neopets on that account though and if possible i'd like to use their names but they seem to be stuck is there any way of deleting the pets from a frozen account or putting them into the pound if not do they eventually disappear and the second question i have another account that i know the password to but because i haven't logged into it in so long it's asking me for my birthdate which apparently i lied about because it's not working is there any way of getting past this or do i just have to keep guessing sorry but you cant put them in the pound but you can un freaz your account did you know that just sign in to your account and it should say sorry it is frozen and more read it and it says how you can unfreaz it like part of it is you tell them the items you have in your account so they no its your account and anouther part it you have to email them and say why they should let your account be unfrozen i dont know about your nd question umm and why dont you just make anouther account visit me when you have an account username is xoxoxoxo send me mail too Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Diablo II Battle.net Blizzard Entertainment World of Warcraft Diablo (computer game) Internet Hellfire expansion pack Computer role-playing game Google Talk USS Diablo (SS-479) Hash table Computer and video game genres Leet Wheel of Fortune Primal Rage Windows XP Copy protection Phreaking Warcraft III Boss (video games) Public-key cryptography The Dalek Invasion of Earth GameFAQs America Online Forum moderator RuneScape cheats Big Brother (USA TV series) Machinima Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Cheating in Counter-Strike Super Nintendo Entertainment System Newbie Syphon Filter MMORPG The Shining (film) Ann Veneman Saw II Colony in Space .hack//SIGN Koei Kim Possible: So the Drama StarCraft Internet Relay Chat Something Awful Forums Apple Open Collaboration Environment Blackjack Steam (content delivery) Game programming E-mail spam Politics of the Republic of China Past teachings of Prem Rawat Blue screen of death Transmission Control Protocol Necromancy Atari 8-bit family Log Cabin Republicans The Daleks' Master Plan Spamdexing Hide and Q (TNG episode) Bad Wolf Guild Wars Windows 2000 Ty Cobb Hollywood Squares Freenet Extreme Programming Ozzy Osbourne Devil Cattle BitTorrent Password Censorship in Australia The Inside Fibonacci heap Avenue Q Theory of conduct The Battle (TNG episode) Final Fantasy Legend III Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act GNU General Public License Father's Day (Doctor Who) Action-RPG Beatmania IIDX Boom Town (Doctor Who) Sorting algorithm Brom Internet Group Management Protocol Distributed hash table Bill Cosby Contract bridge The Lesser Key of Solomon Mac OS X Alan Keyes Rush (computer gaming) RuneScape quests Counter-Strike Skype Aliens of London Damn Yankees
