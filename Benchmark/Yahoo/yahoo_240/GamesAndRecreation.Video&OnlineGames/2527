does anyone know cheats to the game redsteel for the nintendo wii if u do can i have some easy respect every time you engage in a swordfight use only the hammer or little scorpion moves these are easy to pull off and will give you respect each time they hit if your opponent is dodging these attacks which some do then hit him or her a few times with another attack to bring him or her to about half health then use the hammer or little scorpion move again the opponent might block your attack but it is very powerful and will break their sword after a few hits note this does not work for every fight for example against harry as his sword is unbreakable also it will not work if you do not have an offhand sword equipped never kill an opponent after a duel if you let them live you will get a lot of respect and they often open up secrets for you easy kills once you learn how to focus start using it right away while in combat focus as soon as you can and shoot the guns out of your opponent's hands aim inside the white box then shake the wiimote up and down to disarm them this will take them out of combat and give you about respect per enemy also if there is a leader in the room an enemy with a circle above his head disarm him immediately to make all other enemies in the room disarm giving you a large respect bonus easy focus to increase your focus quickly to disarm opponents use the uzi it fires a lot of bullets that do not do a lot of damage therefore if you are out of focus and want to disarm someone shoot them with the uzi for awhile you should get enough focus back to disarm them without killing them try doing this if a leader comes in the room and you are out of focus it makes tough rooms easier secret staff photos when you first find the geishas on the mission reiko sends you on you'll see some lockers near them if you open up the one with a darker door than the others and look on the inside you'll see some photos of the developers wearing blonde wigs bypass the exploding bunnies in the gaming district in the gaming district level as part of the game ii mission you will be forced to climb a slope with exploding bunnies raining down on you on the left side of the slope is an escalator that s moving downward and wont let you walk up however if you face the escalator and push the joy stick all the way forward then press the jump button with perfect timing as soon as your feet touch the ground jump up again you can slowly hop up the escalator thus bypassing the deadly bunnies Pok__mon Colosseum Pok__mon Ruby and Sapphire Pok__mon Crystal Mewtwo Pok__mon evolution Pok__mon (video games) Pok__mon Pok__mon Trading Card Game Missingno.
