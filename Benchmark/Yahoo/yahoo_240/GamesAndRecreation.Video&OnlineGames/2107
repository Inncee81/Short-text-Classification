ds or psp my bf can't have a cell parents won't let him and they can't afford it or email me he doesn't have internet as of now so he's looking for something how can he either text me or message me from far away some of my friends told me that a psp has something where you can message another psp or something i have a nitendo ds but it doesnt pictochat from that far away any reccommendations the person who gives alot of details may get best answer i would suggest getting the ds because now they are starting to make games with the ability to chat through headphones that only cost to dollars the only game with that ability right now is pokemon diamond and pearl but more are coming also if you want to play games when your not chatting you have a better selection of good games for the ds some of which are wifi which means you can play with your friend even though you cant talk to each other its fun i would suggest though if your friend gets a ds to get the more expensive dollar one because i have it and it has very good sound and talking to other people is a breeze hope this helped Sin City Girls Aloud Sleep Fertility awareness Maria Korp Yggdrasil Insomnia Conan the Barbarian The Amber Spyglass Crazy Horse (band) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Old Man and the Sea Eastern Illinois University Circadian rhythm George Abbott 28 Days Later Teen Girl Squad Famous last words Jacob 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Delayed sleep phase syndrome Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Jet lag Odysseus The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe About a Boy Ephesian Tale Ewoks: The Battle for Endor The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Lycanthropy Mafia (game) Gambling Father's Day (Doctor Who) Horus Daylight saving time Martin of Tours Charles Graner The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask Agatha Christie Legend of Zelda series songs Iditarod The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess Adult Swim What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?
