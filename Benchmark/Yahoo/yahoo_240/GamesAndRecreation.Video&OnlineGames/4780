guild wars which guild wars game should i get prophecies or nightfall well many will tell you to start with prophecies and then move up but i actually really don't completely agree with that one reason is that guild wars currently has installations soon with a th and unless u are a hardcore gamer will cost you alot of time to play all of them not including the money required to buy them you also have to consider the fact that less and less players play the older version prophecies and the new one nightfall but other than that here are the advantages of each of the trilogy prophecies has the longest campaign don't have to buy skills you learn over the course of the game great influence on player with player cooperation great farming areas farming is when people hunt monsters for items or cash factions the least number of missions but with alot of non primary missions a big emphasis on pvp player vs player the least game with good farming area's you get the new assassin and ritualist professions nightfall decent missions less than prophecies but more that facdtions you get a type of henchmen called heroes unique to this trilogy thus having a less reliance on player with player cooperation you get the dervish and paragon both great professions better than assassin and ritualist in my opinion all have there own special skills all share certain core skills so it's your chioce if i were you though personally i would get nightfall good luck and happy playing if u got questions message me warrior anjian wy or holy humann Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Grand Theft Auto (series) Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories Grand Theft Auto III Claude Speed Hot Coffee mod Grand Theft Auto Advance Rockstar North Video game controversy Liberty City (fictional) Take Two Interactive PlayStation 2 Xbox Grand Theft Auto 2 Helicopter Jack Thompson Grand Theft Auto: Vice City soundtrack Lazlow Postal__ San Andreas (state) Model aircraft Rockstar Games DRIV3R Fixed-wing aircraft Entertainment Software Rating Board September 11, 2001 attacks timeline for the day of the attacks Airshow Aircraft Radio controlled airplane Pilot certification in the United States Ace Combat 5 Pan American World Airways 1992 Los Angeles riots Abandonware Air Force One Airport (film) Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks All Nippon Airways Computer and video games that have been considered the greatest ever SR-71 Blackbird PlayStation Portable Expansion pack Airport Airplane II: The Sequel San Andreas, California Ace Combat 04 H-3 Sea King Russian airplane bombings of August 2004 Autogyro Hughes Aircraft Manfred von Richthofen Barnstorming Air New Zealand Strategic bombing United Airlines USS Boxer (CV-21) Renault Pakistan International Airlines Israeli Air Force Auric Goldfinger Miles "Tails" Prower Cabin pressurization Boeing 747 Munich massacre Accidents and incidents in aviation Flying boat Braniff International Airways Wal-Mart USS Nimitz (CVN-68) Boeing Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas soundtrack Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty F-16 Fighting Falcon Spore (game) USS Sand Lance (SS-381) Ferrari Amelia Earhart David Cross Air safety Stall (flight) USS Enterprise (CVN-65) Alfa Romeo Airplane!
