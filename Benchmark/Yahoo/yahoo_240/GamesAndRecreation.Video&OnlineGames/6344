guild wars glitch in pre searing i hear you can get a superior salvage kit in pre searing do you know how yes it isn't a glitch superior salvage kits were just recently introduced into pre searing to counteract the black market salvage sellers i don't currently have a pre character so i haven't been able to confirm but i believe the kits drop only from the charr bosses north of the wall i'm not sure though if it's only the bosses or any charr north of the wall that drop them similiar to the green charr bags that were entered into the game a few months ago years ago there was a glitch in the game for about days you could warp to your guild hall from pre searing grab stuff from storage and come back it was quickly found and patched by a net but it still left a lot of contraband items in pre and the owners of those items could charge a lot of cash for their use Warez Mandriva Linux Linux distribution BitTorrent RAR Ragnarok Online Stardock Windows Vista MAME Mozilla Firefox Windows XP PHP Object Desktop World of Warcraft Steam (content delivery) Linux The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Online music store Copy protection Microsoft .NET QuickTime PNG Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire Interactive fiction Ultima IV Wine (software) RuneScape quests Macromedia Flash OpenDocument Mac OS X Ultima IX Age of Empires III GNOME Peer-to-peer Chess Bluetooth PlayStation Portable Perl MSN Messenger ITunes Opera (web browser) You Don't Know Jack OpenOffice.org Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Minesweeper (computer game) Age of Mythology: The Titans Windows 2000 Middle-earth Kazaa Microsoft Windows Spyware AOL Instant Messenger File sharing LimeWire PLATO Infocom System 7 (Macintosh) Ebook Fire Emblem ZIP (file format) GNU General Public License Marathon (computer game) Space Quest Azureus Knoppix Windows 3.x Super Nintendo Entertainment System The Lord of the Rings Ultima Copyleft Doom WAD Warcraft III Game show Titan (mythology) Final Fantasy Homestar Runner Colossal Cave Adventure King's Quest I: Quest for the Crown Doom 3 GIF EverQuest Flashback: The Quest for Identity World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade Microsoft Office Comparison of file systems Web crawler Scrabble File format Neverwinter Nights Xbox Sierra Entertainment Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Resident Evil (video game) Half-Life 2 America's Army Filename extension Podcasting Portable Document Format Wargaming Musical Instrument Digital Interface
