i'm trying to come up with a very good pokemon diamond team what do you think arcanine ability intimidate trait adamant atk spa moves fire blitz extremespeed thunder fang howl hippowdon ability sandstream trait adamant atk spa moves earthquake ice fang slack off fire fang crunch lucario ability steadfast trait modest spa atk moves aura sphere dragon pulse hidden power water psychic milotic ability marvel scale trait bold def atk moves surf ice beam recover hidden power ground electivire ability motor drive trait jolly spd spa moves thunder punch ice punch fire punch brick break gardevoir ability sychronize trait timid spd atk moves psychic hidden power fighting energy ball attract hypnosis thats an excellent team and your could take on just about anyone with it but i do have some recomendations you dont necessarily need to cover your pokemons weaknesses while it is handy and may save you in certain situations like arcanine with thunder fang but sometimes it makes more sense to just use another attack that complements that pokemon rather than defends it like your milotic first of all getting a hidden power with the type you want is pretty had and its also difficult getting one with high attack power i would personally replace hidden power with hypnosis confuse ray refresh safeguard for him u could hypnosis your enemy and then recover attack him but hypnosis has a tendency to miss when u really need it confuse ray is more accurate but a confused opponent may still be abl to attack you refresh would cure you of a status problem which is always handy even though his sbility promotrs him getting statused safeguard also pretty similar to refresh i wouldnt however go with mirror coat as other people like to because with his special deff so high he wont get that much damage do double back at your foe aqua ring is also a good attack and if you give him leftovers as well as aqua ring he recovers one eigth of his hp every turn which can really save you in tough situations so ill let you do whatever with milotic just a suggestion if possible i would like to see some of your pokemon with powerup moves like gardevoir calm mind would help him pwer up then next turn you can unleash havoc to your opponent otherwise your teams pretty good although i would like to know how your going to plit up their evs Photographic film ISO image Console emulator Film speed PearPC Software engineering ISO 9000 Plan 9 (operating system) Northern Lights (novel) QEMU Exposure (photography) Fan translation ISO 3166-1 Catechism Disk image ROM image Philosophy of mathematics Western philosophy Philosophy of mind Scientific method Wine (software) Floppy disk Orders of magnitude (numbers) Linux God GP32 International Socialist Organization Thesis OpenDocument ReactOS LiveCD Expert system Ontology ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 Photography Answers in Genesis International Organization for Standardization Ada programming language Xenosaga Processual archaeology Extreme Programming GNU General Public License Crossword Windows 2000 Super 8 mm film GED BASIC programming language C programming language C-41 process Jacob Neusner Labor theory of value Emulator Zohar Super Nintendo Entertainment System Porting Software testing United Kingdom The iSO News Metaphysics Turing machine Usability Psychology Consciousness Pirate decryption STS-59 The Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything Musical analysis CD-ROM C Sharp H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Philosophy of language ISO 9660 A Tale of a Tub MAME ISO/IEC 8859-1 Question Young Earth creationism Supernatural Plate tectonics ISO/IEC 8859 Pinyin Religion ISO/IEC 2022 VMware FAQ Philosophy of biology Species Questions and Answers Emulsion The Raven Apologetics ISO 4217 Indian English Irish language Historicism Universal Character Set The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Isotope Cygwin ISO/IEC 646
