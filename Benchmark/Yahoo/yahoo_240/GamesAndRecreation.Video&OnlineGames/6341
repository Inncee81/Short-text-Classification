is the real game like the demo it sounds like stupid question but what i mean is i played the game online and it went a lot quicker than the demo the builder build the first hut very quickly then went on to removing the debris by the water also all of the skills built up a lot quicker on the online version i am now playing the demo and it is taking forever the builder has only done about of the hut and it's been about minutes and it looks like he is steady working on it i don't get it but i don't want to buy the full game if it's just like this demo because it's just frustrating sitting here waiting trying to build points and get things done it would if you gave the name of the game you are asking about Kingdom Hearts Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Kingdom Hearts II Hikaru Utada Square Enix Minako Aino Marluxia Cloud Strife Sailor Moon The Lion King Final Fantasy VII Yu-Gi-Oh!
