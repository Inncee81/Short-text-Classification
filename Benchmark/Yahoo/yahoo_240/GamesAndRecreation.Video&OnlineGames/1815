how many mb gb does a game usually hold for psp memory stick i have a mb mb and gb how many games can i hold on them i was thinking of online downloading ok so how much music can i put onto my mb's mem sticks depending on game from what i've seen as low as mb to as high as gb but on average you see most game in the region of mb mb your mb and mb card would be considered useless for storing games gb can hold games if you're lucky try getting a gb or gb stick and use your current cards to store photos and music additional answers on average a song in mp format is about to mb therefore a mb should take about songs a about songs gb about songs pictures on the hand can spread over a wide range of sizes depending on the camera and resolution settings pictures can go anywhere from about kb kilobytes all the way to mb and more so if you want to store high resolution pics in your mb stick it can take up to pics if its low res of lets say kb per pic you can store about pictures on your smallest mb card bear in mind that kb pics are sharp enough for images posted on webpages and pc wallpapers Halo: Combat Evolved Cortana (Halo) Halo 2 Halo (video game series) Rampancy 343 Guilty Spark The Ark (Halo) Legacy of Kain Master Chief (Halo) Kain (Legacy of Kain) Incarnations of Immortality MJOLNIR battle armor The Covenant Angel Poul Anderson RuneScape slang and terminology Tav-Prasad Savaiye The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Theology Christian eschatology InuYasha media and release information Onimusha Charmed Sephiroth (Final Fantasy VII) Jewish Messiah Halo (megastructure) Sanskrit Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Azazel Bastard!!
