attraction to video game characters not normal i'm quite attracted to a video game character mileena of the mortal kombat series anyways i really think she's hot and i find her very very sexy however this seems to annoy other people and i'm not sure if it's orthodox and i do not have the hots for real women but i can't help it s is this a problem yes people find it odd and it kinda disturbs them i don't think it's abnormal i often find video game girls intensly sexy but that's what they're programmed to be most of the time sexy and i think the only reason you don't find real women attractive is the problem that no real woman can look like a video game woman it's simple and natural for some gamer males and of course x lesbians such as myself Bow Wow Wow Xbox Live Bow Wow Xbox 360 IGN Daddy Wouldn't Buy Me a Bow Wow Captain Marvel (DC Comics) Opie and Anthony House of the Dead III Return to Castle Wolfenstein Halo: Combat Evolved Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 2 Rare (video game company) Homer vs. Dignity Goatse.cx Crimson Skies Halo 2 Electronic Arts Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Lockdown Xbox Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield Steely Dan The Covenant Computer and video games Judge Dredd Star Wars: Republic Commando Dance Dance Revolution Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX Halo (video game series) Covenant Elite Crash Bandicoot Will Eisner Stormfront Studios Bungie Studios Psychonauts Counter-Strike TimeSplitters 2 Madden NFL Computer role-playing game Damn Small Linux Interjection Microsoft Game Studios KROQ Top 106.7 Countdown of 1982 Morning Musume Sex Pistols Celadon City Pro Evolution Soccer StarCraft: Ghost Pavement (band) FIFA Series The Killers (band) Splinter Cell Teri Garr Ubisoft Aston Villa F.C.
