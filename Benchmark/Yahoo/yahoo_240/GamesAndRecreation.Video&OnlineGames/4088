ok i need some help i dont know anything about friend codes for my ds how do i find mine plus do i get a different code for each wifi game each game has a different friendcode and different ways to find out for example in animal crossing you need to finish the errands for tom nook first and then talk to the dog on the right of the big gates in the northern area in mario kart you only need to open the correct option in the multi player menu just check the manual that came with the game to find the correct place to find your code and yes every game has its own friendcode it's generated together with your ds console so if you lend out your game or play it in a different ds the friendcode will be different Salamence Pok__mon types Pok__mon Abilities Flygon Final Fantasy Legend II RuneScape quests RuneScape weapons Power Rangers: Wild Force Wawel Locations in the Warcraft Universe Ewoks: The Battle for Endor Kyoryuu Sentai ZyuRanger Donkey Kong's Animal Buddies Mammoth Cave National Park RuneScape Mini-Games Mortal Kombat Drizzt Do'Urden Rayman Abdus Salam Chinese dragon The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time places Donkey Kong 64 Trapinch Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Sceptile Shelgon Fantasmic!
