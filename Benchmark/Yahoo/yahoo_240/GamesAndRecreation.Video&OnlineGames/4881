can i buy the game sally salon on a disc like at best buy even if its a month trial etc or is it just online thanks sally's salon appears to be just online at the moment it's new out and most casual games when they're new are first released just on the web there's quite a few sites you can download it from now and play free trials i'm guessing that you don't have a credit card though and so can't buy the game over the net so i won't suggest places where you buy online and will send you the game on a disk if sally's salon is popular there's a good chance that they will eventually release it in a box for stores like best buy so you just need to wait and hope Pok__mon XD: Gale of Darkness Pok__mon FireRed and LeafGreen Pok__mon Emerald Pok__mon Ruby and Sapphire Pok__mon (video games) Pok__mon Abilities Pok__mon Blue Saphir Pok__mon Trading Card Game Pok__mon Colosseum Battle Frontier Boss (video games) Groudon Pok__mon Stadium Mightyena Deoxys Ralts Pikachu Game Freak Pok__mon Adventures Jynx (Pok__mon) Glitch City Missingno.
