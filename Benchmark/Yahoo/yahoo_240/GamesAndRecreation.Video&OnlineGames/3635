pokemon help diamond which of da starters shud i start out wit empoleon infernape or torterra it depends on what you like empoleon what i started out with is a very good pokemon because it is a water and steel type so it has great defense when i was against the elite four my empoleon helped me alot because the elite four pokemon couldnt take down my empoleon so easily infernape is pretty good in attack and things but he can be taken out easily and is not as reliable i think torterra has really really good defense and learns stronger attacks at the end i think you sohuld start out with tortera or empoleon because they are more reliable Grand Theft Auto (series) Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Grand Theft Auto III Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Rockstar North Rockstar Games Grand Theft Auto Advance Abandonware Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories Grand Theft Auto 2 Grand Theft Auto (game) Take Two Interactive Hot Coffee mod Xbox Liberty City (fictional) Video game controversy Lazlow Claude Speed Grand Theft Auto III soundtrack Spore (game) PlayStation 2 Grand Theft Auto: Vice City soundtrack Toto (band) Game Developers Choice Awards Interactive Achievement Awards Computer and video games that have been considered the greatest ever Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas soundtrack Fall Out Boy Entertainment Software Rating Board Frame rate Scarface (1983 film) Jack Thompson Console game Censorship in Australia David Cross Electronic Arts Gouranga AFI (band) Computer and video games Postal__ 60 Minutes Ron Howard (director) You Don't Know Jack Dave Chappelle Vice City Mod (computer gaming) Insurance Rick James Wil Wheaton Expansion pack The Sims 2 Love and Theft Paul W.
