wow whats the best talent tree for druid ive got a ne druid and im just wondering whats the best and most wanted needed talent for a druid balance feral resto thanks in advance feral is really powerful for levelling especially if you put a few points into resto to round it out i'm currently running a build and can do everything from main tank to dps to heal with little more than a change of clothing for tanking we can give warriors a run for their money and unfortunately for them have an edge on paladins for tanking our cat form dps isn't quite as good as a rogue's but we're still pretty good and in either feral form leader of the pack is great for the increased crit and the healing from improved lotp rocks resto is a pretty powerful healer and their aura is handy for keeping the tanks healed takes a lot of work but one of our tree druids keeps up a pair of tanks at the same time something other classes would be hard pressed to do likewise out heal over time spells mean we can heal multiple targets at once which is handy for off healing balance can do respectable damage and everybody loves the aura but it's a real pain to find the right gear moonkins still have itemization issues but that's supposed to be getting better with the upcoming patches that said it's pretty sick to face something that can nuke yet still has over k armor overall resto seems to be the most popular since folks always want healers however we've proven ourselves very capable tanks so that should be an easy role to fill feral dps takes a little bit more convincing as does balance dps especially due to lack of really effective cc but still shouldn't be too bad Electronic commerce Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Final Fantasy XI Amazon.com Internet fraud Bulk vending MMORPG Poker jargon Dot-com IBM PC compatible Betting (poker) Neopets Virtual economy RuneScape economy Diablo II $ale of the Century Slot machine Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game Mutual fund Money Craps Auction Age of Mythology Deflation (economics) American individualist anarchism Video game crash of 1983 Surveillance MAME Philatelic investment Samurai Warriors (video game) Animal Crossing Topps MapleStory Hyperinflation Solarquest Banknote RuneScape Microeconomics E-mail spam Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Inventory Mahjong Monopoly (game) Video game publisher World of Warcraft Dynasty Warriors MoveOn Economy of Russia Extreme Programming RuneScape skills Online shop Commodity markets Supply and demand Hot Coffee mod Hard disk Live 8 The Long Tail Life insurance Gross domestic product Inflation Atari 2600 Magic: The Gathering Business-to-consumer electronic commerce 1957 World Series Capitalism Anarchism and capitalism Video game music Islamic banking Tax ROM image Koei Natural Selection (computer game) Gift economy FairTax Infocom Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones Philadelphia 76ers Star Trek Customizable Card Game Paintball Protoss Advance fee fraud Management information system Yuan Dynasty Warhammer Fantasy Keynesian economics Windows XP Confidence trick Oil-for-Food Programme EverQuest GunBound Castlevania Annuity Toyota Prius Mozilla Firefox Gameplay of StarCraft Unemployment Civilization III Warrior (wrestler) Loss leader
