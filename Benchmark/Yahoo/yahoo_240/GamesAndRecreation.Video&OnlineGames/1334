which is better playstation or xbox just curious this debate has been going on for quite a long time the ps 's graphics are just a tiny bit better than the xbox 's the xbox has much more games than the ps the xbox costs much less than the ps overall the xbox is the system that you want to have at the moment and the xbox will be on top for quite a while the xbox costs much less than the ps but it has pretty much everything a ps has the graphics are not as good yet still amazing the online gameplay has been dominating for ages on xbox live and it will keep dominating the ps has a few games out so far which are nothing compared to the games on the sony basically screwed with many people over the last year at e sony stated the price of the ps would be dropping dollars but they left out that after the gb versions were sold out the price would go back up to this was the biggest dissapointment of e tons of people saved up their money only to be dissapointed big time so basically the xbox has better games similar graphics lower price awesome live gameplay and it has the biggest releases of coming out on it grand theft auto and halo halo was promised to make more money than any game or movie release so far grand theft auto is just awesome look at the trailers and see for yourself the ps also has gta coming out on it but it doesn't have halo that basically concludes my summarization the xbox is better most people are saying its better now but in the long run ps will dominate i think that may be true but think about it after all those halts with the ps release after it finally came out after sony screwed with kids' minds and after it failed to live up to the hype think for yourself does the ps have a chance i don't think so but thats just me Xbox Grand Theft Auto III PlayStation 2 Computer and video games Grand Theft Auto: Vice City PlayStation 3 Xbox 360 Halo (video game series) Nintendo GameCube PlayStation Portable Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Nintendo Timeline of computing 1990-forward Sega Dead or Alive (video game) Halo 2 Console wars Computer role-playing game Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories Grand Theft Auto (series) Console game Video game controversy Machinima ATI Technologies Counter-Strike History of computer and video games Intellivision The Sims 2 Game programming Nintendo Revolution First-person shooter Grand Theft Auto (game) Jack Thompson Grand Theft Auto 2 Microsoft Game programmer Sega Saturn History of video games (Sixth generation era) Final Fantasy VI Action Replay Hot Coffee mod Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Lockdown Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 2 Wipeout (game) Electronic Arts Killzone Sega Dreamcast Video game music Game show Rare (video game company) Modchip NVIDIA True Crime: Streets of LA Atari 8-bit family Nintendo 64 Bungie Studios FIFA Series Bubble Bobble 24: The Game History of video games (32-bit / 64-bit era) MMORPG Doom 3 Gradius Computer and video games that have been considered the greatest ever Need for Speed Aladdin (1992 film) Game Critics Awards Claude Speed Game controller David Cross Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Lemmings (computer game) Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Resident Evil Nintendo Entertainment System Marathon (computer game) MIPS architecture Final Fantasy Origins Gran Turismo (game) Spider-Man DVD You Don't Know Jack Final Fantasy (video game) Final Fantasy IV Beatmania IIDX Sony Computer Entertainment Interactive Achievement Awards Nintendo DS Commodore 64
