on saints row the mission what goes up should u use the rpg or the ak i am confused this is the hardest mission on the game but have fun with it here is ign's guide that got me past this mission what goes up i'll be completely honest this is the hardest mission in the game bar none you will be replaying this mission at least times if this is the first time you've done it as there are tons of rpg carrying lc soldiers that need to be killed multiple lc cars doing damage to your ride dax drives like a retard in the second half of the mission usually doing more damage to the car than anything else and you have to learn how to lead a rpg shot while driving to take out a moving plane follow the blue path to the airport via the freeway and be careful any damage incurred to your ride on the freeway will worsen any chance you have to finish this mission it doesn't help that people on the freeway get into random accidents or that a cop may attempt to pull you over for speeding and when i say pull you over what i mean is he'll try to ram you off the freeway itself either way make sure you beat the clock to the blue marker and keep your car's damage to an extreme minimum after a short conversation and a quick cinema you'll be riding shotgun in dax's car use the rpg to take out any lc cars that are following you and after you burst through the gate whip out your k assault rifle and target the rpg carrying lc on the ground and on top of the building dax will veer right and then follow around the right side of the building which is where you need to pull out your rpg again as soon as you see angelo's plane shoot it if you lead it i e have the cursor to the far left of the plane so the rocket will hit it you should be able to land two solid rpg shots before dax takes you off a ramp and over onto the streets dax decides that he needs to go back into the airfield so he blows through another gate and you have another shot at hitting the plane if you miss don't worry about it pull out your k assault rifle and aim for the lc on the right side of the roof as you hit the ramp don't shoot at him but at the barrels next to him they explode if you put enough bullets into them after plowing through another fence the area you're looking at is the same spot where you killed the first lc with a rpg so if you missed the guy on the building now is the time to kill him dax will jock the car to the left and to the right of the ramp you took to get out on the streets is another lc with a rpg drop him and dax will take a sharp right onto the airfield where you have a clear shot at taking down angelo's plane with the rpg note if you do this correctly you can kill angelo after you take the first jump out into the city streets but i described the long way just in case you want to do it for cinematic flair or if you miss with the rpg a ton just don't get too frustrated playing this mission as it's just gonna take some time to get used too Team Fortress Classic Combine (Half-Life 2) Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Limit Break Syphon Filter Airport Sniper Sin City Tank Skateboarding trick Internal ballistics GunZ The Duel Shotgun Firearm Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening Rifle Rocket propelled grenade Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Doom enemies Tribes 2 Pinball Quake III Arena Halo: Combat Evolved Perfect Dark Blood (computer game) Escape from New York Counter-Strike Star Wars: Battlefront Poker jargon Bubble Bobble Volleyball Natural Selection (computer game) Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man Equine conformation Turok: Dinosaur Hunter GunBound Turok: Rage Wars Ammunition Glossary of American football Half-Life: Opposing Force Tenshinhan Columbine High School massacre Transportation of Los Angeles M16 (rifle) Fast bowling Armored Core USS Tunny (SS-282) USS Ticonderoga (CV-14) Final Fantasy XI Indianapolis 500 Unreal Saints and Soldiers Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories Aerial (dance move) Jackass: The Movie Sacrifice (computer game) Hitman (computer game) Grand Theft Auto (game) Dog agility Jet Force Gemini Billiards Wild ARMs 2 Reservoir Dogs USS Hancock (CV-19) True Crime: Streets of LA Max Payne Combat Mission (computer game series) Items in the Metroid series Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion USS Uhlmann (DD-687) Guilty Gear Professional wrestling throws Mario series enemies Carbine West Side Highway Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Beltway sniper attacks Half-Life Naruto jutsu Turok 2: Seeds of Evil Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Anchor Super Mario 64 Starsiege: Tribes Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II National Football League Lore Technology in the Stargate universe Sonic the Hedgehog 2 G-Man (Half-Life)
