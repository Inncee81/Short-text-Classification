the boolprop code for the sims just messed up my game what can i do on the options area there is no save option no neighborhood option no quit game option when i click on anything the options show up for half a second and then dissappear what can i do ok you need to manually shut down your computer by either pressing the restart button or trying to turn if off via the start menu in windows when using the boolprop code you have to remember to turn the code off as soon as your done using it or it can cause you game to do very weird things like what your experiencing ok so next time you use the code do the ctrl and shift and c and then type in boolprop testingcheatsenabled true then hit enter on your keyboard the true part in the code means the code is turned on now to turn it off ctrl and shift and c and then type in boolprop testingcheatsenabled false then hit enter on your keyboard false meaning its turned off this should stop future weird things happening because of this code Blockbuster Video PlayStation 2 Leasehold estate Rent control Nintendo Economic rent Monopoly (game) Nintendo 64 PlayStation Portable Warcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans Rental agreement Renting Chocobo Public housing Pok__mon XD: Gale of Darkness Sega Saturn Final Fantasy XI Rent (musical) Videocassette recorder Online DVD rental Movie studio Leasing Armored Core Montreal Chrono Trigger Karaoke Parasite singles Home Box Office Ubisoft Capcom Legacy of Kain Apartment Tales of Phantasia Spice Girls Intermediate consumption PlayStation 3 Cyberport Ragnarok Online The Incredibles Gentrification Game programming Montr__al Expos SNK Playmore Nintendo Entertainment System Sega Art Modell Attack of the Show!
