splinter cell double agent storyline i don't fully understand the storyline why does the nsa frame him is he really a terrorist or pretending to be one so he can get info on them how can he be a double agent with nsa and jba if nsa are the ones who put him in jail in the first place the nsa frames him so he can be put in jail and be friends with a jba member thus infiltrating the terrorist organization this way he can prevent anyone from being hurt while watching the organization and finding out where they plan to strike he's pretending to be a terrorist hence the name double agent basically you have to make decisions throughout the game to please both sides if you fail to keep the nsa bar up they'll think you changed sides if you fail to keep the jba bar up they'll find you out and kill you Pump It Up Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Dance Dance Revolution Dance Dance Revolution KONAMIX Dance Dance Revolution 3rdMIX Dance Dance Revolution 2ndMIX DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Dance Dance Revolution 4thMIX Dance Dance Revolution 5thMIX DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution 6thMIX Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Dance Dance Revolution Solo In The Groove (game) Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 2 Dance Dance Revolution (1stMIX) Dance pad DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution Game controller Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME 2 Dancing Stage Konami Code Nintendo GameCube StepMania Double Dragon Multiplayer Dance Dance Revolution: Mario Mix Bemani Beatmania IIDX Flash Flash Revolution Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Nintendo Revolution Pop'n Music Game Boy Dance With Intensity TV game Music video game Computer and video game genres Musical Instrument Digital Interface Video game music Xbox 360 Wheel of Fortune Technos Japan Corporation Analog stick Samba de Amigo Hot Dance Music/Club Play TechnoMotion History of computer and video games Console game Norway national football team Xbox Game Boy Advance Bouncy techno Nintendo Entertainment System Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Computer role-playing game Karaoke Video game console Dominoes Drum and bass Rare (video game company) Badminton Single player Hot Coffee mod Ninja Gaiden Missy Elliott Baroque chess Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Spark plug Gradius Tori Amos Nintendo DS Table tennis The Sims Computer and video games Chess Tennis Aphex Twin Role-playing game Nintendo 64 BZFlag EyeToy TurboGrafx 16 NVIDIA Naoki Maeda Donna Summer Handheld game console Red Hot Chili Peppers DrumMania Beatmania The Sims 2 Quake Duck Hunt Nightclub Regional lockout PONG Sega Dreamcast Poker jargon Basement Jaxx
