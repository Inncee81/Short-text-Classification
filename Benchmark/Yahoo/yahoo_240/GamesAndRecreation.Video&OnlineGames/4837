i'm having a problem installing the sims it's not going past i'm not receiving an error message either is it just installing slowly i made sure to clean all four disks before i installed it i'm currently on the third there were only a few scratches on the disks i tried the manual install there was an error trying to copy the third disk and i followed the directions exactly buuut it's in the process of installing now and this is the third time i've purchased this game i'm anxious to play it considering i haven't played it in a long time okay manual downloading worked and the game will start but it gets to the ea games screen and then i get an error box saying that the application has crashed scratched cd is most likely you can get round this with a manual install which involves making copies of your disks on your hard drive and installing from there i've done this and it works but you have to follow the instructions to the letter on naming subfolders etc worked for me hope it works for you question why is there a transfer or disk error during installation answer this is due to the cd rom or dvd rom speed dipping below acceptable reading levels for the install shield software to read accurately check to see if there are any scratches fingerprints or marks of any kind on the disk surface something even as small as a piece of hair or a very light scratch can cause this error if you find any fingerprints or debris try cleaning the cd or dvd with a soft cotton cloth if you do not find any scratches fingerprints or marks of any kind on your cd try renaming the installshield folder double click the my computer icon double click the c drive double click the program files folder double click the common filesfolder right click the installshield folder and select rename rename the folder as installshieldold start the installation again to reinstall the installshield components with the newest version if the above does not work try these cd dvd
