pokemon for losers i was wondering is pokemon what is the average age of a professional pokemon diamond player and is it for losers or something not for losers and it's a great alternative to the violent games that seem to dominate the market today professionals i don't think there are any since the definition of profession means you make money lol i'd say about or would be average age middle school age i guess but there are many serious players who are older even adults like me as it's a great game with a lot to do and the games are very interective so you can do stuff with other players it tends to keep some of it's fans as they get older and new games come out and since you can transfer pokemon from older games someone who played ruby in might be back to play diamond and pearl i've played all of the games except nintendo ones and plan on continuing no matter how old i get it's ageless i think i use it to teach little kids to read and use numbers and stuff but i know more than a few older players too if you're interested why not try out diamond or pearl or if you don't have a ds but a gba you can try emerald instead get it used to save some money if you'd like any questions you have can be answered here or someplace like supercheats com or serebii net so you'll have plenty of support if need be until you have it down BitTorrent Cheating in Counter-Strike Windows XP Pretty Good Privacy Craps Public-key cryptography Steam (content delivery) Mac OS X Peer-to-peer Computer security Theory of conduct 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Surveillance Ethernet Blackjack PlayStation 3 Password IBM PC compatible Skype Contract bridge Domain Name System Game programming Internet Relay Chat E-mail CPU cache MAME Social rule Internet Stopping e-mail abuse Warez Closed-circuit television Internet fraud X Window System Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Poker jargon Proxy server Data retention Debugging Transmission Control Protocol RuneScape cheats Xbox 360 Web crawler File sharing Anonymous remailer Spyware Thread (computer science) PlayStation Portable America Online Copyright infringement of software Collision detection Gambling E-mail spam Windows 2000 Musical Instrument Digital Interface Common Unix Printing System Nintendo Revolution Shaggy dog story Freenet Betting (poker) GunZ The Duel Brian Close Star Trek Customizable Card Game Minesweeper (computer game) Copy protection G-Man (Half-Life) CPU design Xbox BlackBerry Backgammon Novell NetWare Bluetooth File Transfer Protocol Java programming language MSN Messenger Jumpstart 3rd Grade Internet privacy Objective-C Game programmer Computer insecurity Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Embedded system Streaming media Datatype Secure Shell Universal Serial Bus Microsoft Quake II Usenet Voice over IP Singlish Commodore 64 Shit Computer and video games Slackware Baseball
