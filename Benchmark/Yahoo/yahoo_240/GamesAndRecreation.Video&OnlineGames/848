sims fishing i was cooking fish alot i had a ton of fish in my inventory then all of a sudden i couldn't click on the stove anymore and there was no option unnder the fridge that said stock why thankssss first of all it is possible that the stove and or the fridge had become glitched this happened quite a few times with my game try deleting the objects and replacing them it might save the problem if the glitch persists it's possible that the house itself is glitched in that case it's best to move the family to another house that resolves most of the glitches secondly perhaps you cannot stock the fridge anymore because it is already full full of fruit and vegetables have you stocked it with that lately try removing some of the products and see if that works thirdly have you downloaded anything recently into your game it is possible that there is a hack that is interfering with the game perhaps you don't even know you have it try the clean installer or some similar tool to get rid of hacks i hope some of this works for you The Sims 2 Kitchen GunZ The Duel Spyware Dungeons & Dragons: Shadow over Mystara Steam (content delivery) Diablo II Super Mario Bros. 3 Ultima Online Missingno.
