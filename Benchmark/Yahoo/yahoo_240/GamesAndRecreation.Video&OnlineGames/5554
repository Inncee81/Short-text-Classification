what exactly does stab mean well that's pretty much all of it but i'd like to know what does it do if anything same type attack bonus stab its a bonus to attack damage whenever a pokemon uses an attack of its own type so if you had a pikachu use thunderbolt it would do x the normal damage but if you had gengar use it it would only do the normal amount x the damage this gets deeper when you have dual type pokemon such as garchomp stab is one of the reasons why garchomp is such a strong pokemon in the current games with ground dragon type his two main stab moves would be earthquake and dragon claw both of which are great moves by themselves but when added with stab will tear through anything that isn't resistant to them most notably skarmory just to recap both pikachu and gengar have the same exact sp attack gengar's thunderbolt would do damage pikachu's would do damage Video game music Musical Instrument Digital Interface Chrono Symphonic Yasunori Mitsuda Chrono Trigger Nobuo Uematsu Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance Xenogears Symphonic Game Music Concert Metal Gear Solid Soundtrack World Wide Web Electronic music Uniform Resource Locator Tracker Electric guitar World of Warcraft Grateful Dead Donna Summer Sonic Youth Mozilla Firefox Apple Computer Chrono Cross Trent Reznor HyperText Transfer Protocol Motoi Sakuraba Karaoke Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty Domain Name System Boss (video games) Vocoder Chris H__lsbeck Whois Rock (music) Pat Metheny Guitar Otakon The Document of Metal Gear Solid 2 Koji Kondo OverClocked ReMix Classic rock Gothic metal Focus (album) Domain name ITunes Music Store Web server Nintendo Power Peter Gabriel Kazaa Commodore 64 Grammy Award Music of Japan Sound recording Michael Land Therion (band) Yuzo Koshiro Bj__rk MOS Technology SID Warcraft III Metal Gear (video game) Kid (Chrono Cross) 2Step Guilty Gear King Crimson Metal Gear: Ghost Babel Piano Boards of Canada Metal Gear Solid: Integral Unreleased Madonna songs Gothic rock Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater Super Nintendo Entertainment System Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes Tori Amos Solid Snake Chiptune PlayStation (original) Final Fantasy Moby Heavy metal music Metal Gear Solid: VR Missions Orchestral Game Concert Google Mozilla Application Suite Cover version Tom Waits BitTorrent Michael Andrews (musician) Tony Banks (musician) Lou Reed Progressive rock Journey (band) Gallium Kraftwerk Dru Hill Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence Boyz II Men
