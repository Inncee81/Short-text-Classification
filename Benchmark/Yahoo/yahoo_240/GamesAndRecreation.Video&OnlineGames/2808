i need to know if you think which tentacruel you prefer tentacruel special wall wrap waterfall barrier toxic tentacruel sweeper waterfall swords dance poison jab ice beam or i'd prefer tentacruel sweeper because unlike it knows waterfall swords dance poison jab and ice beam but to make it really stong replace waterfall with surf cause surf is stronger keep swords dance because it can raise the attack by points poison jab i'm not really sure about but if poison jab is a weak attack i recommend sludge bomb ice beam you could replace with blizzard although blizzard has accuracy it may miss sometimes but ice beam only has power and accuracy while blizzard may only have accuracy it has power so blizzard is a excellent attack to use tentacruel isn't that great because wrap is a weak attack replace it with psychic if it can learn it waterfall you should keep on this one because the other one knows surf keep barrier because it can raise defence or special defence i can't remember lastly keep toxic because it the poison from it will hurt the foe more and more every turn so i'd prefer sweeper because it knows great moves if you want to take my suggestions go ahead i'd rate a out of because of its not so strong moves but if you put the moves on it will be a out of gets a out of ten but put the moves on and its a out of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Hogwarts Floor Directory Hogwarts Houses Severus Snape Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Magic (Harry Potter) Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Battle of Hogwarts James and Lily Potter Magical objects in Harry Potter Minor Hufflepuffs Hogwarts subjects RuneScape quests Bristol Grammar School Columbine High School massacre Potions in Harry Potter Order of the Phoenix Hogwarts Albus Dumbledore Professor Quirrell Harry Potter: Book Seven Remus Lupin Horace Slughorn Minor Ravenclaws Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Harry Potter (character) Ministry of Magic Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film) Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game) Hermione Granger Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game) Ron Weasley Neville Longbottom Castle Wars Dates in Harry Potter Lord Voldemort Draco Malfoy The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Ordinary Wizarding Level Occlumency Ginny Weasley Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter Unbreakable Vow Legilimency Stairway Sirius Black Final Fantasy IV Peter Pettigrew Narcissa Malfoy Minerva McGonagall Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Chatsworth House Sybill Trelawney Fan fiction Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film) Minor Hogwarts teachers Death Eater The Phantom Manor Filius Flitwick Bellatrix Lestrange Canal lock New York City Subway Alan Rickman Wilton House MapleStory Password Buckingham Palace Dungeons & Dragons: Shadow over Mystara Wizard Aberforth Dumbledore Titanic (1997 film) Jumpstart 3rd Grade Diagon Alley J.
