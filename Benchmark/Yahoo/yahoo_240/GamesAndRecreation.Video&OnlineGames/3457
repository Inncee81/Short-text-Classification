im at the end of final fantasy xii and i need some help wat lvl do i have to be and wat weapons armour and spells do i need to defeat the undying vaynes final form i would recommend golden axes maximillian armor and every spell some instructions for defeating vayne are below the undying level hp weak nothing absorb nothing exp lp steal nothing recommended level recommended gambits ally any arise ally hp curaja foe status faith dispel foe status bravery dispel foe party leader's target attack i would recommend that you perform most of your attacks on him manually mainly for spells since the queue will not allow you to cure or arise while a powerful spell is being cast dispel him of his status enhancements at the start set up a protect shield via protectga right now and this will save your party a bunch run up to the boss and start to hammer away with physical attacks flares and scathes no holy he takes very minimal damage from elemental attacks which means that he will be strong versus any elemental weapon so keep that in mind the undying will start the battle most likely with divine sword which will do around damage on the target be sure to set up a curaja gambit since he can hit you from a distance with a physical attack that will take between damage per hit this is why i also recommend the protect shield his long distance attack is very sneaky since there is little animation for it this is his primary attack piercing aga is another of his attacks that will hit for damage this is a more powerful version of all the aga elemental attacks hence the name megaflare will hit all party members for around damage he will mainly use megaflare only at the beginning of this battle if at any time he starts to get the best of you within any of the below phases use a megalixir or elixir you are at the final battle and there is no reason to save anything he will use chain magick to allow him himself to cast magick even faster then set up faith afterwards dispel faith immediately if you can he will set up a magick shield making him vulnerable to all magicks right after the casting of faith cast shellga immediately after dispelling faith he will start to use ascension around this time to take off damage from all party members the undying will use dispelga to take away any status enhancements the party may have then use constant piercing aga magick he will likely use dispel again but be sure to keep shell up for his next trick he will cast enrage on himself to chain attacks greatly then will cast bravery on himself followed by a physical shield that will make him immune to physical damage set up a protect shield immediately and cast haste or hastega turn off all attacks gambits or simply turn off all gambits and cure manually he will use gigaflare sword that will hit for around a whopping damage to all party members his attacks are extremely rapid at this stage so a protect shield is mandatory hit him with a flare attack only if all party members are healed and they have a protect shield since you will not be able to heal while flare is being cast the queue will not allow it even though shock takes off less it is really the best spell to use around this time since it doesn't have a long attack animation like flare he will likely mix in another ascension attack before his physical shield wears off pound on him with more physical attacks and spells while you can once the shield wears off he will attack with his usual long distance physical attacks and use gigaflare sword eventually the undying will soon set up a perfect defense shield that will make him immune to all types of attacks both magick and physical like the battle with pandemonium from earlier you must simply wait this out while trying to survive during this stage he will perform his physical attacks big attacks and will use teraflare to cause around damage the good thing about teraflare is that it means that he is almost dead when his perfect defense fades pummel him with magick and physical attacks until he dies his defense will increase greatly like most bosses he will use dispelga constantly at this point if you set up protect and shell shields but i would advise you to keep casting them if this boss manages to beat your party badly because of low maximum hp try setting up a self bubble gambit on each character and it will make your party stand up to his attacks better bubble can be bought from the clan provisioner after the ward of justice rank is achieved you can also try equipping bubble belts SOCOM II: U.S. Navy SEALs
