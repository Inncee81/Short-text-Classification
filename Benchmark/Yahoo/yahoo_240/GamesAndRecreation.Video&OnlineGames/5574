the sims complete collection how to make friends that last and get star power friends ok ok i know i know you talk and talk and talk on the phone and invite them over for parties etc i have tons of cheats for this game i have money cheats so that my money is stuck at so i never have to work or worry about that i have a mood cheat so i never have to worry about that you save then go to cheat mode and type in move objects on and use the hand tool delete the sim and then hit the red dot and the face and she comes back these are all nice but what good does it do if you can't make any friends that stay i have talked to people till i am blue in the face and talked and talked is there a formula a cheat certain place to go am i missing something it don't seem to matter how many parties i throw how much i talk every friend i make i continue to talk to and they are no longer my friend like the next second what am i doing wrong this is driving my nuts so just a very simple answer or a cheat or a formula please or a link something i didn't buy the game my sister bought it for me she thought i would like it since i like civ and masters of orion and rollercoaster tycoon which are nothing like this however she is not all that bright and any game that has a build mode must be the same thing it was a b day present and it is something to do while the baby sleeps this is for the sims not also for pc not for console http www thesimsresource com downloads free sims objects galleryview orderbydownloads page in items this site is jam packed full of stuff for the game however since it is a collection and not one exansion after another you willl just have to try each cheat and none of the trainers will work unless specifically made for this one and yes making friends is fairly difficult in this game some of these games are made way to complicated to play without the cheats and this one with all expansions included is not an exception especially if you did not buy the game yourself i hate people who bash others for using cheats and trainers the idea is to be fun Latios Missingno.
