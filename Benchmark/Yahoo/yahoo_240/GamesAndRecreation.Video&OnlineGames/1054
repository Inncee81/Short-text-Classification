what is the event they say in serebii net to get legendaries whatever then event is it will be in japan or america so there is no point in getting excited about it the event will probably just give you a code or a device which will give you an item in the game to get the locked legendary pokemon but there is hope because if you have good enough pokemon to trade for them someone might just trade you one using the wifi friend codes anyway good luck and i hope you get some locked away legendary pokemon soon Pok__mon (video games) Pok__mon FireRed and LeafGreen Pok__mon Ruby and Sapphire Pok__mon Trading Card Game Pok__mon Emerald Missingno.
