world of warcraft transfer i'm switching to a new computer with more room i know i can just reinstall the original wow since i have the disks the problem is i downloaded burning crusade offline paying for it that way instead of buying the disks in the store would i have to redownload them onto the new computer and pay for it thank you the bad news the game cannot be transferred from one hard drive to another sadly this was put into place to prevent software piracy you will have to re install your game disks and re download the burning crusade expansion client the good news since you payed for your burning crusade once already and thus upgraded your account to a burning crusade account you will not have to pay for your expansion again best of luck and looting Warcraft III World of Warcraft Ultima Online Blizzard Entertainment Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Battle.net EverQuest Diablo (computer game) Diablo II MMORPG The Sims 2 Defense of the Ancients Illidan Stormrage StarCraft Neverwinter Nights Kel'Thuzad Warcraft II Computer role-playing game Rugby union positions Arthas Menethil Star Trek Customizable Card Game Final Fantasy XI Fast bowling Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield Early IBM disk storage Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds Eberron Asheron's Call 2 Yu-Gi-Oh!
