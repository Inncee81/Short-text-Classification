should i teach draco meteor to dragonite or salamence i mean they both have high special attack stats and evs are pretty clean but it's sort of a moveset thing and since dragonite is a little more verstile than salamence but salamence's sp atk is higher than dragonite's i donno what to do also i'm not teaching it to any legendaries because i don't want to cheat in competitions and battles the reason i don't want to teach both is because i don't want to have to wait around for both pokemon to trust me fully rather have a salamence on my team i've never been a fan of dragonite i personally see it as the worst dragon type teach it to salamence and get someone else to replace dragonite Kingdra Bagon Pok__mon Abilities Seadra Pok__mon (video games) Pok__mon types Pok__mon (anime) Pok__mon FireRed and LeafGreen Pok__mon Colosseum May (Pok__mon) Pok__mon Gold and Silver Orre Magby Pok__mon Indigo Plateau Charmander Squirtle Meganium Yu-Gi-Oh!
