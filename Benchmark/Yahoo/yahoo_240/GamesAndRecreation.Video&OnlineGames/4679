question for animal crossing wild world ds if someone moves out of your town in animal crossing can they ever come back as in like living there again there is a possibility but it would likely have to cycle through a large selection of the possible neighbors before they move back elsewise you can possibly get them back if they moved to a friend's game when you visited and you visit them again and again to get that neighbor back since one neighbor per game will move to the other game each visit that is if i visited you there would be no ifs ands or buts one of my people will move to your town and one of yours will move to mine however quite honestly does it really matter not a one of them are any more special than any of the other possible neighbors Pok__mon FireRed and LeafGreen Sevii Islands Missingno.
