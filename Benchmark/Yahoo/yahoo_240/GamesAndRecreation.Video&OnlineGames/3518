ps games going extinct is it true they are going to stop making playstation games i hear about all these really good games coming out but its either for xbox or the ps whats the deal not every can afford a xbox or ps and i really like my ps unfortunately at some point in time game developers and publishers are going to stop releasing games for our beloved ps the main reason being that they focus on next gen consoles the ps 's hardware is old by today's standards and everyone is now buying next generation consoles i e either the xbox or ps or wii games are now getting more real like and the ps 's hardware just can't handle games like gta iv or assassin's creed for example Nintendo GameCube Mario Kart: Double Dash!!
