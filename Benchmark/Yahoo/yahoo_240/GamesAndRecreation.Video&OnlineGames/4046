im thinkin of buyin an mmo but i cant seem to choose my options are between world of warcraft and guildwars can u give me in depth detail of each it would really help i've not played guildwars but my understanding of it is that ya kinda have to have a guild and an active guild at that to get anywhere or accomplish much in the game in wow a guild isn't required but does add a great social aspect to the game and allows for awesome grouping and raiding opportunities as well wow offers tradeskilling to craft items for your character as well as to sell for money solo questing options so if your buddies aren't around you can still play and enjoy plenty of game content there is a whole other aspect to the game that surrounds the auction house plenty of people play it like the stock market to make fortunes in gold and then use that gold to fund their toons Blockbuster Video Netflix Online DVD rental Computer and video games Movie Gallery Game show Renting Neopets Desert Eagle EarthBound Universal Studios Movie studio Verizon Wireless Pok__mon Snap Nintendo Let's Make a Deal Blockbusters (game show) Usher (entertainer) Xbox Live TiVo First-sale doctrine Intermediate consumption The Long Tail Modding Grand Theft Auto (series) Grand Theft Auto III Tsui Hark Film Solarquest TotalGaming.net Space Invaders E3 Woody Woodpecker Rogers Cable Inc.
