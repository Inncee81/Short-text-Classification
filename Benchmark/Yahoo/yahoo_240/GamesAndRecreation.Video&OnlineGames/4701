sim dating game what exactly is the point of those games what do you do in it i was wondering because my friend is obsessed with them but he doesn't tell me what its about for others im not talking about the sims game i mean like naruto dating sim or some other games like that well it depends on if your talking about the sims or just a sim game the sims is like a full out game with its own uniqueness you can check it out on the web it shouldnt be that hard its pretty mainstream the other sim is short for simulation which is basicly any role playing game so my guess is that your friend is obsessed with games that he plays character and the point of the game is to get dates some are just simple innocent meet a character and work on creating a relationship with that person while other versions aim more at sexual themes Gyarados Team Rocket Pok__mon Abilities Magikarp Dunsparce Pok__mon types Beldum Feebas Trapinch Pok__mon Colosseum Pok__mon Trading Card Game Golduck Pok__mon evolution Misty (Pok__mon) Celebi Sceptile Max (Pok__mon) Pok__mon Stadium Charmander Fuchsia City Bagon Pok__mon Yellow Atomic Kitten Raichu Ditto (Pok__mon) Missingno.
