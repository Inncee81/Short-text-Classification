my son wants to buy his friends xbox w games is this ok it has warranty are you talking about the x box or the x box huge difference if you're talking about the x box i wouldn't pay that much because a brand new one is only pounds for it to be it must have a lot of games and i do mean a lot not just or games but more like games if you're talking about the x box then it really depends on which version for the core i wouldn't buy it since a brand new one is only a premium isn't worth it either since a brand new one is only the elite is definitely worth it because brand new it'll cost him a lot of it has to do with how many games your son is getting and what type of games he's getting for sports games it's not worth that much because nobody wants to play with last yiear's players players move to different teams all the time the warranty isn't all that important or needed since ms has extended the warranty to years at least in the united states but i think it also extended the warranty to other countries Pok__mon Gold and Silver Zapdos Pok__mon: The Movie 2000 Pok__mon Crystal Pok__mon (anime) Pok__mon FireRed and LeafGreen Latios Legendary Pok__mon Articuno Pok__mon Red and Blue Pok__mon Ruby and Sapphire Moltres Pok__mon Emerald Latias Pok__mon (video games) Mewtwo Pok__mon Trading Card Game Pok__mon Abilities Pok__mon Pok__mon XD: Gale of Darkness Viridian City Jynx (Pok__mon) Ampharos Pok__mon Snap Pok__mon Adventures Battle Frontier Missingno.
