max super and simple repels issues in pokemon pearl ds there are some places where the max repel just doesn't work i noticed this because i was looking for shinys using the pokeradar i used the max repel in the middle of the grass when i walked in order to reset the pokeradar i've got a wild encounter i thought it was one of the patch of the pokeradar but when i continued walking i did have another wild encounter thinking about an item mistake i tried to use another repel but it said that one had been used so an item mistake is discarded i did a test using max super and simple repels and then walking around without using the pokeradar but wild encounters kept poping out does anybody know why this happens or if it is just another glitch among the many this game has max repels will only prevent certain pokemon from not attacking you i think that they will prevent any level 's or lower from attacking but don't hold me to that exact number also you can do a few things if you have sapphire or ruby you can gather ash and take it to the ash master's house he can create a flute it's either the white or black that will repel pokemon this helps there is also a hold item called the something tag you'll have to check gamefaqs to find where to get it this will prevent pokemon from appearing if it is attacked to the first pokemon in your party hope this helps getting those shinies and rare pokemon can be hell if you don't have a good repelling system Skarmory Pok__mon Abilities Blaziken Def Leppard Archery at the 2004 Summer Olympics Gengar Blissey The Winged Dragon of Ra Drill Magnemite Archery at the 2000 Summer Olympics Quicksort King of the Ring Basketball at the 1936 Summer Olympics Def Jam Fight for New York Ford Ranger EV Battery electric vehicle Tenshinhan Drill bit Tire Electric motor Hip hop collaborations Wild ARMs 2 Archery at the 1996 Summer Olympics Table tennis Chocobo Eight queens puzzle Locomotive Homer's Enemy Equine conformation Super Bowl XXVII Norway national football team R-Type Survivor Series StarrCade George Westinghouse The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Final Fantasy magic Canadian federal election, 2004 Baseball Stars Slifer the Sky Dragon Sceptile Cockfight Piccolo Junior Saga Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories It's Walky!
