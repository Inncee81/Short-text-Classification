oblivion elder scrolls i have many expensive items and want to sell them for most money possible where can i sell them i've the pc version how much you get when you sell an item is controlled by two things how well you can haggle and what store you try to sell the item at buying and selling items is affected by your mercantile skill the higher the skill the better you haggle and the less you pay for items you buy and the more you get for items you sell it's also affected by the shopkeeper's disposition towards you if he likes you you can haggle for a higher price than if he hates you mercantile not only affects haggling but it also has other affects novices get less when they sell worn goods and can only sell certain items at certain places for example a smith won't buy potions from you when you reach apprentice the condition of the item no longer affects the price when you get to journeyman you can sell anything to any shop you'll notice that each merchant has a maximum price they'll pay for an item no matter how good your item is the shopkeeper just doesn't have but so much money to give you for that amazing sword but he's perfectly willing to charge you much more for it if you try to but it back some merchants have a shop limit as low as gold the best have a limit of gold now if your mercantile skill is high enough to be an expert you can invest in a store and they'll have more money to buy things with so you can get higher prices then you can also bargain better as your mercantile skill goes up you can haggle more to your advantage as a master of mercantile all shops have an extra gold in their shop limit for you even if you haven't invested there note that generally the shops with the higher gold limits tend to have shopkeepers that are tougher hagglers if you're trying to absolutely max out the amount of gold you can get for an item you might have to visit a few shops to figure out between your haggling ability and the shop's limits where you'll get the best deal so the answer to your question isn't a simple one if your mercantile skill is low you're kind of stuck you either hold on to the item until you're better at haggling or if you can't afford to do that you take what you can get for it now if your skill is high then it's just a matter of shopping around to find the right buyer for it Bubble Bobble Nintendo GameCube Sonic the Hedgehog (16-bit) Animal Crossing Windows 2000 Game Boy Advance Nintendo 64 Nintendo Revolution Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Atari 8-bit family Modchip Commodore 64 Nintendo 64DD High score Banjo-Kazooie Game show Nintendo Entertainment System Sega Saturn Goomba Atari 2600 Super Mario Bros.
