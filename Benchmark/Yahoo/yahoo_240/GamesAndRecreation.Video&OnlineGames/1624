can't become plantsim on sims seasons i put all of my ladybug lofts in inventory and my orchard trees went from thriving to sickly my sim was only able to spray one tree one time and all it says is no actions available if i want my sim to turn into a plantsim i have to spray my orchards times to obtain a random chance why isn't the spray interaction coming up i have since put my lofts back in the game but am thinking about removing them deleting my orchard trees planting new trees and trying again what do you think i should do i figured that the trees aren't yet infested but as i mentioned before my trees are dying now i guess after you've produced mouthwatering crops it's hard to see your trees with a big red sad face lol from my experience once you spray the tree it gets rid of the pests so you have to wait a little while for them to come back before you can spray them again i actually made a huge garden of misc plants and let the pests take over so i had tons of things to spray from time to time hope this helps good luck and happy simming i think at this point i would scrap those trees and buy new ones it wouldn't hurt right i'm not sure if producing mouthwatering fruit from them first have any effect on it but it could and like i said try the huge garden thing i made it just to produce plantsims lol i never harvested anything from them at all just let the pests come and sprayed til i turned green PlayStation 3 Computer and video games Star Wars: Galaxies Computer and video game genres HyperText Transfer Protocol TurboGrafx 16 GameSpot Zerg Cross site scripting Neopets Super Mario 64 Dragon's Lair Web page Blood (computer game) Interactive movie Nintendo GameCube Video game crash of 1983 Boss (video games) Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Sega Saturn Computer role-playing game Counter-Strike Halo (video game series) JavaServer Pages First-person shooter History of computer and video games Xbox 360 World Wide Web Ren and Stimpy Ra (board game) Unreal Tournament Inflation Game Boy Quake III Arena Video game music Hiberno-English GoldenEye 007 Web crawler Golden Age of Arcade Games Spider-Man (games) Search engine optimization Nintendo Revolution Daikatana Video game controversy Shadow the Hedgehog (video game) Wiki Star Wars: Battlefront II Gameking Commodore 64 Super Robot Wars Unreal Internet Machinima GameFAQs Speedrun Jack Thompson Vectrex Half-Life 2 Warez Diablo (computer game) Anchor The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Microeconomics Half-Life HTML element Halo: Combat Evolved Gundam Console game Metroid series Eddie Guerrero Laserdisc video game Cheating in Counter-Strike Paintball Space Invaders Metroid Fusion Fantastic Four Theory of conduct Halo 2 Gradius HTML Super Bowl XXXVI Nintendo Entertainment System Intellivision Super Mario 128 The Sims 2: Nightlife Hash table Platform game America's Army Mortal Kombat Starsiege: Tribes BloodRayne CPU cache Colecovision Lemmings (computer game) Fable (video game) The Incredibles Slashdot subculture Game engine World of Warcraft Ajax (programming)
