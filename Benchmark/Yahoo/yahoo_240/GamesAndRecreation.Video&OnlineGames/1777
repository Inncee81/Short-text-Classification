how much can i get for my xbox if i sell it at gamestop i want to sell my xbox at gamestop and i was wondering how much would be a good deal for it i don't want to go in there and have them rip me off usually for games money is given depending on how much of the game they have in stock how old it is and the overall condition of the game however with consoles i believe it is different you will probably not get the original full price for the console knowing industries today you will probably only get half of the original cost of the product Action Replay Minesweeper (computer game) GunBound Mouse (computing) Intellivision Pinball Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Sega Saturn Roguelike Apple II family Missingno.
