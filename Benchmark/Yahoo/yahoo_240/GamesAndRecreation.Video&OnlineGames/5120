what did the recent upgrade on the xbox do when i signed into xbox lve i had to download this upgrade i was wondering what it did and if it was beneficial i don't think they ever update anything you really notice they just keep tweaking things here and there occasionally they do update something very noticable like integrating msn messenger into the dashboard usually it's just changing something like how you access and search for things in the marketplace or maybe even upgrade sound or video quality for certian formats of audio and or video Pok__mon FireRed and LeafGreen Pok__mon Emerald Pok__mon Red and Blue Pok__mon Gold and Silver Pok__mon Yellow Pok__mon (video games) Pok__mon Crystal Missingno.
