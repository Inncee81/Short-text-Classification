xbox or ps or wii or ps which do you like more and why i like the wii and the wii offers more fun party games it makes you feel like you really are bowling or golfing the the graphics are great and it has a lot of good games out i really enjoy the achievements because it keeps me playing a game longer until i have them all or try my best to try to get them xbox live is fun also you can get pretty much every game's demo the only problem i have with it is it breaks down easily i'm on my rd system it is really annoying to have to send it in to get it fixed the ps is good also the graphics are great the online features are not good at all i haven't had any problems from my ps yet but i've only had it about months between the and the ps its a hard decision because both are great systems some games look better on than ps and vice versa i usually wait until the reviews come out to know which system to get a game on exclusive content is available for one system and not the other Super Smash Bros.
