psp overall information can someone correct if i am wrong on the psp you can use the web for free and can connect wireless internet that is up to mile download as many free games you want for the psp you can use msn myspace yahoo and any other chat you have usb stick that will plug in the computer and the psp what is media manager for the psp and do you need it what is not that inportant with the psp would this do sony psp console with pouch mb memory stick duo battery pack headphones with remote control ac adaptor wrist strap first of all for internet u have to make sure that the wlan switch is turned on opposite side of the power button and then you go to internet and maybe just type in google com then it will give u a new screen and here u do make a new connection once you are there do scan and ur network should come up if you have a wep key just type it in and hopefully it will establish the access point and connect from here u should be able to just surf the web at a limited speed though for best results try to be as close to the router as possible internet does not require a usb wire however the usb wire is an extremely vital piece of equipment that is used on a daily basis for me for uploading videos to your psp you need to first download the video to ur computer then you need to download a software that can convert the video file to mp format i use a software called xilisoft mp converter but there is an easier software that is made by sony just for the psp i believe that u have to pay for that tho once you have the video on your computer and you have converted it to mp format you must rename the video it must look something like this m v mp in every video that you are gonna put on ur psp it has to be renamed similar to that in the sense that the m v remains the same and the digit number after is interchangeable start off witht he example i showed you and just change every digit one more for each new video so the next video would be m v mp it is case sensitive so make sure its in all caps if u have done this successfully then it is time to go to ur memory stick connect the psp to the pc via usb cable you do not add this video file to the folder video on the root of your memory stick there must be a folder called mp root just copy paste from what ive typed here for everything within that folder there must be folders mnv and anv the video file must go in mnv so to summarize this you get the video file to your computer convert to mp rename it to m v create those folders on ur memory stick and add it to mnv for uploading games its a bit complicated and i would need some backround information about your psp first to help you on that im sorry but feel free to email me by going to http campolar net tc and then to contact us if you are really interested on getting downloaded games on to your psp i got them to work on mine and now i love my psp more than anything else sorry for the inconvenience i didnt read ur question before typing all this and it seems you downloaded pspvideo i dont knw much about that but that software xilisoft mp converter i use is really good when u download it make sure u get a serial number tho please feel free to email me as i mentioned earlier by going to http campolar net tc and then to contact us if you have any questions that i didnt answer properly good luck campolar http campolar net tc Web server HyperText Transfer Protocol World Wide Web Apache HTTP Server GameFAQs Uniform Resource Locator IGN HTTP cookie Phishing Killer 7 Squid cache Ecclesiastical Latin Jack Thompson Nintendo Revolution Uniform Resource Identifier Website Super Mario 64 SAML Call of Duty Wget Opera house Delta encoding JavaServer Pages Virtual hosting Kingdom Hearts II Port numbers Extraterrestrial hypothesis WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW 2006 PlayStation 3 Domain name War GameSpot The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Domain Name System Internet Resident Evil 5 Slash (punctuation) Shadow the Hedgehog (video game) Web cache The Matrix: Path of Neo Web browser 400 (number) Session Initiation Protocol Super Mario 128 Running With Scissors, Inc.
