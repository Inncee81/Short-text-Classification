pac man donkey kong or the lesser known burgertime which do you like best and why all are great funny you should mention burgertime i just picked up one of those cool multi game handhelds called vg pocket which i highly recommend because the graphics are as good as a palm unit and they hook to a tv if needed anyway the reason i bought it is because it has burgertime on it each of the games you mentioned give you the aw i know i can do better factor which makes them so perfectly addicting these type games are so good that i really have no interest in buying a ps or any of the new systems because they are so obsessed with realism they've all but forgotten how fun the not so real games like pacman are they want to show every sweat oozing pore on a soldier's face in such intricate detail instead of creating a simple fun idea like burgertime or remember food fight anyway if you like the retro games and the simplicity of d graphics that took the video game world by storm in the beginning be sure to check out the little vg pocket units i bought my first one at bed bath and beyond of all places unfortunately these units will probably not sell well because they are packaged just like the units that preceeded them which have the terrible stamped black white graphics there is no mention on the packaging that the screen is backlit and that it is a color unit comparable to a palm or gameboy advance they should have packaged them with the try me button they are well worth the because they come with anywhere from to games in them that's less than a buck a game Super Mario World Super Mario Bros.
