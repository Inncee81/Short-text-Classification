sims help when playing sims i accidentally hit make me friends while using the boolprop cheat now everyone keeps calling me nonstop is there any way to stop this from happening thanks after a while the relationship score will drop down and they'll stop calling you when you get messages saying they thought you'd been abducted by aliens then you know they're not gonna be calling much longer the making friends cheat only works with the sims on the lot you were on when you used the cheat so unless you were on a community lot it'll not take long for your sims friends to lose interest there is another option you can click on the individual sim when they're on the active lot and select make furious with this sim it only lasts a short while but it'll cancel the friend best frend status and therefore stop them calling Roselia Pok__mon Ruby and Sapphire Stone Age Pok__mon Abilities Pok__mon Adventures Eevee Hoenn Aggron Shiny Pok__mon Metal Chao (Sonic the Hedgehog) Pok__mon Gold and Silver Opportunity rover Covenant Elite Prehistoric Europe Vileplume Missingno.
