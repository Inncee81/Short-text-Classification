halo fans i am trying to learn how to do the trick to do the high jump and the site i been going to is not working so can anyone give me a good explaining how to do it the way i know is to through a grenade on the floor and then jump right before it exploads it takes practice you need to time it so that the grenade explodes right below you at the peak of your jump it helps propel you higher into the air you might lose a little bit of life but it is worth it to find easter eggs and blah blah Halo: Combat Evolved Halo 2 Quake III Arena Marathon (computer game) Explosive material Aerial (dance move) Tank Blizzard Entertainment Sonic the Hedgehog Rocket propelled grenade Diving Iggy Pop Half-Life Sub-Zero Speedrun Team Fortress Classic First-person shooter Mario Bros.
