quick question about a xbox ok i am working on gettin and xbox almost there but i wam starting to get worried i am going to try to get live but i am confused ok at my house i have a sotry and i play games up stairs and the cpu is down stares and i use a wireless g router it has ports on the back and i wass wondering if i could plug the xbox with a cable into of the ports and play online it will be about feet of cable tho that will work fine and save you a lot of money instead of buying the wireless adapter i'd only worry about the length of wire if you're going over feet then you would need a repeater or switch to minimize collisions amplify and clean the signal PlayStation Portable Paintball Twisted Metal Electronic Arts Xbox IGN Hot Shots Golf (series) Tournament Mortal Kombat Marvel Nemesis: Rise of the Imperfects Best Friends Forever Need for Speed Handheld game console Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories Sony Computer Entertainment Franz Ferdinand (band) SpongeBob SquarePants National Football League Nintendo X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse Video game controversy Game Boy WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW 2006 Mega Man Legends Historical capital of China Universal Media Disc Amal Movement PlayStation 3 Ridge Racer WWE SmackDown!
