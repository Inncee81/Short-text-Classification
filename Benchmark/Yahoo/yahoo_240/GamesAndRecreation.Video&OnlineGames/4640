how do i get the event window on sims on the sims someone i know gets an event window that pops up when something happens and shows her a picture of what is going on i have the dvd version and i can't find it in the options how do i get it you mean the pip window picture in picture there's an option to turn it on off in game settings the little cogs icon i think however if it wasn't turned on automatically it might be because your system is only borderline able to run the game the pip window can slow things down sometimes quite dramatically i turned it off ages ago you don't miss it most of the time it only pops up to tell you the postman has come or the maid has arrived nothing interesting MSN Messenger Pok__mon Colosseum One Nite Alone...Live!
