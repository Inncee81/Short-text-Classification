what do you fear trying to get ideas for my video game what would scare the crap out of you to see in a video game some of the tried and true methods spiders the spiders in system shock always make me run like a girl while franticly shooting the floor surprise encounters think of the licker jumping through the mirror in resident evil creepy humans it's best to play on realistic themes an insane person or even better a person that slowly goes insane throughout the game usually can make you uneasy allies that you cannot trust that could turn on you at any time might help add some stress think of the crazy military guy in f e a r he was creepy as hell an unknown enemy is great if you think of the movie alien you don't see the thing until the end and that made the movie great the same applies to a game i tend to be more afraid before a monster appears as soon as it does i know i am in control if you could work out a way to keep the enemy hidden for as long as possible if implemented correctly it could ramp up the suspense exponentially oh i almost forgot a very fast monster enemy perfect to cause a surprised jump out of your seat especially when you are comfortable in your ability in the game then you see a new monster for the first time and it runs at you at lightning speed some things to stay away from the scary little girl like the ring or f e a r it was slightly creepy but all i could think about was the ring which made it less than scary because it got me thinking the whole time they could have been more original zombies they just aren't scary anymore too many weapons or too much ammo if your character is loaded with weapons and ammo there is no reason to be scared this happens in every scary game i have ever played except for penumbra as a matter of fact download the game and take heed its a free tech demo and is the scariest game i have played http frictionalgames com penumbra hope that helps Resident Evil (video game) Prank flash Blood (computer game) Marathon (computer game) The Suffering (game) Unreal Quake III Arena Resident Evil (film) Doom enemies Unreal Tournament 2004 GunZ The Duel Bubble Bobble Resident Evil 4 Combine (Half-Life 2) Doom 3 Chrono Trigger Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Boss (video games) Horror film Half-Life Doom Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Turok 2: Seeds of Evil Perfect Dark Resident Evil: Apocalypse Metroid Prime Halo: Combat Evolved Sonic the Hedgehog Alone in the Dark (series) Ranma __ characters Guilty Gear Team Fortress Classic The House of the Dead (video game) Fable (video game) Tag Link (Legend of Zelda) Doom (film) Ultimate Spider-Man Metroid Prime 2: Echoes Yu-Gi-Oh!
