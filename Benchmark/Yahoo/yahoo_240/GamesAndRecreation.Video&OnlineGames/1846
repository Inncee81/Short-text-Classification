nintendo roms and emulators i recently came across some websites where your able to download nes and snes roms and emulators this all seems way too good to be true since you can literally download every single nes or snes game on the pc for free it just seems like it wouldn't be legal or legitamate before i download any of these i'm just wondering if downloading these games is legal or what the deal is thanks i was trying to find further information on the website i went to and i didn't see anything about you needing to own the system it is illegal regardless of whether or not you own the game system or game copyrights are valid regardless of current availability of the system or game therefore copies of said game or system's software are illegal etc etc that's the word from nintendo but it's also illegal to swear in front of women and children when was the last time you saw a guy get arrested for that it seems to happen on a daily basis on television and even some police officers do it i wouldn't be too worried Missingno.
