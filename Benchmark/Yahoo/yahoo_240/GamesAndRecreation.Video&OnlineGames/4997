fan vote wow movie cgi or live action i would so rather see cgi i'm not even a wow player but i love blizzard's other games and i am so geeked to see their cgi team put together a feature length movie but maybe i'm wrong live action is cheaper but with million per month in revenue from wow alone i think blizzard can foot the production budget for a cgi flick is there anyone who would rather see live action sound off on this one if the vote is overwhelmingly for cgi i'll forward this link to blizzard plus if they did a pixar quality job warcraft could go up for the best animated feature oscar how cool would that be sure they can't take all million from one month but they don't have to i estimate about million of that is profit after mil per month in server and employee expenses so over three months they could fund a million cgi movie like nothing ever seen before and you know they'd make it back they have nine million playing the game and you know they'd all see it add in a good marketing campaign and it could be a worldwide blockbuster i'm with you cgi all the way i absolutely love to watch the intro movie that plays when you first install the game they are incredibly beautiful make a full length movie like that and i'll be first in line PlayStation Portable Electronic Arts Wipeout (game) IGN PlayStation 3 Sony Computer Entertainment Xbox Championship Manager Universal Media Disc Nintendo DS Paintball Atomic Kitten Game Boy Team 17 Console wars Homebrew (video games) The Sims 2 Best Friends Forever SpongeBob SquarePants Handheld video game Computer and video games Teen Girl Squad Ubisoft Handheld game console Computer and video game packaging Need for Speed Video game music Action Replay Website WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW 2006 The Sims Football Manager Google Video Worms (computer game) Best Buy WWE SmackDown!
