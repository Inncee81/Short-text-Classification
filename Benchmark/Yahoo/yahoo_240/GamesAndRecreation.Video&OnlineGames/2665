condemned or dead rising both these games are about right now just wondering which one i should get does condemned turn off people because random psychopaths roam buildings for no good reason believable does dead rising turn off people because of the limited save points difficulty okay first off i have never played condemned but here are some great reasons to try dead rising if you are into a game with good replay value it has it the psychos once you find out what they are doing and why they are doing it it does make alot of sense for example one his daughter is eaten alive in front of him so he snaps it has a complex storyline that changes dependent on your actions the save points issue isn't that bad cause the main save points you are always near or passing by you can choose if you want to be a good guy and rescue people or kill them dead rising has gotten more gameplay than most games i have played in the past year with exception of final fantasy cause i bore with games very easily unless there is plenty of stuff to do to keep you moving and occupied there are also separate achievements to go for which unlock all sorts of things it is impossible to get all of them in one round there are also bonus modes to play overall it is one of the best games i have played this year and i am a game junky the only one i liked more was god of war but that game is hard to beat with the graphics and action Xbox 360 PlayStation 2 Xbox PlayStation 3 Xbox Live Video game music Virtual memory Hard disk IBM PC compatible Modchip Electronic Arts ZX Spectrum Computer and video games Halo: Combat Evolved Partition (computing) Nintendo GameCube Nintendo Nintendo Revolution Windows 2000 Redundant array of independent disks Action Replay Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Floppy disk NX bit The Sims 2 DVD CPU cache History of computer and video games Atari 8-bit family Dead or Alive (video game) Sega Saturn File system Computer Backup Halo 2 ITunes PlayStation Portable Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Halo (video game series) USB flash drive Atari 2600 Sega Computer forensics Console wars Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon C programming language Linux Super Nintendo Entertainment System Flash memory Game programming NTFS Theory of conduct Pump It Up 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Amstrad CPC Game programmer TRS-80 Wheel of Fortune Password (video games) Windows XP GameFAQs E-mail Apollo Guidance Computer File Allocation Table Console game Commodore 64 Bubble Bobble Read-only memory Modem Grand Theft Auto III Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Amiga System/36 PaX Dynamic random access memory Game controller Nintendo Entertainment System Doom 3 Universal Serial Bus Link (Legend of Zelda) Non-native pronunciations of English X86 Ctrl Alt Del (webcomic) Video game console Video game controversy MP3 Need for Speed Nintendo 64 X86 assembly language Burroughs B5000 Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Surveillance Shadowrun History of Microsoft Windows Quake Enhanced remake Space Quest
