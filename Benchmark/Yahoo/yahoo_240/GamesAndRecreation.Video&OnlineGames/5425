pokemon generations its just me but i think pokemon is starting to end in a sad way since there is already a god of all pokemon yeah i dont think anyone knows but who thinks there will be a th generation guys all i am saying is is it going to end thats it i mean i love pokemon and it will be a bummer if it does finish i am only asking is who thinks that it will not end and why because i dont want it to and i want it to keep going if you noticed all the questions i answerd are about pokemon and yes i am a kid im but i am saying this because i think they are running about ideas cuz at first you dont know what a bulbasaur and charmander is then you see a chimchar being a monkey and a piplup being a penguin also since it has happened with the previos ones who thinks there will be a special version like emerald crystal and yellow i doubt it my answer doesn't based on the story but basically the business itself pokemon is one of the best sales game by nintendo and the anime itself is a form of promotion of the games that is why all of the explanation in the anime and the game is similar while people keep buying the product it doesn't seems like they are going to stop producing new pokemon George Mallory Mountaineering Mount Everest Animal Crossing Bonnie Tyler Tenzing Norgay Switzerland Die Hard Dinaric Alps Luck Whitewater Columbine High School massacre Surveillance Amish Telephone booth Rachel Corrie Prime Minister of Australia The Empty Child OutKast Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?
