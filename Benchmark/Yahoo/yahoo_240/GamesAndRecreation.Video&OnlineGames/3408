legend of zelda twilight princess bridge to castle town the one to the east is there a way to repair it oops i mean the one to the west of castle town you know the one with the goron thats like i wish someone would fix the bridge yeah that one you donate rupees over time to the malo mart in kakariko village if your at a point in the game where there is no goron asking for money inside the malo mart then you can't do it yet but basically after you donate your money the bridge will be fixed and the goron in kakariko village will then ask for rupees however you can get away with only playing two hundred if you talk to the creepy one out front if memory serves he'll then tell you to get some spring water from the roof or maybe he gives it to you i don't remember but either way you have to deliver it across the bridge while not getting killed since you can't attack and hold the water at the same time and then the donation they ask for is reduced to rupees after you've payed that a new malo mart is opened in castle town offering fair prices for all it sounds like a lot of work but it's seriously worth it to watch them dance at the grand opening hehehe Garfield Cat Hamster Catwoman American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Charles Goodyear Phoebe Buffay's songs Fancy rat Grand Forks, North Dakota London Congestion Charge Gunsmith Cats Penny Arcade (comic) Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog Neighbours Cat Stevens Nation of Islam Black cat EastEnders West Hollywood, California Sam Walton Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade Early Edition The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Bob Hope Care Bears Montgomery Burns Black Ferret Garth Brooks Cat's Cradle Blink-182 Twitch City Rochester, New York Tom and Jerry (MGM) Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina 2000 Australian Grand Prix Guinea pig Bret Hart Invader Zim Leopard Mike Myers (actor) The Cat Empire USS Sea Cat (SS-399) One-time characters from The Simpsons Azumanga Daioh The Jetsons AFI 100 Years series Oscilloscope My Parents are Aliens Anarchist symbolism Badly Drawn Kitties Transcontinental nation Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Silent Night, Deadly Night Gaia Online Legend of Mana Halloween Terri Schiavo Family Affairs IPod nano New Zealand cricket team in Zimbabwe in 2005-06 Confidence trick Watts riots 1919 World Series Socialization Theory of conduct All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship Cathode ray tube Jade Emperor Phil Hendrie Kurt Angle Dog agility Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma George Will Springfield Elementary School Maneki Neko Get Fuzzy Anton LaVey Calvin and Hobbes Koji Kondo Wormhole Philosophy of language Pitaten Walt Disney The War of the Worlds (radio) Doug Inception of Darwin's theory Stephen Hawking Domestic rabbit Animal Liberation Front Saga (band) Happy Meal Micha__lle Jean 1880-1889 Atlantic hurricane seasons Cleveland Browns Animal Crossing AFI (band) Babe Ruth Napster
