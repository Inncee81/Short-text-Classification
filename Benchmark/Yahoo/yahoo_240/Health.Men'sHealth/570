guys i got a question i want to know what guys think about lesbians bisexuals because i have had a boyfriend for two years and i am attracted to him but i am also attracted to a girl should i tell him i really want to have some sort of sexual relations with her whether he knows about it or not but i don't want to lie to him what should i do i think you should tell him that you're bi sexual if he has a problem with it then he's obviously not for you so move on however he may not want you to see her too and that is a good quality for him to have too as long as he understands you then he's a good guy if he doesn't want you seeing her at the same time then you have to make the decision him or her but don't cheat it's not worth it every think about having a threesome he might be up for that whatever you do i wish you luck and hope you make the right choice Sexual orientation Infantilism Gay Lesbian Homosexuality and Christianity Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Social rule Something Positive Homosexuality and Judaism Human sexual behavior Group sex Religion and sexual orientation Bisexuality Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Bi-curious Friends Transsexuality Choice and sexual orientation LGBT Reparative therapy Biology and sexual orientation Coming out Transgender Goodness and value theory Heterosexuality Liz Phair Swinging The Ashlee Simpson Show Homosexuality M__nage __ trois Wonderland (McFly album) The nature of God in Western theology Quicksort Transwoman Sex education Humphrey Bogart Pornographic movie Theory of conduct Will & Grace Polyamory Incarnations of Immortality The Rules of Attraction Human sexuality Gender role Stewie Griffin Queer Galactic Civilizations Ra (board game) Recurring South Park characters Gay slang Sex and the City Good Morning, Vietnam Same-sex marriage Teen Girl Squad Pedophilia Kylie Minogue Anderson Cooper Microeconomics Don't ask, don't tell Decision making Zoophilia Hey Arnold!
