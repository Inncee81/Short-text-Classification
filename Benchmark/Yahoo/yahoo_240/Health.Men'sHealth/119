help me problem going to camp im gay and i'm going to a army camp for a week its a boys one n there gonna be like boys there im gona be so embarased in showers wen i get a boner wht can i do cus i doubt i can wear swim shorts s will you be embarrassed because the other boys will think you're soft excuse the unintended pun or maybe because you're not as developed as you'd like to be or because they might discover you are gay firstly some boys and even older guys both straight and gay get an erection every time they get in the shower even at home where its private and there's nothing around to excite them sexually the warm water stimulates the blood flow in the arteries of the penis and it brings on a physiological response its not sexual just like riding a horse or taking the bus the vibration just sets them off after a while it goes away and then maybe it comes back but eventually it subsides so there is nothing to be ashamed of but if it is going to freak you out here's a few tips dont look at the other guys if you can help it think of them as stone sculptures or whatever also concentrate on something that will take your mind of it for instance try to remember the birthdates and telephone numbers of all your family breathe really deeply and slowly occasionally turn the temperature of the water down real cold leave washing your privates right to the last giving your dick a quick painful flick will usually head off an erection and bending down to wash your feet will make it less obvious some shy guys masturbate and ejaculate in the toilet cubicle beforehand that gives you around minutes or so before the next erection but its best not to grow up having to do that in the army you're taught to be a leader so why not start out being confident of who you are right from the beginning dont deliberately get a hard on because that's kind of sexual but if you do you can be sure there are at least another boys on camp who are going to struggle with the same issue possibly their whole life my friend in the military says it a pretty common thing in the showers Penis Masturbation Orgasm Strap-on dildo Oral sex Condom Toilet humour Sex and the City Nudity Sexual intercourse Shaggy dog story Erection Toilet Gay slang Prostate cancer Decompression sickness Japanese toilet Human sexual behavior 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Urinary incontinence Pornography Anal sex Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Sento Blood on the Tracks Diving Androgen insensitivity syndrome Equine conformation Human sexual response cycle Carbon dioxide Gay bathhouse Infantilism Recurring South Park characters Menstrual cup Salad Fingers Massage Gender role Drowning Eric Cartman Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Milton H.
