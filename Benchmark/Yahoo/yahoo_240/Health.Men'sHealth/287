vasectomy question in april i had a vasectomy physically everything is like it used to be except my right side testicle is still pretty tender i can't run and if i bump it just a little it hurts a very mild crotch hit pain i've called my dr and he says it's normal but most i've talked to have said they healed within a week or two anyone been thru this thanks mine was fully recovered in a week i have heard many men claim that they had some pain months later that usually means they physically exerted themselves maybe lifted something a little too soon after the surgery this is not serious but it is irritating because it takes a while to fully heal Prostate cancer Sterilization (surgical procedure) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Stomach cancer Chronic fatigue syndrome Testicle Babe Ruth Jackass: The Movie Church of Christ, Scientist Stuttering Scoliosis Penis Traumatic brain injury Testicular cancer Bruise Hypnosis Professional wrestling holds Fibromyalgia Acne Traditional Chinese medicine EastEnders Psoriasis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Castration Strap-on dildo Paget's disease of bone Appendicitis Terran (StarCraft) Professional wrestling throws Kodocha Female genital cutting Pain Iliotibial band syndrome Breastfeeding Milton H.
