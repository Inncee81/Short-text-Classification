andominal hernia and e d my husband has an abdominal hernia he says that it can possibly cause him erectile dysfunction he will have surgery for it soon im not sure if he thinks that the surgery can cause e d if there are complications so i want to know is it possible that e d can occur from complications during surgery are these surgeries generally pretty easy or difficult should we be concerned about the possibilty of ed to be honest no he hasnt been weel informed mostly b c he will be having this surgery while is he still incarcerated just as he is now he has complained about it enlarging and becoming more painful for months i finally managed to get utmb to take a look at him and they suggested surgery i will talk to a doc for more definite info but was just looking for a lil insight before i get that oppertunity i'm no doc but i think the ed could occur only if he doesn't get the hernia removed my uncle had this surgery and he was out of work for about weeks he could have went back after a week but the docs said to wait for weeks i think he was sore a few days but didn't have to much complications after the surgery my aunt said that his thingy was hiding like a turtle in a shell for a day or so lol but i guess if i were a man and had that type of surgery i would wanna hide too ppl have this surgery quiet offten so he sould be fine he would want to take it real easy for awhile as far as the ed happening from having the surgery problay not but any type of surgery always has some type of risk rather if it is a small risk or a major risk yal should question his doc about this ask him if any of his patients have ever had any probs from having the surgery what are the risk etc if this doc is a good doc then he won't mind you asking questions if he does or acts like he doesn't have time to sit and chat then find another doc who will honestly i would say that there are more risk by not having the surgery than having it tell him he'll be fine and it's ok if lil man wants to hide for a day or so lol Androgen insensitivity syndrome Intersex surgery Prostate cancer Hernia Stomach cancer Inguinal hernia Traumatic brain injury Cryptorchidism Cancer Penis Adjustable gastric band Theory of conduct Stroke Multiple sclerosis Urinary incontinence Chronic fatigue syndrome Female genital cutting Lung cancer Cephalic disorder History of intersex surgery Strap-on dildo Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Ulcerative colitis Surgery Breast implant Back to the Future timeline Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Aortic dissection Obesity Chiropractic Paget's disease of bone Hip fracture Colorectal cancer Refractive surgery Gastroesophageal reflux disease Aneurysm Acute respiratory distress syndrome Group A streptococcal infection Breastfeeding Ovarian cyst Social rule Cholecystitis Diabetic retinopathy Radiation therapy Replacement joint Crohn's disease Circumcision Days of our Lives Phimosis Hiatus hernia Abortion Sexual dysfunction Mesothelioma AIDS Herpes simplex virus Fecal incontinence The Silence of the Lambs Miscarriage Hip hop collaborations Sex reassignment surgery female-to-male I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Hannibal Lecter Soft tissue sarcoma Spider-Man 2 Esophageal cancer Organ transplant Equine conformation Bowel obstruction Cholecystectomy Dialysis Pneumonia LASIK Atrial fibrillation Migraine Back to the Future Part II Aortic aneurysm Scar Polycystic kidney disease Time Out of Mind Renal cell carcinoma Obstetrics Antidepressant Have I Got News For You Hypospadias Sigmund Freud Kodocha Osteoporosis Viterbi algorithm Foreskin Retinal detachment Malignant melanoma Oncology The nature of God in Western theology Cirrhosis Needle aspiration biopsy
