after hours of rest from my workout on my arms if they are still sore is it ok to workout or wait for it i mean workout my arms again most of the advice i have seen in other places says you should wait about hours between workouts of the same muscle groups one place even said if you are just starting a workout program wait til the soreness is gone before you work that group again they talk about dms or doms delayed onset muscle soreness thats why typically you get better results by working one group today a different group tommorrow and maybe even a rd group the following day then repeat the earlier comment about not hurting anything just not having as effective a workout was pretty sensible too an important thing to remember is that you do not build muscle during a workout you tear down muscle tissue you actually build up muscle tissue after you workout when the torn down muscles re build another reason many recommend a protein supplement immediately after a workout it helps those muscles to rebuild best advice wait hrs between workouts of the same muscle groups Weight training Bodybuilding Exercise Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Breastfeeding Prostate cancer Traumatic brain injury Group A streptococcal infection Urinary incontinence Stretching Multiple sclerosis First aid Myocardial infarction Diabetes mellitus Stomach cancer Action potential Atherosclerosis Massage Decompression sickness Folic acid Androgen insensitivity syndrome Paget's disease of bone Marathon (sport) Cancer Growth hormone Post Polio syndrome Clinical depression Scar Vitamin C Tocopherol Repetitive strain injury Battle of the Bulge Insulin Carpal tunnel syndrome Muscle Osteoarthritis Radiation therapy Growth hormone deficiency Glucocorticoid Diving Andr__s Galarraga Stopping power Sauna Terminal ballistics Running Eye Herpes simplex virus Growth hormone treatment Menstrual cup Stroke Nutrition Rocky Mountain spotted fever Overtraining Local anesthesia Inclusion body myositis Protein Duchenne muscular dystrophy Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis Narcolepsy Rigor mortis Dieting Bedsore Chronic fatigue syndrome Anabolic steroid Protein-energy malnutrition Triathlon Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Aortic dissection Fecal incontinence Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Mouth ulcer Myopia Androgen Breast cancer Gastroesophageal reflux disease Elbow bondage Glucose Tourniquet Flat feet Childbirth Dog Psoriasis Homeostasis Epilepsy Enzyme Lactic acid Poliomyelitis Hay fever Insomnia Babe Ruth Triage Diazepam Alzheimer's disease Sexual differentiation Senescence Asthma Experiment Myasthenia gravis AIDS
