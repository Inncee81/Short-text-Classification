muscles how do you work the muscles right under the pectorals the muscles under are called the pectoralis minora my latin is horrendous so the spelling is not likely right and the main muscle is the pectoralis majora the work together so you can't really target one or the other here s what i do and it has been working for me obviously a workout needs to be tailored to the individual but these exercises may help chest dumbbell incline presses pullovers and presses dumbbell bench presses narrow grip bench presses incline dumbbell flyes barbell incline presses push ups between benches cable standing incline flyes cable standing decline flyes i also do crunches per night my idea is to hit a variety of ranges and movements in order to work the muscle to the maximum i tend to use a weight i can do for reps and for reps on the last two movements apart from this i do minutes or cardio every day and stretch before and after the workout as well as frequently during stretching is very important to muscular growth because not only does it help prevent injury and alleviate recovery pain but it also stretches out the fascia tissue that surrounds the muscle and inhibits its growth when you are pumped and you stretch is when you get the best stretch of the fascia lastly rest and nutrition are every bit as important as the workout itself eating enough protein for the muscle to recover and grow as well as enough carbohydrates to replenish diminished glycogen stores in the muscles and liver is vital for repair and being ready for the next time you tax those muscles Bodybuilding Exercise Equine conformation Insulin Muscle Dieting Bench press Hypoglycemia Dumbbell Massage Glucocorticoid Carpal tunnel syndrome Myocardial infarction Protein-energy malnutrition Diabetes mellitus Breastfeeding Professional wrestling holds Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Atherosclerosis Cancer Puberty Glucose Scapula Traumatic brain injury Wound healing phases Scar Arm Glycogen storage disease type I Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Creatine Growth hormone Atkins Nutritional Approach Nutrition Powerlifting Stuttering Coronary heart disease Abdomen Swimming Action potential Diazepam Glucokinase Liver Cirrhosis Stem cell Fecal incontinence Reptile Human height Cocaine Carbohydrate Humerus Stretching Bicycle Muscular dystrophy Bruise American lobster Osteoporosis Backstroke Radiation therapy Protein Vitamin C Head Running Heart Skeletal muscle Folic acid Enzyme Tightlacing Glossary of climbing terms Duchenne muscular dystrophy Growth hormone treatment Orgasm Sternum Epilepsy Multiple sclerosis Eye Clinical depression Squat (exercise) Hip (anatomy) Osteoarthritis Sleep Stomach cancer Coffee Milton H.
