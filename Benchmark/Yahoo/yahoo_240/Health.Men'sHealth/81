private part issue when i was circumcised as a baby it seems they messed up a part on the part where the circumcision is there is still some flesh left over and it's probably a little less than a half an inch long i've had a couple times where there's been a ball of puss or something of that sort inside of it it is not hanging off or anything but it is a bit noticeable i am saving sex for marriage but i feel that when the time comes time to get married it will affect our sex and my wife will think badly of it and me is there anything a doctor can do or do you have any idea what it is thanks a very good and that is very nice to hear about saving yourself to spare any embarrassment on both parties go see your doctor you'll be much happier when you do Laura Schlessinger Marriage Female genital cutting The Merchant of Venice Religion and sexuality Theory of conduct Mary Jane Watson Circumcision Infant baptism Human sexual behavior Divorce Social rule EastEnders The Wall Child sexuality Same-sex marriage in Canada John Holmes (actor) Sharia Civil unions in the United Kingdom Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Istanbul Pogrom Leo Wyatt Penis Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Circumcision advocacy Jam (TV series) Piccolo Junior Saga Vernon Schillinger Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Little Britain 2000 Australian Grand Prix Pitaten Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Empty Child History of male circumcision History of sex Medical analysis of circumcision Le Malade imaginaire The Curse of Fenric Human sexuality Son Goku (Dragon Ball) The Shining (film) Humphrey Bogart AIDS Bioethics of neonatal circumcision R.
