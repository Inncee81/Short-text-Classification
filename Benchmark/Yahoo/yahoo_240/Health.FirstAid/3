i recently got bit by something but i don't know what it could have been around the bite there's a round red circle that feels hard if i touch it it even feels a bit warm does anyone know what it can be i just want to thank everyone who answered so quickly i probably will consider going to see a doctor keep an eye on it if it gets worse or if you start to have trouble breathing get to a doctor immediately usually insect bites aren't a big deal you get bit they swell up hurt for a day itch for a day and you are done but sometimes you can have allergic reactions to bites and stings that can be serious just keep an eye on it keep it clean and check with a doc if it doesn't get better soon hope this helps Diving Spider Fecal incontinence Social rule Mosquito 2000 Australian Grand Prix Tarantula Hay fever Theory of conduct Eczema Conjunctivitis First aid Kender Sting (musician) Breastfeeding Drill bit Piccolo Junior Saga Prostate cancer Unreal Hal Trosky Cephalexin Venom (poison) Triage Asthma Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Carbon dioxide Anaphylaxis Mast cell Haven (TNG episode) Marilyn Monroe Tattoo Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Virginia Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) The Death Gate Cycle Snake The Legend of Zelda series enemies Paragliding Characters in the Smurfs Blood (computer game) Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Dualism (philosophy of mind) Hamster Milton H.
