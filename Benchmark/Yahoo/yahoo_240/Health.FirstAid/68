toe infection yesterday my big toe it s inbetween the nail and the skin cuticle on the outside corner has begun to develop some green puss underneath the skin my toe is very warm red swollen and tender i have been putting my foot in warm salt water and applying neosproin and the puss is draining but more just keeps forming i have no idea what could have caused it what else can i do to help relive the pain and get it to go away rub some alchohol on it and then use some dissolved epsom salts in warm water cut your nail because it's probably ingrown if it doesn't get any better then you can see a dotor to prevent tenderness put a corn cushion on it and cover with a band aid corn cushions are very useful believe me i use them to prevent blisters when ice skating note corn cushions are circular foam pads applied onto the foot corn but they work for cushioning pretty much anything don't go ice skating with it p hope this helps Callus Manicure Psoriasis Mattress Equine conformation Gout Nail disease Pointe shoes Figure skating Tattoo Nail (anatomy) First aid Upholstery Tofu Shoe Seismic retrofit Wound Snooker Acne Ski Textile manufacturing Pedicure Jackass: The Movie Methamphetamine Cellulitis Crocodilia Professional wrestling holds Roller skating High-heeled shoe Vampire Aloe Ulcer Nine Inch Nails Magnesium sulfate Europa (moon) Boil Diving Billiards Water Maize Otitis externa Ice hockey Hiking Wassily Kandinsky Mouth ulcer Massage Eczema Strap-on dildo Tire Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Sunburn Basic English Dialysis Erysipelas Dracunculiasis Osteoarthritis Swimming Lake Traumatic brain injury Rail terminology Sea ice Cloud Mango Barbed wire Water (molecule) Artistic roller skating Happy Tree Friends Athlete's foot Diving suit Fecal incontinence Corrosion Geodesic dome Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Frog House of Leaves Prostate cancer Effects of global warming Michelle Kwan Herpes simplex virus Glacier Glossary of partner dance terms Diarrhea Global warming Tuberculosis Foot-and-mouth disease Kidney Bread Fancy rat Rash Ice cream Aerial (dance move) Decompression sickness Smelt Banana Fire extinguisher Chalazion Breastfeeding Pharyngitis Ferret
