buffalo sabres losses signings mainly what do you think about the sabres agreeing to vanek's high price salary no doubt he's a great player but he can't make up for drury briere and zubrus i think they should have let vanek go and started from the beginning by drafting a young crew and waiting a couple years pittsburgh did this and they are going to be very good this year we almost have to see how the season plays out to decide if it was a good deal or if they could have worked out a deal with drury they would have been able to let vanek go get young prospects and still have a somewhat decent team with the same amount of money it costs to keep vanek the oilers dont seem to be going anywhere this season so we could have gotten a top pick of the draft also tell me what you think about that and any other comments dealing with other deals management vanek has more upside then briere this is the second team that he has been on so the first team must not have seen much to trade him for chris gratton no less in the first place i really believe he was a product of the system he was in if vanke progresses like he has in the first two years his contract will be a bargain as for drury it wasn't about money for him the sabre's said that would match any contract it just sucked that the team he grew up loving wanted him keep in mine that every year the cap will rise so we haven't seen anything yet and when a player is in their last year of a contact its not in their best interest to sign a new deal without letting the market push their value up also like someone said the buffalo's farm team the rochester americans have plenty of talent Buffalo Sabres National Football League Pittsburgh Penguins American Football League Los Angeles Clippers Salary cap Detroit Red Wings Pittsburgh Steelers Wayne Gretzky Mario Lemieux New England Patriots New York Giants Buffalo Bills AFL-NFL Merger National Hockey League Toronto Raptors Philadelphia Flyers Super Bowl XXVII Satchel Paige Boston Bruins Minor league baseball NFL Draft Pittsburgh Pirates New York Knicks National Basketball Association Oakland Athletics Reggie Jackson International League Cincinnati Bengals Sammy Sosa Boston Red Sox Tennessee Titans Microeconomics New York Islanders Indiana Pacers Carolina Panthers Continental Basketball Association Montreal Canadiens Poker jargon Negro league baseball Alex Rodriguez New York Jets Cleveland Browns Washington Capitals Anarchism and capitalism Qu__bec Nordiques Japanese baseball 2002-03 NHL season Reserve clause Dominik Ha__ek Newcastle United F.C.
