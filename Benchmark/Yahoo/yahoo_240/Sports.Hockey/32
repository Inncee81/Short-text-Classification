what kind of stick is best for me i already have a good stick tell you what kind it is later im just wondering what kind of stick you think is best for me im ' '' lbs im a defensive defenseman and i am a passer i dont shoot too much i like setting up plays at your height and weight you should be using an flex stick nothing stiffer given that you're a defensive defenseman i wouldn't try to go with any excessively light models as that performance benefit does not necessarily fit your needs i also wouldn't go with too big a curve or excessive loft when choosing your pattern don't want to shoot over the net although a bigger paddle might be a plus for blocking passes or shots the blade lie should be determined by your skating and puckhandling style an upright skater who plays the puck near the body would use a higher lie and conversely a lower lie is more practical for a bent over skater who plays the puck away from the body one piece models i might suggest given your position and size would be the synergy st warrior dolomite or nike bauer one not a big fan of rbk ccm because of the weight or tps because of the poor durability i am personally a big fan of two piece sticks and the versatility value they offer don't be mesmerized by one piece designs particularly if you are not willing to invest in higher end models a two piece setup will provide you with substantially more performance than a similarly priced one piece model Figure skating Ice hockey Golf club (equipment) Equine conformation Skateboarding trick Car handling Knife B-47 Stratojet Double bass Bicycle Goaltender Bicycle frame Pole vault Microeconomics Roller hockey Jet engine Terminal ballistics Supply and demand Propeller Table tennis Inflation Violin Aerial (dance move) Wood carving Bicycle lighting F-16 Fighting Falcon Sport utility vehicle Hybrid vehicle Snowboard Mattress Anchor Mixed martial arts Motorcycle Ford Thunderbird Weight training Toyota Camry Centre (ice hockey) Kart racing Hockey rink Basketball Capitalism Spline (mathematics) Mercury Cougar M16 (rifle) Club (weapon) Skateboard Upholstery Cincinnati Bengals Monopsony Radio controlled airplane Tax Baroque chess Efficiency wages Chess strategy and tactics Principal-agent problem Floorball Redundant array of independent disks Penalty (ice hockey) Roller skating Casting Turbocharger Table saw Game controller Kasparov versus The World Miracle on Ice Digital photography Drill bit Carburetor Poker jargon Station wagon Mazda Miata Craps American football Diamond cut Aikido Ra (board game) Tennis Welding Ice skating Brassiere Yao Ming GunBound Pottery Hockey puck Professional wrestling throws Free trade Manifold Mitsubishi 3000GT Artistic roller skating Bicycle helmet Timpani Toyota MR2
