is there anything gary bettman has done that has helped the nhl i hear nothing but bad things about the guy so i ask if he has done even one thing that has helped the nhl well let me think he increased the annual revenues per team from mm in to mm and the nhlpa has benefitted greatly from this he facilitated the use of nhl players in the olympics he was instrumental in bringing the world ice hocey championships to canada in first time ever he has increased the exposure of the game in live nhl games were available in countries today they are shown in things he has been blamed for which he had no part ion the changing of the schedule the nhl adopted a division based schedule in years before his arrival changing the names of the divisions from historical names to geographic names this decision was made in by john ziegler i was on the committee loss of television revenue the nhl does not have a us network deal because us networks refuse to make decent bids nhl ratings in the us have been constant for over years long before bettman joined the league the fact is regardless of whoever is commissioner the ratings in the us aren't going to change unless the league becomes predominantly american in the last years as both the men and women's tennis tours have had the number of top americans decrease the ratings have decreased sharply this is a situation in most countries people prefer to watch their own am american wants to see tiger woods win the masters not mike weir and cbs has the viewership decline to prove it pete sampras should be winning wimbledon not federer i have been involved with the nhl in one way or another since i have met clarence campbell john ziegler gil stein and gary bettman i have also met alan eagleson bob goodenow and ted saskins i have taken part in several dozen nhl committees i know how the league operates the nhl governors run the nhl gary bettman is their spokesman gary bettman is responsible for ensuring that the owners wishes are carried out he only gets a say when their is a tie and that never happens if you get a chance to talk to the majority of players and owners bettman is great for the game if you get a chance to talk to chris chelios you will realize that nobody is good for the game gary bettman did not cause the lockout the owners voted to keep the players out bettman helped the owners and the players make a lot of money but no commissioner in the world is going to make hockey a financial windfall in nashville like it is in toronto the rules changes are chosen by a group of players and owners not by gary bettman the cities chosen for expansion were chosen by the owners not gary bettman during the stanley cup final bill daly mentioned that the league owners have approved the addition of more teams to lubers the nhl governors will gladly increase the number of games they play against the other conference if the number of games are increased the nhlpa will not allow an increase in the number of games and requested a reduction in the number of games during the most recent cba talks as the number of teams increase for better or worse and the number of games stay constant there will be give and take in how the schedule is created for most teams their division geographic rivals pull in the most fans and in the owners adopted this mentality and for the last years teams have been playing the majority of games against their own division during the gm meetings in february this was brought up for a vote again and the owners voted against the idea again your last two points taking a step back and the lack of needing a push into the southern us aren't bettman specific i agree that there is little or no reason to expand to markets where they currently have little or no interest however as long as there are people like jeremy jacobs and ed snider everybody in winnipeg is already a hockey fan we gain no extra fans moving there the nhl will continue to expand into markets where there is somebody with a big fat pocketbook who will line the owners pockets this will happen regardless of who the commissioner is unfortunately the number of darryl katz's' and james balsillie's in canada with the money to purchase a team is very few and those with it are reluctant to spend it on a hockey team it is very sad when you have a team from one of the largest tv markets in the us and a network with coverage nbc and the number of viewers in canada exceeds the number of viewers in the us the nhl governors had everything they wanted a large market us team full continental coverage and still no viewers to trombass what's wrong with playing each team home and away ask ed snider he put forward the schedule idea and james karmanos seconded it and the vote was supposedly overwhelmingly in favour it's all about money pittsburgh will draw more fans to philadelphia than will san jose anaheim will always get more fans when the kings come to town personally i would prefer to see a more balanced schedule and have the top teams make the playoffs i would love to see a montreal toronto cup final or detroit chicago or calgary edmonton or rangers flyers etc none of which can happen under
