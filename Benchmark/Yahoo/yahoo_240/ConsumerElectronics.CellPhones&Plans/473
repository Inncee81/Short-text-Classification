moto razor i have an att motorolla razor i have gotten it wet before and nothing happened but the other day it got sprinkled on and now it doesnt work whats odd is the only key that does work is the on off key ive tried resetting it and everything does anyone have any tips other than getting a new phone or taking it in to get it repaired because i dont have insurance on it and i cant quite afford a new phone i believe on the razr if you take the battery off there is a white dot behind the battery if that dot is red it means the phone has water damage this is what i was told from someone at att i had a lot of problems with my old razr i would recommend taking off the battery putting it back on and charging the phone for a few hours with it turned off i did that when i was having a problem with the keys and it fixed it i would also check the red dot for water damage because if it had water damage then there is nothing you can do USS Waters (DD-115) Battery (electricity) USS Vestal (AR-4) Oscilloscope Mobile phone Cruising (maritime) RuneScape quests Father's Day (Doctor Who) Toyota Prius Elis Prefecture Atari 8-bit family Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Nickel metal hydride Nickel-cadmium battery Atomic Kitten Telephone exchange Thermal power station United Airlines Flight 93 USS Zane (DD-337) Grand Theft Auto (game) Lithium ion battery GSM services USS S-38 (SS-143) USS S-44 (SS-155) Hurricane Rita USS Thompson (DD-627) Community emergency response team Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Insurance 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Charles Ives USS S-35 (SS-140) Leaf Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Emergency preparedness USS Uhlmann (DD-687) Sin City USS Augusta (CA-31) Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans First aid USS Yorktown (CV-5) Photography Social rule Team Fortress Classic USS Seadragon (SS-194) USS San Francisco (CA-38) Combine (Half-Life 2) Johnny 5 Time Out of Mind USS Wickes (DD-578) Auto rickshaw Telephone numbering plan The Time Machine Modem USS Tunny (SS-282) USS Anderson (DD-411) Battle of Hampton Roads Poker jargon 7 July 2005 London bombings Hurricane Katrina timeline Auto insurance IPod HMS Ramillies (07) George Costanza Beltway sniper attacks Shaggy dog story USS United States (1797) Daylight saving time USS S-37 (SS-142) USS Wadsworth (DD-516) Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 USS West Virginia (BB-48) Hurricane Wilma Water polo USS Atlanta (CL-51) USS Albacore (SS-218) Data recovery Automobile Terran (StarCraft) Knife USS Williamson (DD-244) USS Ammen (DD-527) Light-emitting diode Galileo spacecraft USS Richmond (1860) Torpedo Watch Battle of the Aleutian Islands detailed account Ocean's Twelve USS Saratoga (CV-3) Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Energy USS Wichita (CA-45) Vacuum tube Yom Kippur War Wal-Mart USS Thresher (SS-200) Danger Hiptop USS Lexington (1861) Tire
