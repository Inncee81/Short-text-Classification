is there anyway to get custom answertones for cellphones i have a plan with at t and i know they offer recorded songs by wmb but i want to have my own song for my answertone is this possible no the reason you can't is because they are not downloaded to your phone this is how they can be used with any phone they are stored on your provider's servers and you pay for the service that is the only way the other person could hear them Verizon Wireless ITunes Music Store Mobile phone Telephone numbering plan Virgin Mobile Global System for Mobile Communications Web hosting Gmail Electronic commerce North American Numbering Plan BlackBerry Voice over IP Broadband Internet access Instant messaging Short message service Telephone tapping Internet service provider Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Online music store ITunes Customer relationship management MSN Messenger IP Multimedia Subsystem 9-1-1 Database management system Phone sex Mixtape Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Spam (electronic) N-Gage Filling station Surveillance Sprint Nextel Corporation Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Tesco TiVo Bluetooth Videotex Data retention T-Mobile Webmail Enterprise content management RealNetworks Cable television TELUS Whois Windows 2000 Octopus card UK telephone numbering plan Public transport Private branch exchange E-mail spam Microsoft Office Telmex Google Maps Toll-free telephone number Opera (web browser) Best Buy Mozilla Firefox Apple Computer Apple Open Collaboration Environment Game programmer Windows XP Bulletin board system Linux Hotmail Telephone exchange Contemporary culture of South Korea Napster Argentine telephone numbering plan Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act We Belong Together Karaoke Xbox Live JADE programming language BitTorrent GSM services US West (phone company) Steam (content delivery) Danger Hiptop CompuServe EFTPOS Wal-Mart MP3.com Japanese mobile phone culture Network Switching Subsystem Telkom Taxicab Spring operating system Uploading and downloading Podcasting AT&T Windows Vista Skype Associative array Phone fraud Embedded system Video on demand
