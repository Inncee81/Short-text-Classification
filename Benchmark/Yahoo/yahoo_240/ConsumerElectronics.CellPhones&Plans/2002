lg chocolate phone dropped in sand i recently dropped my lg chocolate slider phone first gen in some fine sand at the beach and now the slider motion is no longer smooth because there is sand stuck in there what is the best easiest way to get rid of the sand i would use a vacuum cleaner with a hose attachment use the piece with the brush first then after you've vacuumed out what you can get a can of compressed air from any office supply store and a small brush with thin bristles a new paintbrush will do use the brush to sweep out what you can then blow compressed air in the same direction as your brush strokes then go the opposite direction repeating this step several times try not to operate the slider function until you've done this a bunch of times and cleared as much sand as possible every time you slide it with sand in it you grind the sand deeper into the grooves in the slider once you've cleaned out as much as you can remove with the vacuum brush and compressed air then you can try sliding a bit and repeat the same process to see if you can get more out good luck Vacuum cleaner Vacuum Brush Knife Snake Two-stroke cycle Bong Carburetor Glass Vacuum tube Beatmania IIDX Mattress Hard disk Harmonica Glossary of firefighting equipment Friction Pottery Internal ballistics Volleyball Glossary of wildland fire terms Chocolate Drawing Aerial (dance move) Amateur telescope making Four-stroke cycle Electric motor Equine conformation Manicure Woodworking Parachute Plastic Hydraulic machinery Brazing Gas metal arc welding Movie projector Cross-country skiing Energy development Christmas tree Textile manufacturing Eolian Oscilloscope Glossary of climbing terms Soldering Coffee Palatine bone Radar Internal combustion engine Circuit breaker Professor E.
