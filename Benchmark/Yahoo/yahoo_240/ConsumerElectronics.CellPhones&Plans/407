my iphone keeps crashing i have an iphone that is a month old but it keeps crashing it does it mostly while using safari but today it did it while playing music all i was doing was listening to music while it was in my pocket i have restored it twice and have reset it countless times what should i do take it to an apple store or call apple because the at t store cannot do anything to fix it because we are not allowed to do much with the iphone all we can really do is sell it and fix an occasional frozen phone which would be resetting it so yeah just call apple and see if it needs to be shipped off i think apple does send a tempoary iphone to you Apple Computer Apple II family ITunes ITunes Music Store Commodore 64 IPod IMac Safari (web browser) Apple Newton NeXT Apple Apple typography FairPlay Steve Jobs GSM services Apple Desktop Bus Gmail Online music store System 7 (Macintosh) Walkman Steve Wozniak Atari 8-bit family Atari 2600 Retronym Tag RISC Animal Crossing Apple Open Collaboration Environment Guild Wars Objective-C Podcasting Mac OS X Phreaking Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Hard disk AppleScript Ashton-Tate Blue box Golden Age of Arcade Games PowerPC Oscilloscope Pinball Phishing Year 2000 problem Flip-flop (electronics) Wintel WDC 65C02 Watch Cocoa (API) The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Motorola 68000 Network Switching Subsystem Apple PlainTalk RealNetworks Mozilla Firefox Apple Macintosh Game programming History of the Beatles HTTP cookie Rhapsody (online music service) IPod nano Nintendo Advanced Audio Coding Internet Explorer for Mac IBook Missingno.
