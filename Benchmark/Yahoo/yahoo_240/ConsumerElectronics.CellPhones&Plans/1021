what cell phone plan should my boyfriend get he has nextel now but it is really expensive he says it is because he goes over his minutes from talking to me i have cingular but nextel seems more expensive in general he could either increase his minutes with nextel or switch to cingular he is open to either he has to buy a new phone too what would be best he also obviously isn't too good with managing his minutes what cingular plan would be best is a prepaid phone better for someone like that what is most economical he doesn't text at all or use any extra phone features so i don't think he needs a fancy phone from personal experience i recommend at t for your boyfriend if most of his contacts are on at t and with rollover its pretty sweet the only good nextel is that if you have the certain plans you get free incoming calls and if most of his calls are incoming then stick with nextel with his talking habits i strongly recommend against prepaid mobile phones like at t go or boost mobile if his credit is good go with at t and get one of the free phones since you stated that he doesn't text or use any of the extra phone features Sprint Nextel Corporation Global System for Mobile Communications Virgin Mobile Verizon Wireless Push to talk Mobile Virtual Network Operator Telephone tapping Mobile phone Cingular Wireless Telephone numbering plan Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Social rule Java 2 Platform, Micro Edition Surveillance SBC Communications GSM services Telephone 9-1-1 Verizon Communications North American Numbering Plan General Packet Radio Service Pinball Digital AMPS Friends Gross domestic product Externality Mobile phone radiation and health Theory of conduct Microeconomics Ocean's Twelve Emergency telephone number N-Gage Economics Voice over IP Hiking Short message service International Mobile Subscriber Identity Cellular network Channel One News T-Mobile Bluetooth Japanese mobile phone culture Telephone number About a Boy Taxicab Radiotelephone Q-Telecom Telmex Toyota Camry Gmail Las Vegas Monorail Directory assistance Good Morning, Vietnam Nordic Mobile Telephone Meteor Mobile Communications Tesco Customer relationship management Extras (sitcom) Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?
