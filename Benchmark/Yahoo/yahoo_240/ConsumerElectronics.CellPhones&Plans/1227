bluetooth problems from verizon to cingular i luv bluetooth songs from my phone to my friends phones however for some strange reason i cant bluetooth to my friends who have verizon as their provider i have cingular and i can bluetooth my friends who have cingular and t mobile but i have friends who have verizon and i cannot bluetooth any songs them i set up a partnership and then when i try bluetooth the song it says failure please help me verizon makes it so their phones have a digital copyright verification process basically when you try to transfer a song to their phone the verizon phones attempts to authenticate it through the digital rights management your songs probably don't have that embedded into their code therefore it will not work Bluetooth Verizon Wireless Verizon Communications BlackBerry Cingular Wireless Global System for Mobile Communications Sprint Nextel Corporation Treo 650 N-Gage Vodafone Digital rights management Advanced Mobile Phone System GSM services Speech recognition SBC Communications Mobile phone Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Enterprise content management CDMA2000 International Mobile Subscriber Identity Symbian OS Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act W-CDMA Personal digital assistant Area code 703 Digital camera Push to talk Smartphone Public domain Network Switching Subsystem EGovernment Gmail AT&T Telephone Toll-free telephone number Telephone numbering plan T-Mobile Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Directory assistance Cellular network Short message service Harold I of Denmark BellSouth CPU design Telephone company Motorola RAZR V3 AT&T Wireless Code division multiple access Wi-Fi Embedded system IPAQ Computer Smart card 9-1-1 Warez UK telephone numbering plan Digital AMPS Copy protection Copyright 867-5309/Jenny Cordless telephone Television Global Title Windows Mobile Digital photography Pocket PC Secure Shell NEC Corporation Mergers and acquisitions Digital circuit IEEE 802.11 Voice over IP Abandonware Digital television Gizmondo Telephone number Linux PlayStation 3 Microsoft Laqtel High-Speed Downlink Packet Access Evolution Data Only Musical Instrument Digital Interface Tungsten Handheld MAC address Authentication Apple Computer AMD Electronic Frontier Foundation Octopus card Vacuum tube Universal Serial Bus Digital signature Tupac Shakur Modem Surveillance Photography Digital signal processing Handheld video game
