are trac phones reliable i am in wisconsin don't use my cell phone a lot and am thinking of getting a trac phone do they get good reception does it cost more in the long run i've had several tracfones over the last several years and have found that they are as reliable as any other phone carrier the cost of a tracfone is based on how much time you purchase and how long you keep it activated so the cost per minute varies between to cents per minute based on the last time i figured it long term cost will be determined by much you used the phone my last cell plan for instance cost about month i switched to a tracfone because i simply was not using the phone very much and found that i was typically spending about every days to keep the phone active one added advantage of the tracfone is that you cannot go over on your minutes when the minutes you purchase are gone they are gone with most cell plans you pay a premium per minute to use the phone beyond the plan minutes available normally you only find out that you went over when you receive your next bill if in doubt buy the least expensive tracfone for about and if it doesn't suit your needs you're only out Virgin Mobile Verizon Wireless Gross domestic product Short message service Insurance FairTax Microeconomics Skype Cable television Voice over IP Life insurance North American Numbering Plan Mutual fund Tax Auto insurance Telephone tapping Best Buy Cellular network Modem Radio Extreme Programming Publicly funded medicine NorthwesTel Solar power satellite Electrophysiology Inflation Public transport Health insurance Social rule Variable universal life insurance Broadband Internet access The Amazing Race GSM services General Packet Radio Service 9-1-1 Annuity Bond Code division multiple access Cruising (maritime) Global System for Mobile Communications ITunes Music Store Telephone Airline RISC Solar cell Wal-Mart Wind turbine Bulk vending Transistor Leasing Mobile phone radiation and health Yield curve Supply and demand Capitalism Economics Air New Zealand Telephone exchange Telephone card Political campaign Filling station 7 July 2005 London bombings Hyperinflation X.25 Scrabble Premium-rate telephone number Phreaking Digital photography Software patent debate PE ratio MobileOne Comparison of 21st century fighter aircraft Computer M16 (rifle) Global Positioning System Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Industrial engineering Personal finance Radar Hubble Space Telescope Live 8 Phone sex Grid energy storage Floppy disk PlayStation 3 UK telephone numbering plan E85 Public policy Monopoly (game) Online music store America Online Nonblocking minimal spanning switch Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme Bay Area Rapid Transit Paintball Ford Explorer Illegal drug trade
