hey smart phone advice hey i am switching to qwest wireless in the next few weeks because my dad's work expenses will pay for the bill i really don't know which phone to buy from qwest because i have a gsm carrier at t cingular and qwest uses the same towers as sprint so it is cdma so i can't unlock my phone to bring it over i am yrs old and am a big tech junkie think kewl sk r nerd lol and am thinking of getting a smart phone i am thinking of buying the htc mogul that is coming to qwest in a few weeks if not i'll probably get the samsung m that is just an average slider but at least it's something similar to what most of my friends have so i'll easily fit in am ii too young to get a smart phone ill probably get a data plan just for fun so the ev do rev a on the htc mogul wont go to waste it depends since you're a tech junkie you may actually make use out of a smartphone but then again you may not it has a looooot of really cool features but they're quite expensive if you don't plan to use them even if you do get the data plan you may not end up using all the features and in that case you could have just got an internet plan with the slide phone smartphones are definitely cooler though Smartphone Verizon Wireless Sprint Nextel Corporation Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Mobile phone Qwest Global System for Mobile Communications Treo 650 BlackBerry Push to talk Virgin Mobile W-CDMA Telephone numbering plan General Packet Radio Service Cingular Wireless Cellular network Evolution Data Only AT&T GSM services SBC Communications Modem CDMA2000 Bluetooth Tungsten Handheld Smart card Broadband Internet access Global Positioning System N-Gage Time division multiple access 9-1-1 Code division multiple access Windows Mobile T-Mobile Advanced Mobile Phone System Voice over IP Surveillance Handspring Vodafone Short message service BellSouth Phreaking Hey Arnold!
