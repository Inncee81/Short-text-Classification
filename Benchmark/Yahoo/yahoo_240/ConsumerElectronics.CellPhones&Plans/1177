prepaid cell phone the scarlet letter of the wireless world ok wherever i go and whenever the topic of cell phones comes up people always avoid prepaid phones like the plague and even say prepaid with disdain with a tone of disgust in their voice by extension they also seem to project the same attributes to people that have prepaid cell phones like having one means you are some kind of deadbeat with terrible credit i have a prepaid but i got mine because i don't have to worry about some fugly service plan or get hosed from overage bills on a real carrier but the craziest thing is i have had people gloat to me about their wireless contracts like having one makes them virtuous even though i think they are just slaves to their plans my theory is that all these ghetto prepaid providers like tracfone virgin amp'd and boost mobile have given the prepaid cell phone platform a bad reputation by offering only the crappiest models of cell phone and weak service i think they are to blame for having a prepaid cell go down as a sign of shame i hear you hap' but that is the ridiculous thing about all this i have a cingular now at t again prepaid phone and although its pretty basic it still has a color display and a mobile browser and i got it so i don't have to worry about bills if i want to keep using it i load more airtime and if i don't or can't afford to i don't need to worry about going into hock to pay off the monthly bill however anyone i've ever talked to that had anything to say about cell phones all look down their nose at the prepaid method like its better to have to grab your ankles every month when your carrier sends off the airtime bill i have a t mobile prepaid phone i don't like phones in general but i needed a cell phone for my part time job t mobile was the cheapest solution for me and i haven't had a single complaint about the service and i pay about half of what the cheapest monthly rates offer my reception has never been impaired here in central massachusetts and i purchased the cheapest phone and it does more than i need it to too each their own is what i say Virgin Mobile Global System for Mobile Communications Mobile phone Verizon Wireless Q-Telecom Telephone numbering plan GSM services T-Mobile Cellular network BlackBerry Cingular Wireless Voice over IP N-Gage Sprint Nextel Corporation Telephone Mobile Virtual Network Operator North American Numbering Plan Modem Bluetooth 24 (television) Major League Baseball television contracts Surveillance Social rule 9-1-1 Push to talk Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Insurance Wireless Application Protocol IP Multimedia Subsystem Oyster card Gmail Internet AT&T Mobile phone radiation and health XML Meteor Mobile Communications Advanced Mobile Phone System Mortgage-backed security Tesco Health maintenance organization Global Positioning System NorthwesTel Cable television Telephone exchange Electricity meter Solar cell Theory of conduct Enterprise content management Skype Rogers Communications Verizon Communications Broadband Internet access Turkcell Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an MTV Data retention Telstra Spam (electronic) Telegraphy Cruising (maritime) 1957 World Series Digital AMPS Opera (web browser) Mach kernel Radio clock Public policy Private branch exchange Futurama (TV series - season 5) Musical Instrument Digital Interface Collateralized mortgage obligation Instant messaging Messerschmitt Bf 109 Wireless network Danger Hiptop Hearing impairment Life insurance Telephone number Filling station Phone sex Television NTT DoCoMo Ring tone IEEE 802.11 America Online Mail Federal Standard 1037C ATI Technologies Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority UK telephone numbering plan Bay Area Rapid Transit
