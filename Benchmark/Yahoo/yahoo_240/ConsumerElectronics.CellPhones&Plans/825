wat is is the diffrence between cingular and verizon response to painkiller cdma is based on older technology than gsm but it's not the same thing that they were using in vietnam it's also advancing quite a bit faster than gsm newer gsm technology is starting to model itself on cdma g gsm is wcdma so if gsm were really a better technology why would it model itself on a lesser technology that seems stupid most of the world uses gsm currently that's the world standard it would be pretty difficult for everyone to suddenly make a switch to a different technology which is why gsm is going to be the world standard for a long time as for the differences between at t and verizon there aren't a lot of notable differences verizon used to have much better customer service but at t has really turned that around recently at t scored higher than verizon in jd power associates for customer service this year the plans are very similar the coverage with both companies is great nationwide but there are some locations where verizon will work and at t won't or vice versa try not to get caught up in the marketing spin from both companies at t's claim of having the fewest dropped calls is based on a small area somewhere in california i can't even remember the name of the company that did the study but it was a local study at t took the results and blew it up into a huge marketing ploy verizon does the same thing just try to educate yourself on which works best in your area if you're trying to pick between the two try asking people in your area on verizon and at t and see what they think of their phones service and plans if you're in one of those areas where one company's service works better than the other then there's a real advantage to having one over the other typically there won't be much difference though Verizon Wireless Global System for Mobile Communications Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Advanced Mobile Phone System Cingular Wireless W-CDMA Vodafone Cellular network Code division multiple access Telephone numbering plan General Packet Radio Service Push to talk Verizon Communications CDMA2000 T-Mobile BlackBerry GSM services Time division multiple access Network Switching Subsystem Voice over IP Broadband Internet access Short message service 3G Mobile phone Floppy disk Evolution Data Only Treo Emergency telephone number AT&T ALLTEL International Mobile Subscriber Identity Modem Wireless Application Protocol Telephone tapping IP Multimedia Subsystem RISC North American Numbering Plan Central processing unit Radiolocation Speech recognition Handheld game console N-Gage GSM frequency ranges Treo 650 Nordic Mobile Telephone Toll-free telephone number Monopoly Digital photography 2000 Australian Grand Prix Mach kernel IBM PC compatible Digital AMPS ARM architecture Insurance Turkcell Global Positioning System Secure Digital card Reasonable and Non Discriminatory Licensing Q-Telecom Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Telephone exchange Mobile Virtual Network Operator Telephone IS-95 Microeconomics Mobility management Mobile phone radiation and health 9-1-1 Microsoft Windows Best Buy Extreme Programming Ethernet MTR Yellow Pages Telecom New Zealand High-Speed Circuit-Switched Data Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution Smartphone Charter school Publicly funded medicine Recording Industry Association of America Loudspeaker The break up of AT&T Table tennis Capitalism Nuclear power ATI Technologies NTT DoCoMo Nokia Social rule Laserdisc Siemens AG Diesel engine Comparison of 21st century fighter aircraft
