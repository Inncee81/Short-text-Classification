why do i receive a text message s every time i check my vm from my cell they include the following text a i cannot reply to nor block the sender because it does not indicate who sent the message i assume this is some sort of service feature not normal though i have tried many different ways to clear this up this issue is not included in any of my documentation on this phone also if you wanna be real nice and answer this second question i would really appreciate it there is an option under my message setup which is the setup option for service center messaging this has something to do with cell broadcasting and allows me to input channel s should i have this feature on or off what is the deal with the channel s i'm confused motorola l slvr hey there im taking an educated guess this is for att call customer care and tell them about the vm issue they will need to get you to tech support to resolve the messages you receive are free but they can be annoying also leave the message center number alone when you send a text message it tells your phone where to send it out for delivery if you change it and cannot send messages you will need to call customer care to get the correct number Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Short message service E-mail spam Gmail Modem Spam (electronic) Public-key cryptography United States Postal Service GSM services Stopping e-mail abuse Virgin Mobile System/36 AOL Instant Messenger Internet Relay Chat Verizon Wireless System/34 Internet Group Management Protocol Musical Instrument Digital Interface BlackBerry E-mail Bluetooth Morse Code Coding theory Integrated Services Digital Network IS-95 Anonymous remailer Direct marketing General Packet Radio Service Cellular network Transmission Control Protocol Code division multiple access Call centre Error correction and detection AppleTalk Object-oriented programming Internet fraud Pretty Good Privacy Hamming code Direct Client-to-Client Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Telephone Objective-C Mobile phone Cryptography UK telephone numbering plan Voice over IP Multimedia Messaging System ALOHAnet Radio Mail Vertical service code Scientology beliefs and practices National Weather Service MSN Messenger MDAC Air traffic control 24 (television) Network Switching Subsystem Opera (web browser) Global System for Mobile Communications FidoNet Telephone exchange Mach kernel Java Message Service HTML element XML Apple Open Collaboration Environment SCIP C plus plus Domain Name System IP (complexity) Redundant array of independent disks Email authentication North American Numbering Plan Computer virus Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Sender Policy Framework RISC Enterprise content management ZIP Code Slashdot trolling phenomena Theory of conduct Spring operating system Steam (content delivery) Caller ID Minesweeper (computer game) Self programming language Friends AmigaOS Teletext Social rule EIA-708 GED ITU-T Whois Communications protocol Mobile phone spam Slashdot subculture
