should we start thinking about hamilton becoming champ only once of the podium things are looking good for him if ferrari dont win i hope hamilton does well there is a good reason to say yes it is time to consider it the simple fact he's led or shared the championship lead since bahrain then tied with alonso and raikkonen and alone in front since spain i think it really is down to he and alonso now the ferrari drivers while clearly with mathematical chances to make it to the top are unlikely to gain that much with only six races remaining to have a rookie win the title would be quite something it speaks well to the development series that fuel f it says gp is a good place to learn in a near f environment heck in an f environment for many of the races it says f and before that frenault are good levels in the racing ladder of course it also says the only way to get here is with the right connections having ron dennis step in and say things in your favour like when the f seat in was given to hamilton at asm instead of the tester fernando rees who had apparenlty made a deal to get the seat for that year regardless it also speaks of hamilton's enormous talent top team or not no one just steps into f and wins their first year out unless they've got some serious capabilties behind the wheel of the car rp Kimi R__ikk__nen Fernando Alonso Scuderia Ferrari Team McLaren 2005 Formula One season Juan Pablo Montoya Formula One Jacques Villeneuve Giancarlo Fisichella 2005 Belgian Grand Prix Jenson Button History of Formula One 2003 United States Grand Prix Ayrton Senna Jordan Grand Prix 24 Hours of Le Mans Mercedes-Benz 2005 European Grand Prix Chris Amon Jacky Ickx Penske Racing 2000 Australian Grand Prix 2005 French Grand Prix Riccardo Patrese Renault F1 Champ Car V8 Supercar Mika H__kkinen Ferrari Tony Stewart Nigel Mansell 2005 Canadian Grand Prix 2005 Australian Grand Prix 2004 Formula One season 2005 British Grand Prix Dan Gurney Tiago Monteiro Indianapolis 500 Gerhard Berger Los Angeles Dodgers Ron Dennis 2005 United States Grand Prix Mark Blundell 2004 San Marino Grand Prix Valentino Rossi Carlos Reutemann Jean Alesi Roush Racing S__bastien Bourdais Jarno Trulli Ivan Capelli 2003 Brazilian Grand Prix International League David Coulthard Prost (racing team) Narain Karthikeyan Mazda RX-7 Minardi Alberto Ascari Enzo Ferrari Justin Wilson Eddie Cheever April 2005 in sports 2004 Monaco Grand Prix Kevin Harvick Richard Childress Racing 2005 Brazilian Grand Prix Masten Gregory Sauber Martin Brundle Hendrick Motorsports Jody Scheckter Emerson Fittipaldi Rubens Barrichello NEXTEL Cup Nick Heidfeld Andrea de Cesaris Tour de France Formula One regulations Honda John Barnard 2002 Formula One season Niki Lauda British American Racing Adrian Newey WilliamsF1 July 2005 in sports September 2005 in sports Heinz-Harald Frentzen Toranosuke Takagi American Championship Car Racing July 2004 in sports Pittsburgh Steelers
