why did the race stop at brasil because i watched it on youtube and it was stopped a major crash happened due to heavy rain due to pit strategy and team planning gian carlo fisichella took the victory away from raikonnen because the race was called due to bad track conditions two laps before the end fisichella was in the lead and when the race was called raikonnen had overtaken fisichella but because he was not in the lead two laps previous the win was awarded to fisichella the rules are arranged as such and have changed so much recently it creates alot of confusion unless you keep up with them it was fisichellas first win Kimi R__ikk__nen Giancarlo Fisichella 2003 Brazilian Grand Prix 2005 Belgian Grand Prix 2004 San Marino Grand Prix 2005 European Grand Prix Jordan Grand Prix 2005 Formula One season 2005 Hungarian Grand Prix 2003 United States Grand Prix 2000 Australian Grand Prix Michael Schumacher 2005 British Grand Prix 2005 Australian Grand Prix Renault F1 Indianapolis 500 Fernando Alonso Formula One regulations 2005 Canadian Grand Prix Formula One Carlos Reutemann 24 Hours of Le Mans 2005 Japanese Grand Prix 2005 French Grand Prix Racing flags 2005 Bahrain Grand Prix Ayrton Senna 2004 Monaco Grand Prix Jacky Ickx 2005 United States Grand Prix Ernie Irvan Mark Webber Team McLaren Talladega Superspeedway Scuderia Ferrari Craftsman Truck Series Juan Pablo Montoya Valentino Rossi Mercedes-Benz Chris Amon History of Formula One Alex Zanardi 2005-06 A1 Grand Prix of Nations, Great Britain Nigel Mansell Melbourne Cup 2004 Formula One season Bristol Motor Speedway Swedish Grand Prix Formula One racing Tony Stewart NASCAR Darrell Waltrip 2006 Formula One season David Coulthard Hendrick Motorsports Damon Hill Richard Petty Tour de France Chariot racing Narain Karthikeyan 2005 Monaco Grand Prix Martin Brundle Benetton Formula Ralf Schumacher Penske Racing Pit stop 1985 Australian Grand Prix Jackie Stewart Dale Earnhardt Gordon Johncock Minardi Dale Earnhardt, Jr. Jacques Villeneuve Felipe Massa Danica Patrick Rick Mears NEXTEL Cup Daytona 500 Middle distance track event Belgian Grand Prix The Amazing Race Bowl Championship Series Gustavo Kuerten Robby Gordon Drag racing Indianapolis Motor Speedway Suzuka Circuit A1 Team The Netherlands Future of Formula One May 2005 in sports 2002 Formula One season Gambling International League Autodromo Nazionale Monza Alberto Ascari Jenson Button 1986 Australian Grand Prix 2005 Iditarod GP2 Series
