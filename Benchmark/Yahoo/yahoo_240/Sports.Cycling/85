how can i re gear my bike i have a base mountain bike with gripshift and rear gears it only has the one front sprocket i would like to change this to 'quickfire' shifters and put on front sprockets what would be the best way of doing this thank you if this bike was bought at a wal mart k mart or other big box store don't spend any additional money on it you are not looking at the bigger picture for starters when changing out your crank and shifters you will probably also have to buy a new front and rear derailleur as well this will cost more than the bike you currently have and then some a decent mountain bike is going to cost you or more keep riding the bike you have now till you have at least that much saved up then go to the local bike shop and find the bike you really want you may have to save some more cash after that visit for the one you really want but it will be worth it in the end a good bike can last you years depending on what kind of riding you're doing and how well you take care of it Derailleur gears Bicycle Transmission (mechanics) Mountain bike Bicycle frame Recumbent bicycle Racing bicycle Wal-Mart Honda CX series Cycling Bicycle brake systems Fixed-gear bicycle Bicycle lighting Kart racing Penny-farthing Single-speed bicycle Bike trials riding Triathlon Motocross Mountain biking Hub gear Manual transmission MapleStory Shimano Total Integration Gear Snowboarding Whistler-Blackcomb Inflation Mazda Miata Automobile Transfer case Sears Holdings Corporation Cyclo-cross Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game Bike lane debate Paintball Unicycle Bicycle commuting Roller chain Bicycle wheel Lance Armstrong Adventure racing Bank Hybrid vehicle Citro__n 2CV Tandem bicycle $ale of the Century Drag racing Jackass: The Movie Hyperinflation Surveillance Bottom bracket Tour de France Microeconomics Jennifer Lopez Best Buy Dodge Neon Daylight saving time Vehicular cycling Heinkel He 100 BMW motorcycles Mercury Cougar Volkswagen Type 2 Paramount Pictures Tax Octopus card Cruising (maritime) Bon Jovi Cable television Specialized Bicycle Components Touring bicycle Money Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man Wheel of Fortune 2005 World Series John Bull (locomotive) Burning Man Gambling BMW Steering Caterpillar track Monopoly (game) Toyota Celica Continuously variable transmission BMX Life insurance Berkshire Hathaway Capital accumulation Rail terminology John F.
