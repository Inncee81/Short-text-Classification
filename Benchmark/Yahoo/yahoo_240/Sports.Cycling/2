why do the gears on my bike change when i dont want them too i've recently bought an xc mountain bike with gears and i can be riding along quite happily but it will suddenly slip through the gears on the rear wheel and drop into and stay there anyone know why am i riding it wrong i've not had a bike with gears before and even though the people in the shop have tried to explain it to me i'm still not sure about it whats the best way to ride it and in what gear should it jump into another gear like this any help would be appreciated i'm riding on roads along a river bank and up and down slight hills nothing too dramatic not sure if that makes a difference to the first reply i've been driving a geared car for nearly years and never had so much as a slight knock i currently drive a seater mpv and i would bet any money you care to suggest that i can reverse it into a space a in one move and b better than you thank you to everyone else the bike has now gone back into the shop and they are dealing with it as said by many your gears need adjustment it has nothing to do with the way your ride since you recently bought your bike take it to that shop for service maybe it will fall within the warranty any way it is nothing to expensive to do the best gear to use is the one that is comfortable to you according to the ground level uphill etc your speed strenght etc so select a gear that you are comfortable with a leisure pace would be about pedeles per minute as fast one would be about to or so are for fit cyclist sprints etc not a place you are likely to live in for very long remember big cog in front bigger effort big cog in the back smaller effort they are the opposite one from the other so a small gear in front and the biggest on the back would be your lightest uphill gear the biggest in front and the smallest in the back would be the one that requiers more effort but will give more meters per pedalling stroke will make you go faster if you can spin you pedals in that gear use it for fast cycling in level ground or down hill at speed in between this two option would be the front and back cog combination that will be the most comfortable for you according to the effort you want to put into each stroke the speed you want to sustain if the ground is level or not something our bodies are fast to tell us without having to think to much about it so enjoy and do not worry to much you will know what to do in very little time Bicycle Recumbent bicycle Mountain bike Fixed-gear bicycle Bicycle lighting Manual transmission Mountain biking Bicycle frame Motocross Car handling Bicycle brake systems Bike lane debate Transmission (mechanics) Racing bicycle Cycling Single-speed bicycle Vehicular cycling Drag racing Professional wrestling throws Fast bowling Horse gait Toyota Prius Derailleur gears Gear Chevrolet Corvair Land Rover (Series/Defender) Bicycling terminology Differential (mechanics) Four wheel drive Shaggy dog story 24 Hours of Le Mans Combine harvester Unicycle Turbocharger Steering Drifting (motorsport) Bicycle helmet Track cycling Lance Armstrong Aerial (dance move) Penny-farthing Tire Sport utility vehicle Rugby union positions Transportation of Los Angeles BMW De Lorean DMC-12 Shifter (bicycle part) Speed of light Ford Thunderbird Indianapolis 500 Toyota MR2 Shimano Nissan Skyline Honda CX series Horse Electrophysiology Volleyball Windsurfing Gear ratio Top Gear B-47 Stratojet Tractor Segregated cycle facilities Individual time trial Utility cycling Track bicycle Stage (bicycle race) Radio controlled airplane Ford Falcon Diesel engine Paragliding Professional wrestling attacks Kitesurfing Badminton 2000 Australian Grand Prix Star Wars: Battlefront Tour de France Lawn mower Dodge Charger Strap-on dildo Internal ballistics Automatic transmission BMW M5 Emergency brake Cog railway
