help with bike chain okay soim going todescribe everything to you i was riding and i wasnt paying attention and i ran onto a curb hard then i started going down a hill and i realized i had a flat on the wheel that hit the curb so i proppeed my back wheel up and started walking it home upward so the pooped tire wouldnt run along the strrets then my backtire blew out too soo i had to finish walking home with too flats i changed the backtire with a new inner tube but i patched the front one it worked so now i just had to put the chain back on and when i rode i complety like tangled up and fell so now its hangin off and i cantt fingure out what to do so ima give you all some pics so you can see more thanxs http i photobucket com albums aa x xsickofthisscenex x pics jpg http i photobucket com albums aa x xsickofthisscenex x pics jpg http i photobucket com albums aa x xsickofthisscenex x pics jpg http i photobucket com albums aa x xsickofthisscenex x pics jpg great pics nice little ride by the way you have no problem with the chain there you have likely figured that out by now to untangle that chain do it without the rear wheel installed be very careful untangling that chain if you put too much lateral pressure on it anywhere you will bend a link in the chain untangling that chain means to make a continuous circle out of it again it looks like you can get some of it back on the front chain ring do this now with that half of the chain out of the way start pulling the remaining portion of the chain apart using up and down movements only do not put pressure sideways on the chain you hit hard enough to pop the tire you may have hit hard enough to damage the rear wheel make sure that it is still true straight and that there isn't a break in the actual rim furthermore if you lost your temper and maybe bent the chain you can check by watching for stuck links prior to making your final chain adjustments leave the chain a little loose while the back wheel is installed slowly pedal the bike and watch for links that once they go around a round part want to stay stuck like that between your gearing if you have a sticky link or two replace the chain i just remembered that that chain has a master link can you tell which one that is it is a link that looks just like every other one except that it has a clip on it remove the clip and take the chain apart it will make untangling it much easier and installing it easier too Bicycle Bicycle brake systems Motorcycle Drill bit Mountain bike Tire Professional wrestling holds Car handling Bicycle frame Equine conformation Recumbent bicycle Poker jargon Skateboarding trick Sailing Aerial (dance move) Racing bicycle Manual transmission Fixed-gear bicycle Horse gait De Lorean DMC-12 Textile manufacturing Knife Indianapolis 500 M16 (rifle) Glossary of climbing terms Naval mine Fast bowling Differential (mechanics) Internal ballistics Journey (band) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Boxing Backstroke Kitesurfing Professional wrestling throws Four wheel drive Horse Brewery Glossary of American football Drifting (motorsport) Shaggy dog story Anchor Lawn mower Bicycle wheel Heinkel He 112 Transmission (mechanics) Electrophysiology Violin Strap-on dildo Motocross Bubble Bobble Cycling Messerschmitt Bf 109 Bicycle lighting Pottery GunZ The Duel Mattress Heinkel He 100 Tricycle Mitsubishi 3000GT Tank Glossary of nautical terms Caterpillar track Professional wrestling slang Tenshinhan Wheel of Fortune Chevrolet Corvair Time Out of Mind Arado Ar 80 The Price Is Right Guilty Gear Bon Jovi Semi-trailer Jackass: The Movie Carburetor Mazda Miata Derailleur gears Escape from New York Taikyoku shogi Bike lane debate Professional wrestling attacks Baseball Mario Kart: Double Dash!!
