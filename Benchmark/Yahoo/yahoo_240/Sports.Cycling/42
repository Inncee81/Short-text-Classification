whats with bicycle groups clubs riding their bikes in the middle of the road i thought if they are supposed to go single file on major roads one of these days they're going to cause an accident then no one will be alloewed to ride on the road anymore i think they must have their spandex to tight or they are just inconsiderate the actual answer to your question is rooted in the psychology of group vs individual behavior also known as mob mentality a single cyclist will not ride down the center of the road because it will piss off motorists who will direct of their anger them it's also far more dangerous for the single cyclist that same person however will feel empowered within a group of other cyclists to usurp the road and do stupid things so your question boils down to why do people behave stupidly in the group first there is safety in numbers nobody can yell at just one cyclist if have taken over the road so the burden for personal responsibility is lessened when people can blame it on others or say everyone else is doing it that safety in numbers makes otherwise sensible people justify many types of inappropriate behavior even if that behavior is counter to the rules of self preservation now take the group dynamic i've just described and apply it to a typical cycling club anywhere in america they are mostly white middle aged middle to upper middle class cycling to them is a recreational hobby and not an athletic pursuit we've known them as posers yuppies on carbon and garden variety narcissists riding abreast gives them a chance to talk about their favorite subject themselves now what better venue could there be for a lycra preening narcissist than strutting down the center of the road where everyone has to acknowledge your very presence and existence functionally speaking anything beyond a single paceline is just stupid and dangerous keep the rubber side down Bike lane debate Bicycle Segregated cycle facilities Bicycle helmet Cycling Narcissism Motorcycle Vehicular cycling Critical Mass Mountain biking Social psychology Scientology beliefs and practices Psychology Effective Cycling Bicycle lighting Track cycling Cycle path debate Recumbent bicycle Utility cycling Microeconomics Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Bicycle frame Traumatic brain injury Karen Horney Autism Lance Armstrong Human sexual behavior Neuro-linguistic programming Theory of conduct Bipolar disorder Driving Altruism Asperger syndrome Domestic violence Narcissistic personality disorder A Course In Miracles Milton H.
