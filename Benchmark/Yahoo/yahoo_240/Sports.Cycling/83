will i ever get over the difficultness of riding a bike my husband and i ride miles a day almost every day the road neighborhoods we ride in are pretty hilly i can do miles in minutes so we keep a pretty good pace my husband can ride circles around me and he is years older than me it kills me to think that i can hardly keep up i have allergies and he doesnt seem to think that this should hinder my riding i think it is a contributing factor to my difficulties in riding my pelvic bone is always sore even with padded seats and bike shorts i am trying to toughen up am i just being a wimp i can work out in the gym and get this exhuasted he just seems to think that i am not trying hard enough if i try any harder i will vomit come on no one likes to do that i have been known to do that and continue to ride but that just isnt right is it ideas although he says once i overcome my difficulties with the course he will take me on longer level rides do you think this is the better course for me sorry i forgot to add that i am riding a nice trek moutain bike with tires for road and dirt cant remember the size or model but it was sized for me i do remember that to add more imformation as was pointed out to me i forgot to put what type of bike i ride a nice trek moutain bike it has road dirt tires on it it was fitted for me cycling is hard work you didn't mention what kind of bike you were riding as far as your pelvic bone hurting it could be the seat itself or the seat is not in the right position most bike shops these days have a pro on hand that can make adjustments to your bike to make it much more comfortable as far as being exhausted you might be riding in the wrong gears try these ideas when going up hills have the chain in the smallest chain ring in the front and one of the two biggest in the back when riding flat terrain have the chain in the smallest or middle chain ring in the front and one of the middle three gears in back when riding down hill have the chain in the biggest chain ring in front and one of the smallest gears in the back and always be in the right gear just before you know you are going to need it this will help keep the momentum also try to keep your rpm in the to range do this the same way you check your heart rate count the number of pedal strokes you make with your right pedal for seconds then multiply by your right pedal should make revolutions in seconds if it doesn't shift to an easier gear in the back until you can stay in that range if none of this works by a moped then tell your husband he's going to slow Bicycle Motorcycle Recumbent bicycle Mountain bike Bicycle frame Equine conformation Bicycle brake systems Lance Armstrong Triathlon Manual transmission Motocross Spinning (cycling) Bike lane debate Drag racing Mattress Snowboarding Car handling Skateboarding trick Fast bowling Tire Tour de France Honda CX series Weight training BMX Transmission (mechanics) Racing bicycle 2000 Australian Grand Prix De Lorean DMC-12 Prostate cancer First aid Helicopter Strap-on dildo All-terrain vehicle Timpani Vehicular cycling Fixed-gear bicycle Indianapolis 500 Toyota Prius Engine displacement RuneScape quests Guilty Gear Aerial (dance move) Bon Jovi Stage (bicycle race) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Violin Toyota Land Cruiser Drifting (motorsport) Tractor Kitesurfing B-47 Stratojet Adventure racing 24 Hours of Le Mans Poker jargon Grade (climbing) Diving Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Lighting Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Bicycle helmet Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Cyclo-cross Dodge Neon CPU cache GunBound Theory of conduct Hey Jude Ed, Edd n Eddy Dance Dance Revolution Mercedes-Benz A-Class Utility cycling Derailleur gears Inflation Harley-Davidson W.
