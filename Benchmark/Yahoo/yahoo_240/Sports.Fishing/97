what is the best fly pattern this time of year i know people say match the hatch but i dont know what the hatch is a link to a good pattern would be great p s i live in nh if that makes a difference living in nh the majority of your major hatches are over depending on the quality of the stream you may see some tricos and blue wing olives early in the morning and isonychias and golden stoneflys late in the day you may also have a white fly hatch at the end of the month caddis will abound all throughout the summer but they will be sporadic east coast trout fishing in the summer can be tough i live in pa due to the streams being gin clear and with genreally much less volume of water than the spring that's not to say you can't catch fish this is terrestrial time ant patterns both black and cinnamon griffith's gnat foam beatles i'm partial to the ones tied using peacock herl olive crackleback a good attractor pattern and a small adams parachute should take fish i also carry a generic white mayfly pattern with me as well as some small elk hair caddis and i never leave home without having some small bwo cdc comparaduns head out early in the morning and stalk the stream looking for risers it's not so much the pattern but the presentation i usually start out with an ant pattern if i don't see any tricos caddis or blue wing olives be observant try to see what the fish are rising for if you don't see any caddis blue wings or tricos there probably rising to terrestrials i would advise using a ft leader tapered to x or x on a or wt rod and make your casts count i've been doing this a long time and believe me trout are unforgiving in skinny water a cast where your line slaps the water and you may as well head upstream looking for another fish evening fishing can be fun if there is a hatch of iso's because they are generally large size and easy to see a chocolate comparadun is a good pattern for them if you see some stoneflys stimulator patterns work well don't be afraid of twitching the stimulator on the water you may get some vicious strikes when fishing these larger flys in the evening you can trim back you leader to ' and use a heavier tippet so you can see there is a difference between morning and evening normally the first hours of daylight are productive stoneflys iso's and the white fly won't come off until the last hour or so of the day but you may see some other activity prior to that if you want to fish subsurface i would look for the deepest parts of the stream and probe them with wooly buggers and nymphs check w your local flyshop they should carry the patterns i mentioned and should be able to tell you what hatches are on your local stream hope this helps and tight lines Trout Fly fishing Daylight saving time USS Ammen (DD-527) Macquarie Perch Charles Cotton USS Tunny (SS-282) Bird migration Casting Insect Wood Angling Textile manufacturing Murray Cod Poker jargon Fishing rod Salmon Paragliding Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Strap-on dildo Japanese tea ceremony Capercaillie Mercury Atlas 6 USS S-35 (SS-140) USS Yorktown (CV-10) Sea-Monkey Tai shogi Sand casting Mattress Hebrew calendar Knife Taikyoku shogi USS Trout (SS-202) USS Thresher (SS-200) CPU cache RuneScape quests Tide Fixed-wing aircraft Bladderwort STS-59 Hampshire County, West Virginia Fly Humpback Whale Diving Parachuting IND Chrystie Street Connection Ant Great Lakes 2005 Atlantic hurricane season Seine (fishing) International League Glacier National Park (US) Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Climate of the United Kingdom Stream Equine conformation Operation Market Garden Cat 2004 Atlantic hurricane season Ron and Fez USS Alden (DD-211) Comanche Extraterrestrial skies Transit of Venus Color Peafowl Colours, standards and guidons Aerial (dance move) USS Seadragon (SS-194) Antenna (radio) Mayfly Radio controlled airplane USS Wasp (CV-18) Platypus Television in the United States Parachute Bee The Den (television) Oasis (band) New York Rangers Fish farming Baseball Eldfell RuneScape economy Leopard USS Waters (DD-115) Toronto Blue Jays Buckingham Palace Lake Burley Griffin
