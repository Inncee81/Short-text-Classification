how can we help a child develop a positive view of britain as a multiracial multicultural society rolls eyes i have a genuine reason for asking this as i am adopting and filling in some forms i was interested in other peoples views besides my own and the silly answers just really emphasise the need for it to be asked in the first place please note multiracial multicultural does not mean muslims alone it can aslo mean french polish african asian etc this is such a hard question to answer our population here in the uk is so diverse and we are constantly reminded that we should have understanding and tolerance of other minority and cultural communities differences yet it is often very difficult to access these communities as language religion culture geography and more segregate us from each other we constantly see news articles hi lighted the differences and difficulties experienced between minority groups some of these differences cause certain groups to develop a fear of others which leads to further conflict and misunderstanding perhaps we as parents need to bring the political down to the personal level show children that we are all individual and different and in so many ways constantly talking to children in a positive way and being open to any negative responses they may have gleaned from their experiences outside of the home and turning them into positive reactions is important encourage social activity and interraction where ever possible with their peers and as a family take advantage of any friendships you have with families and individuals from minority communities to someone who is genuinely interested in their culture and beliefs your friends will no doubt happily answer any questions you may have a a result you may find invitations to attend cultural festivals these are always great experiences for children and serve to help a child understand that just because it's different it doesn't mean it's bad or to be feared as a child grows older the wider picture becomes more understandable to them but be prepared for anger and frustration my own children grew up in a very multicultural and multiracial environment with very little if any prejudices displayed by my friends and their families when they realised that prejudices did exist in society beyond their peer and family groups there were some very angry discussions and debates among their peers and with me as their mother they often watch the news with me and read between the lines and recognise those frustrations on a political level for all that though they have not become bitter they calmly challenge negative opinions and are very self assured i'm not sure if this helps you but i do wish you well with your application to adopt Multiculturalism Franz Boas Autism Asperger syndrome Liberalism Affirmative action Infantilism Religion Internet troll Alcoholics Anonymous Racism Black (people) Supernatural Deconstruction Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Janashakti Atheism Democracy Transsexuality Sexual orientation French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Propaganda Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Past teachings of Prem Rawat Hearing impairment Conservatism Homeschooling Philosophy Esperanto as an international language Opposition to cults and new religious movements Scientology beliefs and practices Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Narcissism Gender role Same-sex marriage Transactional analysis Multiracial A Course In Miracles Intelligent design movement Theory of conduct Abortion debate Status of religious freedom in France Melting pot Culture Domestic violence Religious Society of Friends Postmodernism Blue Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Marriage Social rule Human Social psychology Cultural relativism Fathers' rights Patriotism Reparative therapy Cult Martial art Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Economic inequality Feminism Philosophy of mathematics Moral Politics Civil rights Anti-Zionism Milton H.
