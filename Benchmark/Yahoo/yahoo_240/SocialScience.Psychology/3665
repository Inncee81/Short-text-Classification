winner for his groundbreaking research on human brain functions sperry was totally surprised to find that people had a tendency to use one hemisphere of the brain more than the other when sperry began his research in the early s the concept of selective bias in the use of one or the other side of the brain did not exist from his research he concluded that individuals were either predominantly left brain users or right brain users sperry had set out to localize the brain functions that is to determine which particular part or parts of the brain were involved in specific mental tasks thanks to his research we now know that the left brain hemisphere is predominantly involved in the mathematical logical analytic and academic tasks these tasks may involve linear thinking and making use of alphabets numbers scales lists etc the right brain hemisphere is involved predominantly in creative and artistic tasks which involve images colors shapes sounds rhythm etc the left brain is interested in details analyses and a detached intellectual perspective of events and experiences the right brain is interested in the whole rather than the details or the parts the right brain appreciates the sensuous philosophical and emotional aspects of our experiences the distribution of function between the right and the left brain soon caught the fancy of psychologists and educators however it now appears that we have overestimated the dichotomy between the left and the right brain furthermore this dichotomy is more prominent in the case of adults than of children when children explore an object they use all of their faculties they may touch the object at hand feel it see it from every angle and shake it to see if it makes any sound they are excited by colors shapes and movement and manipulate objects in several different ways at times to our delight and other times much to our annoyance but the fact is they are not merely using the left or the right brain but the whole brain such an approach has its advantages for example we adults marvel at how good children are with computers part of the reason is that their whole brain is involved in playing with computers as a result of that they learn and remember more than adults do memory works better when you use the whole brain take for example the task of memorizing a list of items suppose the list contains seven items namely a tree ladder pig table money candle and book you are asked to memorize the list of the seven items in the exact order as given if you tend to predominantly use the left side of the brain you will number each item and repeat the list to yourself a few times and thus commit the list to memory but there is a problem with this way of memorizing if you are a person with average memory after thirty minutes you may at the most remember four to five words but after a lapse of couple days you may remember at the most two or three items from that list suppose you try to memorize it in a different way this time in addition to the left brain you decide to involve your right brain as well this is how you do it involve the right brain in memorizing the list by being creative use your imagination add color and action make pictures in your mind's eye as you memorize the items all these are right brain activities so don't just repeat to yourself number one is tree number two is ladder instead visualize a huge strong and unique tree instead of a generic tree make it specific for example an oak tree see a ladder hanging down from the tree with bright colored rungs and on that ladder see a pig hanging upside down and swinging lo and behold the pig jumps down on the table and lands on the thick wad of money the pig lights a beautiful red colored sweet smelling candle and starts reading the book titled number seven use colors humor and action generously in the scene you draw in your mind to memorize in this fashion is to use the whole brain judge it for yourself as to which one is easier to retain in your memory if you memorize the list by involving your whole brain in this fashion you will remember the items in the exact order for a long time in fact it may be hard to forget it even you try to your brain is just like your car if the wheels on the left side of your car are in top condition but the right side wheels are jammed the car can't go very far you need both sides of the wheels turning together for an efficient ride likewise let the wheels of your mind the right side as well as the left side turn together so they can support each other Human
