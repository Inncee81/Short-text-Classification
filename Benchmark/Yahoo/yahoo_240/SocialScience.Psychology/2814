very serious best friend problems my best friend and i have been friends for a little over years now we have always done everything together and have never faught no matter what we always stayed best friends the small problem is she doesn't really think for herself the big problem is she moved away to college and roomed became friends with with some sad exuses for people since she doesn't think for herself she developed their personality the bigger problem is she dropped out of college to move back home and now there is nobody to do her thinking her intelligence level is so low now its very hard to have a conversasion with her on this level she also has a boyfriend who treats her like crap cheats on her breaks up with her when he's not right beside her for a week or two also has some intelligence problems plus he's cocky and shoots her down a lot he is no longer welcome at my house because of his antics she has become so different and strange she also has become judgemental and has developed a reasoning problem it has made my family get annoyed by her and not enjoy her and my entire family is very open we welcome anybody what do i do about this do i still keep her as a friend do i slowly stop hanging out with her i can't stand trying to converse with her anymore she's so different do you have any common ties with her family or yours or a third party you can counsel with together her communication and control issues are inevitably tied to her past patterns with her parents or family dynamic so what is their history can you use that to troubleshoot the patterns she is falling into now if you cannot be there physically to support her can you keep writing or sharing with her where your positive influence remains consistent can you do this freely without burdening yourself where you don't feel she is depending unnaturally on you can you urge her to get family counseling to avoid taxing your relationship with an unfair burden you can't handle so that you can continue your friendship without strain i think the solution to stabilizing her communication and behavior is to resolve whatever imbalanced relations she may have in her family past otherwise the same problems tend to project and repeat as a friend can you help her look into this and take it one step at a time until she can focus and work on her own my guess is that if she has no sense of will on her own little perception of her space and respect for her own control that would point to her relationship with her dad if she cannot communicate clearly and honestly but has emotional blocks i would guess that has something to do with her maternal relations are there any family members that you can see a connection to also if the guy has issues the same patterns might apply to him and his family all of this would require either counseling or willingness to take on personal change if you can find a way to explain the benefits of making those changes where she is not afraid but feels she has enough support to do that she may be more prepared to face up to it only she can make the choice and commitment to do so but it makes all the difference in the world to have a friend like you to walk with her through the worst stages until she can find her way out if you stay by her side you may keep your distance so you don't take on her burdens but i would encourage you not to give up as there is always a way through human behavior follows consistent patterns so once you see where the motivation to change is rooted when you guide someone in the right direction and it is the right answer for them the change starts to happen first in the heart and mind and then physically when applied to the situation if her case is too much for you i would suggest professional counseling if you cannot help her maybe someone else can Social rule Infantilism Alexander Technique Theory of conduct Domestic violence Neuro-linguistic programming Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Love Divorce Clinical depression Transactional analysis CPU cache Social psychology Fathers' rights Psychology Polyamory Abortion debate Extreme Programming Theodicy Microeconomics Human sexual behavior Prostate cancer Transsexuality Free will Equine conformation Friends Leadership Procrastination Aikido Autism Psychotherapy Calvin and Hobbes Franz Boas Philosophy of space and time Glossary of partner dance terms Alcoholics Anonymous Stuttering David Hume Pitaten Dog training Homosexuality and Christianity Narcissism Jacobo Arenas Past teachings of Prem Rawat Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Mediation Prisoner's dilemma Culture Craps Democracy Japanese tea ceremony A Course In Miracles Ethics W.
