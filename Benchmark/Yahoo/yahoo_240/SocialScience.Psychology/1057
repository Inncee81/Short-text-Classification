how do i stop thinking so much no matter how much i try i can't turn of my mind i think about problems all day non stop then when i go to sleep for some reason sleep cannot stop the thoughts splitting through my head i wake up about times a night then as soon as i wake up in the morning there is a problem there straight away and people keep telling me to stop thinking so much but i don't know how to stop i think when i watch films read books even when i'm having sex nothing stop them and i feel like i'm going to go mad i write them down in a book to try and vent them and that helps a little bit but i can't write everything down all day please help what is going on is that you have 'stress anxiety' and although you are not 'insane' it is a 'psychological condition' that can be successfully treated by both 'prescription medication' and by a 'change of lifestyle ' the first thing you need to do is go to your 'regular doctor' and discuss taking 'sleep meds' so you can get a full night's sleep then see if that doesn't offer you enough relief to 'stop the constant 'thinking' if it doesn't work then ask your doctor for some medication to take during the day to 'slow your mind down' enough for you to 'think properly ' you are not really 'just thinking' too much it's more a matter of 'thinking so fast and trying to deal with far too much information' for your 'short term memory' to keep up the short term memory only has the capability to process things at any one time the 'overage' gets sent to long term memory and the mind still wants to 'work on it' so you develop 'symptoms' of 'losing track of things to do' and that causes you more 'stress' so you get caught in a seeming 'never ending problem' you can stop this but you do need some 'help' until you can get your 'mind' and the 'file drawers' in it under control Insomnia Clinical depression Hypnosis Prostate cancer Urinary incontinence Post-traumatic stress disorder Sigmund Freud Chronic fatigue syndrome Schizophrenia Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Obsessive-compulsive disorder Bipolar disorder Sleep Anorexia nervosa Infantilism Procrastination Migraine Childbirth Psoriasis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Mental illness Psychosis Drug addiction Theory of conduct Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Narcolepsy A Course In Miracles Diazepam Medicine Dream Homophobia Oh My Goddess!
