tips for someone who was a big fish in a small pond going to a small fish in a big pond i used to be the gm of a small company but now i am one of production supervisors for a larger company and there are levels of bosses above me i am used to being the main guy and being in charge but now i cringe when i sit in a meeting that is going nowhere my wife was excited when i got the job because she thought i would no longer be thinking about work since i wasn't in charge but i still do and i mostly get frustrated any tips unfortunately it's something you're going to have to get used to moving into a bigger company i understand your cringing because larger companies make more and for lack of a better word dumber decisions as they say too many cooks spoil the soup or too many chiefs and not enough indians well you know what i mean about the only thing you can do is to speak up at the meetings as long as you're not being disrespectful they have no choice but to listen and consequently voice their opinions and besides it is better to speak up now and then so they take notice of your involvement in the end you may end up a bit higher on the ladder Steve Jobs Chopsticks Spidey Super Stories Time Out of Mind Humphrey Bogart Champagne (beverage) Little Britain Avenue Q Vowel W.
