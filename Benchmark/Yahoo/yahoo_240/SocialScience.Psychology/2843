ocd and left handed people i read someones answer before and they said ocd is related to to much left side of the brain so something is this true if so would that mean right handed people have a high risk of ocd left handed people are usually better at art because they use the right side of their brain which is the 'arty' side while right handed people are better at science because they use the left side of their brain more that's what i'm basing this question on by the way i'm left handed too and i don't have it well nothing more serious than my tv volume having to be on an even number but apparently i'm just being 'silly' haha i'm right handed and have alot of ocd behaviours i am not terribly creative i'm not too sure of your theory though i've read alot about ocd and have not heard this before interesting Obsessive-compulsive disorder Left-handed Psychology Psychosis General intelligence factor Motivation Free will Tourette syndrome Consciousness Magical thinking Handedness Philosophy of perception Donald Davidson (philosopher) Autism Aphasia Milton H.
