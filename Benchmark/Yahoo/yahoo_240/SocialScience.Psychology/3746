someone please make me feel better i made the biggest mistakes of my life last year in that year alone i managed to somehow become an addict lose my virginity to a completely jerk lose contact with lifelong friends and completely flunk all my classes thus getting suspended from my college for the next year today my wonderful beautiful perfect older sister left to go back to college and i'm home alone feeling like a complete failure in life and just hating everything about me i've ruined everything i've ever stood for and i don't even know why i'm so stupid and right now i just wish i was anyone else but me my dad told me last night that i am the biggest disappointment of his life my sister tried to comfort me by the usual things will get better but they won't because the past won't go away and i'm stuck with this forever i just hate me right now and i am so ashamed of myself and i live in a house where i'm constantly reminded of my mistakes and how worthless i am i did that exact same thing as i am very sure many others have i would say you are in a better position than your sister is she may have the ability to go to school but that is not a very valueable skill to have in life as school doesn't teach you street smarts you are whether you realize it or not smarter in a sence of real world skills the perspective you have now is more valuable because you have gained a different level of understanding and comppassion for other people i feel the whole experience changed my oppinions to a less biased and nonjudgmental twords other people and ultimatly has made it easier to make friends protect myself from con men which has also resulted in my ability to help others to overcome their problems never look back forward and judge yourself because you are not looking at the lessons that you have learned if you were to stay in a little bubble and never make mistakes you will never learn or grow as they are the teachers of life skills that make you a better deeper and smarter be wrong and then learn from it beating yourself up will only make the ability to learn the lessons much harder which could make you try to block it out or deni what you have done and you will just end up making the same mistakes over and over again you are young and you do have your whole life ahead of you this is a very small part and in the big picture of your whole life is not that big you could have been just like your father so lacking in perspective and emotions that he can't even figure out how to treat or probably raise children that was very disgusting what he said and you should not listen to him he is just blaming you for his mistakes and really feels bad that he wasn't a better father in the first place your father is really dissappointed in himself addiction is in your mind and if you want to you can change that and no one will remember or hold it against you later if you want to go to school try a different one but don't worry you could be like my sister who is years older than me and favored by my parents she couldn't tell that the college she was going to was a scam and when she went to get a job after graduating the potential employer told her she didn't have a real degree and had to do it again she was so mad at me at the time but now looks up to me for knowledge and support as for your friends they should be better than that you can do better they are lacking in feelings and the jerk was an attempt to get positive male attention or love because your father was not able to so of course you turned to other people even if they were not the best love yourself you deserve it and learn from your mistakes One Tree Hill (TV series) Kodocha EastEnders Humphrey Bogart Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pitaten Ranma __ characters Jon Secada W.I.T.C.H.
