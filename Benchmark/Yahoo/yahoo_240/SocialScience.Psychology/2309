how to do this self talk thing people have suggested that i start the self talk thing because i think i hate myself and i hate the way i look with my glasses on and hate myself for all the bad stuff i've done whether it was in my control or not so suggestions on how to talk to myself i feel weird talking to myself out loud i find it hard to love others that hurt others and hurt me but it's easy to love others who are kind is that because i hate myself suggestions i'm and not overweight or anything lol self talk does not mean talking out loud to yourself if you pay attention to your thoughts you will find that there are words going on in your head to feel better about something you first need to recognize the negative things you are thinking about that something then you need to evaluate to decide if what you are thinking makes sense if not you need to consciously think something else for example if you constantly think i'm so ugly every time you catch yourself thinking that you think something like well maybe i'm not absolutely beautiful but i'm still nice looking Theory of conduct Avenue Q Transactional analysis Shaggy dog story Garfield Blood on the Tracks Sant Mat Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Philosophical skepticism Evil Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Procrastination The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy The nature of God in Western theology Hey Jude Goodness and value theory Kodocha Urusei Yatsura Socrates David Hume Karen Horney Nine Inch Nails Pure Pwnage Nineteen Eighty-Four Sufism Friends Mojave people Fruits Basket One Tree Hill (TV series) God Time Out of Mind Pitaten Sigmund Freud Scenes from a Memory Anne Rice Social rule Homophobia The Smoking Room Sin City Milton H.
