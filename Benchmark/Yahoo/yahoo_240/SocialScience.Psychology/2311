rebuilding my personality okay so here's my question how do you rebuild your personality a few years ago i tried to act all sarcastic and indifferent i decided i wanted to change so last year i was the exact opposite plesant agreeable happy i came to realize though that i had absolutely no personality what so ever now i feel like i'm finally just being myself but what i'm worried about is not having a good personality any suggestions this is a good question you must have favorite tv people or someone who you admire or others who you can copy just the personality trait that you want from them and not their whole entire personality when you have to react to something chose the personality you want to imitate and go for it eventually these will be your traits Goodness and value theory Theodicy Transsexuality Alignment (role-playing games) Meme Theory of conduct Big five personality traits Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Gender role Personality psychology Supply and demand Rei Ayanami Kender Shaggy dog story God Emperor of Dune Microeconomics Rudolf Hermann Lotze U.S. Electoral College Whose Line Is It Anyway?
