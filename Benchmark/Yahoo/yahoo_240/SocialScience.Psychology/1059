some people claim to be very rich are they showy only yes there are plenty of people who will drop their whole paycheck on nice cars designer clothes fancy nail jobs and other mostly inconsequential crap but when you see where they live you know they're anything but wealthy usually when these people open their big mouths you can tell right away they don't really have money class can't be bought i love when i see people driving a brand new lexus into some really dumpy part of town seems kind of strange that people value what kind of car they drive over where they live also in general people who actually have a lot of money don't talk about it openly some may display it with classy clothes and a luxury car but the ones with any decency or self respect never throw it in someone's face Shaggy dog story Craps Mercedes-Benz Sears Holdings Corporation Dice Theory of conduct Microeconomics Hush...
