do people turn violent due to insecurities for example if an argument starts up and someone ends up throwing a punch is it because they just ran out of arguments and it's their primitive instinct to defend themselves from verbal onslaught or is it their own subconscious way of dealing with insecurities after being defeated in an argument my point is people shouldn't be hurt by words sticks and stones i don't get how anyone could turn violent over the use of words violence has many causes the fist fight example you gave could depending on the perspective be quite normal for a person's background the aggressor might have felt provoked by needling or personal attacks in place of logical arguement the presentation of the logic might have been percieved as pushing something down the other's throat insecurity is another possible cause if the aggressor lacks confidence then being attacked in an area they derive confidence from could unravel their cool men when they meet either conciously or sub conciously evaluate each other's prowness at arms this establishes a sort of instinctive pack heirarchy and when one who is viewed as lower in the pack by the other attempts to upsurp it can seen as a challenge the natural resolution is to prove which is higher in the pack rankings through a trial by arms of some sort or simply put by attempting to deck the other guy the aggressor might have been boiling over from unrelated disputes and the timing of the arguement was just bad luck if the aggressor is going through a divorce worried about job money or other things of great importance lacking good sleep then gets into an arguement they will have a much shorter fuse and it may be completely unrelated to the other person in fact the other person might be a close friend but the spark comes from an arguement the two might even agree on the big concepts and be argueing tiny differences in detais the aggressor might have just come from a very aggressive event they may be pumped and still mentally in the arena they just left for example a cop just coming off duty who was involved in an altercation an athelete just coming out of a competition it might be the aggressor works in a highly aggressive field and the pep talks really do leave them high strung for a bit even after leaving the work place there might be maturity issues involve that lead to the inability to appropriately distinguish between threat and discorse between difference of opinion and mockery there's an old saying dem's fighting words each man carries with him an invisible line that if you cross is a provocation they cannot ignore incidental wording in the arguement might have trigged an instinctive response as the aggressor may feel that their ethnicitie religion social class or other valued group membership has been dishonored by what seemed an innocious comment last there's one up manship the crossing of verbal sabers after a point there is always esculation just as there is esculation from fists to rock from rock to knife from knife to gun if the provocation is sufficient if one member of the arguement turns the arguement into personal attacks the other is quite likely to feel a need to respond with more than verbal retaliation the one upmanship tactic often leads to arguements turning into personal attacks or the insertion of derogatory remarks about the other even if both remain above such childish behavior the raw intensity can easily reach a point where offense is given by one requiring a satisfaction of honor Rape Martial art Internet troll Aikido
