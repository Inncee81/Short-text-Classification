why do some people suddenly remove their psychosocial questions when i have an answer for depression and suicide related questions i answer with sincerity and hope my experiences can help a brother or a sister in their vulnerable time a few times now when i go to enter my answer the screen shows that the person has withdrawn their question i know it's a free world but i just wanted to let those people know it is like a kick in the stomach when they disappear i wouldn't be answering your question if i didn't care when you disappear i always hope you are ok but i also know there is nothing i can do if you are not please let your question stand until you pick an answer there could be more good done for more people if they could read any helpful information that you have received p s whatever else may happen i hope you get well soon contrary to popular belief most people are only in anything for themselves they ask a question and everything is cool until they get an answer they don't like it makes them feel funny and they remove it it's not about other people's feelings to them it's about their own Theory of conduct Social rule Stomach cancer Theodicy Shaggy dog story Borderline personality disorder Big Brother (USA TV series) Current teachings of Prem Rawat Game show Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Free will Philosophical skepticism Social psychology Piccolo Junior Saga You Don't Know Jack The Catcher in the Rye Transsexuality Match Game Sharon Tate Kurt Cobain Altruism Family Feud Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Russian joke EastEnders Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Apprentice 2 Sexual orientation Joke Good Morning, Vietnam Goodness and value theory Graham Kennedy The nature of God in Western theology Friends Socrates The 64,000 Dollar Question Autism Supernatural Transactional analysis Mojave people Whose Line Is It Anyway?
