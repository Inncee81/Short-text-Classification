so they think they know what true love is why is it that teenagers like myself always say they know what love is i think its just heavy liking with the combination of our raging hormones why do teenagers say they know when theyre in love it feels like love but is it romeo and juliet could that have been avoided somehow what about those of us that do know what love is and have went through a hell of a lot to get to the point where we are do we just get dismissed as hormones and are never able to open up to the outside world in fear that those people will so easily reject our love based on their perception that at the age of most teenagers love is just an illusion perplexed by raging hormones and uncontrolable desires and lusts how many adults out there have taken the time to finally realize that love is a choice have you ever wondered why there are so many divorces because most adults never wake up and smell that love is a choice based on the fact that you want to make a long and lasting commitment with someone some dismiss love as a feeling and then feel justified by telling their spouse that the feeling is lost no that is not love that was lust a lust and infatuation that was so strong that the person mistaked it for love and never made the choice in his her mind that of all the people she he is the one they want and no one else despite their flaws like and lust cannot be controlled but love is a choice and sometimes we never make that choice and mistake lust for love and when it wears off that is it maybe that is why our parents who do know what love is tell us that there is all the time in the world because some never learn this while others learn it at an early age love cannot be dismissed because of young age and then later justified because someone is older it is all about the two individuals in the situation at the present time and whether or not those two people realize love is more than just a mere emotion it is a life long choice and commitment p s years of life might not be a lot in some people's eyes but my years on this planet have taught me a lot Love Polyamory A Course In Miracles One Tree Hill (TV series) Alignment (role-playing games) Transactional analysis Transsexuality Infantilism Homosexuality and Christianity Pitaten Epistemology Marriage Hulk (comics) Sin Juliet Avenue Q Romeo and Juliet Domestic violence Daredevil Statutory rape Sexual orientation Grief Motivation Darth Vader W.I.T.C.H.
