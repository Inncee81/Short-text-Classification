religion i have my own system of beliefs and i reject all orthodox faiths i refuse to accept societal values and laws as an absolute moral authority that must be abided by and recognize it as tools to facilitate stability deter chaos and i abhor those that object to my activities ie stealing solely on the basis of this i despise everyone who blindly follows christianity i feel the teachings should only be used to encourage virtues of goodness and that society should depend instead on great thinkers like socrates plato aristotle etc etc to mold their lives religion should be emancipated from these superstitous rituals and be founded on reason rather than tradition i'm not claiming i hold some objective truth and everyone else is wrong but whenever i try to communicate this to the religious people i know they tell me how they live by faith or some equally subjective answer my question is am i fucking crazy perhaps i'm missing something here no you are not crazy i can't think of anything off the top of my head that would qualify you as crazy out of the dsm just based on your personal views perhaps it is not you who has the problem maybe those who you are trying to express your opinions to aren't receptive to alternative opinions regarding religion Religion Friedrich Schleiermacher Atheism Ethics Jewish principles of faith Roman Catholic Church Moral objectivism Human Philosophy Social justice Separation of church and state Meaning of life Soul Plato Religious pluralism Morality Aristotle Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Goodness and value theory Ten Commandments Abortion debate Sexual orientation Jewish philosophy Ethics in religion Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Socratic method Judaism Liberal Christianity Confucianism S__ren Kierkegaard Baptism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Reincarnation Nicomachean Ethics New Testament Baptist Satanism Existence of God Theory of conduct Conservatism God Fundamentalism Phaedo Creationism Freemasonry Halakha Patriotism Western philosophy Atomism Objectivist philosophy Who is a Jew?
