people lead a better life now as compare to the past what is your stand please eleborate or list your points both arguement counter arguement thanks in advance much appreciated i can write an entire paper on this one i believe that some lead an easier life than in the past due to financial stability and the options offered to people for college and in the job market today but not neccessarily a better life bc they forget the things that are the most important in life such as family and spending time with others they are bombarded by things to do and places to go they let work and society interfere with what they do and who they are they seem to live more by what society says than they do by what they feel they should live by this has created a loss of morals and values in many before it was hard work that got you what you needed and wanted in life and it seems now that it is more of leading someone in the wrong direction in order for them to buy from you or give you something you want instead of people working for things they are just handed to them instead and this makes for less appreciation for what they possess so i would say that the past was probably the better life instead of the present there are exceptions though people know more about the medical fields which leads to better care and there are rehabs everywhere for drug addicts to help them overcome their problems this would be leading a better life than in the past Theory of conduct Unemployment IBM PC compatible Ethics Goodness and value theory Economic inequality Arguments for and against drug prohibition Drug addiction Microeconomics One Tree Hill (TV series) Software engineering Social rule Value system Capitalism Health insurance Procrastination Economics Redundant array of independent disks Floppy disk Abortion debate Anarchism and society Rudolf Hermann Lotze Infantilism Socrates Sexual orientation Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Transsexuality Jacobo Arenas Lincoln-Douglas Debate Brave New World Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Charles Dickens Publicly funded medicine Public policy Education in the People's Republic of China Canadian and American health care systems compared Inflation Science Alcoholism Criticism of libertarianism Burkhard Heim Bernard Williams Addiction Supply and demand Linked list Money Drug abuse Mediation Altruism Cryonics Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stock Moral Politics Humphrey Bogart Sexual addiction Medicine Drug policy of the Netherlands Medical prescription Nuclear fusion S__ren Kierkegaard Arturo Frondizi Free trade Utilitarianism Independence Party (Iceland) Insurance W.
