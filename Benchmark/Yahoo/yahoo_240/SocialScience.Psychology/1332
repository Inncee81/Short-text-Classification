is this crazy or has someone else felt this way lately i live in a constant state of worry fear and distrust everything i say i regret for fear it will be misunderstood or used to backstab me in some way i don't trust people including my friends and boyfriend not to betray me talk about me behind my back or hurt me in some way i am afraid of being alone forever but at the same time it seems like it would be a relief because no one could hurt disappoint or abandon me i even feel like i will let my family down at some point and they will turn on me i worry about what people will think read into actions and get worked up over things i know are stupid i know someone will say get meds or just get over it but its really not that simple i have tried prayer talking to my dad trying to get my mind off of it but its still there i am still constantly dreading the next bad event betrayal or disappointment what in the world can i do i am only i don't want to live the rest of my life like this the only person you can trust is yourself trust no one that doesn't mean that you have to be alone enjoy the company of other but don't trust them but first you have to get a good job and be independent financially first for example if your boyfriend betray you so what there are ten of thousands of available men out there keep on dating don't be alone but don't put to much trust in people because most people are selfish you will be disappointed if you do however you have to have something to offer life is a two way street if you have nothing to offer they will leave you good luck Social rule One Tree Hill (TV series) American Dad!
