i am and having my st kid in weeks i am really scared i am so scared i'm about to have a kid i don't even know if i want her i know that is a bad thing to say but i had a really bad experience while pregnant i don't know if i can do this being a single young mother i do not think i was ready for a child the father is not supportive so it hurts even more i think she deserves better then what i can give her i try to be positive about the situation but tears bring my joy down everyday some say i will not be able to party or date that my life is over and i made a big mistake by not getting an abortion i am starting to feel this way to i do not know what to do i know if i give her up for adoption my family and peers will look down on me the father says its my fault and i have to live with the consequences and that i can't date or go out that my life is over and tells me i can't raise this child i need some serious advice i feel like i am losing it ok stop and take a deep breath it isn't as bad as you think the people that say you won't be able to party and life is over are the same ones who say get married settle down have kids having kids isn't being settled down by any means people are just stupid and label things they don't know i don't know why children are labeled as problems today they are blessings and wonderful yes your life will change but it can and does change for the better yes you have to grow up a tat faster than you may otherwise but you know what i see year olds who are single and in the party lifestyle that seem like that are immature self centered brats living with their parents i'm and have children they are all wonderful be sure before you take advise to adopt out your child you'll never get the baby back people will hit you up with money problems and take advantage of you hold strong to who you are the people who say you can't date and life is over are absolutely horrendous perhaps a mom shouldn't party but that's pretty immature anyway i take a mom out on dates all the time is a very tough time it's move out or college time people get pregnant life hits your real fast and hard at that stage i lived in my car at i had nothing and thought of killing myself often i had nobody no family no nothing today by god's grace i have a wife and beautiful children and a decent home i'm not trying to sound braggish but i know what it's like to be and feel horribly confused and hopeless and under a ton of stress hang in there make smart decisions think of your child as a blessing rather than trouble my best advice is never do any drugs drink smoke or anything like that make smart decisions with money living situations don't worry about dating many women date with kids there are plenty of people that do that i know of different people who have been married in their mid 's who had and children each abandon anybody who is ugly to you about it ask for more stregth from people who support you encourage your parents to be supportive sometimes life doesn't give you ideal circumstances with children but it is their legacy their grandchild remember that women all through history had children often much younger at it was common for year olds to marry society is what puts this stress on us hang in there don't jump on the adoption idea fast have the baby first then decide after about months if you wish to adopt don't sign papers until you experience the love a mother can give give at least months post birth so you can experience the mom thing at first it's tough but after weeks you get strong bonds to the baby stay positive i never went to college and am still surviving decently remember the advice i'm giving you is coming from a guy who had a shotgun under his chin in under a tree off a farm road after being kicked out of my home with nothing give yourself a break don't worry about what others think of you again make smart strategic decisions based on both your feelings and logic drop a line anytime you want to email crasster yahoo com One Tree Hill (TV series) Friends Humphrey Bogart Kodocha Knots Landing Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Jon Secada Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Tupac Shakur Abortion debate Laura Schlessinger Breastfeeding Alcoholics Anonymous The Marshall Mathers LP The Fairly OddParents Avenue Q Transactional analysis Infantilism Kyle Broflovski Narcissism 2000 Australian Grand Prix Frankie Laine The nature of God in Western theology The Critic About a Boy The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Poker jargon Ty Cobb The Inside Recurring South Park characters Ranma __ characters Ayyavazhi mythology Equine conformation Eric Cartman Fathers' rights Milton H.
