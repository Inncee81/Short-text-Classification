a question about remote neural monitoring i know someone who is convinced he has a chip in his head and that it was place there by someone who wanted to control his mind i'm sure this is not the case with him but i have seen a lot of programs who claim this practice is happening through a government program my question is have the government ever admitted being involed in this project or are the program makers all paraoid schitzophrenics i don't know if i believe such a thing is happening but i do believe that it could i would certainly think twice before automatically dismissing it just because it sounds bizarre i have heard it said that the more fantastic and unbelievable a conspiracy is the better its chances of succeeding because no one would believe it even if it were exposed and there probably is a modicum of truth in that statement one thing that is certain our government is not the good guys they are not morally and ethically above such a thing if they found a reason to want to do it the first thing your friend needs to do is go to a doctor he can trust and have it physically checked out if that is not possible and maybe even if it is he should seek out a competant hypnotherapist who can find the root of this belief if there really is something there a good hypnotherapist can find out when how and by whom it was implanted if there isn't then he she can find out what has led your friend to believe that there is in any case it will give you and your friend the answer s you both seek there is another possibility i will not go into in detail i will just suggest you or your friend obtain and read a book titled ce vi close encounters of the possession kind by dr william j baldwin this is probably out of print as dr baldwin is now deceased but it can still be gotten on amazon com and probably at a better price than you'd have to pay if you could find it in a second hand bookstore Hypnosis Plame affair Philosophical skepticism Milton H.
