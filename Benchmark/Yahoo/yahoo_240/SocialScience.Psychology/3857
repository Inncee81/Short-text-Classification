people say i do not care and don't take things seriously like at job interviews i care about job interviews but i always don't do well and they think i don't care or don't take it seriously i try to but i laugh at the most inopportune moments is this normal you may have some nervous reactions to certain questions my advice is to practice your interviewing skills ask a friend to ask you typical questions that they may ask you in an interview and plan out what you would say until you stop doing things like that the more confidence and professional you are no matter what the job unless it's chucky cheese the more likely you'll get the job Social rule Milton H.
