i had a dream with pokemon in them and i don't know why it was just so random and i really don't know why i dreamt it well paige this is a very interesting dream when i first saw the question i thought it may be a random dream you see there are actually more to dreams than just revealing denied emotions yes it's true sometimes dreams are random figures of imagination sometimes this happens because we have had a lot going on in our day but this dream is different especiacally when i saw the answers already posted on your question i see that marh used to like pokemon along with you in your past this might have some connection to mark perhaps you were just thinking about the good times you had together another reason you might have had this dream was because there was a trigger perhaps you recently saw a commercial for pokemon you might not have thought much of it then but that stayed in your subconscious and was released in your dream maybe it was something even more subtle then a commercial whatever it was it'll probably be hard to track the good news is it probably occured the day before the dream i hope this helps and keep the questions com'n Unconscious mind Free will Missingno.
