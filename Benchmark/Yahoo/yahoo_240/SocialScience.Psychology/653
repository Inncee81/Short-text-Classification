what's the worst nightmare you've ever had jude that's a scary one the worst one i've had those dreams before i think they make you appreciate your kids more i had this dream when i was about and oddly enough it was a few weeks before my mother was murdered the dream was a bit fuzzy and all over the shop but he gist was a young girl had been murdered on the beach near my house and for some reason i had to investigate the crime i was handed a photo of the dead girl and she had a knife through her head i can still see the picture now suddenly the girl's eyes opened and she reached out of the photo and grabbed me i almost wet the bed i woke up in a right state and it affected my sleep for ages i get nightmares all the time many are about poltergeists and really scary things but that dream will always stick in my mind as it was so vivid Dream The Shining (film) Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Lucid dreaming Sin City Wes Craven's New Nightmare Sleeping Murder The Amber Spyglass The Inside EastEnders Prank flash The Tracey Ullman Show shorts Out-of-body experience Shaggy dog story Characters of The Sandman The Lovely Bones A Nightmare on Elm Street (series) W.I.T.C.H.
