how to deal with a sarcastic person how do you get a sarcastic person to stop being sarcastic and speak sensibly have them visit dr phil lol but seriously speaking it's a self defense mechanism it can be funny when used properly and at the right time but some make it their entire life and use it to put others down to them make themselves feel better usually sarcastic people are overweight and are insecure about their weight some people use it to try to sound intelligent and or witty but they dont realize that it turns people off and sometimes it's just not funny at all i would try to find out what insecurities your friend or what is troubling him or her maybe you can try just to be there for that person and help them with their issues Social rule The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe The Catcher in the Rye Doug W.I.T.C.H.
