how does really being in love affect your everyday life how has it made you a better person i heard a beautiful saying once a long time ago a sorrow shared is half a sorrow but a joy shared is twice a joy that is so true love does make the good times twice as good and the bad times only half as bad if love had no effect on life beyond just that it would be enough to make it the most precious commodity in the universe but it does go beyond even that wonderful point it does make those who experience it better people because it inspires better attitudes and better attitudes lead to better actions it is so much easier to be kind thoughtful considerate and tolerant and all these things one should be when these values are inspired by love for someone and be the wonderful knowledge that you yourself are loved as well as creating a desire to bring positive things into the life of the person you love knowing that they love you creates a desire to live up to their loving image of you Goodness and value theory Social psychology Current teachings of Prem Rawat Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Jon Secada Coercion Socrates Time Out of Mind Summa Theologiae Wolfrider Aesthetic Realism Jiddu Krishnamurti One Tree Hill (TV series) Happiness Duties of the Heart Philipp Melanchthon Holy Spirit Supply and demand Theory of conduct Nicomachean Ethics Karma Evil Israel ben Eliezer Sin Human Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Rudolf Hermann Lotze Scenes from a Memory Slavoj __i__ek Philosophy Mortification of the flesh Polyamory Lucille Ball Ten Commandments Power (sociology) Predestination Michel Henry Love Simone Weil Cliff Richard Joy Division (band) Religion Sheikh Abdullah Bhajan Meaning of life Blood on the Tracks Value Eastern Orthodox Church Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Ethics The nature of God in Western theology Past teachings of Prem Rawat Patriotism Deaf culture Epistemology Buddhism Pitaten Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Bernard Williams Supernatural Mojave people Arthur Machen Sexual orientation Justification (theology) S__ren Kierkegaard Novel Repentance Social rule Alcoholics Anonymous Origin belief Wealth Child sexuality Value system Johann Wolfgang von Goethe Opus Dei Sesshomaru Swami Vivekananda Theodicy Gollum Sexual revolution Infantilism Objectivist philosophy Friendship The Yeomen of the Guard Numerology Pashtunwali Capital punishment Magical thinking Wassily Kandinsky Charles Goodyear Free will Scientific method The Book of Five Rings Muslim ibn Aqeel Yehuda Halevi Fernando Pessoa K' Joy to the World Stoicism Expert system
