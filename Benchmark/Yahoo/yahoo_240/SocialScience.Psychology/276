what good does it do to call someone 'shy' seriously i will admit that i am shy but i hate being called shy that is like the worst thing ever i mean what good does it do a person to just blurt out after like five minutes of meeting you that you're shy duh captain obvious bluntly stating facts here i mean people don't say you're loud i just don't get it because all i know is that once someone calls me shy or says something about it then that just makes me not want to talk around them even more i'm sick of people judging i don't understand what good it does i already know i am shy i don't see why those things can't be kept to yourself do people do it just to feel superior because they can 'talk' or what i just don't get it at all what is so bad about being shy why do people have to state it and mention it all the time in my mind it does no good i've been called horrible things and mute even and it really just hurts if people would wait more than a minute and give me a chance thank you to all who answered all the answers are so good i can't even choose between them thanks again introverted or shy have negative connotations for no reason as you have found out there is a lot of pressure to be out going your shyness is a problem to extraverts if someone is rude enough to make a comment like you're shy you could always agree with them yes i am and i think i need some alone time right now let them find someone else with whom to interact Social rule Theory of conduct Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Sydney Riot of 1879 Transactional analysis Goodness and value theory Dilbert Asperger syndrome Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Ashlee Simpson Show The nature of God in Western theology Time Out of Mind Sant Thakar Singh Current teachings of Prem Rawat A Course In Miracles Alignment (role-playing games) Utilitarianism Bill O'Reilly (commentator) Sexual orientation Singlish Kasparov versus The World Philosophy of language W.I.T.C.H.
