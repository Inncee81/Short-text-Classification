do you consider your parents to having been a good mother and father and if not what did they do wrong s jeez it's not that just coz they fed you and didn't abort you or soak you up in gasoline and set you on fire they have been good parents do you realise this no i was a 's child and if you think that what rose and fred west did was bad then you need to think some more i am lucky to be alive they abused both me and my sister and to date have got away with it we were taking physical and mental abuse without going into detail it was horror and i still have counselling today in those days all the police could do was return you to your parents and tell them to leave you alone of course as soon as they have gone the beatings etc started before they were at the end of the path i have thoughts of getting my own back on them all the time especially as in the last few years i have found that my sister was actually sexually abused as well the tragedy of all this is that i now consider myself to have no family it wasn't even my real mum that was abusing me it was a step mum and her children who lived with us were treated well the only comforts i had were from two teachers from my junior school and i will never forget them and be eternally grateful if the law was changed so that parents who have physically and mentally abused children in the past could be prosecuted i would certainly go ahead until then i have to control my thoughts and muddle through life the best i can i would like to offer my sympathies and thoughts to all those children out there who are secretly abused by their parents and families i could continue for ages but i'll end it here now as it is starting to upset me EastEnders Kodocha About a Boy Child abuse Pitaten Domestic violence Knots Landing Scientology beliefs and practices Child pornography Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Friends Good Times Neighbours Abortion Abortion debate One Tree Hill (TV series) Sexual abuse Luke and Laura Spencer Ex-gay Transsexuality Mumia Abu-Jamal Ten Commandments Spanking Infantilism Serial killer Teenage pregnancy W.I.T.C.H.
