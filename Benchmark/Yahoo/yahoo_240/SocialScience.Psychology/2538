i'm feel old at is this weird not trying to be a butthead doesn't this word prove my maturity to people who are older than me and have them tell me you're only how can you feel old but for some reason it s true maybe it's because i'm starting college and i feel like i have to be so mature now and take care of myself or maybe it's because i've noticed a dramatic change in myself from last year to this year can't fit in with my friends anymore they all just want to go out and have fun meanwhile i'm thinking life isn't all about having fun we have very little in common anymore they want to talk about who's going out with who and i want to watch the presidential candidate debates not trying to put my friends down love them dearly but things are different now i know all people eventually start feeling this way at some point in their lives just didn't think it would happen at don't know what do you think did you ever feel this way is this normal am i actually mature or am i just some dumb teen who thinks being automatically makes them an adult sorry if this sounds like complete bollocks but feel free to criticize it won't hurt my feelings p s i meant i feel old not not i'm feel old what you are feeling is absolutely natural this article from the american psychological association webpage should give you some perspective 'emerging adults the in between age' a new book makes the case for a phase of development between adolescence and adulthood starting in psychologist jeffrey jensen arnett phd interviewed young people ages to in cities around the nation over five years asking them questions about what they wanted out of life despite stark differences in their social backgrounds and likely economic prospects arnett was struck by the similar answers he heard from his young respondents they shared a perception of feeling in between knowing they were pulling clear of the struggles of adolescence and starting to feel responsible for themselves but still closely tied to their parents and family they also reported pondering their personal identity a theme that surprised arnett who thought most would have settled that question as adolescents working from those interviews and examining broad demographic indicators arnett proposed a new period of life span development he calls emerging adulthood arnett a professor of psychology at clark university currently teaching as a fulbright scholar at the university of copenhagen in denmark coined the term in his book emerging adulthood the winding road from the late teens though the twenties oxford university press he describes emerging adulthood as the time from the end of adolescence to the young adult responsibilities of a stable job marriage and parenthood and has made it the subject of a new apa book emerging adults in america coming of age in the st century co edited with jennifer lynn tanner phd the book claims the phenomenon has only arisen in the past few decades in the united states in response to social and economic changes and it urges continuing scholarship examining the nature of life and paths of development for emerging adults five features of emerging adults as arnett describes it emerging adulthood can be defined as an age of identity exploration young people are deciding who they are and what they want out of work school and love age of instability the post high school years are marked by repeated residence changes as young people either go to college or live with friends or a romantic partner for most frequent moves end as families and careers are established in the s age of self focus freed of the parent and society directed routine of school young people try to decide what they want to do where they want to go and who they want to be with before those choices get limited by the constraints of marriage children and a career age of feeling in between many emerging adults say they are taking responsibility for themselves but still do not completely feel like an adult age of possibilities optimism reigns most emerging adults believe they have good chances of living better than their parents did and even if their parents divorced they believe they ll find a lifelong soul mate arnett s research shows that emerging adults want a lot out of life a job that s well paid and personally meaningful and a lasting bond with a partner many might be headed for disappointment he says noting that most employers simply want someone who can get a job done and almost half of all marriages end in divorce if happiness is the difference between what you expect out of life and what you actually get a lot of emerging adults are setting themselves up for unhappiness because they expect so much he says larger trends at work arnett says emerging adulthood is tied to larger historical social trends in american society noting that years ago the median age for marriage was for men and for women now the median age for marriage has climbed past for men and edged above for women one reason young people marry later is that a much larger percentage of young people attend some form of college creating a longer transition time between adolescence and adulthood arnett says before and the passage of the gi bill of rights for returning world war ii veterans only a small percentage of high school graduates went to college an educational experience mainly reserved for men now a majority of young people get some college experience in one form or another whether it s a four year residential school or a community college moreover women now make up a majority of college undergraduates and many want to build a career before they marry and have children arnett says the development of the birth control pill helped drive the change arnett says decades ago young people got married rather then face the risks of pregnancy outside marriage now sexual relationships outside of marriage are accepted as natural by many people some prosper some struggle another marker of emerging adulthood is heterogeneity says arnett in terms of the sheer multitude of paths young people can take and their widely varying levels of success given some emerging adults struggles arnett sees the need for greatly expanded societal efforts to help them navigate the transition into careers and family he believes such efforts would pay off given the self awareness people develop in their s and their willingness to change if you provide them with resources they re much more likely to say how can i improve my life arnett says he hopes the book and other efforts such as the future development of a society for studying emerging adulthood will build a community of scholars devoted to studying the period of development arnett and fellow scholars currently discuss ideas through the emerging adulthood special interest group established through the society for research on adolescence the group organized two academic conferences exploring aspects of emerging adulthood and a third is planned for february in tucson ariz see www s r a org easig html the question of why some emerging adults do well why some struggle and what can be done to help more make a successful transition is taken up by several book contributors tanner co editor of the apa book and an assistant research professor in the school of social work at simmons college argues that the heterogeneity arnett cites can be explained by the foundation laid in childhood and adolescence as she describes it how well an adolescent makes the transition through young adulthood into adulthood and becomes a fully independent person depends in large part on the right balance of the adolescent pushing for independence and parents and society giving the correct amount of support not pushing too hard or holding back too much she says many emerging adults who face problems becoming independent have faced past challenges meeting developmental tasks for one reason or another she says there are enormous costs to young people who are not equipped to plug in to adult roles and responsibilities tanner says jean s phinney phd a psychology professor at california state university los angeles writes on emerging adulthood s different features in ethnic minority groups both for cultural and economic reasons many young people from ethnic minority groups tend to take on adult responsibilities earlier contributing to the family income and taking care of siblings sometimes at the cost of slowing down their own schooling phinney says during emerging adulthood ethnic minorities have to deal with the larger culture and figure out their own identity in the context of the larger society for children of immigrants that can be especially challenging she says i think it can be harder for minorities who come from a culture where the expectations of what you should do are very strong she says another book contributor stephen f hamilton phd a professor of human development at cornell university focuses on young people who can t afford college or who don t move into vocational programs many in that group languish in the low paid jobs of the secondary labor market bouncing from one low skilled dead end job to another hamilton says they end up doing this work their whole lives he says hamilton thinks there s a missing institution in american life one devoted to helping young people join the primary labor market of decently paid jobs with benefits and a chance for advancement '
