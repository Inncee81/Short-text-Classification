crazy fear of driving i took drivers ed last year but for some reason i have this weirdd fear of driving my mom says im good at it when we practiced in my skool's parking lot but for some reason going on the road seems soo scary what can i do to overcome this it may sound weird but try try again i too had a crazy fear of driving after i had a serious car accident in i had internal bleeding for a week and almost lost my life i was the driver after that i refused to drive and every time i tried i would get so afraid that i would not be able to do it i even moved into an apartment close to downtown of the city i lived in at that time so i could walk everywhere then in more than years after my accident more than years of not driving at all i had moved to an extremely large city miles away from the small town i grew up in this new place is so huge that a city street is four lanes wide with bumper to bumper vehicles in i was out with a roommate and he became ill too ill to drive so he handed me the car keys and told me that i had to get him to the hospital i did not know my way around that area and was too afraid to drive but knew that his health was in my hands so i got behind the wheel and sweating gritting my teeth and sobbing uncontrollably i drove him to the hospital the next day he was still to ill to drive so i had to go get his medicine from the pharmacy i drove again after that i realized that in order to survive i had to drive what i suggest that you do is this see driving as a function in life that you must do like riding in an elevator or jumping into a pool to save a drowning puppy even if you can not swim sometimes there are things in life that we have to do no matter how afraid we are trust me once you get the hang of it and can do it without having someone sitting there next to you making you nervous you will do just fine always follow the rules laws and always keep your mind on the road not on music or cell phones etc and you will never have anything to be afraid of good luck to you mind over matter you can do it Shaggy dog story Auto racing Rules of the road Road traffic accident The Hitch-Hiker (The Twilight Zone) Kim Possible Driving Car handling Road safety Sin City The Contender (television series) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dog Public transport Automobile Sport utility vehicle Drag racing Vehicular cycling Manual transmission West Side Highway Tag Drowning Traffic Billboard (advertising) Time Out of Mind Road-rule enforcement camera Speed limit Formula One regulations Motorcycle George Costanza Dog training Bike lane debate Motorway Unreal 2000 Australian Grand Prix Chris Amon Sauna Piccolo Junior Saga Transportation of Los Angeles Panic attack School bus Diving Knight Rider Hitchhiking One Tree Hill (TV series) Roush Racing Hendrick Motorsports Milton H.
