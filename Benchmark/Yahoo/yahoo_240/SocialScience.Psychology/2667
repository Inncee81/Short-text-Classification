how can i learn to view my body realistically i have distorted body image and it's driving me crazy even though people tell me i'm thin certain parts of my body always appear fat to me i've had it for about three years along with anorexia and severe depression how can i learn to view myself realistically i'm currently taking antidepressants prescribed by my psychiatrist and also am seeing a therapist but nothing has helped me yet if you have a psychiartrist prescribing medicine to treat your symptoms i suspect that this must form a part of an overall treatment strategy to address the very question you pose that said it seems somewhat inappropriate to attempt to answer your question so much depends upon your age your family history and a great deal of very personal background information information i cannot solicit or likely comprehend just the same i am curious about several things for example how much of your own image is merely a reflection of more influential people in your life friend parent significant other what are your interests have you ever traveled beyond the confines of your immediate surroundings for purposes other than generic ones i am not asking for answers only asking you to consider them some people can be poison in our lives no matter how close or important to us they're perceptions can have lasting and unfortunately painful consequences consider this with your psychiatrist also the other questions are intended to understand your own world view that is your own perspective independent of you the extent to which you shift your focus on issues that transcend you in other words community problems that exist whether or not you do should allow you to appreciate the vast diversity of problems that persist and devour others around us every day illiteracy poverty racism or abuse each presents challenges and rewards that stimulate and hopefully force us to action often times in spite of ourselves or our own problems in short you have a tremendously difficult challenge that cannot be easily addressed with a simple response in fact you've probably been inundated with responses that compare your distorted self image with more realistic perceptions but of course you already know your problem now you need to bridge that divide between this caustic self image and the reality others perceive my only suggestion however weak is to focus less on you and more on those around you those who may unknowingly hurt you and those who equally unknowingly may provide solace through the simple fact that they need you your help your companionship more than you need yourself right now Clinical depression Anorexia nervosa Drug abuse Autism Transsexuality Bipolar disorder Scientology beliefs and practices Traumatic brain injury Borderline personality disorder Psychoanalysis Medicine Antidepressant Chronic fatigue syndrome Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Transactional analysis Psychology Milton H.
