male dominance vs femal dominance i have been noticing recently that many relationships seem to be changing around now that women are very often the bread winner and have equal right which obvoisly they need to have i see quite a lot of hubby bullying obviously not physically but pyschologically has anyone else noticed that a kind of 'my man will do this' and 'my man will stay in' 'he will wear what i want him to wear' etc which would not be as acceptable if the role was reversed also lets face it if a woman did hit her hubby it would probably be brushed under the carpet unlike the other way around you also get women who use their kids all the time as a pawn due to failed relationships are women now the new men and how do we cope with these very domineering almost bully like women i'm sure the sufrajets of old will be turning in their graves to this kind of thing they died for our freedom and now many women are taking advantage of this freedom i think its quite sad that's very interesting i've never really thought about it like that it does seem to be the case though that women are generally the head of relationships these days i'm not really sure how to answer your question however i thought i'd comment on it because i think it's an important point where ever it fits in of course Social rule Gender role Coercion Feminism Infantilism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Dead Like Me Philosophy of language Women in Islam About a Boy Predestination EastEnders Columbine High School massacre Badminton Pitaten Paul Is Dead Spidey Super Stories Liberal Democrats (UK) God Emperor of Dune Homosexuality and transgender The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Anal sex Entropy Transgender Abortion debate Speaker of the British House of Commons Poker jargon Avenue Q Piccolo Junior Saga Socrates Sinfest Whose Line Is It Anyway?
