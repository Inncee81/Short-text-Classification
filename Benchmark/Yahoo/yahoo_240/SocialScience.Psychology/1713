is he very sincere please help me points for best answer the special person and i love each other for years we went to undergrad college it was tons of chemistry but i don t want to have a relationship therefore i pretended to ignore him for years we had never spoken just enjoy looking at each other from distances before my graduation i told him that i am leaving although we did not really know each other but i knew he cared i was very sad because i miss him so much i thought i was going to forget him because we will never see each other again but with god wills i found his myspace he wrotes poetries about us he claims he does not know me but he loves me he does not know where i was and what to do but he is going to wait for me he did not know i have read his poems is he very sincere and want to wait for me thank you it sound like he does care for you very much i think that is a very sweet thing he may know you are reading his poems and is using it as a way to tell you without telling you directly that he still cares for you and wants you in his life you should send him a message on his myspace and say hello and that you have been thinking about him that will let him know you like him and he will then know that you read his poems you should try and communicate with him i mean it would be a big shame if you let that pass you by this will also give you an idea of what kind of guy he is once you start messaging one another best of luck i wish my old girlfriend who moved back to japan would find me on myspace and we could start talking again good luck Social rule Pitaten Friends Past teachings of Prem Rawat Altruism Humphrey Bogart Undergrads Miss Saigon Shaggy dog story The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) The Human Stain Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Scenes from a Memory Deconstruction Theory of conduct Sant Mat The Amber Spyglass Sant Thakar Singh Le Malade imaginaire Piccolo Junior Saga Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Muslim ibn Aqeel Time Out of Mind Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Current teachings of Prem Rawat Judaism Kodocha About a Boy Gary Snyder The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Sin Great Teacher Onizuka Origin belief Another Side of Bob Dylan Summa Theologiae A Course In Miracles Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Meaning of life Paradise Lost John Keats The Death Gate Cycle Transactional analysis Sleeping Murder Confucianism The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Nicomachean Ethics The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Confucius John Howard Yoder God Apology (Plato) Emily Dickinson Oh My Goddess!
