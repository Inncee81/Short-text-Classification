what is your personal experience of free will this is an inquiry about your personal experience there has been many questions about free will on y a examples of answer are free will is an illusion your thoughts are or god has given us free will because etc that is not what i want to here on this subject observation of subjective experience is of primary importance what is the point to argue about free will if it is not associated with some observations i give an example of observation of free will which maybe an illusion whether it is an illusion is irrelevant even illusions need explanation you are very very hungry and someone proposes to you to do a robbery in a super market you think about it hesitate and you decide that you won't do that you feel that you take a decision leave theory behind for now i want your experience religious experience not analysis is fine is it associated with happiness or misery with a choice to make or just a feeling of being in charge examples are useful to neoholbach you seem sorry as if my question was like a lame set up for some religious debate you are right that i was biased actually i was so much biased that i was totally convinced that our choice were guided by some fixed laws even before any test so i defined free will purely as a feeling of being in control or to have to choose not as an absence of laws that still uniquely determine our choice my question is why this feeling it does not matter whether it is an illusion or whatever it still needs to be explained so i wanted to know more about this feeling whether it is usually associated with happiness or misery etc what are the common features in this feeling i cannot see any explanation from an evolution theory point of view does the literature that is proposed here answers these questions what exactly is this feeling and above all how can we explain it continuing so the only reason why i did not want analysis is because i was not interested in the question whether there are fixed laws that determine our choices and i expected most analysis to address this question also often people provides the analysis and fails to give the facts and i wanted facts facts about the subjective experiences but nevertheless facts still i admit it is not a serious scientific study it is just something i do for fun based on personal experience i think it seems like we have free will i choose to do something and i'm able to do it i don't think you can just end the debate there though why did i choose to do what i did and could i have actually chosen something else these are the questions and they can't really be answered just based on personal experience i actually read up on the study that eddie seems to be talking about earlier today and it's really interesting researchers found that the brain is preparing to move a person's arm before they are conscious of the desire to move it also when people are asked to move either their left or right arm and transcranial magnetic stimulation is applied to the left side of their head they will move the right arm percent of the time what's more they still feel that their choice was completely voluntary sorry if this is analysis Free will Sexual orientation Meaning of life Psychology Religion Scientific method Theodicy Science Supernatural Determinism Microeconomics Philosophy of mathematics Mind control Coercion Theory of conduct Abortion debate Ethics Social psychology Human Deconstruction Franz Boas Philosophy of science Democracy Cognitive science Consciousness A Course In Miracles Intelligent design Mathematics Species Creation-evolution controversy Economic inequality Reparative therapy Many-worlds interpretation Game theory Causality Psychology of religion Goodness and value theory Inflation Altruism Creationism Occam's Razor Intelligent design movement Unidentified flying object Model (economics) Philosophy of language Falsifiability Rudolf Hermann Lotze Objectivist philosophy Labor theory of value GED Sigmund Freud Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Philosophy Parapsychology Immanuel Kant David Hume Church of Christ, Scientist Physics Abduction Phenomenon Dualism (philosophy of mind) Prisoner's dilemma Creation science Victor Cousin Law of value Hypnosis Origin belief Where Mathematics Comes From Capitalism Homeopathy Noam Chomsky Liberalism Philosophy of perception Social justice Philosophy of space and time Education in the United States Utilitarianism Soul Fermi paradox Cultural relativism Past teachings of Prem Rawat Sant Thakar Singh Moral objectivism Teach the Controversy Separation of church and state Meme Sociocultural evolution Autism Jacob Neusner Religious studies Francis Crick
