how come i can barely feel anything anymore its been a while now that i seem to have lost almost all my emotions nothing bad has happened to me or anything like that i'm just very indifferent about everything that is going on in my life all food taste the same everything is dull i never really get excited about anything anymore i was in a relationship with a girl and that didn't help much either i think i am getting bored with life or maybe i am expecting too much from it even though i have a normal social life but i enjoy doing things alone like reading writing or drawing in fact i avoid some of my friends sometime just to have time to myself is there any way for me to feel again i think there are just different times in life time to be with friends time to be with family and time to be alone just to get in touch with yourself maybe this is the time to spend with yourself and i find very educational and healthy that you can do it it's like giving you the opportunity to do it once in your life because there are people that never get to do it they never get in touch with themselves and they are completly unable to be alone or even more to enjoy their loneliness if you are not enjoying anything just give yourself some time and it would be nice and useful if you find a new book see some old movies and maybe make a trip try to get away from everything for a couple weeks find new emotions for yourself things you've never done you'll be just fine Social rule Avenue Q One Tree Hill (TV series) Infantilism The Fairly OddParents Happiness Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story About a Boy Nancy Witcher Astor Cliff Richard The Amber Spyglass Emotions (album) Sex and the City The Lovely Bones Blood on the Tracks Motivation Human sexual behavior Nicomachean Ethics Sharon Tate All Quiet on the Western Front Lewis Carroll Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Another Side of Bob Dylan Negima Ranma __ characters Procrastination Transactional analysis On the Road W.I.T.C.H.
