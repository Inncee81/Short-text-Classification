what would you have done in this woman's place imagine you're a single mom and have finally found an au pair to take care of your kid so you can work again but the girl abuses her position of power by forgetting to do of her work by damaging your possessions in voluntarily by using your phone internet running up high bills without apologizing or offering damages it happened this year to the family i worked for as an au pair once too the mom talked and talked to this girl instead of sending her back to france as some of us advised her she was just too afraid of not being able to find another one thus lose her own job what would you have done in this mom's place with no family around to fill in would you have suffered the impertinence of a year old girl for a whole year and do you think this is a question of self confidence fear i sometimes feel the mom lacks self confidence and is too afraid of setting limits to people who take advantage of her even though finding an au pair is quite difficult thanks you're all right and i told her about the same thing but a the family lives in a rural area where not many au pairs want to go it's not like here in munich b the kid is in school for about hours a day and the au pair just needed to work or hours to help in the house c agencies in germany charge up to for an au pair even if the girl leaves after a few days that single mom couldn't afford that i still think she should have put her in her place idream do i have to add that there is no childcare in that area i tried to find a new one for her not long ago but to no avail without question this girl would have been shown the door within seconds of this starting the 'mom' should have immediately called some au pair service for a replacement even if the one she had did not come from them in the meantime if she could afford an au pair then she certainly could have afforded day care it would seem that the 'mom' struggles and really has no one to turn to at times of crisis which is a shame and my heart goes out to her but she really needed to put her foot down straight away on this no if's and's or but's about it Shaggy dog story Plame affair Ben Johnson (athlete) Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Social rule Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Pok__mon Live!
