what do you do about someone who is completely unwilling to reason with you i have tried talking to this person numerous times but they dont seem to care about anyone but themselves talking doesnt work they are completely self absorbed this person just makes me so angry and no one will back me up everyone just gives in to this person to avoid a fight im so fed up they obviously have to much pride to admit mistakes so just let them be for now and once the person matures up and is willing to admit the problem infront of them then you will both be in good terms but nice job in trying to fix things that makes you seem more adult and not childish like the other one Pitaten Avenue Q Social rule Ranma __ characters Debugging Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Polyamory Atomic Kitten Phoebe Halliwell Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Grief Mental retardation Infant baptism Theory of conduct Gothic metal Homunculi of Fullmetal Alchemist Spider Decision making Nicomachean Ethics 1957 World Series Fight Club Inflation Traumatic brain injury Transsexuality Shit Asperger syndrome Infantilism W.
