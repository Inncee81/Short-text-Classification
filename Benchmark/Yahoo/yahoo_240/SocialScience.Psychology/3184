what makes us decide what side of the bed to sleep on what side of the bed to sleep on or where to sit in restraunt when i go to the restaraunt they always ask me what side i want what determines what i choose i think just your own preferences when i choose what side of the bed to sleep on i choose it according to how the room is situated like if my tv or a tv is in the room and is not centered to the bed i will choose the side that i can face the tv and be on that side of the bed or if its centered i like sleeping with my back to my husband because he cuddles with me so i choose accordingly another thing since i've been with my husband i have changed sides many times usually when we've changed the room around i don't even know if any of this makes sense but in a restaurant i look and see where there is less people or more private accomodations such as booths or something if i notice more booths available or less people i will choose that side otherwise it doesn't matter much to me Mattress Transactional analysis Passenger car Friends Sleeping car Swingout Angel One (TNG episode) Out-of-body experience Women in Islam Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban EastEnders Shaggy dog story Sin City Blood Simple Strap-on dildo Damn Yankees Dormitory Avenue Q Theory of conduct Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Lucid dreaming Little Girl Lost (The Twilight Zone) Sleeping Murder The Shining (film) Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Blood on the Tracks The Big Sleep Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Miss Saigon Insomnia Sento Buckingham Palace Lindy Basic Gay bathhouse Microeconomics Milton H.
