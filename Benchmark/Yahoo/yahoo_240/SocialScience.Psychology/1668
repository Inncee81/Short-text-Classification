i'm so messed up procrastinating depressed help why can't i do the things on my list like meditate eat right work out practice my music do my job visit friends etc i've like lost all interest if i could i just want to be free man enjoy nature good company watch a lot fo tv but society makes me feel like loser to do this all day and no money why can't i be happy i don't like anti depressants i think they mess brains up worse in end for most how do i get out of this funk why can't i break out of this inertia and take action in my life i feel paralyzed damn me pick up the good habits you want a little at a time pick the one you want most meditation say decide if you want to do it daily weekly hourly whatever and pick a time on that schedule when you have time to do it now just observe that schedule sit down to meditate every day or week or whatever at the time you chose if you only meditate a minute each session fine in fact it's probably better that way if you try to do too much per session at first you're more likely to get discouraged and stop observing the schedule observing the schedule is the important thing this gets you in the habit of doing the activity on a regular basis successfully observing the schedule even if you're only actually meditating for ten seconds each time will give you a feeling of accomplishment which will start to alleviate your depression once you've established the habit of observing the schedule you can progressively increase the length and scope of the session as you see fit once you've established one good habit you can repeat the process for another one once it's established you will naturally maintain it out of habit that's why they call them that it's been said that people are creatures of habit habits are not entirely rational behaviors so it follows that people are not entirely rational trying to pick up good habits by sheer intellectual force of will will tend to fail therefore it's better to trick the mind and body into accepting the desired habit there are other approaches you can take of course self examination for example you might want to ask yourself questions about your own behavior once in a while like how exactly did you arrive at the standard you've set for yourself that you're so depressed about not meeting was this your decision somebody else's or what and so on yeah i agree most people go running for pharmaceutical assitance way too quickly i don't think most people should be on them unless the men in white coats are actually chasing them down the street with a net Procrastination Ethics Social rule Microeconomics Meditation Surveillance Goodness and value theory David Hume Economics Altruism Clinical depression Meme Human nature Scientology beliefs and practices Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Alexander Technique Current teachings of Prem Rawat Theory of conduct The Apprentice 2 Friends of the Western Buddhist Order Consciousness Divorce The Catcher in the Rye Mojave people Religion Happiness Infantilism Stuttering A Course In Miracles Extreme Programming EastEnders Immanuel Kant Tariff Motivation Canadian Senate Scientific method 2000 Australian Grand Prix Obsessive-compulsive disorder Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Francis Hutcheson (philosopher) Vernon Schillinger Sexual orientation Objectivist philosophy Supply and demand Alcoholics Anonymous Cognitive science Blonde on Blonde Milton H.
