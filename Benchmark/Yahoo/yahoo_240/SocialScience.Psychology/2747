why are people full of themselves everytime i see someone with a typo in their question i ignore it and answer their question as best i can because i try not to judge i don't know if the person is mental handicapped english isn't their native language or if it was indeed just a typo however everyone else seems to lash out at them treating them in a less than human way for a simple typo would you go up to a mentally handicapped person and bash them for saying me and sam instead of sam and i yet a lot of yahoo members seem to assume everyone is just like them with the same education and background why do people do that p s my mentally handicapped brother uses this sight and he is always informed of his typos that make him look like a year old as some have said p p s i'm not talking about the people that say hi one i got use protection and now i'm preg eleven those people annoy me too my question is why do people assume everyone is just like them it isn't so much that people assume that everyone is 'just like me' it is more like some people simply jump to a negative generalization this is especially true if the question is on a sensitive topic and the question itself portrays the asker's viewpoints clearly as for people putting down your brother online those who do so probably do so because they think that they are 'defenders of the english language' either that or it is a contrast effect wherein the person publicly berates another to contrast themselves with the asker thus making themselves look vastly more intelligent to themselves and they hope others it could also be the fact that yahoo answers has turned into a kind of debate forum and so people look for any reason to put down another i would agree that people need to get over the poor usage of grammar and stop their argumentum ad grammaticum Theory of conduct Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Ontological argument Internet troll Reality Plame affair Political correctness Singlish G__del's incompleteness theorem Goodness and value theory Chinglish Abortion debate Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Animal rights Esperanto grammar Psychology Mental illness Presuppositional apologetics Person Non-native pronunciations of English Newbie Intelligent design movement Slashdot subculture Visual Basic Grammatical mood Infant baptism Social rule Turing test Logical fallacy Hiberno-English Sociolinguistics African American Vernacular English Expert system Objectivist philosophy Esperanto as an international language Shogi Japanese language Wealth The Apprentice 2 EastEnders Learning disability The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Mathematics Supernatural Negima Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Polyamory Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Soul Sexual orientation Tripartite System Fallacy Mental retardation Dyslexia Slashdot trolling phenomena Noam Chomsky Pwn Human Argument from ignorance Epistemology Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Homosexuality and Judaism English verbs Procrastination Debate Economics Meaning Philosophical skepticism Chess Creationism Franz Boas Japanese grammar Independent school (UK) GNU General Public License Autism rights movement Pronoun Meaning of life Policy Debate Euphemism The nature of God in Western theology Propaganda Creation-evolution controversy Contract Dissociative identity disorder Socrates Autism Infantilism German grammar Cultural relativism Slander and libel Spanish verbs God Emperor of Dune Cannon shogi Social psychology Motivation
