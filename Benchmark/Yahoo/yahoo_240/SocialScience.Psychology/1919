why does it feel like america and the rest of the world is being grandfathered into what the bible describes in revelations it seems as if the major issues and ethical issues are becoming slowly but surely introduced into our lives in a slow drip will all the controversial issues and bad decisions made by world leaders and people just become a norm and spin people into a null to the world s crisis its happening before our eyes we sit and talk about it like we are preparing ourselves for what we know will happen and just wait day to day waiting to turn on the evening news to replenish the hope the government puts in us along with the rest of the world its seems to be a book that we all read a million times but haven t really understood what it meant it s just weird to me but of course what am i doing writing out a question that i hope strikes a few chords somewhere ya know well i'm done make with what you can from my rambling i will apologize for a longish answer and the pop culture references up front but it's a good question i think about it this way the problem is that prophecy is a guess that comes true when it doesn't it's a metaphor vir cotto babylon the book of revelations is one of a couple of things potentially it's accurate in a metaphorical sense the end times may always seem upon us it's not accurate in anything like a metaphorical sense and was written with the historical events near about the time of the writing of the books of daniel and the revelation of john it's the accurate fact of things at hand in the near future this implies that the prophecies are thematic in nature and can be valid under a number of circumstances all good prophecy reads as if it was relevant to us today nostradamus was famous for this his predictions had a nasty habit of coming true but not always and almost never as imagined or stated i can even say something generically and specifically true you will have a ham sandwich it will be bad the lettuce will be wilted odds are pretty good sometime between now and the time you die unless you are sworn off ham sandwiches this prophecy will come true nostradamus has been quoted as saying the new city at degrees shall burn great that sucks for anyone in the new city but pretty much any time any city anywhere near degrees has a fire related incident involving more than two city blocks techinically one could consider the prophecy as fulfilled new york famously is cited as the city in question has had a significant portion of the city burned to the ground no less than two separate times once on account of accident during the i believe in the 's again in the 's during the revolutionary war and again during the civil war by confederate insurgents not to mention the fact that according to some sources apparently the soviet union had a dead man switch for a small nuclear weapon pre positioned in manhattan from the 's through to the mid 's which may or may not be in the possession of mr bin ladin company but here's another trick if enough people believe something they can make it true it can also be the case that the actions or inactions of people may also make the prophecy come true this is not some pseudo religious mumbo jumbo i'll give an example which is cribbed more or less from a cartoon my younger cousin watches called avatar the last airbender but here goes a less specialized example but excellent example where doubters make a prophecy come true sort of let's say some dime store prophet comes to a town near a volcano when the volcano acts up they says nothing will happen to the town and most people relax but some doubting visitors actually go to the top of the volcano and find the lava is creeping ever upward and unless something is done the top will overfill the volcano in a short while running down the side of the mountain and destroying the town our helpful traveling naysayers go to the town below and convince a few more people that they must do something that the prophet is wrong and unless they do something the town will be destroyed they decide to dig a large ditch leading away from the town the prophet insists protesting that action is unnecessary saying only that the town will not be harmed the doubting travelers don't believe the dime store prophet together they and some workers start digging a trench away from the town and a few days after they are finished digging sure enough the lava flows down the mountain the lava approaches the town and then is diverted by the trench the town is saved at the end the prophet takes credit for her prediction that the town was not destroyed the prophet was right but only on the account of her doubters hows that for irony it's sort of like that sort of in our world today you have evangelical christians to pick a group and take them to task these folks proudly and sincerely accept as a matter of fact that the world is going to come to an end in this generation sometime next tuesday after oprah perhaps the prophet tv host pat robertson has made a multi decade career of predicting the end of the world is tomorrow or next tuesday up until his presidential candidacy in the 's he was regularly prophesies the end of the world i don't believe that mr robertson was right any time he predicted the end of the world but a people still believe him and more importantly they follow his prophecies and teachings as if they were accurate so with these folks when in power they sincerely believe it is not important to protect the environment because jesus is here but hiding and the rapture is next tuesday so what's the point of having global warming legislation or regulating some toxin being released by abc manufacturing when the earth will be gone in a few weeks anyway by ad for sure and definitely by ad or ad or perhaps ad the problem is this given enough access enough time and enough of such dereliction of responsibility the world may become rather hellish on account of their inaction to act responsibly towards the planet in contrast to our friends the prophets of evanglion we rational folks are armed with scientists who also make predictions but their predictions are always couched with a degree of uncertainty and data to back their predictions up you can even perform experiments to test their predictions evangelists don't really have a lot of experimental data to back up their claims and there are no tests to experiment with you'll just have to take their word for it physics predicts that when i drop a feather it will hit the ground but nothing in physics prevents a breeze from sweeping up that feather into a tree the law of gravity didn't fail it did however fail to predict the circumstance because another rational event occurred which caused the feather to do something other than what we predicted it would do so for example let's take our global warming or global pollution example perhaps the worst concerns of the environmentalists are right and if the earth heats up more than a few degrees we get nasty feedbacks from the permafrost and sea levels will make the average american's homelife look like an out take from mad max or waterworld in years is that because the prophecy was right all along or because we allowed religious furballs to dictate our future put another way would it really matter to some future mad max waterworld resident that the worst prophecies came true in the biblical sense not probably they would just know what we can only suspect that their ancestors us dropped the ball and that back in the day people supposedly used to be a lot better off similar examples follow suit in middle east politics if for instance our messianic president instigates a conflict with iran pakistan may ship a couple of nuclear weapons to them as a sort of middle eastern version of a nuclear lend lease agreement if iran or israel or the us actually used nuclear weapons in the middle eastern theater of operations very bad things would necessarily happen eventually as resource prices and the unstable military furball of a situation might compel other interested parties to act unilaterally let's suppose that in such an instance china finds the whole circumstance unacceptable they might see it as perfectly rational and necessary to form and then march a large conventional force through the middle east to restore order killing every living thing in their way as they went now if a chinese army of say million were mustered with even just ak 's and sent westward with orders to eliminate any all resistance until the oil they want need is secured there would really be nothing to stop them would some aspect of the book of revelation have come true yes would it be the revealed word no it would be a large army acting in accord with it's perceived national interests however you might have a hard time convincing our furball prophet mr robertson or president bush for my money i'm sure it's entirely possible but i choose to live as if the world isn't going to come to a screeching halt tomorrow since that to my mind the book of revelation is just fine just so long as you leave me and mine out of it for myself if that's what the evangelical christian faith is selling we would collectively do well to keep them at very long arms length as i find such a vision of the future utterly dismal how to avoid such a cheery future as is found in the revelation of john simple use common sense when considering things responsibly act towards the future consider the impact of our decisions not just on ourselves but on our children's children that's it problem solved beware the zealot attributed to jesus beware the false prophets among us attributed to the apostle peter good advice no matter what your faith
