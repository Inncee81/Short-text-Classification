minor hallucinations from marijuana the other day i experienced the first hallucinations of my life after smoking a good amount of the substance aforementioned but i've heard that this substance usually does not affect users in this manner so i am a little confused i would describe it as the visual cortex of my brain would see for example a relfection of a tree in a window and recognize another shape that reminded me of something i kept seeing projections of people and disney characters if i focused on these objects long enough like someone had slid a film of them in front of the pre existing image has anyone else experienced these hallucinations btw the images were fainter than i would have expected and i knew i was hallucinating at the time i experienced this dope isn't good for you it hits everybody in different ways i suggest get off the stuff while your'e still smart Psychosis Hallucination Cannabis (drug) LSD Methamphetamine Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants Cyberspace Schizophrenia Cocaine Cognitive science Non-medical use of dextromethorphan Aphasia Dyslexia Direct realism Out-of-body experience Meditation Stereoscopy Ketamine Bong Illegal drug trade Salvia divinorum Telepathy Clinical depression Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Milton H.
