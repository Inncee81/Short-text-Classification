can anyone help me with this i have been having nightmares for almost two weeks normally i can control my dreams you know i think of a specific person i dream about that person lately i haven't been able to do that the first week was all one dream it was really horrifying but when i figured out what it meant i stopped having it but then i started having all these other nightmares they are not the same every night any more i just want to know how to get rid of them these ones don't seem to mean anything i can't even remember them but the feeling from them stays with me at least half of the day how do i get rid of my nightmares none of these answers helped me so i'm just not going to pick a best answer sorry y'all dreams are often related to stress and some believe they are a way for the mind to work through them if you are stressed about something find a way to either reduce it or engage in techniques to mitigate it such as exercise or meditation Dream Lucid dreaming Post-traumatic stress disorder Nightmare Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare Social rule Clinical depression Scientology beliefs and practices Psychoanalysis Stress (medicine) Meditation Stomach cancer A Course In Miracles Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Ekadasi Insomnia Traumatic incident reduction Oh My Goddess!
