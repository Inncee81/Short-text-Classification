how to control my psycic ability of seeing into the future against my will currently i have a problem with seeing things in the future while i am dreaming but now i can see things when i am awake as well how do i control this power i also get severe headaches when i see these visions note i do not have any mental conditions nor am i on any medications i just get these visions and if i am seen by certain people in the vision they try to kill me but there is this one woman who always saves me in these visions but i can't seem to find out who she is can anyone help me or at least point me in the direction of someone who can help me ok well you don't seem to understand the situation i have seen things into the future that have come true for instance the terrorist attacks on i saw them two weeks before it happened and i was in the th grade i can't get an mri nor can i see a doctor about this because my parents put it off as the rantings of a teenager who is trying to get a little attention if it is a tumor then i'm dead anyways but i don't care i want control of this ability not to rid myself of it nor do i wish to pray to god about it i know what this is and i know if i can get control of this then i can gain control of my other abilities like my telekinesis and the ability to manipulate matter to do my bidding i can control this but i need help the thing with psychic abilities is that you have to have a good grounding to deal with them you have to be your own worst skeptic otherwise you will unintentionally delude yourself or be deluded by those who've dropped off so first step is get those headaches checked out a brain tumor would cause exactly the symtoms you are describing nd if your mri checks out then you need to make sense of the vision it is quite likely not literal there'll be perceptual distortions in what you see seeing a face you've never seen before thorugh a non visual context will cause your mind to give it familuer charactoristics as a comfort mechanism so even though you see the ladies face clearly you are not really seeing it clearly the lady might even be a stand in for a group of people rather than a single individual if they are real not manifestations of a physical condition then you will want to figure out their meaning they clearly sound like a warning do get an mri even if the visions are quite correct and real that doesn't mean they are not induced by a serious physical problem Traumatic brain injury Supernatural Jean Grey Psychosis Neuro-linguistic programming A Course In Miracles Parapsychology Aphasia Causality Cancer Theory of conduct Multiple sclerosis Scientology beliefs and practices Abortion debate Psylocke Stroke Magnetic resonance imaging Migraine The nature of God in Western theology Philosophy of language Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Alexander Technique Epilepsy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Clinical depression Philosophy of perception Cephalic disorder Hypoglycemia Epistemology Edgar Cayce Philosophical skepticism Hypnosis Bene Gesserit Milton H.
