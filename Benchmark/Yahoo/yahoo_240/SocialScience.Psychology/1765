rumbling anxiety help i'm always anxious wen i'm out wen i'm with friends and family and wen people visit my house most of the time i cant sit in the same room as visitors they think i'm ignorant but im just soo anxious and because i'm anxious my belly starts rumbeling so i leave any situation wen i feel my belly going to start to save my embarrassment as soon as i'm by myself it stops completely ther is no good reason for me having this accept from being shy i'v had no big trauma or anything hard to deal with am i going mad or can the doctor treat me what would he give me and what kind of tests would he do i'v not been to the docs in years and i'm now years old all information welcome and i know constantly worrying that your belly is going to rumble is soo stupid because no would care but i just cant help it it just starts first you are definitely not going mad and your question is most definitely not stupid far from it please don't worry about that what you're experiencing is actually rather common and lots of people suffer from various symptoms when put in uncomfortable social situations the mind body connection is very strong and psychological symptoms are easily manifested as physical ailments even illnesses or pain so while your ailment may be embarrassing to you it is not unexpected also remember that it is probably far more noticeable to you and more embarrassing to you than it is noticeable to others as you're already anxious in the situation you will be even more concerned about the perception of your physical symptoms without talking to you this really is too little information to be able to instantly diagnose social phobia a k a social anxiety disorder but it certainly sounds like your symptoms fall into that spectrum it also contains possible elements of generalized anxiety disorder g a d if you are having anxiety for unexplained reasons in unexplained situations beyond just meeting strangers etc i like the advice that one person gave of something of a systematic desensitization approach where you expose yourself first to situations you can easily handle and then gradually work your way into more difficult situations of course a therapist guiding you through this if you can afford one is a huge benefit way better than yahoo answers finally your question about what a doctor might do he could recommend a variety of pharmaceutical or therapeutic approaches the most common medication prescribed and proven effective for social phobia is paxil it is an ssri anti depressant other potential anxiety drugs that may be suggested are klonopin clonazepam xanax alprazolam or buspar buspirone depending on how serious the doctor considers the anxiety klonopin and xanax are benzodiazepines and buspar is a less addictive anti anxiety drug there is also the option which someone else suggested of using gastrointestinal over the counter medications though i don't think this is probably the way a doctor would go except maybe at first just to give it a shot one thing he will not do unless he's a horrible doctor is make fun of you or make you feel stupid for having these symptoms they really are not particularly unusual and you shouldn't feel like a freak or weird for having them i hope this helps at least a little and i should mention that i'm not a ph d and nothing can replace the advice of a doctor i hope things work out for you best wishes nathan Psychotherapy Bipolar disorder Prostate cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Psychosis Chronic fatigue syndrome Alprazolam Stomach cancer Post-traumatic stress disorder Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Antidepressant Benzodiazepine Paroxetine Drug addiction Insomnia Multiple sclerosis Buspirone Psychiatry Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Hypoglycemia Homeopathy Meditation Autism Traumatic brain injury Psychopharmacology Social rule Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor Borderline personality disorder Anorexia nervosa Agoraphobia Migraine Narcissism Traumatic incident reduction Charles Darwin's illness Hypnosis Schizophrenia Anxiolytic Diazepam Chlorpromazine Milton H.
