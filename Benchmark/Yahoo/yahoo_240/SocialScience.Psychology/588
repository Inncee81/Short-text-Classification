how to not be hated it seems like no matter what i do people dont like me if i am quiet and shy i get teased and trampled on if i am my normally bubbly self i am bitchy or annoying i am so nervous around people i get paralyzed i just dont want to be made fun of anymore my confidence is completely shot to just be myself and not care in the past year my new bf's best friend hated me and would always say rude mean things and insult me i thought i was being nice but i apprently he thought i was annoying people at my new job are unreceptive ive tried to see what it is i am doing and take blame for part of it and i honestly dont know i am comletely lost and sad then i think it must be because i am ugly and not cool i know i am a good person adn anyone who knows me knows this why is being a kind person not enough better be hated for who you are then to be loved for what you are not my grandmother used to say everyone has the right to be happy just be yourself and surround yourself with positive energy the rest falls at its place Kodocha Pitaten Knots Landing Little Britain Social rule Jennifer Lopez Patrick Star W.I.T.C.H.
