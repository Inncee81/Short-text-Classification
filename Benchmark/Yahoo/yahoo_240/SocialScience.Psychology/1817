am i insane for believing this i believe that eye contact is invasive i avoid making eye contact with people until i feel connected to them on some level i think it's an issue of power and those that stare at my eyes are almost stealing from me crossing over a boundary i know it sounds odd but in other cultures it isnt that uncommon i live in the u s and people think that i'm creepy or very nervous when i wont look them in the eye i thought i was the only one who felt that way i totally agree with you when someone stares into my eyes it feels like an invasion almost a violation i really don't like it unless like you said i know that person well and am comfortable with them otherwise i feel like they are taking something away from me sounds crazy i know like i'm giving them a window into my soul which would be o k if i knew that person enough to trust him her with such intimate details of my inner self i think this comes from having had relationships with people who have been abusive in one form or another and i'm not a trusting person anymore i like to keep what's inside me inside me if someone can read me through my eyes then they have a certain power over me a way to hurt me if they chose to sounds nutty i know but i really think it's a product of being deeply hurt one too many times we become much more guarded with our feelings our emotions we realize that not everyone needs to know them that some people will use them against us does this make sense unfortunately most of the rest of society sees someone who doesn't like to make eye contact as someone who is a liar i don't lie i just don't like to let people in until i know i can trust them Jon Secada Eye contact The Shining (film) Theory of conduct The Amber Spyglass Rei Ayanami Human sexual behavior Scenes from a Memory Simone Weil Haven (TNG episode) Sin City Death Note S__ren Kierkegaard Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Shaggy dog story Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Rape Lie Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Children of God Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Time Out of Mind Plame affair Alignment (role-playing games) Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Sant Thakar Singh Gestalt therapy Fathers' rights Emotions (album) Polyamory The Death Gate Cycle Cindy Sheehan The Ashlee Simpson Show Traumatic incident reduction Autism Evil Transactional analysis Dualism (philosophy of mind) Domestic violence A Course In Miracles Ocean's Twelve David Hume Wolfrider Blonde on Blonde Nihilism Stuttering Anderson Cooper Ken Wilber Conspiracy (TNG episode) The Catcher in the Rye Mystique (comics) The Dalek Invasion of Earth Kodocha One Tree Hill (TV series) Characters of Naruto Narcissism Out-of-body experience Scarlet's Walk Empathy Angel Sanctuary Milton H.
