why do so many of my friends and family want me to have another baby in addition to the two i already have i'm not ready for one but i also feel this urge my family keeps asking when the next one's to be expected and they normally don't push this with most of the family just the setlled ones my friends both online and offline keep asking me and hoping for it and on both sides the majority are not muslim so it's not a population increase thing i'm also hearing that this urge that i'm also having to have another is god's way of telling me to get going on it so why are most of the people i know encouraging me to have another this is confusing i also just got remarried in may it hasn't even been a year why start so soon in this new life is it a spiritual thing for them for me for who as i said befor will say it again children are blessings from god if you feel like having children do it without fear many people say that they decide not to have children because they cannot bear the cost but we muslims believe that with every child born god sends his aid with the child you should always cherish the ability to give birth because many people don't would do anything to have one child Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Religious Society of Friends John the Baptist Muslim ibn Aqeel Marriage Arjuna Virgin Mary in Islam Eid ul-Fitr Book of Isaiah Christmas Milton H.
