help me i am addict of thinks and dreaming much i am adict of thinking and dreaming much so that i have every thing in my mind and nothing in the world atleast very lower than i can i spend about hours a day to listen music and imagine success i try to do sth for it stop imagine i stop listening but when i do that i really feel low and it couldn't continue i will hurt i don't know this things that i write is true or another strange imagine of myself my vistions change very fast what i do help me dreaming is not such a bad thing give yourself a break there when i was a young girl i used to fantasize all the time about all the things i could have i have them now so that's not so bad i would suggest you put something more concrete to what you're doing feeling thinking that might ground you a bit more or at least make you begin to feel like your head isn't so much in the clouds that would be to try and write down what your dreams are you seem like you're a very creative soul in that respect you have the qualities that will allow you to not only jot down all the dreams you have but see clearly a path to get them believe me once you begin to have some successes with your dreams coming true they will feel less like a fantasy and more like reality never ever kill a dream it's what keeps the passion burning inside you it's what we all wish we had don't lose it Jon Secada Theory of conduct Social rule Scenes from a Memory Milton H.
