i hope to get her back one day my gf broke up with me about a week ago and said that i needed to be happy with myself and gain more confidence i admit that i had been pushing alot of my problems out on to her and complaining alot she said she wants to be friends though at first i told her that would be hard for me to do we continued to talk though via email and then this last friday we hung out i've been very respectful and havent been freaking out on her or anything we went out to eat and i paid then we went to the park at night and then we went to a movie i paid for that too i made a joke about guys finding me attractive and she said she couldn't help being attracted to me at the end of the night i told her i love her and that i was sorry about what happened she said she loved me too i gave her a little hug and then i went inside last night she sent me an email asking if she could call me we just talked and i didn't say i loved her anyway i really want to have her back one day should i keep should i keep telling her i love her or just keep it casual on the phone it was weird ending our conversation without saying it because i'm use to that also she said she wants to continue our outing at the park so i don't know if i should just keep things casual or what i don't want her to think that i am moving on and i want to date other people you know lol the thing about guys finding me attractive was a joke an inside thing it made her laugh anyway ok what stikes me about readingthis is that you told your ex that guys fancied you and that although you broke up with her you still say you love her to her face are you saying your gay or stupid Social rule Friends Piccolo Junior Saga The Ashlee Simpson Show Shaggy dog story Humphrey Bogart EastEnders Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Avenue Q Time Out of Mind Marilyn Monroe The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Plame affair Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Ocean's Twelve "Weird Al" Yankovic Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Fiddler on the Roof Garfield 1957 World Series Recurring South Park characters Kodocha 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines RuneScape quests Fancy Crane Pitaten She Loves You The Inside Major League Baseball television contracts 10 Things I Hate About You Blood on the Tracks Meat Loaf Good Morning, Vietnam Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Ron and Fez Undergrads Rod Stewart Lauren Bacall Methos Mojave people Whose Line Is It Anyway?
