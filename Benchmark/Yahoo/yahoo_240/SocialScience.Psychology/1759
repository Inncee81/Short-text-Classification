is this all in the head or in need of a professional a boy was adopted by a very loving mother who couldn't have children she did absolutely everything for him his father was a distant hard working man never stingy with praise just a little short on affection the boy turns marries and has boys he vows not to be like his father nothing and no one seems to do anything right by his standards he forbids his wife to drink alcohol yet he gets sloppy drunk during business trips he doesn't want any other males in the house yet he has affair after affair and accuses his wife of having one his now year old son is popular with the girls decent grades yet he can't praise him or be proud all that comes out of his mouth is a put down or it's about time he blows up at dishes not being done on time lawn not mowed on his timeline yet wonders why no one speaks to him he gets a job wants a better paying one gets that still wants more he buys a motorcycle wants a faster one a dirt street you see where i'm going he's ultra nice compassionate empathetic with total strangers co workers he's the best friend best sailor there's been numerous awards for him being an outstanding worker sailor whatever yet in his personal life especially with those close to him if you're family beware he will tear you apart his parents praised him highly for all of his accomplishments yet he chokes at being prodded to acknowledge his own children's accomplishments i guess i'm asking all of this because i want to know if it's something he should work on or maybe it requires meds i just want to make sure our sons never inherit this the boy in the beginning of this story was the year old boy i married he's now and has a and year old teen boys who rebel at everything he says because they believe he doesn't follow the rules himself hmm interesting answers so far i haven't had any rougher childhood from others i had parents who were affectionate but had problems with excessive alcohol use yes i'm the balance in these boys i've told them the have the power not to be like their father their father's mother dressed him combed his hair paid his bills was really protective and took care of him all the way till she died he couldn't do any wrong in his parent's eyes i don't want to even attempt to save him change him or make him do anything he doesn't want to do i'm curious if it's psychological or he needs meds because of a chemical imbalance he's often told me he's aware of the pain he causes but his impulse control is nonexistent he seems to thrive when others are miserable and wants to argue to win even lashing out with personal put downs to win if no one is speaking to him that's also cause for him to get upset it's like being in a mine field he's not my mate he's the boys father at the age that your sons are their individual beliefs are set in stone short of therapy for them you're not going to make any significant changes in regard to how they might treat others they know even family so stop worrying about that if you did a good job and you were the balance they will come back to what they know even if they veer off the path regarding your mate wow sometimes men who come from backgrounds that appear to have everything a child needs is really tainted with things that cannot be seen maybe his mother was hypercritical yes she probably gave him everything and was a perfect mother in every aspect but i can tell you from experience something is lacking there regarding his father it appears he is incapable of seeing the good that his father did provide this happens for one of two reasons the boy believes he is a constant victim and therefore cannot have empathy with those arround him or he has not learned what respect truly is i would suspect the way you describe him that he does not understand what he is doing to you or your family if he's clued in enough to know how to behave with others then i would self evaluate if i were you you've had a rough life i take it you could be enabling this behavior to continue because of your issues one thing i do know is that when one person elects change the other must follow it can begin with you the bottom line yes i would seek professional help for the both of you sorry i know that's not what you want to hear and he's probably way opposed to that idea but i really feel some help for him could help you both rebecca Humphrey Bogart Theory of conduct EastEnders One Tree Hill (TV series) Transactional analysis Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sin City Shaggy dog story Abortion debate Autism Alcoholics Anonymous Infantilism Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Domestic violence Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Knots Landing Milton H.
