is this normal when i am down or whatever i go in my room put loud evil eminem music on and shout out the words it and write down lyrics an draw in the dark i then think of evil things an death an stuff does this mean im crazy i snap out of it the weird thing is i dont mind this happening its almost like makes me feel good when i feel like that if you say what a lot of people do is normal then you're quite normal except for maybe the drawing in th dark part maybe you should give that drawing in the dark a try when you're feeling usual and see what comes out although lots of people listen to loud violent music yell and scream to them it doesn't mean it's not a bad thing it's definitely not good for your mental health if you care about that sort of stuff like some people said instead of fueling your tendencies try controlling them there's nothing better than having complete control over your thoughts and emotions cos it puts you back in control and not the machine The Marshall Mathers LP Time Out of Mind Theory of conduct Social rule Buddy Guy Teen Girl Squad Evil Kim Possible Sin City Mental illness Blood on the Tracks Paul W.
