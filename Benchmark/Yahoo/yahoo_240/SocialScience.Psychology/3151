of hundreds more think for a moment about these individuals you recall in your memory try to call to mind facial expressions and conversations you have grown accustomed to since your childhood the comments some have made about their lives their concerns and worries and the ways they express them the remarks that colleagues repeat daily and what others say amongst themselves about their families and financial problems try to recall in your mind's eye the people you've seen in the street waiting at a bus stop trying to battle their way home through dense traffic or being splashed with rainwater by passing cars remember the images of actors in tv programs those who act the part of happy people seemingly enjoying themselves in front of the cameras and who claim to the press that they're friends but behind one another's backs say unbelievably bad things think about their spiritual state and the state of those unable to protect themselves from jealousy hatred rivalry or other such emotions and who while trying to entertain others because it is their job to do so betray their own unhappiness in everything they do off stage and off camera examine the lives of people who have attained the highest possible worldly rank who have enough money to buy whatever they want whenever they choose who live in the finest houses and own the latest model cars who wear the most expensive clothes and who because of their achievements are most respected and listened to in their community when you carefully consider all these people you will come across a very important truth whatever their circumstances may be there is one significant feature they have in common the great majority of people lead unhappy lives the goods and property they own the jobs they perform and their loved ones are not enough to make these people happy in any real sense these people's lives are ruled not by happiness tranquility pleasure and joy but by negative emotions like melancholy pessimism and hopelessness a great part of most people's time is spent in this mood when compared to true happiness those moments when they are capable of being happy are fleeting and extremely shallow sometimes too they may be driven to deceive both themselves and those around them yet deep inside they are experiencing a secret sorrow that prevents them from taking pleasure in all the good they see around them so why are these people unhappy why do they suffer such deep inward sorrow and lead lives that lack tranquility the reason why they suffer from sorrow and feel unhappy even in the best of circumstances is because they live at a distance from allah god allah grants people happiness only through faith and only in this way it is possible to take full pleasure in the beautiful things of

do think that majority of the people lead unhappy lives i look at my parents and sometimes i feel horribly sad for them because they are unhappy with their jobs but have no choice but to go on for the sake of making a living i think that most people are unhappy because they are frustrated frustrated with their jobs with the rat race with people who are born with silver spoons and seem to lead an easy life and that's also quite sad it seems so hard to find little pleasures in the things we do that's why we get bored and frustrated with them easily it also means that people are getting more wrapped up in their own problems i think that although most of our lives suck we have a lot to be thankful for we just need to open our eyes wider and see it Infantilism Yoga Sutras of Patanjali
