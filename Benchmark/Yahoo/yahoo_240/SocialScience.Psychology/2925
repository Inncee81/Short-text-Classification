is this normal sometimes when i get deep into thoughts ill blurt out a sentence im thinking about for example if i am thinking deeply about dogs i may say i like dogs aloud also when im in deep concentration like when working on math problems ill talk out loud more like a mumble i am told is this normal if not how do i stop also i sometimes like when im walking or in a car go off on fantastic adventures in my mind which is normal i think but it takes me a minute to snap out of it sometimes i find that odd is that unusual it is occuring less though but that is because im riding my bike instead of walking i think how do i stop that you're perfectly normal i do that kind of thing sometimes i call them loud thoughts in other words sometimes the things i'm thinking seem so vivid to me that later i'll start to wonder if i've actually said aloud the things i was thinking it's kind of strange but definitely nothing to worry about Shaggy dog story Father's Day (Doctor Who) Philosophy of language Psychosis Lucid dreaming Hearing impairment The Inside Russian joke Treehouse of Horror V The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Kodocha Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Out-of-body experience Philosophical skepticism Ludwig Wittgenstein The Lovely Bones W.
