is my humorous and quasi childlike demeanor scaring the females away i can't help it i'm but i feel like i'm maybe my looks don't match my personality i get bored easily at work if i wallow in my problems and thoughts too long i start cracking up i work with younger people maybe they get freaked out because they expect to be different by time they reach my age what i figure is that people don't really know they can still feel young after their s but whatever thanks for your answers and haters swallow your last words no but your humorous and quasi childlike demeanor is scaring you away from what you want in life there are some key things a woman looks at before she can consider a guy for a long term relationship they include emotional and personal maturity responsibility confidence reliability and adulthood and these are dead give aways as to how responsible you will be in your life together as a boyfriend husband and as a father there is nothing more endearing to me as a youthful playful adult but the key word is that this youthful playful individual is an adult the attractive aspect of childhood that most wanna be kids try to hold on to is lack of responsibility i am not implying that you are irresponsible you may or may not be if you do want to take on adult tasks like sharing an adult's life with them then you have to become an adult too it is a scary step but a step that you cannot afford not to make at the age of unless of course you want to continue to be single and not participate in an adult relationship remember there is no rule that says that you cannot retain your playful and youthful self but you do have to grow up in order to participate in adult activities Transactional analysis Infantilism Adolescence Asperger syndrome Past teachings of Prem Rawat Transsexuality Child Child sexuality Polyamory Narcissism Autism rights movement The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Human Child sexual abuse Motivation Adult attention-deficit disorder Statutory rape Pedophilia Alignment (role-playing games) Borderline personality disorder Grief Human sexual behavior The Ashlee Simpson Show Drama Childlove movement Jon Secada Girl One Tree Hill (TV series) Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Social rule Autism Avenue Q Tag Baldness Ageplay Stuttering Religion The Fairly OddParents Scientology beliefs and practices Adult Antisocial personality disorder Sexual orientation About a Boy A.
