is it in the bible because it feels wrong or does it feel wrong because it's in the bible this is a very good question that needs to be asked more often i especially like the churchillian wording which makes the point clearly through humor if you expand your reference to the bible to include all examples of holy writ it is easy to see that each reflects the culture that inspired it look around and you will see that culture is quite malleable for example there is solid evidence that some societies past and present have considered mutilation of self and others to be quite normal even beneficial right and wrong are obviously not absolutes even today this becomes tragic in the case of modern terrorism inspired by religious fanaticism to answer your question completely guilt is almost entirely based on core beliefs which tend to be based on the bible or other works of faith these works in turn reflect their respective cultures and at the same time reinforce them therefor the answer is both Religion Bible Fundamentalism Biblical inerrancy Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Ethics Infant baptism Theory of conduct New Testament Sexual orientation A Course In Miracles Evil Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Biblical canon Christianity Morality Evangelicalism Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints God and gender God Abortion debate Guilt Abington School District v.
