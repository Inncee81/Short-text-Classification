what would you do if someone in your team within an office was not pulling her weight try talking to her and let her know how you feel tell her that it's not right for her to let everyone else do the work and if she can't step up then the tasks that are delegated to her just wont get done and when the boss asks why the work wasn't done just tell him or her that everyone had their own assignment to do and for some reason she can never do hers and the only reason it was done before was because you and the other workers had to carry her load as well as your own try to be nice about it at first though ask her to lunch with you or for coffee and when the of you sit down explain it to her nicely and if that doesn't work then that's when you let the boss see whats going on Teen Girl Squad The Inside Extreme Programming Shaggy dog story Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Reservoir Dogs Blood on the Tracks Avenue Q Atomic Kitten Friends Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Beetle in an Anthill The Big Goodbye (TNG episode) Theory of conduct Undergrads The Apprentice 2 Infidels Johnny 5 The Contender (television series) Grandview, U.S.A.
