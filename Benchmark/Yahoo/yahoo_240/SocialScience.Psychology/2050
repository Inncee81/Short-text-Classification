how to dream a person who passed away i am not sure how this work but i saw clarity answer the question abt dreaming of dead person and experience weird things that make to believe they are surrounded i desparately like to find out more abt it if possible my bf just pass away and i am still trying to get over but really wish to dream of him and talk to him i am seeking if anyone knowing anyway to i knew it might be a silly question i wish to know if he is surrounded me too hv or encounterment which make me believe he is around if you hv faced the similar and hv some encounterment to feel that the person is surround you could you please share with me too because i am not sure if am thinking too much or is real my deepest sympathies to you in the loss of your boyfriend you need not ask how to dream of him because he will come to you in many dreams because he surrounds you all the time he's always on your mind you may feel better by talking to him as i know he will hear you you have already had encounters involving him so be comforted by any future encounters soon after my youngest son died so tragically he came to me in many ways it comforted me so much i had some other things happen tryed to tell people but many do not believe in that especially if they have never lost anyone close to them it's not silly to ask if anyone knows how you can dream talk to him it's normal Scenes from a Memory Jiddu Krishnamurti Shaggy dog story Lucid dreaming Social rule Children of Dune Jean Grey Jon Secada Out-of-body experience God Emperor of Dune Infantilism Avenue Q Time Out of Mind Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix A Course In Miracles The nature of God in Western theology One Tree Hill (TV series) Child sexuality Milton H.
