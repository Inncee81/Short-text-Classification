does seeing an unattractive woman literally make men unhappy or angry i'm asking this because i've actually noticed that when i go out with some friends who don't happen to be very attractive the men don't just treat them like a regular person who they're simply uninterested in they actually often show signs of impatience with having to speak to or look at them outright rudeness hurrying through conversations with them and these looks of disgust why do many men do this i know that women do this too but from experience i understand it to be insecurity on their part these women are normally unattractive and overweight and are always bitter so it's nothing to take note of but these men are often very nice outside of such situations so are men physically incapable of being around an unattractive woman is it painful in your testicals or something nothing but brutal honesty please no Physical attractiveness God Emperor of Dune Social rule Characters in the Smurfs Japanese honorifics Humphrey Bogart Theodicy Hwi Noree Brave New World Asian fetish Knots Landing Honesty The Smoking Room Dead Like Me Little Britain Brian Lenihan Texas Revolution Sexual attraction The Devil Wears Prada Zoophilia Gay slang The Shining (film) Traumatic brain injury Hiberno-English Theory of conduct Binge eating disorder Hearing impairment Body image Supernatural Shaggy dog story Transactional analysis Polyamory The Fast Show Sin City Miss Saigon Transsexuality Dualism (philosophy of mind) Philosophy of language Finnish language Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Euphemism Infantilism Contract Homer Simpson Elvis and Me Megan Griffin Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Garfield Rape Mojave people Cliff Richard Reparative therapy K' Iago Franz Boas Angel Undergrads Alcoholics Anonymous Cary Grant Predestination Abortion debate True Crime: Streets of LA Religious Society of Friends Germaine Greer Asperger syndrome John Lennon The Royle Family Archie Comics Kim Possible Domestic violence Rain Man Human height Married... with Children Conspiracy (TNG episode) About a Boy Ex-gay Eye contact Stock character Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Breath of Fire III Sadism and masochism Ren and Stimpy One Tree Hill (TV series) Yoko Ono Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Peter Griffin G-Man (Half-Life) Evolutionary creationism On the Nature of Things Opus Dei Ocean's Twelve Will & Grace Scrooge McDuck Fitz Hugh Ludlow Ron and Fez Slovak language Call girl Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity
