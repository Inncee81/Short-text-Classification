is this ocd i think i might have ocd but im not really sure okay ever since i was little i did stuff that would drive my mind crazy like i would have to step on the tile but not on the cracks if i did i would go all the way back wherever i started walking that went away after i got older but then i started getting thoughts that cant get out of my head like for a few months i had thoughts of me committing suicide and whats stopping me from committing suicide i'm not suicidal i love living i would then throw a ball in the air and say if i catch the ball times then i am not suicidal if i didn't catch it i would be devastated is this like ocd i do weird stuff like that too like if my phone's ringing i'll think of a random person i know in my mind and think if this person's calling me then i won't be alone forever and when the person calling isn't the one i was thinking of it totally puts me in a bad mood but no i don't think you have ocd your mind's just organized a different way than other people's may wanna look into some anti depressants for the suicidal thing though i have to take em i was bein weird about the suicidal thing too and i love life just had a chemical imbalance in that part of my brain good luck hun Obsessive-compulsive disorder Shaggy dog story Teen Girl Squad 1957 World Series The Catcher in the Rye Clinical depression Suicide Bipolar disorder Magical thinking About a Boy Paroxetine Luck The Shining (film) The Inside The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Procrastination Max Martin Aerial (dance move) Jon Secada Wonderland (McFly album) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Columbine High School massacre Time Out of Mind Clomipramine Social rule Borderline personality disorder Friends Satchel Paige The Ashlee Simpson Show Tenshinhan John Berryman Volleyball Immortality The Chemical Brothers W.
