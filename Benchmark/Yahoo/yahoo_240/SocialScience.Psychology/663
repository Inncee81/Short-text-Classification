why am i not motivated to do anything i have so much stuff to do like work but simply cannot motivate myself i love my work and atm just cant be bothered with anything i am happy with my life just feel a bit bogged under could it be because my long term boyfriend recently split up with me and im feeling lost help me titty lee i am not lazy i work very hard arfurchance that was not very nice my ex met someone else actually i have real problems i am not and if anyone was naturally idle it was him i did so much and was totally unappreciated i think i may just be feeling lost as my life has completely changed recently and all at once i feel like i should be depressed but i am not i am over my ex as i realised that i am better off without him i know what you mean one of my colleagues is of this week and all his work has been dumped on my desk there's so much of it i don't know where to start hence my presence here i'm afraid the only answer is to start with one thing at a time get it done then move onto the next thing don't look at the big picture just focus on the one small job in front of you you'll probably get more done than you realise and yes separation from a long term partner can cause depression even in small forms and it may be that i think that doing some of the work you love will help you forget him for a little bit Shaggy dog story EastEnders Extreme Programming 2000 Australian Grand Prix Carburetor Knots Landing The Ashlee Simpson Show Care Bears Rich Mullins Friends Pitaten Theory of conduct W.
