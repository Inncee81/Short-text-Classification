do you agree that violent actions that kids watch on violence video games had somehow affected their behavior absolutely i didn't think that til i saw how it affected my brother growing up he always had a video game in his hands and then started to become brainwashed into a fantasy world by these games he is almost grown now and still has these idea's that he can rule the real world it's very scary to think of how many children are growing up with these violent games someone needs to stop this as our youth and very young minds are being brainwashed by this corruption it is truly a serious problem i see it first hand young children should not be allowed to get ahold of these games this is when their minds are being developed and they can't tell the difference between reality and fantasy i saw first hand how these games affect a young vulnerable mind to all the parents out there you better listen up before its too late these games are played for hours on end and eventually the child starts to get drawn into them and they actually live these games it becomes their reality they start to incorporate the fantasy of the game into the reality of their lives they also see so much of the violence and bloody gore in these games and they become numb to it i would like to add that young children mimic what they see this is how they grow and learn to become adults growing up with shooting people and stabbing them over and over again on these games is like giving these impressionable minds a gun and knives it's wrong yet these games are still sold to the people who say it doesn't your in denial Motion picture rating system Theory of conduct Nintendo Child sexuality Computer and video games Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder The Marshall Mathers LP EastEnders Fatality Computer and video game genres Infantilism Captain Marvel (DC Comics) Console game Domestic violence Taxi Driver MTV Punisher Transactional analysis Miss Saigon Poker jargon Narcissism Persona (video game) Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters Final Fantasy magic Sin City The Invisibles Janet Jackson Fathers' rights Tenshinhan MMORPG Link (Legend of Zelda) Reality Mind control Video game music Milton H.
