is the observation of phenomenological psychologists scientific read details phenomenological psychologists believe that we are responsible for our actions we are not acted on forces outside our control but are actors capable of controlling our own destiny the issue is here is one of determinism versus free will i believe they are only partially correct behaviorally all organisms have a set of instructions hard wired into our cells called optimization you don't even need a nervous system for optimization to be present it's part of the cellular instruction what optimization states is that an organism will attempt to do the least amount of work for he most amount of reward hence a dog given a choice will more likely run to the closest of two equally full food bowls however when brains get involved then things start becoming more complex after all what is reinforcing to one creature may not be reinforcing to another even if those creatures are the same species or race or brains do have history effects and they can alter what we consider to be a reward the previously mentioned dog might be willing to travel further to get to a food he has a preference for even if it's a smaller amount however the higher the intelligence the greater the differences are apparent as well sometimes creatures that are more intelligent will engage in behaviors that seem like unnecessary effort like a cat playing or dolphins swimming complex patterns in a shoal but in actuality they are giving themselves better or more options for a later date then there is man it would seem insane that anyone would want to become a medical doctor eight years or more of school two or more years of internship not to mention the stress and the expense only to have huge responsibilities once you graduate however for a select few people the rewards are worth it hence i believe it's more like a bell curve on the shallow end there are people that are complete slaves to their brains they cannot seem to act at all unless it is following the rules of optimization the vast majority of people have a limited degree of free will which is hindered by their biology and social environment and at the other end there is a few individuals that can transcend their programming almost completely and focus on what they wish to do by their own wills now this is mostly opinion but i would feel that in conjecturing this that i'm not going outside some commonly accepted factors within the psychological community Free will Second language acquisition Behaviorism Drug abuse Scientology beliefs and practices Biology Artificial consciousness Sexual orientation Gender role Randomness Brain Education in the United States Infantilism Species Clinical depression Biology and sexual orientation Supply and demand Stuttering Microeconomics Human brain Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Determinism Inflation CPU cache Fermi paradox Action potential Chronic fatigue syndrome Addiction Compiler optimization Dog Strategic management Medicine Motivation A Course In Miracles Ethics Affirmative action Mental illness Cognitive science Occam's Razor Ecology Happiness Hypnosis Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Human nature Coercion The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Senescence Nutrition Hypoglycemia Economics Empathy The Bell Curve Divorce Predestination Principal-agent problem University of Maryland Baltimore County Expert system Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Altruism Consciousness Simone Weil Controversies in autism Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Neuroscience Reinforcement Graduate school Neuro-linguistic programming Radical behaviorism Bipolar disorder Race and intelligence Quizbowl History of intersex surgery Androgen insensitivity syndrome Efficiency wages Maurice Merleau-Ponty Insulin Anorexia nervosa Sleep Science Sex Democracy Out-of-body experience Intelligence (trait) Enzyme Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Asperger syndrome Philosophy of mathematics GED Surveillance
