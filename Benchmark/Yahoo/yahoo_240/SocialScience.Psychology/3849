pschological opinions needed please my fiance and i are really happy together he's and i'm however there is one major thing we cannot agree on and that's the issue of children he says he would like to have children and start a family in or years time i however am not sure if i want to have children sometimes i think i would but sometimes i am not sure one thing i know is that if i do want kids i would not want to even think about it until or years time when i am in my early thirties i'm nervous about getting married if we can't agree on this what should we do any advice would be greatly appreciated i was am in a similar situation i did not want to have children when i got married my husband agreed with me but later changed his mind we are not angry with each other but recognize that these are very important feelings for both of us and we talk about them regularly we understand that no one is right or wrong but that this is just a continual issue for us and we try to listen to each other respectfully we have decided as a team and couple not to have kids yet however it doesn't mean that my husband's feelings have gone away we continue to talk about it i would advise you to purchase a book by john gottman ph d called the seven principles for making marriage work his last several chapters deal with the big issues that are often unresolvable between partners e g styles of money family children sex etc his theory is that virtually all couples have at least one or two unresolvable issues simply because they are two different people and no one couple agrees on everything he gives advice on how to continually talk about these issues with understanding and respect there are usually many complicated reasons why people make these major life decisions and the more you can talk about them as a couple the more likely it is that you two will reach a compromise that you will both be happy with good luck there is no right or wrong answer it all depends on how you two talk about this e g the underlying issues and if you two can come to some kind of compromise don't let your fiance pressure you sometimes women don't want kids and that is okay at the same time his feelings also deserve respect Theory of conduct Goodness and value theory Laura Schlessinger Abortion debate Polyamory Marriage Human sexual behavior Friends The nature of God in Western theology Social rule Utilitarianism Infantilism Divorce Juliana of the Netherlands Moral Politics Economics Emperor of Japan David Hume Ethics Nicomachean Ethics Plame affair The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Bernard Williams EastEnders Microeconomics Sexual orientation Same-sex marriage Philosophy of language Transactional analysis Aesthetic Realism Avenue Q U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Humphrey Bogart 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Boston Public Supply and demand Women in Islam Yoko Ono Simone Weil Consensus decision-making Mail-order bride Happiness Immanuel Kant Traumatic incident reduction The Catcher in the Rye Le Malade imaginaire Fathers' rights Discordianism Legal aspects of transsexualism Homophobia Originalism Fiddler on the Roof Rich Mullins W.
