why would somebody throw away a great girlfriend just because he wants to be alone my ex broke up with me twice the first time and the second time both had the same reason cuz he wasnt in love with me any more and wanted to be alone the first time we were together for about years and we broke up for months and got bak together for months he told me he'd never do that to me again after the first time but he did he fell out of love with me again but this time he says he dosnt think he'll come bak to me again why r people like this and do u think he'll come bak again hes years old and quite immature i totally disagree to let him do his thing that's nuts does sound like he loves you but obviously is scared maybe he doesnt love you like you love him that's a guess if you keep taking him back you are letting someone else decide what you need if you want a relationship that you can count on one you can trust then this coming going crap needs to end once for all you have no reason to believe this guy even if he does some back to you he's proven that you can not trust what he says i'm not saying he is lying on purpose but maybe does not know what he wants himself and to the poor girl who said her guy did this several times but that they got engaged things have been ok since holy crap i'm sorry but i think she's kidding herself marrying someone will not solve relationship problems trust me i tried it doesnt work you will end up trying to hold the relationship together for the both of you that can not possibly work Friends Scenes from a Memory Saved by the Bell One Tree Hill (TV series) Eric Cartman Pip (South Park episode) EastEnders About a Boy Great Teacher Onizuka Sin City Recurring South Park characters Phoebe Buffay's songs Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Craps The Fairly OddParents Aerial (dance move) The O.C.
