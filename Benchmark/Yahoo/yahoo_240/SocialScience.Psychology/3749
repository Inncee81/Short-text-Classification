do you find that extended warranties offer you peace of mind i am writing a paper on extended warranties for class i am also curious how many of you have actually used your extended warranties i think extended warranties do offer peace of mind however i would only get then on either electronics large appliances or other things that cost quite a bit i buy them on these types of items i have also found that things tend to break right after the original warranty i sometimes wonder if they test the products to see how long it takes for something to go wrong and make the warranty period end right before that i had a television that i purchased an extended warranty for and ended up using it just days after the original one expired i believe the replacement warranties are best and just purchased one for my printer i have also used this type of warranty on my stereo you just call them and they mail you a postage label them they send you a voucher for a new one Warranty Postage stamp Implied warranty Mail Loss leader Product liability United States Postal Service Gramophone record Mattress Western Digital Embedded system Trademark Best Buy Copyleft BSD license Stamp collecting Sears Holdings Corporation Ethical consumerism Universal Serial Bus IBM PC compatible Fender Telecaster Objective-C Tamper resistance Mediation Computer virus Rebate (marketing) Bulk vending Nalgene Procurement CPU cache De Lorean Motor Company Deed Plastic Bluetooth De Lorean DMC-12 Common Unix Printing System Oscilloscope Intellectual property RFID Sound Blaster Annuity PostScript Direct marketing $ale of the Century Sinclair Research Ltd Land Rover Copyright law of the United Kingdom Teleprinter Taxicab Public transport Public-key cryptography Leasehold estate Computer Gross domestic product Laser printer TurboGrafx 16 School choice Overclocking Auto insurance Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd.
