why do some people shy away from accepting compliments and some are not sometimes it's hard to accept compliments insecurity plays a bigger role in accepting them compliments than you might think example if you tell someone they look really great in that outfit they may feel that their 'other' outfits must make them look crappy as no one commented on 'them' example if you tell someone they are a totally cool person to be around they may feel it would be wrong to just say thanks because they feel it would be like saying i know i'm cool to be around no one likes an egotistic person perhaps if you start the compliment by saying i feel or i think like i think you're a great listener then the focus would be on you and not them and it would be easier for them to accept the compliment shy insecure people do not like being the center of attention usually i hope this helps i think you are a caring person who wants your friends to know how you feel about them Social rule Megan Griffin The Apprentice 2 The Ashlee Simpson Show Religious Society of Friends Professional wrestling slang Hermione Granger Woody Allen Hypnosis Monkey (zodiac) Shyness Care Bears Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog Elvis Costello Transsexuality D.N.
