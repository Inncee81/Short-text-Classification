any advice on people who ask do you think it's ok i did that a friend calls me at least once a day to tell me something he has done like telling somebody he's got no time for them or asking a girl for her telephone number just ordinary things i would do without wasting one thought on them but he's always afraid he took too many liberties just saying what he feels thinks wants or doesn't want it's as if he asked me to give him absolution for a sin today he asked me if it was ok that he told his girl friend that he gets awfully jealous every time she mentions a certain colleague and i said oh you shouldn't have done that that's not ok there was almost ' silence and then we both laughed i wonder how to react next time i'm not a psychologist and he refuses to see one but i fear there is a deep lack of self confidence in this guy and i don't know how to handle it i seem to be surrounded by a lack of self esteem gang these days or maybe it's me who's overly self assured hi again most of you are right when i said he refuses to see a psychologist that means that i have already tried quite a lot of your answers on him we've discussed his problem but that doesn't solve it and it's not that much that he's putting pressure on me he gets on my nerves ok but that he's quite a decent guy and i would really like to help him shed that he has a lack of self confidence reassuring him will not help him in the long run Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Social rule Shaggy dog story Time Out of Mind Friends The nature of God in Western theology Coming of Age (TNG episode) Mojave people Theodicy John Kerr The Catcher in the Rye Avenue Q Pok__mon Live!
