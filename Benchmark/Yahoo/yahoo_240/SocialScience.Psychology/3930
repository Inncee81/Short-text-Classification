techniques for overcoming severe anxiety panic attacks and car anxiety first of if your going to say breathe just take deep breathes then do not bother i am talking about life crippling anxiety it can not get worse than this and i dont need to be patronised by being told silly little methods that dont work sorry but this is serious ive done some research but short of forking out money online to gather information about the simplest things and coping strategies i cant find much in way of methods to cope with this i got in the car this morning and straight away the moving sensation was making me feel strange then no more than mins down the road i almost fainted and had to turn around and come back no i wasnt driving i dont usually ask about these problems on here i like to appear strong but i am not i always know how to help others but its hard helping yourself this is serious i dont know what to do i am meant to be travelling tomorrow to see my grandmother some kms away i wont make it at this rate and i have seen the dr many a time he has told me all my symptoms lead to anxiety stress etc but i refuse to take pills thinking of taking pills makes me think of the side effects that i could get and on comes another horrible feeling its like being scared of life and everything in it and fearing everything serious answers only please most poeple couldnt possibly understand this yes many car accidents plus a lot of other bad things from the time i was a kid grandparents have also died this year i'll start out by telling you that while my response may seem simple it's something i've used at the advice of my therapist for social anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder it's called exposure response prevention erp therapy i was am being taught to use something called thought stopping when i get anxious when the very first physical symptom comes on for me it's an immediate tightness in my chest i have to drop everything stop what i'm doing close my eyes and tell myself to stop i have to stop the thoughts that i'm having and i have to stop for three seconds the exposure part is having the thing there that causes the anxiety the response is the anxiety but more specifically the first symptom of the anxiety the prevention part is where it gets tricky my therapist says we have to ask ourselves why we feel the way we do if you're anxious about being in a car you're afraid fear is emotional when you use stop thought you're telling your brain to switch from the emotional side to the logical side and you can ask yourself what am i feeling where is it coming from why am i feeling it is it apropriate for me to feel this way in asking these questions and answering them to the best of your abilities and in total honesty you're able to not only shut off the emotional response side at least for a short time but you're also able to re program your brain this of course will happen hundreds of times before you're reprogrammed but it helps you to understand why you're anxious and that it's a fear related response then you have to praise yourself congratulate yourself even though you may know along the km trip you'll do this a hundred and fifty times you congratulate yourself every time that's all that i have and i know that this may sound oversimplified and ridiculous but i can tell you that most of the time not always this works for me in handling my obsessive compulsive disorder which is an anxiety disorder i've been doing this for about a week and for the most part with an exception of one time i've been able to quell the obsessions and the compulsions of my disorder i hope you do well and if all else fails rather than turning around and going back home pull over get out walk around for a minute or two and try again Narcissism Borderline personality disorder Traumatic brain injury Psychotherapy Psychoanalysis Autism Charles Darwin's illness Milton H.
