do guys go through regression when they life significantly changes one of my close friends has been going through some regression since someone close to him passed away we've been friends for years and according to him and our friends i was always the girl that opened him up he felt comfortable w me and could easily tell me things compared to other people where they would question him about things he's a shy type with girls and keeps to himself with his own personal matters but open and outgoing with others since we've met he's always adored respected me earlier this year i realized i felt the same way and he did so we kinda got together kisses cuddles and i was his first kiss we're in our 's but after this we decided not to rush and become friends about a month later he lost his friend and everything went downhill with out relatiionship the whole time i was just concerned about my friend and how he was doing i didn't want anything else but for him to be okay and for us to be good friends again instead he's been avoiding me the most avoiding all his friends and only talking to certain people and i'm not included he has no problems anymore and he's back to this insecure quiet guy who comes off as an a s s h o l e my other friend thinks that he's just going into some regression since his friend's passing and it's his excuse to be selfish with himself and other people he's hurting me emotionally because he can and can get away from it he wants to feel needed is this true can someone help me understand this we've talked a little every now and then but it's not the same he prefers going to his other close friend girl to talk and hang out with me it's like i know he's confused but with me he puts up a front that he's completely okay doesn't need me and is happy he told me not to wait for him but i wasn't i just wanted a good response from my friend it's been a few months since it happened the tragedy regression the act of going back to a previous place or state return or reversion in this case he went back to being an insecure quiet non caring guy i don't think that that he's doing it to hurt you if he still has some part of his good side left in him he should still remember the time you spent together with him its probably the shock that caused him to turn a i really do not know what you can do now my advice is to believe in him i guess One Tree Hill (TV series) Kodocha Social rule Theory of conduct Humphrey Bogart Friends Shaggy dog story Pitaten Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) EastEnders Infantilism Avenue Q Blood on the Tracks The Ashlee Simpson Show Jon Secada Cliff Richard The Amber Spyglass Mina Mongoose Transsexuality W.I.T.C.H.
