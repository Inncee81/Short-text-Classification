and okay i'm almost and even though this is going to be totally embarrassing i'm still terrified of the dark and i have no clue why i always have been i know there are some people with this fear that are older but i feel very wrong and degraded about it is there a way to get rid of this phobia there's usually an underlying reason as to why someone is afraid of something and it could stem from a lot of things like some people are afraid of spiders and snakes because it's a trait that humans are born with they're afraid of what can kill them and both the aforementioned can in fact kill humans if you're still afraid of the dark it could because you can't see what's going on around you so there could be imminent danger or there could be a memory associated with the dark that could be triggering your fear but you aren't able to determine it people can usually help themselves or at least train themselves to get over their fear if it starts to interfere with your life you may want to seek outside help for the most part you should be fine just try to conquer it start small put a nightlight in your room start going without that nightlight for small periods like a day or two see if that works Anxiety Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Procrastination Phobia Panic attack Theory of conduct -phobia Kender Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Doctor Who (Enemy Within) Traumatic incident reduction Year of the Spider Determinism Abortion debate Homophobia Legacy of Kain Spider Mount Pinatubo Religion Fear Fear of flying Kim Possible RuneScape locations Piccolo Junior Saga Value system Alexander Technique Serial killer Shaggy dog story Monk (TV series) Dark Judges Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Social rule The Death Gate Cycle Chapterhouse Dune Blood (computer game) Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) One Tree Hill (TV series) The Second Renaissance The Smoking Room Chu-Han contention Human nature Agoraphobia Paranoia Agent Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban American Dragon: Jake Long Force (Star Wars) Bene Gesserit Ranma __ characters Lord Voldemort War on Terrorism Cult Diwali Sin City Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?
