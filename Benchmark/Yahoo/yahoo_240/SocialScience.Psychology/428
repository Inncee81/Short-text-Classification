vicodin addiction continued yesterday i posted regarding my vicodin addiction today i find that i have no more vicodin so now how am i to try and make it through the horrible withdrawl i have school and work everyday is there something that i can take to supplement that is over the counter like a pain reliever or something until i can get in to see my doctor you could trick your brain by putting asprin in your vicodin bottle or any vitamins or something that looks just like the vicodin pills this usually only works if you dont know that its not vicodin so this might not work so well but every time you have pain just take an asprin and think that it is vicodin or just get hammered Hydrocodone Analgesic The Marshall Mathers LP Drug addiction Aspirin Ketamine Addiction Controlled Substances Act Osteoarthritis Antidepressant Self-harm Sedative Obsessive-compulsive disorder Clinical depression Anxiety Migraine Tocopherol Vitamin Vitamin D Brett Favre Patent medicine Fecal incontinence Folic acid Dietary supplement Tryptophan Chronic fatigue syndrome Psoriasis The Venture Bros.
