regression if so why lately since my life has been in turmoil i find myself regressing back to when i was very young i previously lived in another area that was much more pleasant and then moved to a rich neighborhood where ppl where obnoxious i believe this may have trauamatized me i have since continued to go back to my old neighborhood and trying remember all the happy times it's like i'm afraid to get since my life is moving on even more one things that doesnt help much is i visited my old house neighbors and the woman who lives in my house was cruel she was out watering her garden and i said hello she didnt smile or anything i explained her i once lived in her house nothing else and she had no expression and went back inside after i said it it's not like i asked go inside i've also been watching home movies a lot and digging out old toys why am i feeling this way and what is a possible cause i enjoy looking back on fond memories but don't want live in the past either i think you said it all in the first line of your detail lately since my life has been in turmoil things are apparently going on that you want to escape that escape is taking the form of regression may i suggest that you make a change in your routine not necessarily a permanent change just for a few hours escape to the theatre and watch a movie lock yourself in a room with the computer and play i think you need a relief period from the stress you are feeling about the turmoil if i were a betting man i would put money on the idea that you feel powerless or that the turmoil has so many facets that you don't know where to start in your effort to improve things so take a or hour vacation do something that will consume you something where there is no room for turmoil stuff that is beating you down then start working on your life paper and pencil write the different things that are causing you so much grief then with them all in front of you start prioritizing and sort out the stuff you can control and the stuff you can't the pick the simplest one you can control and control it nothing helps a situation like yours more than a success after the success you deserve another short vacation give it a try it is probably a different approach and the methods you are currently employing aren't working very well good luck as someone once said like kidney stones this too shall pass Extreme Programming The Inside Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Scenes from a Memory Pitaten Microeconomics Infantilism Poker jargon Code: Lyoko Social rule Sin City Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Johnny 5 The Star Wars Holiday Special Sydney Riot of 1879 G-Man (Half-Life) Autism Time Out of Mind Boom Town (Doctor Who) The Shining (film) Current teachings of Prem Rawat Avenue Q Milton H.
