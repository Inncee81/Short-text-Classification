have u ever had an outer body experience is it a state of sleeping or reality once when i was about i remember being anxious and terrified about something which i won't go into i was in bed and had that familliar falling feeling you sometimes have when resting only this time my whole body froze and it was the most terrifying thing i've ever experienced the only thing i could do was breathe and swallow my own saliva i was alone i strugged to move so much but i couldn't even move my hands i seriously thought i was going to die naff as that sounds then very suddenly i remember being sat up in bed looking at my back and not realising what had happened i tried to turn on my lamp but i couldn't find my limbs other people who've i've talked to who've had this happen to them do not remember any sounds but i remember clearly the backgroungd noise of v loud tinnitus and people laughing at me mocking me for trying to turn on the lighht with my hands then as quick as it happened i looked at my back and willed it to move i was laying down again and moving i am absoloutley sure this was not a dream as i dream very vividly and im usually conscious that im dreaming when i dream if that makes any sense i was so scared it might happen again i didnt sleep for two days and got quite ill luckily it's never happened since but very frequently i get the same muscle freeze ive looked this up and apparently its called atonia a function to stop you acting out during rem sleep though it's rare for it happen when awake and it feels like it may happen again but i resist it i hate it personally Out-of-body experience Dream Lucid dreaming Shaggy dog story Milton H.
