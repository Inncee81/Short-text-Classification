how does aa work know someone who goes to meetings but hides drinks to take whenever he can get away with it aa doesn't seem to be working any ideas of what to say to him that might be helpful aa is merely a reinforcement if you don't deep down really want to quit you can live at aa meetings and it's not going to help fighting most addictions starts with dramatic lifestyle changes you have to view yourself as a new and different person this also means dumping most of your old friends yes you still like them but they are still in your old lifestyle and if you hang around them the subconcious message is to do what you used to do even if they themselves do not participate in that addiction the only friends you really want to keep are those who are not involved in the addiction and who will actively help you fight your addiction basically you have to find out if the guy is really wanting to quit drinking or if he has to be at those meetings to impress somebody might be a spouse might be a court order who knows if he's not serious about quiting you have to offer up to him the consequences if he's in aa the booze is affecting his life enough that he was forced to go there or chose to go there so find out why he goes there then remind him that if he doesn't quit the same problems that got him into aa are going to come back and worse for the most part not alot you can do until he decides he wants to quit drinking when he does it's a tough road if he's physically addicted it's not much fun even if it's a psychological addiction either way he has to change his lfiestyle make new friends find new ways to have fun that being the biggest thing there's a joke about a sign saying there is life after drugs it's just not much fun that's the same kind of mentality you have to defeat he has to see that there is something to do for fun besides drink if he doesn't find it not only will he go back to drinking it's probably better that he does real death beats being the living dead life has to have meaning and enjoyment and your friend has to find this without drinking Alcoholics Anonymous EastEnders Friends Theory of conduct Avenue Q Red Hot Chili Peppers Humphrey Bogart Knots Landing Infantilism Sin City Social psychology Mobile Fighter G Gundam Fight Club Divorce Pitaten Drug addiction The Beach Boys Goodness and value theory Nicomachean Ethics Traumatic incident reduction Social rule Alcoholism Procrastination The O.C.
