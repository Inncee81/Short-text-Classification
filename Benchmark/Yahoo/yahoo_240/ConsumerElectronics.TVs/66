television please help it's a long story but someone put a magnet by the tv so now it looks green and purple where the magnet was is there any way to fix this without buying a new tv there's no need to go buy a new television no permanent damage to the tv has been caused by the presence of the magnet however it has temporarily magnetized the picture tube this is what is causing the color impurity in the picture all consumer grade televisions come with an electro magnetic coil that surrounds the picture tube when the tv is turned on for a moment that coil is energized making a buzz sound it's purpose is to de magnetize the picture tube if leaving the tv off for at least minutes and turning it back doesn't cause it to make a buzz sound meaning this electro magnetic coil or degaussing coil has just been energized and demagnetizes the picture tube does not fix the problem then it must be done externally by someone who knows how to demagnetize the picture tube if it's a tv or smaller just take it to a tv repair place and in less than seconds they could fix the problem if the tv is bigger and far too heavy to carry then you will need to have a tv repairman come to your home and do this second job for you just getting him in the door may cost for this second job you could buy a degaussing coil and do it yourself it's not difficult but if you do it wrong you could make it look worse but if done correctly it will look good again Cathode ray tube Magnet Degaussing Naval mine Transformer Loudspeaker Gramophone record Second Battle of the Atlantic Fluorescent lamp Electric motor Tesla coil Electromagnet Thermal power station Circuit design Vacuum tube Oscilloscope Phonograph Microphone Computer Spacecraft propulsion Relay Mattress Hearing aid Laserdisc Tire Galileo spacecraft Automobile self starter Floppy disk The Midnight Sun Hard disk M60 machine gun Solar power Lightsaber Apollo 8 Welding Star Trek: First Contact Electricity meter Fusion power Digital photography Seismometer Magnetic cartridge Resistor Best Buy The Legend of Zelda series enemies Electrodeless lamp Linear particle accelerator Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Magnetic field Shaggy dog story Titanium Magnetic resonance imaging Diode Television Upholstery 8 mm video format Electric guitar USS Vestal (AR-4) Frogman The Time Machine Electrical generator Equine conformation Helium Wind turbine Light-emitting diode Neutrino Jumpstart 3rd Grade Windows XP Pittsburgh Steelers Items in the Metroid series Television commercial Magnetic levitation train Data remanence Amateur telescope making USS Tunny (SS-282) Bass guitar Inflation Space elevator Aurora (astronomy) Ionizing radiation M16 (rifle) Electromagnetism Transcranial magnetic stimulation Alternator Bob and George Technetium Movie projector Enriched uranium Guitar Mass driver Coil Debugging Wardenclyffe Tower Magnetism USS S-30 (SS-135) Apollo Guidance Computer GunZ The Duel Superconductivity Spin (physics) Serial London Underground
