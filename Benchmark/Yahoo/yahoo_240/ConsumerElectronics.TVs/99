can a p hdtv pick up the signals on cable today hello answers community my outdated tv has recently broke and i've had to face the fact that i need to upgrade to an hdtv unfortunately me and my family aren't knowledgable on this area of electronics i have been told that p will be broadcast eventually but i don't understand why a better tv can pick up lower signals of hd is it just a matter of compatibility or can it really work and people did not want to tell me yes a p hdtv will usually accept all other signal formats then convert them to the tv's native resolution there are some tvs that will not accept p signals but will accept i if you're using a cable box or satellite receiver to receive you hd signals you may be able to set it's output to whatever signal format your tv accepts High-definition television Television Digital television Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Cable television Xbox Satellite television Laserdisc DVD ATSC S__CAM Digital Visual Interface Widescreen TiVo Home Box Office Digital video recorder NTSC MPEG-2 RS-232 Teletext MP3 YUV Media in Canada Xbox 360 Broadcast television system Modem Oscilloscope SCART DVB Direct broadcast satellite Federal Standard 1037C Satellite dish Camcorder Communications satellite Low-noise block converter Atari 8-bit family Broadband Internet access British Sky Broadcasting Digital Satellite System Nintendo Revolution Musical Instrument Digital Interface Public Broadcasting Service 24 (television) Terrestrial television Video codec Pirate decryption DirecTV StarChoice Global Positioning System PlayStation Portable 1080i Floppy disk Law & Order ITU-T Set-top box Betacam KQED Digital cable Sound Blaster Optical fiber Windows Vista Radio clock Video Morse Code Ultra high frequency Liquid crystal display television PAL TV tuner card Audiophile Ethernet High-Definition Multimedia Interface Television licence Dolby Laboratories Light-emitting diode Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis VHS History of radar 1080p Electrophysiology Composite video Broadcast flag Phreaking DV Serial port Digital-to-analog converter Bluetooth Broadcasting Electronics Advanced Technology Attachment Voice over IP Sega Dreamcast Software-defined radio Anamorphic widescreen CFTO Atari ST Microphone Central processing unit The Late Show with David Letterman
