slvania ' big screen tv screen showing red color only hi i have a slyvania ' big screen tv and the color of the picture all of a sudden is very dark and red only sometimes it will go back to light but still the picture is not right i tried to adjust on the menu screen but it will do nothing any help out there would be appreciated a good way to determine if this issue is with the tv or something that you have connected to it is to disconnect everything and try to navigate the menus if you're still getting the red tint in the menus it probably needs to be serviced DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution Television DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX PlayStation Portable Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 2 Light-emitting diode IPod DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution Mouse (computing) Super Nintendo Entertainment System Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Atari 8-bit family Color Windows XP DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution 6thMIX Danger Hiptop Screenshot Stereoscopy Blue Inflation Gamut Mac OS X v10.4 DVD Pump It Up Yohoho!
