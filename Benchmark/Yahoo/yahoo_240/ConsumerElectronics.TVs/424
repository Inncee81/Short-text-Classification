how can i claim to use my extended warranty on panasonic projection tv so that they can't fix it replace only i have panasonic tv and spent more tan on that bcz i have purchased the extended warrnty too from circuit city i never used the warrnty and it will going to end soon i just wanna give a try to pretend that my tv has problem and such problem which they can't fix and they need to either replace it or give me a choice to get another model of the same price i know it may look like cheating but it is not because i paid a good sum of money on that which i never used thank you well usually the warrenty wont replace the tv unless its deemed unrepairable and that usually doesnt happen and if you try to tamper with the tv the technician who checks it out will know and will deny your claim another wat to get another tv is if the tv has the same problem usually more that times the manufacturer will say just give them a new tv but it is usually the same tv but your warrenty isnt through the manufacturer any more its through circuit city and if you prove to them that you have had the same problem more than times they might just give you the credit that you spent towards another tv any tv but you said that your warrent is almost up so i doubt that there is enough time to claim there is a valid problem with the tv more than times you should have thought of this when there was like a year left on the warrenty that way you would have a year to prove that your set is worthy of replacement so i think your stuck dude believe me ive seen it done and ive seen peolple get caught trying and ive seen it done succesfully it works best when the tv is out of the manufactures warrentybut still in the extended warrenty i think i gave you too much information use this for the good of mankind good luck Warranty Value added tax Microeconomics Ives Manufacturing Company Theodicy Economics Inflation IPod Tax Steam (content delivery) Poker jargon Sound Blaster Surplus value Law of value Baseball Stars Auto insurance Digital photography Gross domestic product Capital accumulation RFID Keynesian economics Copyleft Bank fraud Heinkel He 100 Labor theory of value Bond Commodity Galactic Civilizations Prices of production Cheating in Counter-Strike American Flyer Supply and demand ALGOL 68 Debugging She Loves You Great Depression Bretton Woods system Atheism Progressive tax Transformation problem Mick Foley Dynamic Systems Development Method Formal power series Contract MMORPG Normal distribution Ethical consumerism Capitalism Floppy disk Scientific method James Hanratty Surveillance Schabir Shaik Trial Agnosticism Leica Babylonian law IP (complexity) Life insurance Lionel Corporation Extreme Programming Pretty Good Privacy Land Rover Trademark 2000 Australian Grand Prix Atomic Kitten IBM PC Insurance IBM PC compatible Mahjong Annuity Minimum wage Axiom De Lorean DMC-12 Year 2000 problem Product liability Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd.
