daewoo dc television help hi i need some help if anyone is a tv expert or has had the same problem i have a daewoo dc dsl d lcd television i've had it for around months now every so often the tv would make a pop kind of noise and then turn off usually unplugging it and turning it back on again would resolve it but the other day when i was watching a dvd it did it and now will not turn back on i've tried the fuse and checked that the gang lead i was using was fine and they all were but the tv is still dead anyone any ideas whats gone wrong and how to solve it thanks ps the tv uses an adapter like halfway between the plug socket and the tv connection point only mentioning this because my dad thinks its a bit odd send it to an authorized service center for repair if it is the tv or the power supply in the cord it needs to be checked and repaired why if it is the power supply it is probably because something is wrong with the tv and why buy a new power supply from them if the tv is going to break it again Domestic AC power plugs and sockets BS 1363 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Windows XP Universal Serial Bus Fuse (electrical) Digital Subscriber Line Modem Telephone exchange Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sin City Thermal power station Friends Escape from New York Jack plug Electrical wiring (UK) Hey Jude Europlug Error correction and detection Laptop Television Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Residual-current device Liquid crystal display Power strip Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting SCART Poker jargon Shaggy dog story Good Times Super Android 17 Saga Domain-specific programming language Public-key cryptography Oscilloscope Earthing system Broadband Internet access Screw CPU cache Power cord Theory of conduct GM Daewoo Capacitor plague Tire X10 (industry standard) D-subminiature Nintendo Entertainment System Surveillance String theory Hamming code Watch Futurama (TV series - season 5) Time travel Back to the Future The Ashlee Simpson Show Microeconomics R46 (New York City Subway car) Daewoo IPod Death Comes to Time Epistemology U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 STS-61 Cerebellum Operation Petticoat Screenwriting Game Boy Advance Rodney McKay The Tracey Ullman Show shorts Extension Cord AppleTalk Personal computer Undergrads Transformer Asynchronous Transfer Mode Live Aid Cathode ray tube Theodicy Wire wrap Conspiracy (TNG episode) The Daleks' Master Plan PlayStation Portable Ethics USS Vestal (AR-4) Canon T90 EastEnders 11001001 (TNG episode) John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Wallace and Gromit Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Carburetor Electricity meter Keynesian economics Expert system Jumpstart 3rd Grade Protoss Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Battle of the Bulge USB flash drive Integrated Services Digital Network Stem cell
