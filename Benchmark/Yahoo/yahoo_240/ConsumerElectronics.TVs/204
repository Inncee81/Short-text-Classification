what does contrast ratio mean with respect to video the contrast ratio is the ratio of the measured intensities i e luminance measurement values for direct view displays and illuminance values for projection screens between the brightest white and the darkest black levels that a properly adjusted display system is capable of reproducing the higher the contrast ratio the better contrast ratio is a major determinant of perceived picture quality if a picture has high contrast ratio you will judge it to be sharper than a picture with lower contrast ratio even if the lower contrast picture has substantially more measurable resolution charles poynton unfortunately the contrast ratio specification is one of the more deceptive specifications much as microprocessor clock speeds were are and is regularly abused or misused by most display manufacturers there are two popular methods for measuring and specifying the contrast ratio of a display system the full on full off method which effectively measures the dynamic contrast capability of a display or image and the ansi now known as the iec contrast measurement which measures the static contrast capability of a display or image though far from perfect the iec ansi method can provide a somewhat better representation of a display s real world contrast performance it is also one of the few official standards that have been established for measuring the contrast capability of displays using the iec ansi method however produces results that are highly dependent on the testing environment unlike the full on full off method i would like to see manufacturers provide a minimum combination of contrast ratio specifications where applicable vesa fpdm full on full off and iec ansi specifications along with the test conditions that were used currently a level playing field does not exist when it comes to the contrast ratio specification because most consumer electronics manufacturers all too often allow their marketing departments to prevail when it comes to product specifications these same manufacturers seem intent on their unwillingness to fully comply with the recommended methods and practices being promulgated by standards organizations such as vesa iec iso etc nevertheless the video electronics standards association vesa has made very good progress with their flat panel display measurements standard fpdm which specifies soon to be different ways to measure contrast and hopefully responsible manufacturers will adopt such standards and practices when it comes to providing consumers useful and or meaningful product specifications you should also be aware that you can increase the ambient contrast ratio of a display by greatly controlling the level of light in your viewing environment using dark neutral colors on the surrounding walls within your field of view and most importantly properly adjusting the brightness black level and contrast or picture peak white level settings on your display in conjunction with optimizing your viewing environment or viewing conditions for more detailed information on this topic please be sure and read the first three references Liquid crystal display Television Light-emitting diode Laserdisc MP3 Movie projector Explosive material C programming language Unicode Color Pixel NTSC C plus plus Stereoscopy Oscilloscope CIE 1931 color space Computer Plasma display Microeconomics Projection screen DVD H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Loudspeaker Light pollution Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Welding Radar Inflation Windows 2000 E85 Decibel Bicycle lighting Video High-definition television Software testing Lighting Fuel injection XML Solar cell SQL ISO/IEC 8859 Microscopy Supply and demand Carburetor Gamut Diamond Analog-to-digital converter Organic farming Central processing unit Reliability engineering Jet engine International Organization for Standardization Contrast ratio Liquid crystal display television Electric motor PlayStation Portable Ada programming language X Window System PNG Nuclear magnetic resonance Atari 8-bit family Turbocharger Eyepiece Transistor Datatype Antenna (radio) Object-oriented programming MPEG-2 Color space Credit card Extreme Programming Intelligence quotient Windows Vista Widescreen Law of value Photography Digital circuit Konica Minolta Insurance Binary prefix Enterprise content management Information warfare Mouse (computing) Computer-aided design IBM PC compatible Wind turbine Binoculars Measurement Computer display standard
