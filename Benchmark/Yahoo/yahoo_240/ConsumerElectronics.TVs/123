how can i change the video input on my insignia i have a insignia ns htv with a phillips universal remote pmdvr everything works fine on it except i cannot change to the video input on the tv with the remote nor is any option for it on the tv menu and on the tv it self is there anyway to get it to change cause i really dont want to shell out for the original remote if i dont need to when properly programmed the input on your tv will change when you do the following put the remote into tv mode by pressing tv near the upper left corner of the remote change the tv's input by pressing tv vcr dvr which is located about halfway down on the right side next to the if this does not change the inputs on your insignia tv you should try reprogramming the remote using an alternate code unfortunately insignia is not listed on the brands of tvs that this remote will operate so you'll just have to hope that some other brand's codes will work to reprogram your remote do the following turn on your tv press and hold the code search button until the red indicator stays lit release the code search button quickly press and release the tv mode button the red indicator blinks off once press channel up repeatedly until your tv changes channels the red indicator blinks each time you press the button if you overshoot a valid code press channel down to go back to the one that works press and release mute to install the code there may be more than one code that works for your tv so if the video input won't change with one code try to search for another code that may work instead there's a chance that your remote won't work with your insignia tv in this case you will either have to get the original remote more expensive option or get a different univeral remote that has codes specifically meant for insignia tvs Mouse (computing) Pump It Up SCART Embedded system Traffic light HTML element System/36 Windows 2000 System/34 Macromedia Flash PlayStation Portable Atari 8-bit family DVD Oscilloscope Xbox 360 Remote control Windows XP Nintendo Entertainment System X Window System IPod Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Mozilla Firefox Konami Code Microsoft Windows Xbox X10 (industry standard) AmigaOS Nintendo DS Dance Dance Revolution Bluetooth Palm OS Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Beatmania IIDX ALGOL 68 Windows Vista Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting ITV Internet Relay Chat Danger Hiptop Guilty Gear Gmail Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Visual Basic Linux Slot machine Light-emitting diode DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution 6thMIX Original Amiga chipset Compact disc PHP Resident Evil (video game) Minesweeper (computer game) Amstrad CPC Digital video recorder Common Unix Printing System DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution PlayStation 2 Poker jargon History of the graphical user interface Fischer Random Chess United States Postal Service Radio Debugging Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX Vertical service code Computer Resident Evil 2 Sinclair ZX81 Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 2 Burglar alarm Rank Insignia of the Galactic Empire Microsoft DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution TiVo Screenshot High-definition television Hello world program Ajax (programming) Gradius Unicode Floppy disk Apple Macintosh Morse Code S__CAM Shirt Laserdisc ZX Spectrum Television Modem Mac OS X Starfleet ranks and insignia Team Fortress Classic Double Dragon MS-DOS Nintendo Revolution Videocassette recorder
