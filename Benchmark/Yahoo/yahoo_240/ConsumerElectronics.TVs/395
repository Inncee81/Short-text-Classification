i have a '' rca hdtv what is the resolution or how could i find out my hd channels look really good plus will a ps and hdmi make my tv have more resolution as you can tell i know nothing of this stuff and id also really like to know if my ps will look like it does in the stores with awesome graphics and all that inch sounds like it's an rca crt projection tv all crt projection units are i it makes no sense for a manufacturer to build a p crt tv too much circuitry to change the signal now if it's dlp or lcd it gets a little dicey because they make both p and p units however most p units have a nice sticker on the front stating that if you bought it this year it's possibly p because last year they didn't make any p units ok video quality let's get to it your hdmi connections have the same level of video quality as the component inputs it'll be up against but hdmi can handle the picture faster than component inputs especially with an lcd or dlp unit because they don't have to convert the signal much you'll never honestly see any difference in the two for the ps to look awesome you need hd games your old games will look ok but hd games wow ooooooh wowie wow wow ruff ruff the producers Television Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Liquid crystal display SCART DVD Oscilloscope Laserdisc 1080p Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Plasma display Cathode ray tube Digital Visual Interface High-definition television Pixel High-Definition Multimedia Interface Commodore 64 Xbox RCA connector Analog-to-digital converter NTSC Gamut DLP Liquid crystal display television Gramophone record Nintendo Entertainment System Atari 8-bit family Home cinema Synthesizer Computer Digital photography Operational amplifier Dynamic random access memory Laptop IMac Gameking Sound Blaster IBM PC compatible Digital projector Screensaver Sega Saturn Interlace TurboGrafx 16 Electrophysiology Composite video Central processing unit Atari ST Stereoscopy Sound card Digital television Windows XP Game Boy 8 mm video format Transformer Light-emitting diode Apple II family Amstrad CPC Digital cinema Teletext Digital circuit S__CAM Audio system measurements Digital cinematography Transistor TFT LCD Dolby Laboratories Compact audio cassette LCD projector Movie projector Xbox 360 Video Blu-ray Disc Musical Instrument Digital Interface Loudspeaker High fidelity Original Amiga chipset Digital Sega ZX Spectrum Digital-to-analog converter Gross domestic product Sinclair ZX81 MAME Camcorder Gamma correction RCA High-Bandwidth Digital Content Protection PlayStation 3 History of computer and video games Jack plug Universal Serial Bus Nintendo Revolution Atari 2600 Game programming Electronic amplifier Video codec Sega CD ATSC SGI Indy
