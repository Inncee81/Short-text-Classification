rca tv makes squealing noise won't turn on i have an rca tv model number f which won't turn on and when it's plugged in it makes a squealing noise nothing happens when pressing the power button does anyone have any idea what might be causing this the horizontal output is shorted the squealing is caused by the power supply attempting to drive the shorted output if you cut the collector of the shorted horiz output then you can turn it on and it shouldn't squeal if it still does then the horiz output also took out the volt power supply rectifier the horiz output is normally mounted on a metal heatsink near the black box with the red wire connected to the top of the picture tube the collector is the middle pin on the transistor you can cut it using a diagonal wire cutter found at sears or lowe's or home depot in the tools section do not have the tv plugged in when you cut it then plug it in after the collector pin has been cut turn it on for a tech it's a simple fix and would cost you about to if the rectifier is shorted Operational amplifier Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Transistor Diode Oscilloscope Vacuum tube CMOS SCART Nintendo Entertainment System Electric motor Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets IPod Gramophone record Computer Universal Serial Bus Electronic amplifier Jack plug Loudspeaker Commodore 64 Circuit design Digital circuit Welding Lathe Drill bit Solar power Linear regulator Incandescent light bulb Voltage regulator Fuse (electrical) Xbox 360 BS 1363 Switch Laserdisc Overhead lines Gas metal arc welding Atari ST Switched-mode power supply Mouse (computing) Current source Residual-current device Diesel engine Screw Three-phase electric power Fluorescent lamp Atari 8-bit family Logic gate Mercury arc valve Wire wrap Thermal power station Barbed wire Radio controlled airplane X10 (industry standard) D-subminiature Semiconductor device Integrated circuit MOSFET RCA connector Electrical generator Sega Saturn Personal computer Embedded system Hearing aid Electricity meter Tire Model aircraft RS-232 Seismic retrofit Nonblocking minimal spanning switch Microeconomics USB flash drive Amstrad CPC Field-programmable gate array Kenwood Electronics Microphone Uninterruptible power supply Laptop Capacitor plague Battery (electricity) Lightsaber Wind power Surface-mount technology Analog-to-digital converter Electronics Spark plug Seismometer Commodore C64 Games System Relay Variable Frequency Drive
