hdtv vs computer monitor since hdtv is just a buzzword and actually just refers to resolution why is it so expensive for a television to have good resolution but not a computer monitor here is an example i have a regular run of the mill computer monitor i've had for about years when i hook my xbox to it i can get resolution that is higher than p but not quite i however all the televisions i see that are under k can only display p so basically any hdtv i buy for under k is a downgrade from my monitor yet i can buy a new monitor that can display higher than p for a couple hundred bucks so if computer monitors can display hd so easily and cheaply why do they charge an arm and a leg for a television to do that what is different between a television and computer monitor just for comparison my monitor is inches an hdtv that size is more expensive than my monitor and doesn't have as good of resolution why i guess no one really cares or understands what i'm saying since no answers i guess i should jump on the bandwagon and buy an hdtv when my monitor can do it better and cheaper because that is logical very strong and articulated argument tv tech man when you spell it out like that i can see where the extra cost is incurred thanks for your response all though i do think they inflate the cost a bit b c they get to use buzzwords like hdtv or full hd and so on well what are you missing in a computer monitor sound circuits input circuits and the tuner circuits you don't get a remote with your monitor do you what about all the choices in your menu your monitor is beginning to sound a little too basic in my book man you're missing a lot in a monitor all it does is produce a picture with only one type of connection on it it doesn't have circuits for hdmi component and s video and standard video either you can't hook up audio at all and there's no circuitry for digital audio or optical audio and talk about the lack of channels all you have is pc video you don't get channels on uhf band and on cable band and none of the digital sub channels you can't stand feet away from it and turn it on or off or change the brightness or width of the picture you can't select warm or cool color temperatures can't get closed captioning it comes up a little short in the entertainment world hook up your dvd player to the monitor hook up your ps or sony xbox oh you can't can you at least not without unplugging your computer no switchable inputs but you can hook up a computer to a tv if you read the instructions Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Laserdisc SCART Digital photography Computer Atari 8-bit family Oscilloscope PlayStation Portable Xbox 360 Digital cinematography Xbox Video Nintendo GameCube PlayStation 3 Teletext High-Definition Multimedia Interface Compact disc Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Floppy disk Computer and video games Digital circuit MPEG-2 Digital television Analog-to-digital converter Central processing unit Amiga Original Amiga chipset Digital Visual Interface Nintendo Revolution Amstrad CPC Federal Standard 1037C Home cinema ATSC ATI Technologies TiVo Digital NTSC Transformer Digital-to-analog converter Modem 1080p Aspect ratio (image) Camcorder Liquid crystal display television TurboGrafx 16 Universal Serial Bus Gramophone record High fidelity Karaoke Atari ST Stereoscopy Plasma display 8 mm video format System/34 Musical Instrument Digital Interface PC Engine Computer display Sound Blaster Synthesizer Movie projector Cable television Loudspeaker Apple Macintosh Nintendo Entertainment System Bluetooth Solar cell Kenwood Electronics System/36 Pixel Closed captioning ZX Spectrum Sega Saturn CPU cache USB flash drive Electrophysiology MP3 Warez YUV PlayStation 2 Windows 2000 Videocassette recorder Dolby Digital Compact audio cassette Widescreen RGB color model
