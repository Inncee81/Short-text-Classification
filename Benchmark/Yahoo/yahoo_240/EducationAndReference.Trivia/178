another trivia perhaps the two vertices of an equilateral triangle are a and b find the coordinates of the third vertices also would you kindly state your complete solution hint the answer is a irrational number hint there are two answers those coordinates give us the following information the slope of the base ab is the length of the base is sqrt the midpoint of the base is the height of any equilateral triangle is sqrt times the base so the height of this triangle is sqrt the coordinates of the third vertex can be found on a line perpendicular to the base i e has slope that goes through the midpoint all you need to do is find the points on this line one on each side that are sqrt from the midpoint sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt Triangle Tetrahedron Parabola Cissoid of Diocles Trigonometric function Polygon Square root Octahedron Angle Rotational symmetry Conic section Complex number Polyhedron Pi Reuleaux triangle Hexagonal lattice Ellipse Simplex Tessellation Circumcircle Golden ratio Pascal's triangle Duality (projective geometry) Irrational number Pentagram Area (geometry) Analytic geometry Collision detection Archimedes Point groups in three dimensions Lattice (group) Pentagon Lagrangian point Crystallographic restriction theorem Trigonometric identity Square root of 2 Dirac equation Platonic solid Hyperbola Quadratic equation Boy's surface Regular polytope Catalan number Multiple integral Quaternion Proper time Huzita's axioms Glossary of graph theory Vector (spatial) Grover's algorithm Ruler-and-compass construction Delaunay triangulation Special relativity Hyperbolic function Pendulum Coordinates (mathematics) Line (mathematics) Quartic equation Heron's formula Trajectory Quantum harmonic oscillator Frame fields in general relativity Traveling salesman problem M__bius transformation Curve fitting Geographic information system Metric space Quantum tunneling Particle in a box Euclidean space Geographic coordinate system Fibonacci number Random walk Graph theory TI-89 series Ptolemaios's theorem Phonon Distance Roman surface Ruffini's rule Ramsey theory Coordinate system Simplex algorithm Fano plane Euclidean plane isometry Monochromatic electromagnetic plane wave Ramsey's theorem Coordinate rotation Phase-shift keying Slope Root system De Casteljau's algorithm Desargues' theorem Barycentric subdivision Icosahedron Cubic equation Rational trigonometry Altitude
