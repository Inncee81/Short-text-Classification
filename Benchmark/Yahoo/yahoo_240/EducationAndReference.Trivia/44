are there any uses for sand such as can building materials be made from it without clay etc yeah sand is used for making glass too sand comprises particles or granules ranging in diameter from or mm to millimeters an individual particle in this range size is termed a sand grain the next smaller size class in geology is silt particles smaller than mm down to mm in diameter the next larger size class above sand is gravel with particles ranging from mm up to mm see particle size for standards in use sand feels gritty when rubbed between the fingers silt by comparison feels like flour sand is commonly divided into five sub categories based on size very fine sand mm diameter fine sand mm mm medium sand mm mm coarse sand mm mm and very coarse sand mm mm these sizes are based on the sediment size scale where size in log base of size in mm on this scale for sand the value of varies from to with the divisions between sub categories at whole numbers sand is often a principal component of concrete molding sand also known as foundry sand is moistened or oiled and then shaped into molds for sand casting this type of sand must be able to withstand high temperatures and pressure allow gases to escape have a uniform small grain size and be non reactive with metals it is the principal component in glass manufacturing graded sand is used as an abrasive in sandblasting and is also used in media filters for filtering water brick manufacturing plants use sand as an additive with a mixture of clay and other materials for manufacturing bricks sand is sometimes mixed with paint to create a textured finish for walls and ceilings or a non slip floor surface sandy soils are ideal for certain crops such as watermelons peaches and peanuts and are often preferred for intensive dairy farming because of their excellent drainage characteristics sand is used in landscaping it is added to make small hills and slopes for example constructing golf courses beach nourishment transportation to popular beaches where seasonal tides or artificial changes to the shoreline cause the original sand to flow out to sea sandbags are used for protection against floods and gun fire they can be easily transported when empty then filled with local sand sand castle building is a popular activity there are competitive sand castle building competitions see sand art and play sand animation is a type of performance art and a technique for creating animated films aquaria are often lined with sand instead of gravel this is a low cost alternative which some believe is better than gravel railroads use sand to improve the traction of wheels on the rails Opportunity rover Sewage treatment Pottery Drill bit Erosion Brewery Explosive material Irrigation Balikpapan Gas metal arc welding Anchor Plastic Sedimentary rock Sand casting Beach Powder metallurgy Drainage Motor oil Dune Sediment Tank Knife Aggregate (composite) Masonry Corrosion Geology of the Moon Seismic retrofit Vacuum Eolian Welding Optical fiber Glass Portland cement Ecology of Hong Kong Spark plug Thermal power station Swiss plateau Bar (landform) Internal ballistics Terminal ballistics Houseplant Dairy Levee Drawing Lake Igneous rock Geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area Deforestation Saxophone Silicon Hydrogen economy E85 Hamster Bass guitar Wood Tofu Loudspeaker Fire extinguisher Nuclear weapon design Peanut Solar cell Gas tungsten arc welding Carburetor Coffee County Antrim River Sand art and play Geography of Albania Concrete Fire fighting Phase (matter) Building material Sandpaper Tuff Nuclear fallout Biodiesel Incandescent light bulb Geology of the Grand Canyon area Transformer Geology of the Alps Rail tracks Handloading Erie Canal Hampshire
