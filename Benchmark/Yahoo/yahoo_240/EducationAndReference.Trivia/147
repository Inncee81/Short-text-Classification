edward humphrey wants to know what is the difference between coal tar and asphalt edward humphrey wants to know what is the difference between coal tar and asphalt the chemical makeup or the ingredients asphalt is a sticky black and highly viscous liquid or semi solid that is present in most crude petroleums and in some natural deposits there is some disagreement amongst chemists regarding the structure of asphalt but it is most commonly modeled as a colloid with asphaltenes as the dispersed phase and maltenes as the continuous phase in u s terminology asphalt or asphalt cement is the carefully refined residue from the distillation process of selected crude oils outside of north america the product is called bitumen the primary use of asphalt bitumen is in road construction where it is used as the glue or binder for the aggregate particles the road surfacing material is usually called 'asphalt concrete' in north america or simply 'asphalt' elsewhere the apparent interchangeability of the words 'asphalt' and 'bitumen' causes a lot of confusion outside of the road construction industry despite quite clear definitions within industry circles coal tar n a viscous black liquid containing numerous organic compounds that is obtained by the destructive distillation of coal and used as a roofing waterproofing and insulating compound and as a raw material for many dyes drugs and paints Petroleum Oil refinery Tar Alkane Coal Tar sands Pavement (material) Asphalt concrete Gasoline Sulfuric acid Benzene Non-conventional oil Carbon Fractional distillation Roof Future energy development Abiogenic petroleum origin Town gas Concrete Perfume Ceramics Road Explosive material Liquid crystal Water (molecule) Titanium Athabasca Oil Sands Alcohol fuel Vanadium Viscosity Chemistry Methane Carbon dioxide Helium Hydrogen Charcoal Distillation Photography Alternative fuel Energy development Construction Chocolate Portland cement Hydrogen economy Resin Solar power Motor oil Mercury (element) Glass Water purification Renewable energy Turquoise Hubbert peak theory Transformer Industrial wastewater treatment Cracking (chemistry) Thermal power station Masonry Nitrogen Oil shale Volcano Methanol Diesel Aniline Architecture of the California missions Oil supplies Kerogen Raney nickel Industrial process Silicon Uranium Aggregate (composite) Plutonium Essential oil Polychlorinated biphenyl Silver Natural building Phase (matter) Waste management Alcohol Chloroform Solar cell Ammonia Economy of Nigeria
