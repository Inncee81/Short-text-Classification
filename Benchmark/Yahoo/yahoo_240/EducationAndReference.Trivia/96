i dont know the differences between circumcised uncircumcised penis please explain in details ok visual difference they both look the same hard while soft a circumcised guy's knob shows on the end the part that looks like a helmet an uncircumcised guy will look like an elephant trunk tapering at the end hiding the knob inside because the knob is always hidden under a layer of skin it stays moist literally mucous and has a shiny appearance circumcised guys don't have their knob covered in skin all the time so it's dry just like any other skin on the body the anatomical difference the skin on the penis is loose and slides back and forth on the penis it is attached fixed at two places at the base where it attaches to the abdomen skin and at the place just behind the knob on uncircumcised guys the skin is actually longer than the penis itself so it hangs down and folds back on itself drooping down over the knob and covering it on circumcised guys the skin is shortened so that it's the same length as the penis because it's shorter it doesn't fold back on itself or cover the knob well there you have it Penis Glans penis Circumcision Foreskin Foreskin restoration Strap-on dildo Vulva Ridged band History of male circumcision Knife Phimosis Medical analysis of circumcision Clitoris Pubic hair Masturbation Plastic surgery Smegma Anatomy Pachypodium brevicaule Puberty Gliding action Syphilis Autonomic nervous system Chancroid Fecal incontinence Undergarment History of anatomy in the 17th and 18th centuries Skin Body modification Orgasm Hair Prostate cancer Climbing equipment Kyle Broflovski Human penis size Abdomen Katana Penile cancer Windows XP Stage lighting Dispensationalism Oral sex Lung Sex organ Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Ulna History of Christianity Coconut crab Pachypodium baronii Cellular network Sexual fetishism Penis removal Decompression sickness Erection Goatse.cx Mummy Casting Balanitis Aquatic ape hypothesis Hypospadias Sexual differentiation Professional wrestling holds Extreme Programming Drill bit Dinosaur Trombone Aerial (dance move) Glossary of climbing terms Tarantula Frenulum Testicle Evidence of evolution Head Seismic retrofit Pachypodium bicolor Leaf Gay slang Herpes simplex virus Jewish Christians Condom Electrophysiology Circumcision advocacy Human anatomy How to prepare an onion cell slide Epithelium Humerus Doom enemies Anatomical terms of location Maize Mattress Intersexuality Comanche Nile crocodile Chair Violin Brassiere
