how can i create still pictures from a video my sister thought she was taking pics but actually took a video is there anyway i can edit the video in such a way that i get a still photo there are many ways to do this i am assuming it is digital video although tape video can be made into pics also however once you show the video on your computer you can pause the video at the point where you wish to take the picture and hit the printscreen button on your keyboard that causes the computer to generate an image of whatever is on your screen then you can go to any picture editing program and use the edit function to paste the printscreen image onto the editor that image can be edited also or saved as a jpg file or some other picture file this is by far the simplest way although there are many programs out there that do very much the same thing microsoft has the printscreen button on the upper right hand side of the keyboard sometimes labeled prntscrn sysrq or insert good luck Screenshot Game controller PlayStation Portable Mouse (computing) Embedded system IPod Atari 8-bit family Nintendo GameCube Windows Vista Mac OS X v10.4 ASCII art ZX Spectrum Goatse.cx Floppy disk Synthesizer AmigaOS Emacs Text editor PlayStation 3 Digital image editing Macromedia Flash Windows Mobile Microsoft QuickTime Pixel Opera (web browser) Apple Computer ITunes Dance Dance Revolution JPEG WordStar Intellivision Stereoscopy Windows 2000 Microsoft Windows Computer and video games X Window System Pinball Universal Serial Bus Defender (game) Super Nintendo Entertainment System Apple II family Editor Xbox 2D computer graphics IBM PC keyboard Podcasting IBM PC compatible Traditional animation Unicode Linked list Computer Amiga CPU cache Object Desktop Prank flash High-definition television Cheating in Counter-Strike Image file formats TRS-80 Common User Access Sega Dreamcast BASIC programming language Icon (computing) PlayStation 2 Xbox 360 Dither Computer virus Ebook Logo programming language Computer animation Final Fantasy (video game) Slot machine Text Editor and Corrector Laserdisc Computer forensics Video game music Musical Instrument Digital Interface TiVo Command line interface System/34 Internet slang Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Newline Macro Apple typography Nintendo Revolution Copy protection HyperCard Debugging TRS-80 Color Computer Anamorphic widescreen MSN Messenger Forth programming language
