need help deciding between two cameras pentax w or nikon d i'm in the market to buy a new digital camera the main uses would be for outdoor nature photos im by no means an aspiring professional photographer but enjoy taking photos i have been focusing on two totally different types of cameras and was looking for some reviews from users of these cameras the pentax w point and shoot and the nikon d i am aware of the huge differences between these two cameras but need help on decided whats best for me please do not give websites i've already been there personally forget the point and shoot i actually have one but i don't do any serious work with it it's just for the odd snapshots when i don't want to carry my slrs in their rather heavy knapsack i'd suggest two choices go for those cameras that look like slrs but aren't or go for the nikon in some respects you sound like me i started thirty seven years ago with a film slr with the only intention to take some good snapshots over time i migrated to a professional film slr and now i have two nikon digitals a d s and a d the nice thing about the ones that look like slrs is that you can get a lot of slr features except interchangeable lenses that means you have the controls and the tools to do outstanding pictures and to also master photography later as you outgrow the camera assuming you do you can then go for the slr and still keep the other one for those days you don't want to carry around a lot of lenses and stuff just be aware they're limited in what they can do and they're not very fast which means you may miss the odd pictures that isn't an issue when you have a mountain it's not going anywhere but when you're at a party sometimes seconds count to capture that special moment and expression on the other hand now is a good time to consider an slr i'd suggest the nikon d x actually instead of the d and i'd suggest an mm mm lens which will cover just about anything you want to do today later you could add a wider angle zoom and also a longer telephoto but in the meantime you'd have an outstanding lens range in a single lens that should keep you happy for years going straight to the d x accelerates your ability to really master photography and if later you outgrow your d x you can shoot for the d or whatever replaces it that one has a lot of professional features that you'd really appreciate once you're ready the nice thing is that the lens will still work for you and if you happened to buy a nikon flash in the meantime that too would still work fine too my personal opinion is to go for the nikon d x as your best choice that gives you something to grow with i remember when i started if i had bought an expensive regular film camera i'd have replaced it a year later with an slr so i was happy to start with the slr i have a feeling you'd be happier with that too when i went digital i started with a nikon d s replaced now by the d and i grew to a nikon d a year later i have three lenses and a huge flash too among other gadgets at the same time i also have a little point and shoot canon powershot g that i bought long after the digital slrs so that i have something for my pocket for those days when i really don't want to carry the slrs around that camera frustrates me it's got limited range in funcitonality and it's slow compared to my slrs but it serves the purpose at a party or dinner if i had to give up one of the cameras the canon would be the first to go i hope that helps a little good luck Photographic lens Photography Cinematography Digital camera Canon T90 Contax Nikon FM2 Nikon FE Panoramic photography Rangefinder camera Nikon FM Stereoscopy Nikon FA Camera Macro photography Camcorder Binoculars Street photography Medium format Nikon D70 Advanced Photo System Point and shoot camera Panavision Closed-circuit television Canon PowerShot G Full frame digital SLR Computer Windows Vista Film Zoom lens Eyepiece Movie projector IBM PC compatible Shaggy dog story Depth of field Volleyball Anamorphic widescreen Cinerama Canon EF lens mount Poker jargon Canon FD Surveillance Shutter speed Canon EOS-300D Photojournalism Apollo 8 Cosina Pinhole camera Photographic film Secure Digital card Disposable camera Television Quake III Arena Gross domestic product Traditional animation Amateur astronomy Knife Schneider Kreuznach Lens (optics) Olympus (company) Machinima Aperture IMAX Motion picture terminology Technicolor Timeline of photography technology Theory of conduct Twin-lens reflex camera 24 Hours of Le Mans Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Airsoft Lightsaber Canon EOS-20D High-definition television Gramophone record The Star Wars Holiday Special Laserdisc Underwater photography Lightning Internal ballistics Road-rule enforcement camera Pornography Canon Inc.
