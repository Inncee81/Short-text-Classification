how do i choose the camera i want what traits should i pay attention to details please i thought that the higher are megapixels the higher is the quality of a picture wrong i tried a megapixel camera from canon digital elph and the pics come out really grainy not that the camera is bad but it's not what i am looking for what i would like to know is what sort of camera i should look for if i'm looking for a good quality in nature pics mountains forests ocean etc nature in one word and also how can i make sure that zoomed in images will look good clear not obscure as if it's not taken from too far away now i know very little about cameras i would really appreciate if you give me the exact parameters i need to look for from what range to what range what sort of lens what brand how many megapixels details please and if you know the price ranges it would also help a lot also what should i look for the images taken at dusk and dawn w t a lot of light i appreciate whatever info i can get thank you all for the good info especially a user by name 'r m' and btw i never mentioned that the pics print grainy overall images appear grainy on the screen no matter what mode i use i started looking for the camera according to things listed by 'r m' and i think my head is about to explode the more you learn the more questions come out on the way so is ' mm f g ed af s dx lens' considered a good lens and overall is 'nikon d kit w af s dx zoom nikkor' considered a good camera i found one for thanks again there are three key things you should look for speed the faster the response when you press the shutter button the better you'll be able to capture those special moments this is known as shutter lag you want a very small shutter lag the best is around second the worst is around seconds noise in low light conditions a camera with noisy electronics will produce images with lots of speckles this is similar to graininess found on film cameras you want a camera with very low noise especially at iso settings of or more this will result in nice clean shots in low light conditions image sharpness a crisp image will be the combination of a good lens and image sensor the only way to get the best of all three features is to go with a dslr style camera such as the nikon d the downside to dslr cameras is that they are large and heavier that something like a pocket side digital elph Konica Minolta View camera Photography Digital camera Photographic lens Camera Cinematography Film speed Stereoscopy Single-lens reflex camera Movie projector Canon T90 Nikon D70 Mouse (computing) Digital cinema Binoculars Widescreen Nikon FE2 Camcorder Nikon FM2 Pixel Nikon FA Panoramic photography Shutter speed Amateur astronomy Aperture Digital camera back Digital cinematography Motion capture Contax Canon EF lens mount Anamorphic widescreen Street photography Photographic film Floppy disk Bluetooth Nikon FE Danger Hiptop Macro photography Exposure (photography) Automatic number plate recognition Canon EOS-300D Zoom lens Canon EOS Opportunity rover Game Boy Quake III Arena Nikon FM Secure Digital card Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Charge-coupled device Hard disk Film Ebook Computer vision Gamut Pinhole camera Point and shoot camera Television CPU design Antenna (radio) Zeiss Time-lapse IMAX Gramophone record Modem Digital image editing PlayStation Portable Tank Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory GunBound Enlarger Computer Medium format Technicolor Wind turbine Advanced Photo System Bicycle lighting Carburetor Closed-circuit television Walkman Canon PowerShot G Extreme Programming Digital video Zire Handheld Road-rule enforcement camera Shutter (photography) Pump It Up Laserdisc Depth of field BASIC programming language Xbox 360
