best digital cam for taking pictures of yourself sure that sounds vain but i'm going on a trip overseas and i want to have plenty of pics not just pics of the surroundings but pics of myself experiencing the surroundings it's always nice to see yourself at times when you were happiest or adventuring so with that said i'm looking to buy a digital cam for the first time but i need one that allows me to see myself when shooting a pic of myself maybe one with a flip screen thanks for your suggestions you want either an articulating camera like the nikon coolpix s or s or one with an articulating lcd panel like the canon powershot a both are very good cameras with lenses that let you and the background be sharp this works best in wide angle settings cameras in which the lcd is not in a fixed position to the lens also let you take overhead shots in crowds while being able to see exactly what you are taking as well as very low to the ground shots which sometimes enhance the perspective in urban settings as always practice with your camera before you go on the trip and see what accessories batteries chargers extra digital storage cards you will need have a great trip Digital photography Stereoscopy Digital single-lens reflex cameras Digital camera Television Canon PowerShot G Movie projector View camera Photographic lens Nikon Corporation Panoramic photography Liquid crystal display Cinematography Leica Game Boy PIC microcontroller PlayStation Portable Digital camera back Nikon FA Camera Film Anamorphic widescreen Zoom lens Widescreen Nintendo DS Point and shoot camera 70 mm film Universal Serial Bus Depth of field Gameking Digital cinematography Contax IMAX Binoculars Single-lens reflex camera Sharp Zaurus Canon EOS Tungsten Handheld Game Boy Advance Danger Hiptop Laptop Street photography Liquid crystal display television Cinerama GunBound Parallax Rangefinder camera PowerBook Gamut Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March High-definition television IBM PC compatible Mouse (computing) Patricia Ford Cheating in Counter-Strike IPod Raw image format Movie camera Pornography Atari ST History of computer and video games Screenplay Archos Joel and Ethan Coen Pixel Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Vacuum tube Nikon D70 Nintendo Nintendo 64 PC Engine Bluetooth Canon EOS-300D Canon Inc.
