which camera is best for beginner i am going to college to study photography with the hope at the end of the year course of setting up my own business i want to buy my first 'real' camera to get me started and was wondering what type would be best ie sony nikon canon etc i want a good one that will last me a long time not just through my studies i was looking at the nikon d but not sure if i should start with something a little 'less professional' also can anyone suggest the best place to get such cameras and accessories i am in the uk thanx if you are thinking of doing photography seriously then you'll have the best choice of optics if you go down the canon or nikon route both systems have their die hard afficianados the nikon system is more backwards compatible as in you can buy many older mf lenses to fit and still work to some degree on current nikons that said canon lenses from the last years should work on any current eos camera a couple of things to consider buy a good body just now no harm to the budget models but they tend to lack some of the features you'll want you will need a camera with a 'pc' socket for studio flash you will need a camera with spot metering so you are looking up the range a wee bit also forget the kit lenses buy a body only and get a sigma there are two versions one at around one at around both are better than the supplied lenses that canon and nikon ship with their budget bodies buy the best you can afford canon tend to have the edge for professional photojournalists they have better af and faster buffers but don t expect any pro camera to be cheap most importantly go into a shop and handle the cameras both are good but a lot of it will come down to which one fits best in your hand the canon system tends to have more versatility in that they have full frame and aps c frame cameras in their range a lot of folk really rate the eos d but be warned it isn't as fast as the eos 's or nikon d 's but it is full frame better for wide angle in partiuclar canons ef lenses not ef s are suitable for both canon eos film and digital cameras nikons dx lenses don t work so well on film cameras though any other f mount lens will af d af g etc the other advice might be just to get a cheapish manual film camera something like a pentax k or a nikon fe or fm these will force you into learning the absolute basics and reward the effort you put in just check your college still uses darkrooms first if you buy a nikon fe or fm then you would be able to use this system lenses along side a nikon digital system in the future though nions digital dx lenses won t work with the old manual bodies so not a straight forward answer but not a straight forward question as i said the important thing is to buy something that feels right in the hand it's hard to buy a bad camea these days just make sure it's going to be comfortable in use if you buy a budget end dslr you might be kicking yourself in a couple of months go and see the folk at calumet they have the best prices even compared to the internet and helpful staff who'll give you good advice they don t have that many shops and they only open office hours but they make up for it with everything else enjoy the course and good luck Camera Single-lens reflex camera Nikon D70 Binoculars Full frame digital SLR Nikon FM2 Nikon FA Canon EF lens mount Rangefinder camera Cinematography Movie projector Photographic lens Advanced Photo System Nikon FE2 Pentax Nikon FM Contax Floppy disk Stereoscopy Macro photography DVD Digital camera Canon EOS-300D Panoramic photography Digital camera back Bicycle lighting Canon FD Universal Serial Bus IBM PC compatible Medium format Strap-on dildo Equine conformation Film PlayStation Portable Canon PowerShot G Mouse (computing) Compact audio cassette Amateur astronomy IMAX IPod Charge-coupled device Canon Inc.
