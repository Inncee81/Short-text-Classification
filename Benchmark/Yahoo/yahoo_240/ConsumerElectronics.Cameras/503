digital camera buying whats the best here's the specs im looking for m p min prefered optical zoom min x prefered x face detection is a plus image stabilization is a plus smart flash correction is a plus i saw a camera that has a setting to take two pictures with one click one with flash the other without i want both auto and manual focus options i want to have manual options for most everything shutter f stop etc auto settings are a plus night landscape fireworks portrait etc having the option to attach different lenses is a huge plus im going to be taking lots of outdoor pictures in the mountains and of wildlife so i want to have big time zoom capability i also want to be able to attach filters for uv etc im also going to be using the camera for indoor pictures family party etc slr would ve nice but not required movie sound great i would like the price to be under for the camera and under after lenses filters tripod memory batery etc what do you guys think about fujifilm finepix line i can get any of these under s fd s fd s s s http www fujifilm com products digital cameras s finepix s fd specifications index html i use several standard answers but i don't give the same freaking answer for every single question regardless of whether it is helpful or not i don't know why this bothers me tonight but it does the pentax optio w is mp the optical zoom is only x it does not have full manual exposure control you are describing a digital slr in your spec list but you will have a hard time getting that kind of optical zoom for your budget so called optical zoom is not used as a measure of lens power in slr's anyhow here's a camera for you to consider it's not exactly what you have specified but i think it will perform better than you expect for the money look at a nikon d with the lens this is available from b h photo see yahoo shopping for techincally speaking is x zoom but it's the raw number that matters see http www flickr com photos samfeinstein for an idea what this lens covers look at the actual numbers and not the equivalent numbers would give you the first six pictures and every single focal length in between on a point and shoot super zoom camera you will find that they have a range but it is covered in steps so you end up with maybe different focal lengths instead of different focal lengths you can use auto exposure or any of the various scene modes as well as the infamous p a s and m modes for various degrees of exposure control up to full manual control this m is direct too and you don't have to play with menus to change your settings the way you do with a p s camera this is much faster you can use manual or auto focus you can choose from about lenses that give functionality on this camera and hundreds that do everything except auto focus see http www members aol com swf nikonafs txt for a list of af s lenses or see http www nikonians org cgi bin dcforum dcboard cgi az read count om forum dcforumid for even more obviously you can attach filters of all kinds which is a chore with p s cameras if it is possible at all with the d you are not getting your preferred mp but you are getting a sensor that is huge compared to p s cameras check out this tutorial and read the caption http www flickr com photos samfeinstein bear in mind that all of the currently available super zooms have the smaller sensor you will have so much more sharpness with a mp slr sensor than a mp sensor that it's not even funny you are giving up the following from your list no movies face detection many people defeat this after they see how much it slows the camera down just focus on the face and recompose you can find the face faster than the camera can the camera does not have image stabilization i agee that this is a plus but as you add a lens or two just buy a nikon vr lens they do cost a bit more but they are not insanely expensive my wife just got a very useful vr lens for i don't know what smart flash correction is but you can vary the output of the on board d flash some p s cameras might have a larger aperture that makes them seem better suited for low light but again the tiny sensor defeats any attempts to take really low light shots an slr will do much better in low light because of the larger sensor to get an idea what normal people can do using auto on the d check out check out nikon's picturetown
