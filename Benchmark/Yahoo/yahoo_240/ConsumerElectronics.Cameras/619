canon and nikon i'm using a canon d and my friend's using his nikon d i've said it for ages but only today when comparing similar photographs have i concluded that the nikon shoots far better photos regardless of megapixels but instead with the colour i've checked that our iso speeds are the same etc but all my photos seem colourless and dull whereby his look as if they've already had a run though photoshop does anyone have any information for me or anything that you think i have missed also to add that we are both using polarizers on our shots so filters are not the case thanks wil you couldn't have put it any better your eyes like the results of the nikon d better but i can imagine that you'll find other photographers that like the canon's images more i've said it before the choice of a camera should be a personal one i shoot nikon and so does one of my brothers other members of the family shoot sony pentax canon we get into some pretty heavy dslr debates at family gatherings but we're all happy with our choices because they fit us individually all the camera makers are 'tweeking' their cameras for the desired customers for example nikon got complaints that the d d s required too much post processing for beginners so when they released the d it had brighter images with 'better' color straight out of the camera fuji put their own sensor chip into the nikon d body for their s series and got rave reviews about color accuracy for portraits i'm sure the canon line had done the same through all the different generations and models photoshop and other programs are the great equalizer but true beauty of images is truly in the eyes of the beholder Digital single-lens reflex cameras Nikon Corporation Leica Digital camera Photography Konica Minolta Canon EOS Nikon D70 Camera Single-lens reflex camera Nikon FE2 Binoculars View camera Nikon FE Pixel Raw image format Stereoscopy Color Nikon FA Secure Digital card PNG Cinematography Film speed Charge-coupled device Digital camera back Canon T90 Adobe Photoshop Canon EOS-300D Image scanner CPU cache Super Nintendo Entertainment System RGB color model Advanced Photo System Traffic light Traditional animation Photographic lens Pentax JPEG Canon Inc.
