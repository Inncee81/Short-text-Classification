good camera im looking for a camera thats like good for taking pictures of people i already have a kodak easy share z which is great for taking pictures of landscapes and stuff but when i take pictures of myself or friends the camera always like messes up the colour its weird because when you look at the screen before you take the pic everything looks fine but after it makes all the colour different and it just doesnt take very good pictures of people so anyways does anyone know of a good camera that doesnt cost too much that would be good for taking pics of people thanks according to steves digicams com your kodak z takes wonderful pictures including in the portrait mode you should be reminded that even though the picture in the lcd screen may be off colored due to artificial lighting the final printout is what determines the actual color output so don't conclude prematurely that the camera is not properly taking what you see in the lcd it's not a true view you should go and have those portraits processed into prints so you can see for yourself how wonderful the z captures difficult lighting portraits good luck Digital camera Digital photography Stereoscopy Color Liquid crystal display Photographic film Camera Pixel Traditional animation Gamut Oscilloscope Movie projector Technicolor Organic light-emitting diode Film Panoramic photography Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Digital single-lens reflex cameras Single-lens reflex camera Game Boy Television Anamorphic widescreen View camera Camcorder Digital cinema Opportunity rover Widescreen Super 8 mm film Eastman Kodak Drawing CMYK color model Surveillance Cinematography Instant camera Leica Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Plasma display Computer animation TFT LCD Canon T90 Henri Cartier-Bresson Screenplay Handheld game console Cinerama Tungsten Handheld Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid (album) Screenshot Anaglyph image Movie camera Computer display Liquid crystal display television Sharp Zaurus Transparency (photography) IMac Canon EOS Care Bears System/36 Spirit rover timeline for 2005 March Computer printer Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Digital cinematography Photograph Color temperature Hello world program Plasma (physics) RGB color model Closed-circuit television Sega Saturn 3-D film The Ashlee Simpson Show Enterprise content management Dot matrix printer Traffic light Laserdisc Road-rule enforcement camera Parallax Digital camera back Autostereogram Requirements analysis Charge-coupled device Nintendo DS Social rule Color management Rise of Nations High-definition television PostScript Film speed The Amazing Race Typewriter Contax Polarization IMAX Film stock Light-emitting diode Game Boy Camera Late Night with Conan O'Brien
