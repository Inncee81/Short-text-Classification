the digital camera flash issue i have a problem with my sony digital camera the flash does not work so all of my pics are dark help the most obvious thought i have for you is to check your settings it's far too easy to turn the flash off in which case it won't fire for you you should have a flash button on the camera and as you press it repeatedly it cycles through flash flash with red eye protection and flash off you likely also have a menu item that turns off the flash so if the button doesn't do it check your menu if neither of those works for you i'm afraid you're into a repair bill sorry i hope that helps good luck Mouse (computing) Screenshot Danger Hiptop IPod Poker jargon Tungsten Handheld Embedded system PlayStation Portable Canon EOS Floppy disk Resident Evil 2 GunZ The Duel Road-rule enforcement camera Oscilloscope Photography Bubble Bobble Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Sony Macromedia Flash Windows XP Gradius Nintendo DS DVD Platform game Nintendo Entertainment System The Price Is Right Universal Serial Bus Prank flash The Amazing Race Canon T90 Resident Evil (video game) HTML element EXpanded MultiPlayer Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories Nintendo 64 Team Fortress Classic Bicycle lighting Traffic light Walkman Chrono Trigger Digital Modchip Xbox 360 Digital camera Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Starsiege: Tribes Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Combine (Half-Life 2) DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution 6thMIX Web design Stereoscopy Digital photography Ecco the Dolphin Copy protection Flash memory Super Metroid Phoebe Halliwell Spirit rover Leica Burglar alarm Mega Man (NES) Cheating in Counter-Strike Secure Digital card Bluetooth Movie projector Camcorder Beatmania IIDX Camera Adobe Photoshop Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, manga or movie only characters Dance Dance Revolution PIC microcontroller Red-eye effect Wild ARMs 2 Memory card Dungeons & Dragons: Shadow over Mystara System/36 Surveillance Wipeout (game) Dragon Booster Captain Marvel (DC Comics) SOCOM II: U.S. Navy SEALs Legal research Memory Stick 2000 Australian Grand Prix Konami Code Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Final Fantasy (video game) CompactFlash Sun Apple Newton Color temperature Game controller Charmed Compact disc Mobile phone Peugeot
