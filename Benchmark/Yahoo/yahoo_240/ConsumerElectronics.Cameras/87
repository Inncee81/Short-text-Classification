what camera should i buy i am trying to get into photography as a second job what type of digital camera would be the cheapest but good for me to start out with to take outside and inside pictures with first of all if you are looking to do photography as a second job i would not consider any type of camera other than a dslr this is the type of camera that you will see all professionals use if you are serious about doing this as a second job you may want to consider paying a little more for the camera if you just buy a point and shoot camera because its price is better then you may find the need to upgrade to a dslr anyway at that point you will have wasted enough on the point and shoot that it will make it harder to spend more for a dslr generally dslrs are not considered cheap one of the less expensive cameras but excellent in quality is the nikon d you should be able to find it for about with a lens i have a friend who has one of these and i really like the camera it takes great photos i personally selected the sony dslr a instead of the nikon d because of a few reasons this camera usually can be found for about with a lens although i got a good sale price of about with lenses first the camera had a bigger sensor so the images would be larger second the camera has a built in anti shake feature which works great since it is in the camera body the lenses i buy don't need this technology which saves a lot of money i traditionally use a higher zoom lens and don't feel like taking a tripod along for stability i have taken hand held photos with a mm lens with no image blur thanks to this technology i could never do this with my old slr third the camera has some built in dust removal technology the last thing i wanted to do was spend hundreds of dollars on a camera and have to deal with dust issues on the sensor all the time fourth the kit lens it provides covers a higher zoom range than the nikon so i wouldn't need to switch lenses to a telephoto lens as often you would really do yourself a good service by reading a review about your potential candidate cameras or a comparitive review of multiple cameras from a reputable website like www dpreview com when spending this much money on something you really should be comfortable with what it does well what it doesn't do so well and how that compares with what you need it to do this is how i made my decision good luck Nikon Corporation Digital camera Single-lens reflex camera View camera Photography Leica Cinematography Binoculars Macro photography Camera Camcorder Canon EOS Nikon D70 Digital camera back Canon EOS-300D Rangefinder camera Contax Panoramic photography Hard disk Anamorphic widescreen Amateur astronomy Floppy disk Secure Digital card Stereoscopy Advanced Photo System Point and shoot camera Street photography Four Thirds System PlayStation 2 Shutter speed Zoom lens Nikon FE2 Nikon FM2 Zeiss Schneider Kreuznach Panavision Full frame digital SLR Digital cinema Eye Bluetooth Galactic Civilizations Movie projector Paintball Surveillance Motion capture Mouse (computing) IBM PC compatible Computer Depth of field Closed-circuit television Charge-coupled device Canon FD 8 mm video format Supply and demand Eyepiece Digital cinematography Photojournalism Henri Cartier-Bresson Canon EOS-20D DVD High-definition television The Apprentice 2 Film Steadicam Nikon FE Gross domestic product Oasis (band) Raw image format FairTax Windows Vista Microeconomics Electronic journalism Laserdisc Gamut Outsourcing Naval mine PlayStation 3 Apollo 8 Poker jargon Lens (optics) IMAX Road-rule enforcement camera Strategic management Professional video camera The Amazing Race Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Nuclear power Thermographic camera
