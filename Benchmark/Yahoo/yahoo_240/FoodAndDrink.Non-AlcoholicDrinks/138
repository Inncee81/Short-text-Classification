bellyache after silk soy milk i seem to get a stomach ache a bit after drinking silk soy chai latte i am lactose intolerent so i have to use a subsitute i drink rice milk unfortunately not many coffee shops do rice so i had a little bit of silk soy chai latte and now my belly aches a bit i use to drink soy but stopped because it gave me belly aches i ate soy chocolate ice cream yesterday and was fine so can anyone give me some advice or feedback thanks it sounds like you're allergic to soy but if you ate soy based ice cream without any problem then i would assume that isn't the problem check the amount of soy in the ice cream and also the amount in the latte if it is a big chain coffee shop they will probably have this nutritional information listed on their website and maybe even on a pamphlet in the store if the latte has a very large amount of soy and the ice cream only has a small amount maybe you're allergic after all other than an allergy i really can't think of what the problem was maybe you're allergic to something else in the latte the spices in the chai for example Soy milk Milk Ice cream Tofu Food Breakfast Cheese Lactose intolerance Veganism Chocolate Cat Meat analogue Cuisine of Singapore Soybean Japanese cuisine Soft drink Breastfeeding Dairy Food allergy Kit Kat German cuisine Coeliac disease Allergy Cha chaan teng McDonald's Yoghurt Espresso Crohn's disease Vegetarianism Wine Chai Drink Cuisine of Malaysia Cappuccino Fecal incontinence Natt__ Stomach cancer Cuisine of Laos Twix Diarrhea Spider Soy protein Oreo Mango Milkshake Heath bar Starbucks Fancy rat Cold Stone Creamery Ramen Dairy product Sauce Insomnia Protein Korean cuisine Russian cuisine Irritable bowel syndrome Cuisine of Denmark Taiwanese cuisine Vernor's Questionable Content Bubble tea Healthy eating 7-Eleven Lactobacillus acidophilus Cantonese cuisine Gelato Hamster Soy sauce Cream (food) French cuisine Peruvian cuisine Peanut Botany Atkins Nutritional Approach Alcoholics Anonymous Cuisine of Vietnam Cuisine of Austria Soup Singlish Cake Guinea pig Adjustable gastric band Nutrition Customs and etiquette of Japan New Zealand English Insulin Mochi Rice pudding Frappuccino Bengali cuisine Taboo food and drink Charles Darwin's illness Urinary incontinence Sento Omega-3 fatty acid
