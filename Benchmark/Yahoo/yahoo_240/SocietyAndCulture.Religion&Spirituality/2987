hey christians orignal sin u believe that every child is born in sin apparently orignal sin now how does this sin transfer to the newly born innocent souls secondly apparently jesus died for all yr sins so all u christians r sinnless no matter wat u do on earth so its really confusing are'nt these beliefs of yr contradicting each other ie r u like born with sins or r u sinless not all christians believe in the concept of original sin actually this belief didn't surface in christian theology until hundreds of years after jesus' resurrection many christians such as myself believe we are born with a sinful nature but not with sin somehow residing within us this sinful nature is really an inborn tendency to rebel against god's commandments to put this doctrine into another frame of reference christians believe jesus is god in the flesh he was both son of god and son of man since he was born and lived as a human being then he would have also had sin within him if the concept of original sin is correct however this would conflict with the clear biblical teaching that jesus was never defiled by sin christianity does not teach that we are sinless it teaches that we have been forgiven for all sins past present and future due to jesus' sacrifice we are still sinners but we no longer live in bondage to sin and we no longer face judgement because of our sins Sin Original sin Salvation Christianity Immaculate Conception Justification (theology) Theodicy Hell Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Resurrection of Jesus Predestination Divine grace Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Sola fide Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Mary, the mother of Jesus A Course In Miracles Trinity Baptism Lutheranism Purgatory Christian eschatology Soul Abrahamic religion Theosis Creationism Pharisees Ten Commandments Jesus God Justin Martyr Binitarianism Heaven Religion Roman Catholic Church Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Church of Christ Charles Grandison Finney New Testament Seventh-day Adventist Church Bible and reincarnation Homosexuality and Christianity Angel Merit Summa Theologiae Origen Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Jewish eschatology Sacrifice Repentance Eastern Orthodox Church Christian Blessed Virgin Mary Prophet Prevenient grace Eucharist Christian apologetics Religious pluralism Evangelicalism Immortality Catholicism Urantia Jewish principles of faith Paul of Tarsus Church of Christ, Scientist Sabbath Baptist Religious perspectives on Jesus Genesis End times Christian views of Jesus Martin Luther Perseverance of the saints Tertullian John Howard Yoder Ethics in the Bible Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Dispensationalism Total depravity Reinhold Niebuhr Gospel of Thomas Jehovah's Witnesses Mortification of the flesh Anselm of Canterbury Evolutionary creationism Harrowing of Hell Satan Theology John Shelby Spong Qiyamah
