we do karmas and get as per our own karmas then why do we expect from the god that he should help us why when we are in problem we remember the god if our problem is not solved then we start saying that there is no god if there is a god then why terriosts rape murders are going on if we do good deeds we are sure that we will get good alone then we won't pray specially to god because we are sure that we have done good deeds but if otherwise we know that we have done something against the divine law we are certain that we'll be punished so we cry to god for help for we know that at that point of time only he can help us as far as an ignorant is concerned he'll be saying that there is no god if his problem is not solved but a true spiritual person will convince himself that everything is happening for his good alone and he will take it as god's test alone talking about the problems like murders rape etc consider that good and bad are two sides of the same coin how could we be able to fully understand the serenity of goodness if there is no 'badness' if we are gifted with only happiness and comforts in this kaliage are we going to remember god no way so the purpose of all happenings is to make us think of god Karma Theodicy Karma in Hinduism Theory of conduct Free will Reincarnation Immortality Sin Summa Theologiae Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Soul Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism A Course In Miracles Heaven Goodness and value theory Utilitarianism Social justice John Howard Yoder Sant Thakar Singh Moral objectivism Supernatural Justification (theology) Bhagavad Gita Charles Darwin's views on religion Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Merit Sikhism primary beliefs and principles Determinism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Smartism Simone Weil Jewish principles of faith Christian eschatology The nature of God in Western theology Meaning of life Vernon Schillinger Scientology beliefs and practices Ethics in religion Messiah Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Predestination Nicomachean Ethics Scenes from a Memory Ten Commandments Satan Aristotle Socrates Original sin Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Sermon on the Mount Virgin Mary in Islam Consciousness Holy Spirit Leviathan (book) Maimonides Religion Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Romulus and Remus Purgatory Atheism Eastern philosophy Salvation Sri Aurobindo Abortion debate Pharisees Divine grace Human nature Philo Karma Yoga Jainism Roman Catholic Church Origin belief Rape God Evil Miracle Eastern Orthodox Church Opus Dei Sant Baljit Singh Israel ben Eliezer Book of Mormon Suma Ching Hai Buddhism Trinity Left-Hand Path and Right-Hand Path Zoroastrianism Hell Biblical inerrancy Agnosticism Philosophical skepticism John Wycliffe New Age Judaism The Inside God Emperor of Dune Alcoholics Anonymous Mahabharata Ethics
