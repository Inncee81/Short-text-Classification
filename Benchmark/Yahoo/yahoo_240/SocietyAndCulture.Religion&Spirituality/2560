if there is a such a thing as a 'soul' then it must be merely an observer correct let me elaborate if you take a couple of drinks or smoke some pot you become intoxicated it is easy to understand how the chemicals in alcohol and cannabis can affect the ticking of your nerve cells but how can physical reactions in your brain cause the psychological or spiritual you to get high if your soul controls your body how does it do so when you drive a car you sit in the driver's seat you push on the pedals with your feet and you turn the wheel with your hands if you consider your body to be a biological machine driven by your soul where does the driver sit and how does your purely spiritual soul pull the biological strings that make your neurones fire and your muscles move what say you a soul interacting with the body would require constant violations of the principle of conservation of energy since it would have to move molecules around to make neurons fire even an observing soul would have to have some way to detect neurotransmitters or open closed ion channel conformations and it would have to process trillions of these every second this of course would require a tremendous amount of computing power so even an observer soul would require its own mind without its own soul positing a soul even just as an observer does not explain consciousness at all it simply pushes the problem back and makes it even more complicated Action potential Dualism (philosophy of mind) Enzyme Membrane potential Synapse Brain Electrophysiology Eye Signal transduction Soul Emergence Health issues and the effects of cannabis Spacecraft propulsion Neuron Energy development Cognitive science Psychosis Neuroscience Quantum mind Clinical depression Cerebellum Drag racing Cancer Cannabis (drug) Addiction Artificial consciousness Neurotransmitter Carbon dioxide Protein Biochemistry Water (molecule) Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor Chemistry Stroke Cocaine Homeostasis Consciousness Methamphetamine Ionizing radiation Brain-computer interface Human brain Mass spectrometry Insulin Immortality Muscle Hypoglycemia Computer vision Cold fusion Long-term potentiation Quantum mechanics W.
