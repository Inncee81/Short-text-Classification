why do christian say the trinity is still monotheistic i get the idea that christians believe there are three persons in the one god but how is that any different from polytheism except for the words in the gospels jesus says he will send my spirit he talks to the father and thefather also talks to him they don't relate to each other as though they were the same being hindus believe in many gods yet they also believe they all boil down to one god namely brahman but i am confidant no christian would call hindus monotheistic they even have a trinity of their own brahma vishnu and shiva that they say all are really brahman but again no christian would call that monotheistic now please don't tell me it's a mystery because i am not asking anybody to explain the trinity i'm asking about word choice why christians call the trinity monotheism instead of polytheism when they call hindus polytheistic when they have similar beliefs read carefully most of you are doing precisely what i asked you not to do i am not asking for an explanation of the trinity i am asking why christians call their trinity monotheistic but the hindus' polytheistic when both groups say it all amounts to one god most of you are answering a question i did not ask the doctrine of the trinity has caused a lot of trouble for christians since the beginning it is mentioned nowhere in the bible it was adopted as an official belief of the early church at the council of nicea they wanted to give jesus divine status but did not want to be considered polytheists so they came up with this one god three persons doctrine i suppose it made sense at the time and christians have tied themselves in knots trying to explain it ever since several christian sects jehovah's witnesses mormons unitarians reject the doctrine for exactly the reason you state it is against monotheism it is also a reason why muslims completely reject christianity for them jesus is a prophet of god not an aspect of god Christianity Religious pluralism Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Religion Hindu deities Polytheism Predestination God the Father Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Fundamentalism Great Apostasy Religious perspectives on Jesus Prophet The nature of God in Western theology Judaism Philosophy of religion Mormonism Holy Spirit Jesus Brahman Vishnu Prayer Neopaganism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Mormonism and Christianity Religious conversion Restorationism Arianism Moses Supernatural Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Ishta-deva Christian views of Jesus Pantheism Angel New Testament Theology Deity Ten Commandments Millerites Smartism Book of Mormon Salvation Advaita Vedanta Brahmanism Origin belief Biblical canon Goddess Atheism Saint Miracle Godhead (Mormonism) Kabbalah Avatar Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Hell Jewish principles of faith Theodicy Existence of God Soul Christian Charles Grandison Finney Devil Christian eschatology Elohim Bible and reincarnation Mary, the mother of Jesus Coptic Christianity Heresy Christian denomination God and gender Messianic Judaism Unitarianism Catechism Paul of Tarsus Filioque clause Zoroastrianism Michael Servetus Eastern Orthodox Church Mormonism and Judaism Evangelicalism Chosen people Abraham Apocalypse Nicene Creed
