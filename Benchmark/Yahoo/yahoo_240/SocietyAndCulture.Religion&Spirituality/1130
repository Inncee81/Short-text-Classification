do many christians feel that the passion of the christ was too vicious and was there just to inflict fear i saw it at school and well i'm sorry to say that the passion of the christ was just too gory and it didn't reveal the true depiction of the story i can't help but find it a bore and that i admit several parts of the depiction of christ were good in terms of cinematic effect but it lacked efficiency in dialogue through which the protagonist just ended up being tortured repeatedly also since i am not a christian i feel that some questions need to be answered did christ himself want to be killed in the end since as the son of god god could have saved him was he just sent to procreate christianity which would be at the epicentre of every christian in the future or was he sent there as an example to inflict fear in people to follow him god if they didn't was it to emotionally entrap people so that internally they would feel sorrow and remember him was it emotional abuse and could it be said that christ i'm sorry to offend could have been a bit insane i am not a christian and so i can have an opinion i didn't chose to be born a non christian and will never be a christian without christ i'd be a hater like you what is that supposed to mean i never exclaimed hate that is what christians seem to do i ask a controversial question and you say i hate god being blind sighted you just don't get it so if i were you ans thank god i'm not i would lay off of the you hate god speech fear is religion's greatest tool remember god is nothing more than a nonsense word made up by man to explain away the things we can't yet understand A Course In Miracles Eastern Orthodox Church Religion Predestination Sola fide John Howard Yoder Church of Christ, Scientist Trinity Mary, the mother of Jesus Resurrection of Jesus Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Soul God Mortification of the flesh Socrates Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Leviathan (book) Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Opus Dei The nature of God in Western theology Ten Commandments Fundamentalism Goldstein's book Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Merit Hell Genesis Summa Theologiae S__ren Kierkegaard End times Intelligent design Cult Daredevil Gospel of Thomas Church of Christ Michel Henry Roman Catholic Church The Amber Spyglass Christianity and anti-Semitism Religious pluralism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Evil Salvation Jesus God Emperor of Dune Nation of Islam Theory of conduct Angel Blood atonement Satan Philipp Melanchthon Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Free will Catechism Divine grace Creationism Aristotle The Passion of the Christ The Pilgrim's Progress Perseverance of the saints Idolatry Book of Isaiah Zoophilia Book of Mormon Original sin Anti-Mormonism Theodicy Existence of God The Death Gate Cycle Origin belief Prophet South Park Homosexuality and Christianity Agnosticism David Hume Sacrifice Sexual orientation Sabbath Ascetical theology Simone Weil Theology Dionysus Darth Vader Revelation John the Baptist EastEnders God the Father Apologetics Saint Secret Gospel of Mark Charles Grandison Finney Chosen people
