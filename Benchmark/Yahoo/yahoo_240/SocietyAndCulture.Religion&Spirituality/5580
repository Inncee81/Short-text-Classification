do you want to know the truth about suicide bombers shaikh ibn uthaimeen the suicide bomber is not a martyr and is in hellfire http groups yahoo com group welcome islam message author shaikh ibn uthaimeen source riyaadh us saaliheen trans dawud burbank article id mnj the words of shaikh ibn uthaymeen concerning suicide bombings shaikh ibn uthaymeen may allaah have mercy upon him said in his explanation of riyaadus saaliheen whilst giving some points of benefit from the hadeeth of suhayb may allaah be pleased with him that allaah s messenger sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam said there used to be a king amongst those who came before you and he had a sorcerer so when he grew old he said to the king i have become old so send a boy to me so that i can teach him sorcery the hadeeth riyaadhus saaliheen no fourthly that it is permissible for a person to expose himself to danger for a matter of general benefit to the muslims because the boy indicated to the king the way in which he would be able to kill him and which would lead to his demise which was that he should take an arrow from his quiver etc shaikhul islaam ibn taymiyyah said because this was a jihaad in allaah s cause which caused a whole nation to truly believe and he did not really lose anything since although he died he would have to die anyway sooner or later but as for what some people do regarding activities of suicide tying explosives to themselves and then approaching unbelievers and detonating them amongst them then this is a case of suicide and allaah s refuge is sought so whoever commits suicide then he will be consigned eternally to hell fire remaining there forever as occurs in the hadeeth of the prophet sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam i e his sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam saying and whoever kills himself with an iron weapon then the iron weapon will remain in his hand and he will continuously stab himself in his belly with it in the fire of hell eternally forever and ever reported by al bukhaaree no and muslim no in the book of eemaan because this person has killed himself and has not benefited islaam so if he kills himself along with ten or a hundred or two hundred other people then islaam will not benefit by that since the people will not accept islaam contrary to the story of the boy rather it will probably just make the enemy more determined and this action will provoke malice and bitterness in his heart to such an extent that he may seek to wreak havoc upon the muslims this is what is found from the practice of the jews with the people of palestine so when one of the palestinian blows himself up and kills six or seven people then in retaliation they take sixty or more so this does not produce any benefit for the muslims and does not benefit those amongst whose ranks explosives are detonated so what we hold is that those people who perform these suicide bombings have wrongfully committed suicide and that this necessitates entry into hell fire and allaah s refuge is sought and that this person is not a martyr shaheed however if a person has done this based upon misinterpretation thinking that it is permissible then we hope that he will be saved from sin but as for martyrdom being written for him then no since he has not taken the path of martyrdom but whoever performs ijtihaad and errs will receive a single reward if he is a person qualified to make ijtihaad end of the shaikh's words in islam killing and suicide are major sins terrorists will not be rewarded for their evil actions thankyou for posting that link Islam Similarities between the
