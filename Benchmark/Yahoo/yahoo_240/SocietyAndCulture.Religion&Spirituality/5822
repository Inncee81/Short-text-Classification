do christian families have to be patriarchal i listen to a lot of christian radio and i am a non believer and the model of the family they present seems a bit old fashioned to me the father should be the leader of the family the wife should obey her husband is it necessary to believe this to be christian can a christian household be run as an equal partnership where both lead can christian wives work outside the home or must you be barefoot and pregnant to be a true christian this question is for christians what are some stereotypes and misimpressions that people have about your religion do you feel that members of your religion contribute to these negative stereotypes in any way sincere answers only no christian bashing i am trying to get past my own negative stereotypes and prejudices and i will be asking a series of questions like this some of them may sound silly these are sincere questions not intended to offend but to help me get past my own stumbling blocks i'm not looking to convert just to understand what if you don't accept those roles can you still be christian could a christian family be matriarchal or an equal partnership between husband and wife i want to hear from christian women on this in the family that i was raised in it was an equal partnership even though most fundamentalists say this many of them don't have this type of marriage is either equality or the woman has bit more control in the decisions i don't think that you should use religion to justify sexism Marriage Fundamentalism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Religion Christianity Christian-Jewish reconciliation Feminism Infantilism Same-sex marriage Criticism of Mormonism Religion and sexual orientation Homosexuality and Christianity Judaism Religious Society of Friends Gender role Sexual orientation Cult Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Religion and sexuality EastEnders Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Homophobia Discrimination Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Same-sex marriage in Canada Atheism Roman Catholic Church Rich Mullins Sola fide Supernatural Feminist movement Eastern Orthodox Church Unification Church Status of religious freedom in Malaysia Gender-neutral language Economic inequality Blue Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Ordination of women The nature of God in Western theology Homosexuality Paternalism Christian views of women Evangelicalism Sharia Family Infant baptism Patriotism Iglesia ni Cristo Little Britain Simone Weil Societal attitudes towards homosexuality Urantia Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Resurrection of Jesus Civil rights Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Religious views of suicide Social rule Jewish principles of faith Ethics Christian Abrahamic religion Fathers' rights Abraham Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Blacks and Mormonism Baptist Past teachings of Prem Rawat Ten Commandments History of the Latter Day Saint movement Origin belief Religious pluralism Clergy Jewish humour Separation of church and state Jewish views of religious pluralism Christianity and anti-Semitism Charles Grandison Finney Role of women in Judaism Laura Schlessinger Children of God Bible and reincarnation Mary, the mother of Jesus Guiding Light Abortion debate Ontological argument Confucianism Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Muhammad Sant Mat Intelligent design movement Justification (theology) Speciesism Sin Nation of Islam
