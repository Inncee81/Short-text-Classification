if god cannot die then how can jesus be god bethybug it is truly amazing what people have been taught and what they believe he then transcended it and raised himself from the dead i think it's a beautiful belief a partial quote from one of the answers to this question christ the only begotten son of god was dead totally dead christ did not nor could he have raised himself from the grave because he was dead it was the father that raised christ from the grave give the one true god the glory for what he did give the praise to whom it belongs romans therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness of life the preachers today will have much to answer for in the judgement christ is not god he has the name of god yes for he is the son of god and the father gave his son a very special name god the one true god cannot die for he is immortal and cannot die his son however is not god and he did in fact die and was slain from the foundations of the earth and his father raised him from the dead if christ did not totally die on the cross then you have only a mere man and a mere man died for our sins in order to save us there is no man that is good enough to save even himself by his death it would be only a human sacrifice and nothing else the god that i love and serve allowed his only begotten son to die to be separated from his father to die a most horrible death to be nailed to a tree and to die an agonizing death to save any human that would believe on the son of god that they might be saved the father watched the things that where done to his divine son god allowed his son to go through what he went through and to die because he loves us and he made a way for our escape from the snares of satan that we might also have everlasting life the price for my salvation the cost for my sinning against the law of god was the son of god dying the death that i should have died the price was so high that only the death of his only begotten son could ever cover the debt that is owed for transgressing the law of god another god dying for my sins could never have covered the debt because another god would not have been all that special another god would not have been as dear to the almighty god as the almighty god s own son the almighty s son could have only covered the price of the debt and nothing else could satisfied the debt so that there could be no question to the debt that is owed has been paid in full and that the almighty god truly loves his creation there is more that can be said peace and grace david feel free to contact me if you wish to learn more sampson yahoo com Eastern Orthodox Church Trinity Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Merit Divine grace Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Original sin Ten Commandments Mormonism Apostles' Creed Athanasian Creed Baptism Charles Grandison Finney Church of Christ Christian eschatology Roman Catholic Church John Howard Yoder A Course In Miracles Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Religious perspectives on Jesus Articles of Religion (Methodist) Resurrection of Jesus Holy Spirit Soul Summa Theologiae Mormonism and Christianity Dispensationalism Heaven Christian views of Jesus Book of Isaiah Christianity Catechism Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Jesus Binitarianism Jehovah's Witnesses John Wesley Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism John the Baptist Mary, the mother of Jesus Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Purgatory Theosis John Wycliffe God the Father Book of Mormon Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Abrahamic religion Paradise Lost Infant baptism Urantia Gospel of Barnabas Predestination Indulgence Nontrinitarianism Perseverance of the saints Adam-God theory Prevenient grace Martin Luther Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Eucharist Incarnations of Immortality Augustine of Hippo Mass (liturgy) Catholicism Hell Limited atonement Nicene Creed Church of Christ, Scientist Alan Campbell (pastor) Sacrifice Mortification of the flesh Qiyamah Origin belief Opus Dei Socrates Gospel of Thomas Immortality Satan Christian anarchism The Amber Spyglass Prayer in Christianity Pharisees Predestination (Calvinism) Jewish eschatology Endowment (Mormonism) Religious pluralism Priesthood (Mormonism) Temple (Mormonism)
