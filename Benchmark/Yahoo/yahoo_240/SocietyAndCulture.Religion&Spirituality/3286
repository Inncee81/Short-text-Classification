serious question for people who do not believe in god do you believe or have knowledge of the historical factual events and people that the bible speaks of do you understand the realism of the books of the bible and if you do why is it that you can't believe in jesus this is not meant to be rude i truley want to understand your basis of why you don not think that god exists spiritwanderer actually gave me an amswer that makes sense even though i believe in the bible and jesus he made an honest attempt it's funny how general all of the answers are slaves where part of the family treated well and loved but of course you would not know that because you have never been educated by a christian leader that knows true history all is well with me you have all just made me believe even more thanks mission acomplished ok i understand the historical references to the bible but a lot of books have historical references like this i can write a book throw in a god bring about a young martyr hero followed by a band of a ragtag group of fighters and then write it with a bunch of historical references like i can write it during the middle ages and have historical references not trying to mock but i could do that and pass it on as fact could i not also the reason why i don't believe in god is not because of the bible it's much more personal than that as for why i don't believe in jesus i'm sure that there was a guy named jesus and that he was a good man and he died on a cross and he was martyred for our sins at least that was what he believed he was doing now if he was the son of god i don't know i also don't really care i doubt the bible because of the translation processes and because that it is years old and there was bound to be things lost and destroyed look at the dead sea scrolls you know hope this answered your question Resurrection of Jesus Biblical inerrancy Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Creationism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Predestination Eastern Orthodox Church Religion Book of Isaiah Sabbath Jesus Trinity God Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Biblical canon Angel Bible Nation of Islam Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Christianity Sola fide Christian eschatology Nontrinitarianism A Course In Miracles Salvation Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Homosexuality and Christianity Summa Theologiae Sin Christian views of Jesus Historicity of Jesus The Pilgrim's Progress Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Gospel of John Book of Daniel John Wycliffe Miracle Book of Revelation Baptism Ten Commandments Chosen people Acts of the Apostles Fundamentalism Young Earth creationism Mary, the mother of Jesus Book of Mormon Origen Paul of Tarsus Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Religious Society of Friends Holy Spirit Moses Charles Grandison Finney Saint Idolatry in Christianity Linguistics and the Book of Mormon Bible and reincarnation Church of Christ, Scientist Theodicy Free will End times Liberal Christianity Merit Genesis Alan Campbell (pastor) Abraham Immortality John Howard Yoder Historical Jesus Maimonides Creation according to Genesis Presuppositional apologetics Theory of conduct Philosophical skepticism Secret Gospel of Mark Original sin Rastafari movement Satan Opus Dei Apocrypha Eucharist Day-Age Creationism The nature of God in Western theology Reinhold Niebuhr Apologetics John the Baptist
