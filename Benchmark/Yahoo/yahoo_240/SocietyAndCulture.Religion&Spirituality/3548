how come christians why are the christians are allowed to ask stupid questions about other religions here and most of us don't report them but when someone asks a silly question some of them jump on a little bandwagon and report the one who asked the question if you don't like it hit the back button on the browser and move along to another question my basket is ready for the answers for one thing i only call it how i see it i try not to make assumptions and if i do then it is because i have some evidence i did not say all christians do this so if you think i did i am sorry but it really seems like if i were to make fun of christianity in harmless question then i would get reported but if someone made baseless accusations or make fun of pagans very few would report them once again i am only calling how i see it sorry well you know it all comes down to our own personal ethics and how much unkind and uncharitable behavior we will allow ourselves to engage in how small of a person we will let ourselves be and that's all i will say Sexual orientation Religion Atheism Theodicy Ethics Science The nature of God in Western theology Apologetics Trinity Joke Resurrection of Jesus Whose Line Is It Anyway?
