do you have any religious guilt or any other guilt for that matter or regrets i feel guilty for leaving the roman catholic church not because of the belief system necessarily but becaue i spent the first years of my life in the rcc and i studied catholicism for years i suppose i feel guilty for spending so much time for nothing and for leaving my friends in the church but i am still a christian i joined a non denom church instead the church of christ me now is much like catholicism so that relieves my guilt of beliefs but i want to hear your guilts or regrets oh when i say i left my friends they think that i made a huge mistake that is unforgiveable i mean we still speak and we still hang out but our relationships are not as strong as they used to be the rcc church i went to was in my city but now my non denom church is in a small town like minutes away the friends from the rcc are my school friends as well and i see them everyday unlike the other friends out of my friends from the rcc so far of them still love me and appreciate my choices the other think i am a disgrace to the holy catholic church i feel the same way you do i have guilt for leaving the catholic religion and becoming a follower of a christ in a christian church however the guilt is less and less apparent as i follow the bible more god wants us to follow his word believe and accept him and he wants us to do it where we are most comfortable i have no regrets over my faith and chosing a diffrent path yet i do still have guilt every once in a while like taking the communion with out confessing my sins to a preist even though the bible doesnt say you must directly do that Christianity Church of Christ Sin Roman Catholic Church Catholicism Baptist Religion Salvation Eucharist A Course In Miracles Eastern Orthodox Church Confession Holy Spirit Trinity Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Homosexuality and Christianity Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Justification (theology) Religious conversion Christian denomination Religious Society of Friends Abrahamic religion Sabbath Protestantism Lutheranism Ten Commandments Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Anglicanism Church of Christ, Scientist Calvinism Sola fide New Testament Evangelicalism Mary, the mother of Jesus Mormonism and Christianity Predestination Charles Grandison Finney Religious pluralism Idolatry Guilt Separation of church and state Mass (liturgy) Theology Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Christian theological controversy Pacifism George Fox Jesus Repentance John Howard Yoder Mennonite Evolutionary creationism Martin Luther Divine grace Second Vatican Council Messianic Judaism Catholic Christian apologetics Nontrinitarianism God Biblical canon History of Christianity Merit Catholic sacraments The Pilgrim's Progress Hell Prophet Paul of Tarsus Perseverance of the saints Bishop Articles of Religion (Methodist) S__ren Kierkegaard Heresy Christ Clergy Mortification of the flesh History of the English Bible Coptic Christianity Heaven Fundamentalism Religious perspectives on Jesus Saint Christian Christian anarchism Restorationism Legalism (theology) Witchcraft
