churches selling thing do you agree i feel like god has already told me that this is wrong but i want to know if anyone els has felt the same conviction alot of churches these days are a church and a restuarant in one like just before church or just after church they'll sell you a tray of food or a cup of coffee i find it unchristian for two reasons jesus drove the money changers out of the temple and second jesus always fed people for free i think pot lucks are alot more christian way to feed people at church but of course alot of churches sell dinners claiming they need the money for missionaries early christians had manditory tithing also alot churches sell books and c d s if you have to sell me a book on salvation i'm not going to think you're real a church i use to go to now has a cash register in the church selling coffee i was asked for cents for water you know what jesus said about giving someone a cup of water it's almost as bad as churches that have scheduled smoke breaks although the 'church' does not recognize the sabbath day which is on saturday not sunday even if they did and even if that sabbath were to be on sunday they violate the sabbath by doing the things you describe see nehemiah about buying and selling on the sabbath the 'church' these days worship the god of mammon not the god of abraham isaac and jacob and since you recognize in your spirit that this is wrong what does righteousness have to do with unrighteousness leave them and find a group of messianic believers they are out there Sabbath Ten Commandments Christianity Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Church of Christ Abrahamic religion Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Fasting Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Dispensationalism Messianic Judaism Mormonism and Judaism Justification (theology) Baptism Christian eschatology Divine grace Paul of Tarsus Chosen people Alan Campbell (pastor) Bible Salvation Messiah Legalism (theology) Judaism Prophet Salvation Army Baptist Book of Mormon Eucharist Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) 613 mitzvot History of Christianity True Jesus Church Tithe Mormonism and Christianity Old Testament Genesis Shabbat John the Baptist Religion in Israel Restorationism Noahide Laws Trinity Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Temple (Mormonism) A Course In Miracles Christian Identity Jesus Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Religion Biblical canon Abraham Gospel of Thomas Pharisees Church of Christ, Scientist God Iglesia ni Cristo Saint Biblical inerrancy Amidah Cultural and historical background of Jesus Resurrection of Jesus Easter Judaizers Sabbatarianism Eastern Orthodox Church Temple in Jerusalem Criticism of Mormonism Sin Roman Catholic Church Gospel of Mark Sunday Sabbatai Zevi Urantia Infant baptism Jewish eschatology Great Apostasy Book of Isaiah Prophets of Islam Pentecostalism Religious conversion Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Evangelicalism Richard Allen (reverend) Herbert W.
