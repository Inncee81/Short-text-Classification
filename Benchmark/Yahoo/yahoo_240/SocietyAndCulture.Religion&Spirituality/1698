how would you feel with a husband who wanted more than one wife personally i'd kill my husband if he did that then again he has no reason to and i've asked him before and he says he's more than happy with the one he already has what is your impression of the following how does it make you feel does islaam promote polygamy for muslim men to have more than one wife is a permission which is given to them in the quraan provided it is not done to satisfy lust but to meet social solutions and needs this permission is given provided the person is capable of treating the wives equally it is not an injunction in the pre islaamic period men used to have many wives one person had wives and when he became muslim he asked the prophet muhammad peace and blessings of god be upon him what should i do with so many wives and he said divorce all except four the quraan says you can only marry or and up to women if you can be equally just with each of them since it is very difficult to be equally just with all wives in practice most of the muslim men do not have more than one wife prophet muhammad peace and blessings of god be upon him himself from age to was married to only one woman khadeejah may allaah be pleased with her in the western society some men who have one wife have many extra marital affairs a survey was published in u s a today april section d which asked mistresses what they would like their status to be they said that they preferred being the second wife rather than the other woman because they do not have the legal rights nor did they have the financial equality of the legally married wives and it appeared that they were being used by these men historically all the prophets except jesus who was not married had more than one wife so this is not something which islaam has started in fact islaam regulated it i said it earlier and i will say it again i asked my husband what if he wants to have another wife he said are you serious i cannot handle one and you are talking about two as they say man is successful when he makes more then his wife spends how many successful men you know but i do know this a good muslim wife rarelly spends on unneccessary thing and gaurds her husbands wealth answer to yoru question sis it provides a roof over women who are widow and orphen and it is far more rewarding to marry them over anyother in allah's eyes Marriage Polygamy Islam Women in Islam Muhammad Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sharia Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Divorce Jizya Christian view of marriage Nikah Mut'ah Status of religious freedom in Malaysia Muhammad's marriages Aisha Same-sex marriage Maria al-Qibtiyya Isa Mary, the mother of Jesus Dhimmi Bah__'u'll__h's family John the Baptist Apostasy in Islam Ten Commandments Qiyamah Muslim ibn Aqeel Zia-ul-Haq's Islamization Five Pillars of Islam Virgin Mary in Islam Prophets of Islam Islam as a political movement Homosexuality and Christianity Religious pluralism Mahatma Gandhi Salah Joseph (Hebrew Bible) Bilal ibn Ribah Nation of Islam Eastern Orthodox Church Religion Plural marriage Osama bin Laden Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Ma malakat aymanukum Dwight York Succession to Muhammad Mother Teresa Qur'an Prophet Emma Hale Smith Fundamentalism Opus Dei Polyamory Same-sex marriage in Canada Nikah Misyar Polygyny Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Eid ul-Fitr Sexual orientation Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Triple talaq Economic inequality Criticism of Islam Christianity Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Hijab Fiddler on the Roof Feminism Ali Allah Utilitarianism Civil rights Homosexuality and Islam Saint Battle of Badr Priesthood (Mormonism) Khadijah bint Khuwaylid Infantilism History of sex Alawite Kohen Family Adam and Eve Sunni Islam Birth control Sin Women as imams Caliph
