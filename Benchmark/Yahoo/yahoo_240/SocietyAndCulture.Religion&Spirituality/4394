please enlighten me on the judaism view of hell is there a lake of fire according to judaism what we believe in is euphemistically called the world to come not much is taught on it at least not in open sources it is not a world as we know itg nor are there beautiful gardens and winged angels playing harps with golden halos around their heads at the same time their is no fire and brimstone or eternal damnation and burning in the fires of hell the world to come is a spiritual realm souls try to cluster around the pure essence of god to close to the holy for the sake of being near it because souls yearn to be as close to god as possible but it is not as simple as that either the world to come is not a simplistic realm of one level in the talmud masechta chagigah it is said that the outer courtyards to god's abode has seven levels each of ascending holiness each soul wanting to be as high as possible it briefly states that beyond these levels you have the inner courtyard and abode itself but stops there with the statement beyond here we do not enquire maybe it elaborates further in the kaballah i have no idea on that hell is completely absent from judaism there is no devil in judaism as it is not possible for an angel to rebel only humans have free will angels can only perform specific tasks what is generally misinterpreted as hell is the concept of sheol or gehinnom this refers to the burning the soul feels at the heavenly trial after death essentially we are brought to the heavenly court god and judged satan literally the accusser is the prosecutor and wants to introduce all oput sins into the equation god is merciful and drops some of the sins before the trial begins rambam hilchos tteshuvah after that the soul basically watches two movies one is what your life was the other what your life could have been the soul feels shame at the lost opportunities at what it could have been vs what it is it is this shame that feels like an eternity of burning the burning is not a literal one it is the burning of shame that it feels at realising how it has transgressed when it could have been so much more think of how for us with physical bodies the shame of being shouted at by a parent teacher boss can feel like burning how much worse for a soul which is a pure being and has no physical imperfections or mental imperfections to give it excuses but though it states that this burning feels like an eternity it truth it never lasts for more than months god is much too loving to give out eternal punishments just as a loving parent would never punish a child for forever Heaven Abrahamic religion Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Original sin Soul Jewish principles of faith Sin God Angel Maimonides Jewish eschatology Kabbalah Christian eschatology Reincarnation Summa Theologiae Religion Devil Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Simone Weil Immortality Ten Commandments Justification (theology) Purgatory Death (personification) Israel ben Eliezer Urantia A Course In Miracles Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Love Christianity Guide for the Perplexed Demon Eastern Orthodox Church Merit Holy Spirit Resurrection of Jesus 613 mitzvot The Amber Spyglass Divine grace Religious pluralism Kain (Legacy of Kain) Afterlife Sola fide Paradise Lost Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Apocalyptic literature Halakha Jewish Messiah Baptism Church of Christ Mormonism and Judaism Church of Christ, Scientist Harrowing of Hell Hinduism Adam-God theory Mormonism Roman Catholic Church Korban The Divine Comedy Capital punishment Book of Mormon Aristotle Michael (archangel) Sant Thakar Singh Heresy Judaism Spiritual evolution Sacrifice Zohar Salvation Jehovah's Witnesses Origin belief Sabbath Hindu philosophy John Wesley Meaning of life Philo Indulgence Sri Aurobindo Origen Mary, the mother of Jesus Sephiroth (Final Fantasy VII) Azazel God and gender Problem of Hell Phaedo Paul of Tarsus Calvinism Advaita Vedanta Catechism Jews as a chosen people Miracle
