do christian need to believe in evolution does evolution have a place in the bible of people think that we evolved through the guidance of god but how does the evolution help us believe in the bible it doesn t evolution was a concept that was conjured up as a theory by darwin no evidence was given at that time and darwin himself had doubt that is was possible because he said that blind science could never create something like the eye so if christians are to gain their faith from the bible then i guess the bible should support evolution right wrong if evolution is possible then adam and eve did not exist be cause we all came from apes no adam and eve means there is no family tree and would lead to moses no moses would mean that either the flood didn t happen or that the bible lied about how it happened if there is no moses then there could be no abraham who is the father of all the jews no jews means there could be no jesus christ who was himself a jew now i ask you why do christians need to believe in the theory of evolution http www cbsnews com stories opinion polls main shtml evolutionist don t even have solid proof of the existence of evolution they are continually changing their theory in news this week evolution of humans from apes was proven false just think all of us were deceived in school for all those years when we could have just trusted in the bible http news yahoo com s ap ap on sc human evolution tactful justin the story of genesis is a metaphor well i guess you don't believe in jesus christ then he was a jew where did the jews come from then bula'ia aratymen thanks for the evolution update should i believe this new data or wait till it changes tom well lets see you say that science is always finding new proof that changes the idea to change an idea it to say the old idea is not the right idea that would make the old idea um wrong evolution and creation are incompatible the biblical account of creation is not a metaphor or a story it is fact the bible does use parables images etc to describe certain principles but when this is done the reader is made clear that this is so the bible teaches that 'god created the heavens and the earth' genesis 'in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god all things were made through him and without him nothing was made that was made' john the bible is the word of god and so we can trust every word of it 'the entirety of your word is truth' psalm though we cannot prove everything it says we can believe 'for we walk by faith not by sight' corinthians plus all the prophesis predictions stated in the bible have proved true the health messages promoted in the bible are exactly the ones we are being bombarded with today there is so much supporting evidence showing the bible to be just as relevant in the st century can i clarity something evolution is a theory not fact its just that people seem to be conveniently leaving off the 'theory' part this world and all the lifeforms that inhabit it are so intricately put together there is such great design that no one can convince me that we are the result of some accidental occurance this world and all that is in it was made for a purpose and by a great designer we are 'fearfully and wonderfully made' psalm Dispensationalism Christian eschatology Resurrection of Jesus Apocrypha Intelligent design movement Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Ten Commandments Origin belief Trinity Divine grace Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Moses Abrahamic religion Kabbalah Miracle Teach the Controversy Creation science Eastern Orthodox Church Atheism Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Christian apologetics God and gender New Testament Church of Christ, Scientist Creation according to Genesis Jehovah's Witnesses Rapture Flood geology Book of Isaiah Sin Angel Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Apocalyptic literature Biblical canon Original sin Christianity Charles Darwin's views on religion Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Supernatural Noah's Ark Answers in Genesis Meaning of life Hell Bible Day-Age Creationism Urantia Evolutionism Christian views of Jesus Jewish principles of faith Documentary hypothesis Wedge strategy Historicity of Jesus Predestination Religious Society of Friends Summa Theologiae Adam and Eve Modern geocentrism Apologetics Church of Christ Christian Identity Theory Justin Martyr Kuzari Bible prophecy Religious pluralism Phillip E.
