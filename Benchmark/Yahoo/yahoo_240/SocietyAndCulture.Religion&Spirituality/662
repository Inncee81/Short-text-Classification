who can pole vault greater distances true christians or those other christians the true ones since no one can identify one they must not exist and hence are mass less thus any movement at all allows them to reach escape velocity and they vanish out into space General relativity Black hole Faster-than-light Modern geocentrism Open cluster Mercury (planet) Escape velocity Astrodynamics Modified Newtonian dynamics Gravity Project Orion Electric motor Athletics Gravitational slingshot Solar wind Plasma (physics) Space elevator Aberration of light Sun Planetary orbit Force Mass driver Special relativity Coriolis effect Spacecraft propulsion Internal ballistics Cassini-Huygens Pole vault Edwin Hubble Space Shuttle program Velocity Rotating black hole Big Bang Extrasolar planet Bussard ramjet North Pole Interstellar travel Potential energy Mass Dark matter Electromagnetic field Earth Lagrangian point Neutron star Action potential Wind power Sport utility vehicle Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Sonar Tide Moon Extraterrestrial skies Glacier Space colonization Solar sail Mercury 4 Magnetic field Explosive material Anticyclone Rocket Bucket argument Atmospheric circulation Comet Planetary nebula Space fountain Terminal ballistics Semi-major axis Thelema Physical law Jet engine Warp drive Orbital speed Precession Temperature John Wycliffe Perspective projection distortion Dyson sphere Newton's laws of motion Christianity Schwarzschild coordinates Mythology Supernova Map projection History of the Jews in Poland Saturn V Magnet Dark energy Planet Cat's Eye Nebula Speed of light Lorentz group Hyperreal number Zeno's paradoxes Event horizon Perspective (graphical) Trajectory Vacuum Comoving distance
