getting baptised tomorrow a month or so ago i decided to become baptised at one of our church's informal get together parties it is tomorrow and it will be in a lake i've been brought up in a strong christian assembly of god background and i believe that god is the creator and the bible is the word of god my question is that when i signed up to be baptised i felt more connected to god than ever before and now a month or two later i feel the furthest from god that i have been in a long time i feel like i shouldn't get baptised if i feel so far from god i have prayed about this and im debating whether to get baptised tomorrow i mean i'm declaring my faith when i feel so far from him i just don't know what to do any advice thanks for all input thanks all i was baptized yesterday baptism is one of the greatest ways that we declare our death to our life of sin and our new life with christ the first time that i was scheduled to be baptised was in march i was driving to the hotel where it was going to happen but i got lost and missed that opportunity i was devestated that i was unable to do it at this time i decided to really think about this decision and learn as much as i could about the siginificance of baptism i thought that i was ready in march but it seems that the right time wasn't until july it was in the chesapeke bay and i was chosen to go first it was a highly memorable day i am only trying to say that god's purpose will be accomplished in his time and way maybe you aren't ready yet or maybe you are the adversary will do anything he can to keep you from this act of obedience to god he knows about your nervousness and will exploit it if he can before you go to bed for the evening ask god to search you to see if there is anything that god wants you to deal with leave your worries at the cross god is very proud of you for your decision to be baptised it is a time of rejoicing and celebration god bless you Baptism Roman Catholic Church Infant baptism Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints John the Baptist Baptist Catechism Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Church of Christ Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Martin Luther Sabbath Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Book of Mormon Salvation Holy Spirit Divine grace Free will Eastern Orthodox Church Religious conversion Priesthood (Mormonism) Justification (theology) Religious Society of Friends Mass (liturgy) Predestination Mary, the mother of Jesus Opus Dei Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses John Wesley Mormonism and Judaism Jon Secada Church of Christ, Scientist John Howard Yoder Iglesia ni Cristo Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Jewish principles of faith First Council of Nicaea Sola fide Catholicism Merit Alan Campbell (pastor) Sin Cliff Richard John Wycliffe Dispensationalism Huldrych Zwingli Christian views of Jesus A Course In Miracles Slow Train Coming Second Vatican Council Revelation Indulgence Articles of Religion (Methodist) Calvinism Mennonite Liturgical year Anabaptist Anti-Mormonism Book of Isaiah Jehovah's Witnesses Rule of St Benedict Lutheranism Confession Repentance Christianity Christian Mormonism and Christianity Shaggy dog story Easter Vigil Westboro Baptist Church (Topeka) Summa Theologiae Christian symbolism Temple (Mormonism) Nahmanides Covenant Theology Purgatory Charles Darwin's views on religion Roman Catholic Diocese of Honolulu Soul The Pilgrim's Progress Theodicy Independent Christian Churches/Churches of Christ Judaism God Ten Commandments Pentecostalism Ambrose Heaven Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite) Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology
