question for christian creationists i have a specific question for those who believe that the world was created exactly as described in the bible something that has puzzled me for quite a while the bible contains two reports about how earth was created first the creation in seven days and second adam and eve in the creation in seven days animals were created the day before man in adam and eve however first adam was created and when he was bored god created animals has his companions i e animals after man ordinary logic would suggest that only one of the two accounts can be right and thus the other is wrong however if one is wrong why should the remaining one be correct i am sure this contradiction has been realized by proponents of creationism and there is some reasoning to explain it away but how thanks for the answers so this may be actually a problem of translation the version i had in mind pretty strongly suggested in gen that the animals were created afterwards like in the new american standard bible www biblegateway com then the lord god said it is not good for the man to be alone i will make him a helper suitable for him asterisks by me you are basing your belief that the two accounts are contradictory on your interpretation of genesis you believe it says that man was created before the animals in contrast to the first chapter of genesis which says the animals were created first the niv has perhaps the best translation of genesis saying god had formed the animals this is a pluperfect indicating the animals were created before man even if one were to translate this verse as a simple past tense the statement is easily seen as a parenthesis i will give an example of two fictional comments i got on yahoo answers tonight to see if someone had a question about the bible then i found this question about genesis i have read the question about genesis i got on yahoo answers tonight to see if someone had a question about the bible these two statements have the same meaning even though they have a different order in the first statement the events are related in strict chronological order the second statement uses a parenthesis talking about an action after one that comes after it in time it speaks of getting on y a after mentioning the reading of the question this kind of parenthesis is a very common device in the english language and it was in the biblical languages as well thus we have three options here the hebrew should be translated as a pluperfect thus eliminating any possibility of a contradiction the second account uses the common device of the parenthesis the authors or if you insist editors redactors of genesis were extremely careless with this text which was very holy to them no one seemed to notice this was a contradiction furthermore no one else did until someone pointed it out in the st century options are possibilities option does not seem credible the accounts do not contradict each other they complement fill out the meaning of one another Young Earth creationism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Bible Day-Age Creationism Adam and Eve Genesis Qur'an Old Earth creationism Documentary hypothesis Sabbath New Testament Noah's Ark Resurrection of Jesus Book of Mormon Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Ten Commandments Intelligent design Evolutionary creationism Creation-evolution controversy Flood geology Noah Abrahamic religion Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Theodicy God Original sin The Bible and history Biblical canon Apocrypha History of the English Bible Creation science Trinity Answers in Genesis Binitarianism Devil Philo Angel Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Names of God in Judaism Historicity of Jesus Moses God and gender Infant baptism Kabbalah Tetragrammaton Jacob Neusner Philosophy of language Guide for the Perplexed Origin belief A Course In Miracles Modern geocentrism Intelligent design movement Soul Dispensationalism Ussher-Lightfoot Calendar The nature of God in Western theology Book of Daniel Holy Spirit Spanish verbs Satan Storytelling Nontrinitarianism Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Gap Creationism Alan Campbell (pastor) Gospel of Thomas Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Justification (theology) Fundamentalism Linguistics and the Book of Mormon Idolatry Gospel of Mark Criticisms of Christianity Halakha Religion Origen Meaning of life History of creationism Sodom and Gomorrah King James Version of the Bible Baptism Abraham Gospel of John Jewish principles of faith El (god) Deconstruction Acts of the Apostles Psalms Paul of Tarsus
