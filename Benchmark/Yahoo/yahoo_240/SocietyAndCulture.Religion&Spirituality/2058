just curious the people that run the catholic church down and say we don't follow the bible and read the bible have you ever been to the catholic mass we read from the bible actually parts of the bible the first reading the hebrew scriptures the first reading is mostly chosen from the old testament and during some seasons the book of acts might be read the second reading the christian scriptures this reading is also referred to as the epistle is usually from one of the letters in the new testament which may also include the book of acts the gospel reading the gospel is the climax of the liturgy of the word catholic faith teaches that in proclaiming the gospel christ is truly present to the community for this reason the community stands to witness to christ s resurrection which allows him to be present to his people the priest than gives a sermon on the three readings and it is very interesting and i like listening to it so how can you say we don't read the bible and you have never been to the catholic church to find out what we do at a mass i hate how people are so down on catholics let me believe what i want to believe thank you i really hate all the pamphlets and books written about how bad catholics are that catholics are all going to hell New Testament Biblical canon Gospel Mass (liturgy) Sabbath Eucharist Roman Catholic Church Old Testament Saint Peter Holy Spirit Christian eschatology Gospel of John Apocrypha Apostle Eastern Orthodox Church Dispensationalism Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Baptism Prophet Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Origen Church of Christ Mary, the mother of Jesus Christian Second Vatican Council Christianity Jesus Biblical inerrancy Harrowing of Hell Martin Luther Salvation John Wycliffe History of the English Bible Canonical hours Gospel of Thomas Christianity and anti-Semitism Great Apostasy Authorship of the Pauline epistles Apostolic Succession Paul of Tarsus Septuagint Fundamentalism Trinity Nazarene King James Version of the Bible John Wesley Matins Baptist Christian-Jewish reconciliation Marcionism Sola scriptura Alan Campbell (pastor) Anglicanism History of Christianity Resurrection of Jesus Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology New Testament apocrypha Epistle to the Romans Vespers Historicity of Jesus Saint James the Just Sola fide Tridentine Mass Lutheranism Priesthood (Mormonism) Religious Society of Friends Vulgate Huldrych Zwingli Mormonism and Christianity Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Filioque clause Gospel of Matthew Catechism Rapture Apostolic Fathers Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Acts of the Apostles Coptic Christianity Thomas (Apostle) Catholicism Antinomianism Christian views of Jesus Book of Malachi Bible and reincarnation Altar Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod
