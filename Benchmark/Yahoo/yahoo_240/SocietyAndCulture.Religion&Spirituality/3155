as anyone been involved in a relationship with a meth alcoholic person and lived to tell the tale yes my ex husband i was with him for years he drank smoked pot did meth was physically emotionally and psychologically abusive it was a nightmare when i finally tried to leave the relationship he stalked me for two years and during that time tried to kill me twice he also stole everything i had that was worth any value materially and otherwise i developed depression anxiety attacks and post traumatic stress disorder because of him protection orders and restraining orders and prison time did nothing to help the situation neither did marriage counseling anger management classes or psychological treatment or bible studies help him with his issues i've been divorced for five years now and for the last two years he's finally left me alone to live my life of course i had to put two hundred miles in between us and move in with relatives so that i wouldn't be alone he still uses my kids as pawns against me whenever he gets the chance thank god the courts awarded me full custody of them he's still using and he's still crazy it's hard to know which came first the drugs or the craziness he's been using since the age of he's now he's been diagnosed with an anger disorder and sociopathic psychopathic tendencies and i consider myself lucky to be alive really it's taken a few years to get my life back together after our divorce lots of family therapy too for the kids and i my suggestion is if you are living with someone like this do yourself a favor and get into therapy yourself living with an addict or a mentally ill person can make you as crazy as he is eventually pretty damaging to the kids as well and i just want to say don't make the same mistake that i did wasting precious years of your life and causing great damage to yourself and kids because you think that if you love him enough he'll change for you or you can change him it's not gonna happen you'll be lucky if you don't get sucked right down into madness with him Clinical depression Mental illness Divorce Bipolar disorder Borderline personality disorder Domestic violence Antisocial personality disorder Rape Methamphetamine Alcoholism Narcissism Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Psychoanalysis Schizophrenia Anger management Psychotherapy Psychiatry Transsexuality Drug abuse Reparative therapy Stroke EastEnders Ex-gay Boston Public Chronic fatigue syndrome Drug addiction Karla Homolka Knots Landing Days of our Lives Dead Like Me Meditation Adult attention-deficit disorder Terri Schiavo Alcoholics Anonymous Hulk (comics) Psychosis Cancer Medicine Mental Health Act 1983 Friends Anti-psychiatry Obsessive-compulsive disorder Cult Charles Darwin's illness Transactional analysis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) The Marshall Mathers LP Arguments for and against drug prohibition Combat stress reaction Psychological trauma Sigmund Freud Pedophilia Asperger syndrome Eating disorder Procrastination Diazepam Child sexual abuse Mental health Psychopharmacology Grief Hypnosis False memory Psychology Project MKULTRA Torture One Life to Live Cephalic disorder Neighbours Narcolepsy Abortion Cannabis (drug) Fathers' rights Postpartum depression Palliative care Hypoglycemia Stuttering Involuntary commitment One Tree Hill (TV series) Sexual dysfunction Fred Phelps Red Dwarf characters Controversies in autism Electroconvulsive therapy Urinary incontinence Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
