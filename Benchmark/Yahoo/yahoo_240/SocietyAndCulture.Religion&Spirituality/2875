what religion would this make me if i believed all of it i'm getting at the polarisation in here a god name is optional created the universe he made a great big mass of many elements and inside that mass he placed an infinite amount of divine energy the mass was not able to cope with the energy within and broke up with huge force each small piece taking some divine energy with it one of these pieces was the sun which then used some of her energy to create planets one of these planets she placed in the most perfect place to receive her light and to that planet she sent her daughter nature nature herself needed to continue and created life each and every living thing now contains a tiny by comparison amount of nature's divine energy we are all equal as brothers and sisters human and animal all equal as the descendants of nature when humans came to be we needed a process to follow a path to knowledge thus we created religion to seek the answers science to find the answers and philosophy to truly understand the answers a little more to follow however to believe all of this is irrelevant as it is the past we must focus on improving the future by improving our present selves i can't help but notice a rule of here god sun and nature religion science and philosophy past present and future and all of these 's are as one sets of one but still sets of x symbolic of planets what i've basically done here is picked a few bits from a few religions and blended them into one the purpose to attempt to find a 'middle ground' between as many people as possible you may notice a strong emphasis on the fact that we created science to find answers this is for the atheists to agree with i don't think anyone can believe it all but i think we all agree with 'our part' of it and therefore we become less hostile to someone who might share 'our part' and combine it with another part which in turn might open our minds to those who disagree with us it's great you've taken the time to find a common ground among so many diverse points of view it is quite plausible it sounds sensible to me yes it's true the basic number is a you're very well oriented and yes it amounts to a frequency of three times the monad and finally yes there is definitely a pattern following that order i hope people here will start agreeing a little bit more on some things or at least treat each other with more respect Religion A Course In Miracles Origin belief Supernatural Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Trinity Existence of God Urantia Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Friedrich Schleiermacher The nature of God in Western theology God Hinduism Creationism Meaning of life Free will Philosophy Theory of conduct Gravity Fundamentalism Simone Weil Summa Theologiae Scientology beliefs and practices Philo Determinism Human Scientific method Intelligent design Mass Reality Spiritism Eastern Orthodox Church Faster-than-light Jacob Neusner Christianity Black hole Philosophy of space and time Charles Grandison Finney Soul Taoism Theology Vacuum Evolutionary creationism Bah__'__ Faith and Science Advaita Vedanta Philosophy of mathematics Jewish philosophy Socrates Protoss Sexual orientation Moral objectivism English grammar Epistemology Philosophy of science Causality Planetary orbit Psychology RISC Force (Star Wars) Human nature Atomism Solar system Confucius Teleological argument Western philosophy Sri Aurobindo CPU cache Islamic philosophy Philosophy of language Karl Popper Belief revision Entropy Modem Logic General relativity Modernism Past teachings of Prem Rawat Satanism Immortality Eastern philosophy Physics Deism Separation of church and state Coercion Heretics of Dune Immanuel Kant Religious conversion G__del's incompleteness theorem Modern geocentrism Spacecraft propulsion
