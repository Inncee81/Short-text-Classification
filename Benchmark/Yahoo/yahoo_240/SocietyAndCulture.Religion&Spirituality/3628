would you rather want mercy or justice if someone you loved was murdered in my own case this has happened my sister was murdered would you want to extend mercy to the person that did the murdering or would you want to extend justice it was a very brutal murder the guy killed her then ran over her with a truck several times to make sure she was ground into the ground the absolute only way to identify her was by her teeth the person has never been caught iam not yelling i am legally blind and cannot see without the capitals i think that i would love to think that i could be a big enough person to extend mercy to be a loving person and let god take care of the judgement that is what i would love to think but in truth i would probably want justice if it were my sister i would be grieving and my heart would be so involved that i am not so sure that i could be that big hearted and let my love overcome my sense of pain and so i would probably ask for justice i know that is not what is the best thing god would want us to ask for mercy that is always the best but i would always be thinking that he gave my sister none and i would have a bad time showing him any if i could i would show him mercy i would pray and pray and i would show him the mercy that he never showed my sister my family i would pray i could be that person in reality i don't know i would not pray vengence i would only pray justice at all costs that is not wrong Capital punishment Theory of conduct Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Time Out of Mind Ethics God Appeal Evil Theodicy Sin Charles Grandison Finney Muslim ibn Aqeel Goodness and value theory Ten Commandments John the Baptist Merit Utilitarianism Anselm of Canterbury John Howard Yoder Revenge Summa Theologiae Phoebe Halliwell Eastern Orthodox Church Murder Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Qiyamah Mother Teresa Abortion debate Faustyna Kowalska Days of our Lives Daredevil Truth Opus Dei Property (ownership right) Simone Weil Religious pluralism Virgin Mary in Islam Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Twelve Swords of Power Calvinism Friedrich Schleiermacher The Pilgrim's Progress Rich Mullins Jon Secada Richard Rahl Blue Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Ethics in religion Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Origin belief Free will A Course In Miracles Liberal Christianity Philosophical skepticism Duties of the Heart Immortality Scenes from a Memory Blood atonement Sub-Zero Sharon Tate Bon Jovi Arjuna Love Glen Jacobs Apostasy in Islam Humphrey Bogart John Lennon Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Fathers' rights Ed, Edd n Eddy Animal rights Urantia Oh My Goddess!
