please read all if god gave us a brain to use why belive in god doesn't it make more sense to be an athiest or an agnostic if there is no solid proof of something it may or may not be true if you are an agnostic you are not required to belive one way or another so until you have proof of something you don't know i think more people are agnostic than will say i know when i was child as a christian i always had doubt no proof i would have argued with anybody who said that god didn't exist and denied my doubt but i was still agnostic of course it does make more logical sense to not belive in ghosts and goblins thoughts any budding agnostics out there who want to confess their doubt the more i think about it the less i believe in god at first it is scary and you don't want to let go you know what happens if you don't believe right it means that when you die you no longer exist it's hard to let go of both of my parents are ordained ministers and i grew up in a god loving home worked for me it was all true had to be mom and dad said so as i got older and started to think for myself that faith became more and more difficult to maintain about years ago i realized i was agnostic and in the past year have admitted i've become an atheist when i was younger i guess i felt like i needed to lie to myself to keep myself from doing bad things but only because that's what religion teaches you today i'm a happy atheist and i break fewer laws now than ever before but back to your point that is why they call it faith there is no proof if someone tried to start a similar movement today he'd be locked up in a padded room so fast it's not even funny still if people want to or need to believe in a god or two go for it i think that can be very healthy for some people but it's not their job to force their god on anyone else do people in wheelchairs force crutches on others walking by it's fairly simple the way i see it as long as their god doesn't affect my life we'll all get along just fine Atheism Agnosticism The nature of God in Western theology Existence of God Religion Strong atheism Alcoholics Anonymous God Theodicy Ten Commandments Afterlife Christianity Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Roman Catholic Church Charles Darwin's views on religion Creationism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Supernatural Philosophical skepticism David Hume Pitaten Sabbath Unitarian Universalism Evolutionary creationism Simone Weil Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Goodness and value theory Douglas Adams Bertrand Russell Articles of Religion (Methodist) Summa Theologiae Pascal's Wager The relationship between religion and science Christian apologetics Fundamentalism Apostasy Immortality Charles Grandison Finney Soul Al-Ghazali Eastern Orthodox Church Religious conversion Predestination Friedrich Schleiermacher Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Reincarnation Sin Intelligent design Utilitarianism Spiritism Objectivist philosophy Justification (theology) Jesus Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Christianity and anti-Semitism Original sin Transcendental argument for the existence of God Infant baptism Merit Evil Biblical inerrancy Separation of church and state History of creationism John Wesley Christian denomination Weak agnosticism Messianic Judaism RuneScape quests Free will Young Earth creationism Religious Society of Friends Church of Christ Meaning of life Existence Rich Mullins Church of Christ, Scientist Creation-evolution controversy Argument from morality Friedrich Nietzsche Negima Dualism (philosophy of mind) Resurrection of Jesus Baptism Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Eucharist Past teachings of Prem Rawat Ludwig Wittgenstein A Course In Miracles Papal Infallibility Sant Thakar Singh Historical persecution by Christians Jewish principles of faith Sola fide Deconstruction The Death Gate Cycle Presuppositional apologetics
