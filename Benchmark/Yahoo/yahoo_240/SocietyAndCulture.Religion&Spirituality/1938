what can i do to make myself focus on the good things at my church and get away from dwelling on negative i haven't went to my church for over a month because i kept thinking negative things about people giving me dirty looks and the fact that my job bill collecting was insulted by the music minister and the preachers son pushed me out of the way when i was trying to open the door for some old ladies the thing is i don't like not going to church i've looked for others and didn't feel like they were preaching what i believe this church i've been going to for years i love the preaching and believe in what is preached i've tried to talk to the minister but it seems like he never wants to talk to me because i'm quiet the thing is i do want to go i don't like just not going to church i don't feel right doing this i'm thinking about just going to the same church that i feel so unwanted in every wednesday night only because the crowd is less and the music minister that insults my job isn't there that night and i love the wednesday night preaching would it be ok to go only on wed nights i am in kinda the same boat the people at my church have been so good to my family in times of great distress but the people teaching in the childrens church have hurt my grandchildrens feelings on several occassions i haven't been in over months and i hate it but i can't attend a church that treats children like second class citizens but i think that satan plants people in the churches so as to get people away from god what better place to work than in god's house with god's people just go worship and pray for those who talk bad about you they need it Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Rich Mullins John Wesley Church of Christ Minister of religion Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Social rule Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Shaggy dog story Alan Campbell (pastor) Muslim ibn Aqeel Theory of conduct Sant Thakar Singh Sabbath Religious Society of Friends EastEnders Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Justification (theology) Westboro Baptist Church (Topeka) John the Baptist The Shining (film) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Prophets of Islam Rosa Parks One Tree Hill (TV series) Infidels Philipp Melanchthon Eastern Orthodox Church Cliff Richard Religious conversion William M.
