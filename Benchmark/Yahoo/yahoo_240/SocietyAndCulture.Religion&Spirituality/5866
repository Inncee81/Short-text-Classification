muslims do you generally agree or disagree with this comment if the us really wanted to fight terrorism it should have bombed florida which is the haven of many criminals who once served us interests or london which houses nerve centres of most of the terrorist outfits in the world or israel which is the terrorist state number one i read this just a few moments ago is this an accurate representation of the view held by the majority of muslims dear mr muggle you hide yourself and assume i am a christian you are excused your hatred has been acknowledged the problem with this is that no one is in the position to take a life that's the right of a higher power it's sad that politicians take out their big guns and war handles every time they think they see something as a threat and they can't seem to find alternative things terrorism has no face has no religion it's everywhere it's in our schools in the form of racism and bad education it's on the streets in the form of violence drugs etc it's in peoples minds in the form of hatred and intolerance i agree all of them have different degree of measure but all of them have similar solutions terrorists don't wear badges saying they are terrorists and because of this thousands of innocents become victams the only thing i agree about that statement is that the us should concentrate on the terrorism that no one is paying attention to the kind that swallows young minds into becoming criminals think about it while football stars and measly actors and actresses are running big bucks making millions for ridiculous things people we need the most i e teachers cops fire fighters government aids social workers people that actually make a difference get paid what grand a year the government does not know how to prioratize anything i think if this whole system were to change things would be better Anti-Defamation League Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Yusuf al-Qaradawi Arab-Israeli conflict Plame affair British Mandate of Palestine Fundamentalism Israeli Arab Nation of Islam Pat Buchanan War on Terrorism Terrorism Anti-Semitism Post-September 11 anti-war movement Kurdish people Neofascism and religion Christianity and anti-Semitism Christianity Religion The Left and Opposition to War Murder Privacy U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Capitalism Hillary Rodham Clinton Democracy September 11, 2001 attacks Palestinian National Authority The Power of Nightmares Coercion Anti-Arabism Punisher Rudolf Steiner Domestic violence Columbine High School massacre Theory of conduct Gun politics Democratic Party (United States) Bowling for Columbine Separation of church and state George Galloway Lebanese Civil War Racism Anthroposophy George W.
