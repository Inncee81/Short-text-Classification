science's naturalistic methods is there something wrong with them why i'm now listening to paranoid by black sabbath not very christian of me i know in my defense its playing in the radio in my place of work and theres nothing i can do about it what are you listening to paz de cristo yeah i'm lucky d can't change the channel though rules well how about the science's methods i think its worth disscussing them more deeply michael there's something wrong with me for questioning scientific methods why i don't like when people treat science like its some sort of religion pwacheri science only deals with mesurable replicable data it says nothing about supernatural phenomenon or god i just read an answer to a question about evolution that said this was a bad thing i know that many religious people find this to be a shortcomming of science since it searches for the truth oh and the song isn't as bad as you're thinking in my opinion its alright for everyone to listen to black sabbath unlike cannibal corpse i'll pray and think about what you wrote though nothing wrong at all science is just one of many ways to explore god's creation it only gives reasons to believe if your mind is not corrupted Intelligent design Religion Supernatural Meaning of life Creation-evolution controversy Theory of conduct Phillip E.
