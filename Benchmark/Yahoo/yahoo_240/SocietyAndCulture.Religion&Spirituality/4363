jehova's witnesses in light of deuteronomy and isaiah how are we to understand john in nwt deuteronomy see now that i i am he and there are no gods with me isaiah before me there was no god formed and after me there continued to be none john in the beginning the word was and the word was with god and the word was a god surely if jehovah had already said that there was no god with him before him or after him this verse is incorrect either that or jehovah has lied which is impossible as he cannot lie surely the correct translation should be as in kj which reads in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god as we know that jesus is the word then from these scriptures we can also say that he is god i have heard the explanations using the corinthians calling satan the god of this system of things however satan in this instance made himself a god and as such is a false god if we apply this premise to john then it would also follow that jesus was a false god which of course he is not i follow your reasoning and agree with your conclusion another way of looking at things which might be helpful is to consider that unless christ were indeed god then he could not have accomplished salvation for us he must have three essential qualifications to be our substitute and be able to redeem us he must be fully human or he could not stand in our place and take the punishment rightly due he must be infinite or else he could not satisfactorily bear our punishment of infinite duration only god is infinite he must be perfect having no sin or corruption of course god is perfect and sinless and that is also why the virgin birth was necessary the mother being the vessel the carrier and not imparting her blood system her sin that christ has suffered for all leaves the possibility that all might be saved if united to christ god is full of love and mercy and is not willing for any to be lost and seeks out those who are away from or who have fallen or strayed or been stolen or led away from christ we do not always know how god reaches people nor what dealings he may privately have with an individual but we do know that through faith in jesus christ we are saved unless we really do stand in jeopardy of eternal separation and punishment from a holy and just god of perfection who will not allow sin in his presence nor to corrupt heaven and all who dwell there then why was it so necessary for christ to take our punishment upon himself and cleanse us from our sin the reality of our perilous and desperate state has been met by the greatest expression of love possible by a merciful and compassionate saviour who held nothing back and could do no more and who truly shows both in his loving and compassionate life and supremely in his glorious death on the cross the very heart of god how could he then be anything other than god Jehovah's Witnesses Christianity Book of Isaiah Abrahamic religion Justification (theology) Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Summa Theologiae Heaven Soul Religion Dispensationalism Charles Grandison Finney Purgatory Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Mary, the mother of Jesus Hell Holy Spirit Book of Mormon End times Biblical inerrancy Merit John Howard Yoder Articles of Religion (Methodist) Angel Sacrifice Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Jewish Messiah Divine grace A Course In Miracles Indulgence Mormonism and Christianity Great Apostasy Religious pluralism Devil Church of Christ, Scientist Eucharist Jesus Mormonism Christian views of Jesus New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures Repentance Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Prophet Calvinism Anselm of Canterbury Theodicy Liberal Christianity Evil Five points of Calvinism Satan Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions John the Baptist John Wycliffe Jewish principles of faith Creationism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism John Wesley Religious perspectives on Jesus Mortification of the flesh Pascal's Wager Opus Dei Paul of Tarsus Alan Campbell (pastor) Origen Apocalyptic literature Catholicism El (god) Religious conversion Free will Gospel of Thomas Binitarianism Perseverance of the saints Athanasian Creed Predestination Names of God in Judaism Christian and Missionary Alliance
