why do people act like evolution is better then creationism last i heard evolution was a theory a theory is a guess it might be a good guess compared to earlier guesses but it is still a guess they can't make a deodorant that lasts past lunch and you want me to believe they know where we came from i have a little guess for you if you listen to god he will tell you the truth when i was god said yo brah the bible is truth and what do you know after thousands of years no one can dispute that truth so why is it when i meet evolutionists they act like i don't know something they do i know what a theory is what else do i need to know i don't even have the heart to tell them thermodynamics proves evolution wrong if you want to know where i am coming from read my profile and my favorite words those will tell you where i am coming from here is your answer key factor that we all must recognize is that the vast majority of scientists who believe in evolution are also atheists or agnostics there are some who hold to some form of theistic evolution and others who take a deistic view of god god exists but is not involved in the world everything proceeds along a natural course there are some who genuinely and honestly look at the data and arrive at the conclusion that evolution betters fits with the data again though these represent an insignificant portion of scientists who advocate evolution the vast majority of evolutionary scientists hold that life evolved entirely without any intervention of a higher being evolution is by definition a naturalistic science for atheism to be true there must be an alternate explanation for how the universe and life came into existence although beliefs in some form of evolution predated charles darwin darwin was the first to develop a plausible model for how evolution could have occurred natural selection darwin once identified himself as a christian but later renounced the christian faith and the existence of god as a result of some tragedies that took place in his life evolution was invented by an atheist darwin's goal was not to disprove god's existence but that is one of the end results of the theory of evolution evolution is an enabler of atheism evolutionary scientists today likely would not admit that their goal is to give an alternate explanation of the origins of life and thereby to give a foundation for atheism however according to the bible that is exactly why the theory of evolution exists the bible tells us the fool says in his heart 'there is no god' psalm the bible also proclaims that people are without excuse for not believing in a creator god for since the creation of the world god's invisible qualities his eternal power and divine nature have been clearly seen being understood from what has been made so that men are without excuse romans according to the bible anyone who denies the existence of god is a fool why then are so many people including some christians willing to accept that evolutionary scientists are unbiased interpreters of scientific data according to the bible they are all fools foolishness does not imply a lack of intelligence most evolutionary scientists are brilliant intellectually foolishness indicates an inability to properly apply knowledge proverbs tells us the fear of the lord is the beginning of knowledge but fools despise wisdom and discipline evolutionary scientists mock creation and or intelligent design as unscientific and not worthy of scientific examination in order for something to be considered a science they argue it must be able to be observed and tested it must be naturalistic creation is by definition supernatural god and the supernatural cannot be observed or tested so the argument goes therefore creation and or intelligent design cannot be considered a science as a result all data is filtered through the preconceived presupposed and pre accepted theory of evolution without alternate explanations being considered however the origin of the universe and the origin of life cannot be tested or observed both creation and evolution are faith based systems when they speak of origins neither can be tested because we cannot go back billions or thousands of years to observe the origin of the universe and life in the universe evolutionary scientists reject creation on grounds that would logically force them to also reject evolution as a scientific explanation of origins evolution at least in regards to origins does not fit the definition of science any more than creation does evolution is supposedly the only explanation of origins that can be tested therefore it is the only theory of origins that can be considered scientific this is foolishness scientists who advocate evolution are rejecting a plausible theory of origins without even honestly examining its merits because it does not fit their illogically narrow definition of science if creation is true then there is a creator to whom we are accountable evolution is an enabler for atheism evolution gives atheists a basis for explaining how life exists apart from a creator god evolution denies the need for a god to be involved in the universe evolution is the creation theory for the religion of atheism according to the bible the choice is clear we can believe the word of our omnipotent and omniscient god or we can believe the illogically biased scientific explanations of fools Determinism Bah__'__ Faith and Science Al-Ghazali Creation biology Nontrinitarianism
