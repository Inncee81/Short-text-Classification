as a christian have you been through a church split how did it affect you what was it split over i myself have been through two church splits one as a child which crushed the youth of the church because the pastor at the time was very excited about the growing youth ministry but the old guard at the church did not like the children growing in numbers and the second one was years ago when the associate pastor plotted with the chief money contributors to rid the church of the pastor because he refused to allow the church to be lorded over by those that gave high amounts of money i have been through two church splits both were really nasty and over serious things the first was over a pastor who sexually assaulted a minor the second in the same church was over the conduct of the interim pastor it was hell on earth brotha Church of Christ Minister of religion Evangelical Lutheran Church in America Seventh-day Adventist Church Worldwide Church of God Roman Catholic Church Pentecostalism Uniting Church in Australia Salvation Army Baptist Hillsong Church United Methodist Church Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Jehovah's Witnesses Alan Campbell (pastor) Southern Baptist Convention Clerical celibacy Bishop Holy Orders Church of the United Brethren in Christ Lutheranism David Wilkerson Fred Phelps Mennonite Motion picture rating system Charles Taze Russell Church of Scotland New Apostolic Church Christian right Separate Baptist Photosynthesis Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod William M.
