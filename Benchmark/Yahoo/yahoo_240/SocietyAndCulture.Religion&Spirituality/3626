ladies and gentlemen i'd like to leave you all for the night with a thought would you consider this i do not agree with many of the ideals of most religions and most religious people don't agree with most of the ideals i live by although we disagree we are human more or less and have a limited time learn and grow as my health begins to fade more rapidly i feel that anything that evokes thought is worthwhile even if it is done through somewhat devious means i will continue to toss out questions that only make sense to me or questions that are controversial because they tend to provoke thought and through thought knowledge and understanding we all need to consider that everyone here is a person with the same feelings and cares as everyone else we also need to consider that in some cases people actually have a lot riding on the answers received here though it is a good distraction for some of us try to keep in mind that it is based on learning from each other answer honestly question often and don't be afraid to have a good time thanks for your time and opinions that was beautifully said it is perhaps an unfortunate side effect of the net that while we are exposed to more ideas cultures and ways of life the presentation is often faceless we forget where the ideas are really coming from people with hopes dreams fears it's good to be reminded good night Theory of conduct Ethics Religion The nature of God in Western theology Confucianism Abortion debate Scientology beliefs and practices Socrates Evil Phaedo Meaning of life Milton H.
