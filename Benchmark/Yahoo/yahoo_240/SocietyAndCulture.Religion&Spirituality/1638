question for all religions about the apocolypse okay so various religions and civilizations have predicted the apocolypse the mayan prediction is very near in i think maybe but the point is say the apocolypse never comes and all religions were wrong including atheists becuase eventually something will destroy us all then wouldn't everyone feel stupid knowing they wasted their whole lives preparing for a day that would never come i know it would make me a little upset but im not going to go crazy over it i will still belive in god and just believe that he will come someday your takes on it apocalypse greek translit apokalypsis literally the lifting of the veil is a term applied to the disclosure to certain privileged persons of something hidden from the mass of humankind today the term is often used to mean end of the world which may be a shortening of the phrase apokalupsis eschaton which literally means revelation at the end of the world i think not starjumper they are synonyms dont correct unless you have a degree in this s'hit people i am a christian you are seriously overthinking what if we are wrong what would you do simple geez i know what the coming of the lord will look like its just a question out of curiosity i am greek again dont speak about things you dont talk about apokolypsis has two meanings the end of the world and the lifting of the veil and that veil is the secret day of jesus' second coming i am greek again dont speak about things you dont talk about apokolypsis has two meanings the end of the world and the lifting of the veil and that veil is the secret day of jesus' second coming i swear the next bastard that drops that stupid if spiel on me is in for it i will hunt you down not really but seriously stop it its so fu'ckin annoying well i guess this all comes down to faith i have occasionaly thought very similar things but i always come back to the realization that i either believe the bible is god's word that god is not the author of confusion and god does not lie or i believe that the bible is only half truths and can be manipulated to mean whatever we want to turn it into if is such a loaded word as evidenced by this post http answers yahoo com question index ylt ave qggchmpi rlvp rapuxty ix qid aamvuog show profile info cifhr bpaa apparently christians using the word if means we don't believe ourselves or something Apocalypse Religion Fundamentalism God Eschatology Book of Revelation A Course In Miracles The nature of God in Western theology Ten Commandments Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Christian eschatology Prophet Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sin Shit God and gender Sabbath Idolatry Soul Existence of God Atheism End times Moses Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Christianity Predestination Dispensationalism Abrahamic religion Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Theology Religious conversion Gospel of Thomas Separation of church and state Jesus Names and titles of Jesus Theodicy Meaning of life Biblical inerrancy Biblical canon Saint Peter Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Resurrection of Jesus Book of Mormon John Howard Yoder Slow Train Coming Gospel of Mark Aramaic of Jesus Freemasonry Trinity Scientology beliefs and practices Christ Evil Holy Spirit Origin belief Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Philo Religious Society of Friends Judaism Church of Christ Jewish Messiah Sola fide Opus Dei Baptist Evangelicalism Eucharist Catholicism Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Jehovah's Witnesses Religious pluralism Simone Weil Evolutionary creationism Great Apostasy Social rule Human Jon Secada Unification Church Singlish Book of Daniel Tetragrammaton Qur'an God Emperor of Dune Church of Christ, Scientist Bible Mary, the mother of Jesus Secret Gospel of Mark
