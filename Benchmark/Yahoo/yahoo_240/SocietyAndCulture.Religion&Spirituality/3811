christians jehovah's witnesses and the holocaust in wwii germany i was visiting the shoah foundation website which is a website that was built by steven spielberg and usc about the testimonies of surviving victims from the holocaust besides testimonies from the jews there is testimonies from jehovah's witnesses as well why didn't other christian groups suffer like the jehovah's witnesses they where kill with the jews billy s sorry billy no testimonies from catholics on the website maybe they all just kind of accepted hitlers way of doing things rather than stand up and speak up against it i also think catholic preists where mixed up with political affairs and even blessed hitlers army just like they blessed uk's army usa's armny etc meg m did you read the links you posted this is from one of them the insidious mythology of christians especially catholic complicity in the holocaust is so persuasive that even many catholics including the clergy subscribe to it little wonder there is a conspicuous paucity of commemorations in catholic and protestant churches of hitler s other victims during holocaust remembrance week though a handful of priests and nuns protested hitler s atrocities and suffered for it the vatican as well as the catholic church and its army of clergy gave either active or tacit support to the nazi tyranny which they regarded as a bulwark against the advance of world communism sitting pretty in the vatican pope pius xii let the holocaust on the jews and the cruel persecutions of jehovah s witnesses and others proceed uncriticized it is ironical that pope john paul ii on visiting germany in may should glorify the anti nazi stand of one sincere priest what were the other thousands of the german clergy doing during hitler s reign of terror a pastoral letter issued by the german catholic bishops in september at the outbreak of world war ii provides enlightenment on this point it reads in part in this decisive hour we admonish our catholic soldiers to do their duty in obedience to the fuehrer and to be ready to sacrifice their whole individuality we appeal to the faithful to join in ardent prayers that divine providence may lead this war to blessed success such catholic diplomacy illustrates the kind of harlotry that religion has engaged in over the past years in wooing the political state in order to gain power and advantage such religio political relationships have fostered warfare persecutions and human misery on a vast scale Christianity and anti-Semitism The Holocaust Opus Dei Pope John Paul II Anti-Semitism Christian opposition to anti-Semitism Eucharist Ten Commandments Persecution of Christians Jehovah's Witnesses Second Vatican Council Roman Catholicism's links with political authorities Separation of church and state Relations between Catholicism and Judaism Catholicism Persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses Eastern Orthodox Church Sedevacantism Christian-Jewish reconciliation Priest Nazism in relation to other concepts Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Pope Pius X Religious pluralism Pope Paul VI Clergy Centre Party (Germany) Funeral of Pope John Paul II Holocaust denial Homosexuality and Christianity Polish September Campaign Baptism Judaism Lutheranism Traditionalist Catholic Propaganda Martin Luther Mass (liturgy) Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Fascism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity World War II Josemar__a Escriv__ Blessed Virgin Mary Great Apostasy Canonical hours Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Protestantism Excommunication History of Europe Nazi Germany Anschluss Exorcism Catechism History of the Jews in Germany History of the Jews in Italy Religion Pope Pius XI Anglicanism John Chrysostom Religious Society of Friends History of Germany Holy Orders Ordination of women Biblical canon Mary, the mother of Jesus End times Nazism Christian eschatology Protestant Reformation Criticisms of Christianity Clerical celibacy Abrahamic religion John Howard Yoder Great Jubilee Persecution of Jews History of anti-Semitism Counter-Reformation Pacifism Religious conversion Roman Catholic Diocese of Honolulu Christian denomination Jubilee (Christian) History of the Jews in Poland Independent State of Croatia Coptic Christianity History of the Jews in France Prophet
