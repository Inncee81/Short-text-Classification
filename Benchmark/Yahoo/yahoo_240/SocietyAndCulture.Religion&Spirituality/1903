do you honestly believe this this is an excerpt from an answer to a previous question do people honestly believe that the catholic church never seek s out truth mainly steering clear of all science considering it is one of the few christian churches that as a whole definitively upholds evolution and other scientifically maintained precedents how can someone make such an ignorant claim oh let's ignore the fact that since the church has funded an academy of sciences that has hosted almost nobel prize winning scientists let's focus on the views that were maintained by a medieval church ones that were never claimed as doctrine ones that were shared by a vast majority of people and ones that were maintained until the point where research could prove contrarily does anyone else claim that the church is ignorant regarding science note first how many prominent scientists choose to research in conjunction with the vatican do research first then break out the keyboards http www vatican va roman curia pontifical academies acdscien ann storia en qxd pdf onthewatch let's just ignore the fact that if you are christian reading a bible you're reading a catholic book confirmed atheist i don't ignore the past disagreements with science nor do i justify them they are however ideas held by a people with negligible means of scientific proof this is a query into your research only not an attempt at a rebuttal do you understand that informed catholics make a distinction between a pope's spiritual guidance and his actions as a sinful man generally the non catholic belief is that infallibility is a constant thing au contraire we recognize that the pope is just as tempted to sin as any other man therefore in matters not pertaining to the church we don't emphasize his actions but as for church direction changing on a whim i must object in most cases there has been a general anguish with overturning a previous papal encyclical as you must understand if this occurs frequently what's allowing anyone to believe in any sort of authority running out of lines and consciousness would you care to email me i value your input answerman if you have such hatred toward the catholic church after so long as a member you never understood anything regarding it in the first place also have you ever been to a mass there are three readings a day plus an excerpt from psalms and the mass is built upon the words of the new testament all the prayers are scriptural i e they contain scripture and the rosary focuses on most aspects of christ's walk in life death and resurrection not only people who memorize verses know the bible feel free to contact me if you wish to talk but it seems you're going to be a bit close minded brandon i agree with you about the vatican's recent efforts but let's not kid ourselves about the history of the church just because they've begun to come into agreement with science in the last years does not mean that they've generally been proponents of science the catholic church has just as much injustice against science as the branches that left it in the 's now again i agree that they've made strides well beyond that of the other christian religions but i'm not one to claim their complete innocence from the situation at hand either you know as well as i know that a new pope means a new direction and catholicism is only a pope away from re instituting a ban on science one pope's fancy can easily be overturned by the next edit i see your point regarding individuals within the church i think i will email you to continue this conversation i can already see that it can easily get very long you already know i respect your opinion and hold you in high regard that's why you're one of my contacts thanks for taking the time to address my answer Eucharist Homosexuality and Christianity Eastern Orthodox Church God New Testament Mary, the mother of Jesus History of Christianity Trinity Dispensationalism Gallicanism Ordination of women Sedevacantism Original sin Teach the Controversy Christianity and anti-Semitism Creation-evolution controversy Science Biblical canon Apocrypha Theology Christian apologetics Great Apostasy Pope John Paul II Modern geocentrism Pope Pius XII Blessed Virgin Mary Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Sabbath Supernatural Mormonism and Christianity Merit Ten Commandments Ecumenical council Sin Infant baptism Sola fide Filioque clause Resurrection of Jesus Catechism Scientology beliefs and practices Anglicanism Religious pluralism Theory of conduct Book of Mormon Jewish principles of faith Abrahamic religion Sola scriptura Christian denomination Religious conversion Origen Alan Campbell (pastor) Canonical hours Apologetics Christian eschatology Novus Ordo Missae Predestination Bible Liberal Christianity Society of St. Pius X Tridentine Mass Pope Paul VI Plame affair Bible and reincarnation Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology
