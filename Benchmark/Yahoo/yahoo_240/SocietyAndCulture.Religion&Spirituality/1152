any mormons out there who can answer this question as a child my husband was baptized in the mormon church he wasn't old enough to understand anything about the mormon beliefs and he's never been a practicing mormon after we got married he began attending church with me i was raised in a baptist church and he has since been baptized and saved in my church the problem is the mormons find him no matter where we live they come knocking on the door leaving notes and basically won't take no for an answer we've told them many times that we attend a different church now and we'd rather them not come around but they still do why it's not a big enough nuisance that i'd ever call the police on them or anything like that but i don't understand why they won't listen to what we say and just stop coming around and interestingly enough a girl i work with has a similar problem having attended a mormon church as a teenager what gives serious answers only please thanks the lds church takes record keeping very seriously and appear to have been able to keep track very well in this case don't know how often they are coming to your door but the church also takes seriously following up with what we call the less active if we did not it would be a lack of fulfilling our responsibility to tend to our sheep if you will however i hear what you are saying as much as i hate to do this because i am lds and have a firm testimony of it i would advise you to receive the missionaries the next time they come to your door you can investigate a couple of things to stop these visits were they told by member friends of yours that you guys would be a good family to visit and teach the gospel to do you have friends who are lds who may have done that the missionaries never stay in one area to proselytize throughout their mission they get transferred every couple of months and pass on information to the next missionaries in the area concerning homes they have gone to perhaps previous elders have left pamphlets in your home and felt that you may be interested at a later time you can make a written request to the lds church that your husband's name be removed from church records it has to be a written request since it would get sent to headquarters you guessed it salt lake city where they would process the request again i hated to do this but as a former missionary and current bishop i know that coersion pressure or telling people that they're going to hell are not missionary tools in our faith we focus on telling people what we can offer not what another faith does wrong i only hope happiness for you and your husband through the years wherever you may be Criticism of Mormonism Temple (Mormonism) Joseph Smith, Jr. History of the Latter Day Saint movement Baptism Book of Mormon Mormonism and Christianity Mormon missionary Priesthood (Mormonism) Mormon Mormonism and Judaism Endowment (Mormonism) Anti-Mormonism Mormonism Church of Christ Religious conversion Community of Christ Blacks and Mormonism Eastern Orthodox Church Polygamy Missionary Christianity First Vision History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Plural marriage Orson Hyde Baptism for the dead Religious Society of Friends Paul of Tarsus Baptist Thomas B.
