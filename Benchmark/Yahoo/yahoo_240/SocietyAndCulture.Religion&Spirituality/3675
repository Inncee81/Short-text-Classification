when i was taking clinicals i worked with a surgeon who told us his belief on gods care to hear it a local preachers wife was having surgery so some of the nurses and techs wanted to have a prayer session before starting the doctor asked them to try and hurry then left when he came back in another tech student asked him if he was christian he said no that he was atheist she asked him how he could be atheist when he saw miracles every day he said we do our jobs and nature does the rest if a god had anything to do with it i wouldn't end up covered in blood every day of course i wouldn't be driving a porsche either the doctor is almost spot on of course the mistaken view is the one held by the tech student who insisted the doctor saw miracles every day by definition a miracle is supernatural in origin if the doctor is in there with all the wonderful skill and talent that got him through medical school there's nothing divine or supernatural in that prayer is fine if that's what you want i'm certainly a proponent of it but to suggest that miracles are occuring in the or every day is to misunderstand the nature of miracles hannah j paul Miracle Supernatural Atheism Evolutionary creationism Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Mother Teresa Jesus A Course In Miracles Charles Darwin's views on religion Church of Christ, Scientist Theodicy Creationism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Religion Existence of God Jewish principles of faith Fiddler on the Roof Alcoholics Anonymous Reconstructionist Judaism God Saint The Shining (film) Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism David Hume Creation-evolution controversy Biblical inerrancy Pledge of Allegiance Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Philosophy of religion Physician William M.
