why are atheists or liberals so intolerant of christians because we love to live uprightly and morally when we don't agree with their choices or opinions which go against the bible and morality they call us intolerant don't they or you the circular reasoning going on we need to tolerant their sin and not say a word which we mostly do but they can scorn and mock us and we have to tolerate it because it is a free country for them not us our position is based on the bible which we believe is the word of god yours is based on opinion feelings and pride in your stance this is the shaking your fist at god thing that stalin did before he died don't you see the error here in this thinking you don't see christians persecuted muslims have it easier forgive my incorrect grammar as for me being intolerant i knew you guys would say that it is the easy thing to say i believe liberal and atheist are prac the same atheists and other non christians reject god and therefore choose satan they choose to be deceived by satan who hates god and human beings and live or die rather into his lies non christians are in the dark and blind to the truth they don't understand christianity and they don't like it for that simple fact they need him and deep inside themselves they want it but because they're so in the dark they don't fully realize this and instead choose to keep rejecting god many people think they believe in god or are christians but are no t simply because they reject god without even realizing it in order to follow what the world and therefore satan wants for them to do many people don't believe in the bible simply because it's judeo christian other people don't believe in it because they don't think that it contains the actual word of god or in other words the truth they don't understand the bible nor agree with what it says so when christians live their lives by and claim it to be truthful non believers have a problem with that the bible which is completely truthful is merely another part of christianity that non believers don't like nor understand non believers belong to this world and believers don't non believers are children of the kingdom of darkness this world and believers are children of the kingdom of light god christians don't belong to this world and they are therefore outsiders or outcasts rejected by the masses christians are not meant to be surprised in receiving a negative reaction or treatment from non believers simply because it's god that they don't want and if they don't want god then they don't want christians by the way i personally don't like to refer to liberals as being liberal because the word liberal means freedom and a lot of the what liberals believe in is not freedom and is in fact bondage to this world and therefore satan and you will be hated by every human being because of my name jesus to his disciples matthew jesus told them 'if god was your father you would love me for i have graced you with my divine presence and it was not from my own self that i came except he sent me however why you do not abide by my manifestation it is because of your inability to recognize it you come from your father the devil and in the service of your father you are content to be enslaved to him who is the killer of mankind from the beginning who never upholds the truth for truth does not abide in him and when he speaks lies he speaks of his own genesis for he is a liar like his father also but since i speak the truth you do not believe me ' john my beloved do not be surprised by the trials like something strange overwhelming you because these things are your communion in the inheritance your sacrificial lambs except be glad that you are becoming partakers in the passion of christ so as you may also partake in the revelation of his glory and be glad and celebrate and if you are maligned or slaughtered for the sake of the name of christ you are indeed blessed as the glorifying spirit of god shall rest upon you suffering as a murderer a thief or an evil doer is not the same thing then you should not be ashamed to suffer passion for being a christian except glorify god for the sake of this name peter but whoever hates their brother is in darkness and by darkness perishes and they know not which way they are going for the darkness blinds their very eyes john for when they speak of depraved gaiety they try to trick those who are easily fooled by the evil desires of the flesh and they pretend to offer them freedom while these are the works of degeneracy peter Prophet Historical roots of
