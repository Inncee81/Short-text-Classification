muslims only please i think i am going to convert to islam so here are my questions how do i convert to islam will you muslims on here help me what are some good websites mashaallah welcome to islam i am very enlightened to hear that may allah guide you to the straight path and make things easy for you to become muslim you have to pronounce the testimony of faith 'shahada' with sincere faith the implication of the shihada is that you believe that there is only one god allah who alone deserves to be worshipped it also implies that you believe in muhammad peace be upon him as the messenger of god and you believe in his message it also means that you believe in all of god's prophets including jesus peace be upon him who is a messenger of god and not divine or son of god if you accept this the only thing that remains for you to become muslim is to say the shahada while believing in it with your heart word for word as follows i bear witness that there is no god except allah and i bear witness that muhammad is the messenger of allah then repeat this same testimony in arabic as follows ash hadu anlla ilaha ilallah wa ash hadu anna muhammadan rasul ullah some people have a wrong notion that entering into the islamic fold requires an announcement from the concerned person in the presence of high ranking scholars or shaikhs or reporting this act to courts of justice or other authorities it is also thought that the act of accepting islam should as a condition have a certificate issued by the authorities as evidence to that effect we wish to clarify that the whole matter is very easy and that none of these conditions or obligations are required for allah almighty is above all comprehension and knows well the secrets of all hearts nevertheless those who are going to adopt islam as their religion are advised to register themselves as muslims with the concerned governmental agency as this procedure may facilitate for them many matters including the possibility of performing hadj pilgrimage and umrah of course faith is not only words but is complemented with action so upon reciting the shahada one should begin to learn and uphold his her duties as a muslim the main pillars of islam as you know are the five daily prayers annual charity to the poor and needy fasting the month of ramadan pilgrimage to mecca once in a life time for those who are able the next step now after the shahada is to take a complete shower bath with the intention of purifying yourself to be ready for prayers here are some good islamic websites http discover islamway com http www themodernreligion com index html http www harunyahya com http whyislam org introduction http convertingtoislam com http www islamcan com http www allaahuakbar net misconceptions index htm and ofcourse if you have any questions about islam don't hesitate to e mail me or any of the muslims here on y a i'm sure they will be happy to help peace Shahadah Muhammad Fasting Ramadan God Qiyamah Allah Apostasy in Islam Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Virgin Mary in Islam Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Women in Islam Religious pluralism John the Baptist Yusuf al-Qaradawi Prophets of Islam Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Isa Abraham Abdul Qadir Jilani Baptism Exorcism Islam and anti-Semitism Ali Fundamentalism Alawite Jizya Judaism Book of Mormon Mary, the mother of Jesus Religious Society of Friends Salah Predestination Sikhism Christianity Bilal ibn Ribah Ten Commandments Aisha Criticism of Islam Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Sufism Merit Islamic calendar Chosen people Hadith Trinity Islam as a political movement Eid ul-Fitr Status of religious freedom in Malaysia Muslim Al-Ghazali Jewish principles of faith Caliph Bah__'__ Faith Dhimmi Buddhism Sunni Islam Jerusalem Muslim ibn Aqeel Saint Intercession of saints Holy Spirit Creationism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Apostasy Wahhabism Khabbab ibn al-Aratt Twelvers Separation of church and state A Course In Miracles Atheism Angels in Islam Jesus United Submitters International Hijab Opus Dei Angel Messiah Pledge of Allegiance Plame affair
