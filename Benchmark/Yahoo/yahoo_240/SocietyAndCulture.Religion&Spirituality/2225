fellow muslims would you help me with this situation i live next door to a muslim elderly couple subhanallah they have been married for some years now they married at unfortunately after years of marrige the husband became legally blind but she took care of him till now all those years she couldn't work and they have no kids and are paid by the federal govenment but for the past weeks he has not eaten anything and has become physically and mentally ill she now says can't take care of him anymore because she's tired and sick herself and wants to send him to an elderly home without divorce she was asking me if she should do this i don't know what to say really what advise would you give how do you see this from an islamic point of view please star this it's very important jazakallah khair she has relatives sadly they refuse to help her or him they said they have their own problems bismillahi rahmani rahim in the name of allah the beneficent the merciful salaam alaikum wa rahmatullah it is so sad to hear of this situation it is a major sin that their relatives choose to ignore them someone must continue to counsel the family members to take care of them lest they be in the hellfire if you live in an area with a muslim community you should go there and speak to someone there might be someone there in charge of social work they may be able to offer direct help like a sister who can volunteer to go and help with daily needs or they might be able to coordinate social services i have a family member who is an invalid and her husband took care of her for many years he is old and feeble and not able to do so alhamdulillah we are able to help them but if there were no one to help him he would not be able to take care of her daily needs such as bathroom visits cleanliness and food and such she would be in serious danger if there were no one but him to help her despite his love for her and their long marriage in such a case where there is no family to take care of him i think she has to seek social services first of all if he very suddenly had a change of physical and mental condition he may have had a stroke or other serious issue and he needs to see a doctor immediately if he's in no immediate danger she can make an appointment to see if they can get in home care for him or see if he needs to go to a facility she is not abandoning him in this case i'm sure she really is sick and exhausted and she can't take care of his needs it will be a dangerous situation for both of them if nothing is done allah will reward her for taking care of him all this time she deserves to have some help and if family and the muslim community cannot or will not do it she should turn to the social services for help she could be doing him a favor if he is in need of care it is overwhelming to take care of a relative who is mentally not functioning well and he can actually be a danger to her if he is not in his right mind may allah bless you for your concern if you can make some phone calls for them that will be a great help fi aman allah nancy umm abdel hamid Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an John the Baptist Marriage Polygamy Divorce Muslim ibn Aqeel Women in Islam Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Fasting Sharia Aisha Hillary Rodham Clinton Talaq (Nikah) Involuntary commitment Rais massacre Eid ul-Fitr Mental Health Act 1983 Medicine Khabbab ibn al-Aratt Terri Schiavo Five Pillars of Islam Allah Domestic violence Nikah Mut'ah Eastern Orthodox Church Melanie Wilkes Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Status of religious freedom in Malaysia Salah Publicly funded medicine Osama bin Laden Religion and sexuality Bilal ibn Ribah Apostasy in Islam Isa Jizya Religion Apostasy Sexual orientation 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Mary, the mother of Jesus Hikikomori Islam Psychiatry Health insurance Psychology Homosexuality and Islam Love Religion in Hong Kong Abd al-Rahman ibn Sakhr Fathers' rights Muraqaba Islam and anti-Semitism Anorexia nervosa 613 mitzvot Plame affair Religious conversion Alcoholics Anonymous Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Predestination Dhimmi Qiyamah Clinical depression Traumatic brain injury National Health Service Muhammad Grief Women as imams Simone Weil Abdul Qadir Jilani Summa Theologiae George W.
