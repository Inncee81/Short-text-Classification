why can't christians except gays why can't we except each other for what is in the heart not what we are i am gay and i can't tell you how many times i have been hurt and scarred by some of the things people have said about me and this was before i faced up to the fact that i was gay i officially came out this year a few months ago i used to go to church but don't any more it has nothing to do with my faith in god i started having a lot of mental and physical issues i let those issues conflict with my faith and started lashing out at god thankfully that was a long time ago and i know that jesus christ is my lord and saviour and he died for our sins i have been teased and ridiculed my whole life for various reasons the way i look talk act walk you name it but what has hurt the most are the people who believe in god and love god faithfully with a devoted and loving heart as i do i wish people wouldn't be so cruel i have been told many times i will go to hell when i die and i will not meet jesus when i die this was before people knew i was gay mind you it has made me cry so much a lot i do accept people for who they are and i love them no matter which sin they commit i'm not perfect what right do i have to hate anyone for their sins i'm sorry you've been hurt by christians i know it's kind of a cliche thing to say but it's true christians are called to love the sinner and hate the sin and we've all sinned therefore no one has any right to judge anyone else take it to jesus don't look to mankind jesus has the answers i believe that with all my heart mind and soul he loves you and so do i Sin Salvation Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Original sin Eastern Orthodox Church Sola fide Rich Mullins Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Soul Charles Grandison Finney Theodicy Religion Resurrection of Jesus Indulgence Repentance Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Sabbath Book of Mormon John Howard Yoder John the Baptist Catholicism Summa Theologiae Ten Commandments Roman Catholic Church Merit Religious pluralism A Course In Miracles Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an God Urantia Mary, the mother of Jesus Criticisms of Christianity Christianity Infant baptism Jon Secada Christian views of Jesus Mortification of the flesh Sant Thakar Singh Ex-gay Predestination Emanuel Swedenborg Evil Hell Immortality Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Theosis Jesus Church of Christ Trinity Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Confession Catechism Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Purgatory Heaven Book of Isaiah Opus Dei Simone Weil Mormonism Prophet Apostles' Creed Abrahamic religion EastEnders Slow Train Coming Contrition The Amber Spyglass Calvinism Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Athanasian Creed Qiyamah George Fox Second Vatican Council Alan Campbell (pastor) John Wesley Noah Epistle to the Romans Baptist Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible John Wycliffe Nation of Islam Jehovah's Witnesses Legalism (theology) Angel Christian eschatology Homosexuality and Judaism Criticism of Mormonism Cliff Richard Religion and sexuality Religion and sexual orientation True Jesus Church
