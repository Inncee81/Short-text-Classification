is it immoral to have your own children when there are so many children that need to be adopted i mean kids are starving out there and dying because no one will adopt them yet i see a lot of people especially the religious that's why i'm asking on this forum that want to have their own kids instead there's the whole passing on the bloodline thing and i don't get it what's the difference with having your own kid personally i'm adopting what do you guys think is it immoral to purposely get pregnant and have your own child when there are others already on this planet that need homes and love i won't bash people that have their own kids already but is there any real reasoning for it and please don't try to sell me that myth that you can't love an adopted kid as much because you didn't carry him or her months fathers never carry the kid and they love their kid just as much similarly i know that it can be expensive to adopt but shouldn't you already have that money if you're planning on a kid yeah i forgot about the fertility thing i too think it's nuts to spend thousands of dollars on your own sperm and egg when you could change a life that's already here i never had a big family so i'll probably adopt no more than two kids it'll be many many years in the future is way young to have a kid i believe that it is not immoral morality involves what is right and wrong there is nothing wrong with having your own child yes adopting may be good but it doesn't follow that having a child is bad it also doesn't follow that if you have your own child you become incapable of helping other people maybe the right thing to do is to tackle the root of this problem some reasons why kids are abandoned by their parents are poverty and irresponsibility of parents i believe that if those problems are tackled in the right way the number of abandoned children may decrease i admire your decision of adopting kids instead of having your own that is a big sacrifice i also thought of that before and i am just yrs old and since i'm a male i know it's rare for a man not wanting to have his own child maybe because males crave sex more than females we have the right to decide for ourselves but i think that other people also have the right to choose for their own by the way nice question Abortion debate Theory of conduct Theodicy Birth control EastEnders The Fairly OddParents Humphrey Bogart Sexual orientation Social rule Rich Mullins Moral Politics Avenue Q Microeconomics Laura Schlessinger Marriage Morality Arguments for and against drug prohibition Friends Same-sex marriage Opus Dei Fathers' rights Sex and the City God Goodness and value theory The Apprentice 2 Utilitarianism Moral objectivism Kyle Broflovski The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie About a Boy Predestination Pitaten Alcoholics Anonymous Altruism Androgen insensitivity syndrome Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Ethics Childfree Transactional analysis Bat Lash Religion and sexuality Orgasm The Human Stain Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Capitalism Pregnancy Little Britain Evil School choice Transsexuality Shaggy dog story Sex-selective abortion and infanticide The Catcher in the Rye 2004 Republican National Convention Simone Weil W.
