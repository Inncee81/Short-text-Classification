being a witness for jesus and hurricane katrina victims can the experience be similar they are similar we have to hope people will take our word for what we have seen and heard yet with both eyewitnesses of what they experienced during that hurricane and the aftermath people do believe what they want to believe i have heard some say because someone used their fema card for porn then they all must have don't you think this could apply to christians as well some are telling the truth even though some are misusing the name of christ like misusing your fema card do you realize christians are just people like you who have the same bad day same car problems same bill they can't pay sometimes we just have one difference we are a witness to what jesus christ has done in our lives and we would like to testify actually there have been films made of jesus moving by his spirit in various healing meetings and such people just say i dont believe it' if they don't want to believe they just won't believe no matter what they see or hear it's the truth i can really relate to this example you have given i went through katrina and have heard all the abuse and it hurts but i have respect for christians and what they believe i am not a christian basher or a basher of anyone else for that matter so take care Michael D.
