christians have you ever had a spiritual experience while drunk or in an altered state did being that way make you feel guilty or make you feel like you really connected to god better im just so sorry i didnt get roger's approval i must be wrong in some way first let me say that i am a 'mystic catholic christian' so what i am going to tell you about may not seem like a 'spiritual experience' but to me it was i was at 'neighborhood party' and there were guests there who spoke mainly german and a 'tiny bit of english' so i was 'translating' for them in 'both directions' i was drunk and i slipped on a rock and hit the back of my head on the 'trailer hitch' on a boat parked in the driveway where we were holding the party after that i could not speak english the germans actually had to start translating for me i could 'understand' english but i couldn't speak it i went to the doctor the next day and he said i had a 'massive concussion' after that to this very day probably every time i 'got drunk' i could speak only german but one day on a bus in san francisco i saw a young man start to get off the bus at what i 'knew' was the wrong stop' and i told him in german that it was dangerous to get off the bus there and to get off when i did because i was going to golden gate park i had not a clue what his language was but he was a german and although he spoke fairly good english my 'rapid fire german' saved him we became friends and hung out a lot and sometimes he'd end up 'translating' for me these days i don't 'get drunk' enough to 'slip' into speaking only german but when i was just 'becoming a catholic' i 'confessed' to a priest about my 'past drinking' and told him that it was 'so bad' because i could only speak german when i got drunk he looked at me smiled and said 'and god gave you the gift of tongues i see i think that your 'drunken german' is penance enough for that sin and we went on to the next i had never really 'seen it as a gift from god' until that day but since i haven't gotten 'truly drunk' since then i guess i'll 'never know' until i can ask 'the big guy' himself Martin Luther Social rule Humphrey Bogart Shaggy dog story Baptism Protestantism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Kyle Broflovski Justification (theology) Opus Dei Sin City Holy Spirit God Sola fide Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pitaten Eastern Orthodox Church Confession Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Church of Christ Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Theory of conduct Catholic sacraments Mass (liturgy) Alcoholics Anonymous The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Divine grace RuneScape quests Roman Catholic Church Rich Mullins Good Morning, Vietnam John Howard Yoder Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology The Shining (film) Religion Repentance Indulgence Abrahamic religion Jesus Summa Theologiae Salvation Charismatic God and gender Time Out of Mind Ten Commandments Heaven EastEnders Avenue Q John Wycliffe Milton H.
