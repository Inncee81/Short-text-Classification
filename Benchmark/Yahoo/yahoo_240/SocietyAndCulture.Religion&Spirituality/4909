is there an afterlife i've always wondered this and i'd love to have some sort of answer like if you die do you become total nothingness or do you somehow live on in some sort of way are the people who are now dead still there or are they completely gone i know i've heard of ghost stories and spirit stories and whatever but i just want to somehow assure myself that the ones who are no longer here are still here somehow and that there really is life after death and if there is when you die too can you visit them i just want there to be hope to see the ones you lost again and some truth in an answer i know that probably many people wonder this but if you have any answers opinions or thoughts they'd be gladly appreciated d ghosts aks spirits are merely the souls of those who have passed over and you are in spirit as you are in life just no physical body and yes you can choose to come back and visit family you have free will over there as well spirits are all around us just most peole don't have the capabilities to see or experience them and the spirits we here about in hauntings and whatnot you notice are in towns and cities where huge tragedies have occurred aka lost unhappy souls who need and are seeking but recieving resolution but yeah they really are still there got a grandpa on the other side that you miss a lot or a parent or a sibling talk they can hear you and chances are good if you had a good relationship with them they'll come to check up on you every now and then Phaedo The Amber Spyglass Dead Like Me Scenes from a Memory Holy Spirit Ghost Afterlife Jewish eschatology Simone Weil Religion Undead Sola fide Innocence: Ghost in the Shell Animism Meaning of life Christian eschatology Church of Christ, Scientist Jon Secada Original sin Pitaten Force (Star Wars) Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Resurrection of Jesus Kain (Legacy of Kain) Out-of-body experience Heaven Human nature Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Sant Thakar Singh RuneScape quests The Lovely Bones Theodicy Rudolf Steiner Justification (theology) John Wesley Divine grace Paul Is Dead Human Immortality Charmed Alan Campbell (pastor) Hey Arnold!
