i'm in love with a man i had a one night stand with years ago how do i move forward this is a strange tale i met a boy in college and i fell madly in love with him from afar he was what i always sought after in a soulmate i studied him we'll call him philip like it was my major i inquired about him and i'd make friends with his friends just to get in good with him creepy i know one night he and i drank a little too much and we slept together for him i think it was just a one night stand for me it was like a spark i didn't know how to handle my emotions for him and the situation so i distanced myself he and i never really did speak again but i yearn for this man years later i am madly in love with him i'm in a relationship with another man but i cannot move on from the aforementioned in a perfect world or in my sick mind philip and i would be together but he is in a commited relationship and i am too and i don't want these feelings anymore what steps can i take to move forward in my love life this is just my opinion but it seems like you may be confusing the ideal him and the real him you might be in love with an ideal for some reason he represents you don't even know this man he barely knows you right love is something cultivated and worked on a true friendship lust is another ball game it is easy to distance yourself from your reality when you have these feelings for someone not in your reality maybe that is why you still carry a torch for him it will be hard to break this habit but that is just what this is a habit if you concentrate on reality on your life now your feelings might begin to fade One Tree Hill (TV series) Humphrey Bogart The Amber Spyglass Friends Friedrich Schleiermacher Love Knots Landing Jon Secada Shaggy dog story Simone Weil Macbeth Time Out of Mind A Course In Miracles W.I.T.C.H.
