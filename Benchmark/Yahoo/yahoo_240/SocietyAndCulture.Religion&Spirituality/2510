after collapse of soviet union are the west afraid to the islamic revolution yes they always afraid from the ultimate truth of islam that's why they propagate false impressions lies about islam so they can stop the growth of islam but somebody tell them that islam is the ultimate truth towards which religion common sense leads us common sense prophet muhammad peace be upon him said like true prophets of allah abraham moses jesus etc to believe in only one true god not like other fools who used to preach idols common sense prophet muhammad peace be upon him said believe in jesus and his revealed book original one which is lost and mosses and his revealed book original one which is lost and all revealed books and prophets otherwise u can not be a muslim if he is not the true prophet maaz allah then why he said that believe in them otherwise u will be sent to hell read eman e mufassil eman e mujamel testify common sense prophet muhammad peace be upon him never said that he is maaz allah god but strictly said that there is only one allah god and no one is like him if he is not the true prophet maaz allah then why he said that he is allah s last prophet not bragged about himself maaz allah as god as so many ppl did common sense prophet muhammad peace be upon him said like true prophets before him like abraham moses jesus about the judgement day common sense if u see prophet jesus peace be upon him in pictures made by non muslims he has same kind of beard like muhammad peace be upon him had muslims have and also mother marry dress in pictures made by non muslims is exactly same as muslim women do dress commone sense non muslims say that muhammad peace be upon him plagiarize the holy quran from the holy bible but this is not possible because muhammad peace be upon him was not educated then how he could do such a thing commone sense another reason that muhammad peace be upon him can t plagiarize from the holy quran from the holy bible is that the holy bible at the time of muhammad peace be upon him was not translated in arabic language then how he could plagiarize from it common sense non muslims claim that muhammad peace be upon him himself wrote the holy quran if so then why his name is only used in the holy quran only times jesus peace be upon him name times prophet moses peace be upon him name comes times in the holy quran if maaz allah muhammad peace be upon him wrote the holy quran then why not he used his name more than any other prophet common sense if muhammad peace be upon him maaz allah not a prophet then why he used to pray times a day and conveyed the message of allah that this an order from allah in islam u can t pray without performing ablution why muhammad peace be upon him used to pray what for for who common sense if muhammad peace be upon him maaz allah not a prophet then why he himself performed hajj which is the toughest of the pillars of islam and said that it is farz imperative for all muslims who have the money to afford it for who what for common sense why prophet muhammad peace be upon him strictly ordered not to do sajda before any body but allah if he is not maaz allah not a prophet then why he said so why not he said do sajda to me as well common sense if muhammad peace be upon him maaz allah not a prophet then why he used to fast for the whole month of ramadan for to days without a break why he most of the time used to pray in taraweeh long prayer and other prayers after the fast for who for what common sense if muhammad peace be upon him maaz allah not a prophet then why he used to give zakaat money to poor and said that this is god s order and every one who can afford should give zakaat fitraa is also a god s order and it is also giving money to poor ppl why he used to do that himself and said that this is imperative for all muslims who can afford zakaat fitraa for what and for who common sense if muhammad peace be upon him maaz allah not a prophet then why he used to give khairat to poor ppl which is again giving money to needy ppl to gain reward from allah common sense even abraham pbuh moses pbuh used to dress like muslims cover head beard and thoroughly covered body common sense there is a quranic verse named after mother of jesus pbuh the name of the verse is surrah e mayam if prophet muhammad pbuh is maaz allah not a prophet then why not he named the quranic verse name after his mother allah says that he choose mary above the women of all nations why not muhammad pbuh s mother if he maaz allah wrote the holy quran himself al e imran the family of 'imran the house of 'imran behold the angel said 'god has chosen you and purified you and has chosen you above the women of all nations o mary god gives you the good news of a word from him whose name shall be messiah jesus son of mary honored in this world and the hereafter and one of those brought near to god common sense if muhammad pbuh is not a true prophet then why he never used alcohol and made it strictly prohibited which is always use by humans for fake enjoyments for whom what for why common sense muhammad pbuh went to makkah to perform hajj from medina with all of his followers but with no arms when the ppl of makkah were to hostile against muslims for whom what for why i could have write tons of tons more common senses but if i do this then what will be left for u to think about
