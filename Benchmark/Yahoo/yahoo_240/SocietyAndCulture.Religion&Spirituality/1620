why do some say separation from god is evil or a wrong path when in reality it merely results from differing reasoning and beliefs or non beliefs should we abolish freedom of religion to end this foolishness and evilness i do not think it would be right to abolish freedom of religion that would lead to tyranny by the majority and in this country i would not be allowed to hold beliefs as an atheist i am willing to respect and tolerate others so long as their religion is not forced onto me using our government separation from god is considered evil by those who believe in a god because they feel as though a person is rejecting a vital spiritual connection or ignoring life's wonders only most of these folks do not understand that our views are based on reason that there is no evidence for a god but harm in that collective believe and that being an atheist lead to a better appreciation of life no afterlife crutch Atheism Religion Evil Supernatural Theodicy Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity God Separation of church and state Afterlife Creationism Judaism Soul Heaven Jewish principles of faith Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Religious pluralism Simone Weil Monotheism Problem of Hell Democracy Ten Commandments Shinto Human nature Theology Moral objectivism Animism Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses European Convention on Human Rights Idolatry Christianity Sin Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Richard Dawkins Abrahamic religion Christian-Jewish reconciliation Salvation Pashtunwali Unitarian Universalism Witchcraft Socrates Existence of God Baptist Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Maimonides Social justice Objectivist philosophy Apostasy Reincarnation Spirituality Charles Darwin's views on religion Agnosticism Jewish views of religious pluralism Evolutionary creationism Pascal's Wager Jehovah's Witnesses Fundamentalism Deism Karma John Howard Yoder Buddhism Christian eschatology Separation of church and state in the United States S__ren Kierkegaard Messianic Judaism Trinity Human Scientology beliefs and practices Freethought Abington School District v.
