evoultion i am years old okay lets look at the feather a truly marvel of desgin with a downard thrust of its wings a seagull launches itself skyward once aloft it wheels and turns rising effortlessly on the wind making only tiny adjustments to the angle of its wings and tail the bird hangs nearly motionless in the air what enables it to perform thoose functions with such grace and perfection to a great extent its feathers birds are the only animals today that grow feathers most birds have diffrent kinds of feathers the most visble are the overlapping contour feathers which give birs their smooth aerodynamic shape contour feathers include the wing and tail feathers which are vital to flight a humming bird may have fewer than such feathers and a swan more than okay let me get to the point the fact of the a matter is feathers are a little to perfect thats the problem notes yale university's manual of orinthology feathers give no indication that they ever continued they ever needed improvent in fact the earliest know fossil feather is so mordern looking as to be indistinguisahble from feathers of birds flying today yet evoultionary theory teaches taht feathers must be the result of gradual cumlative change in in earlier skin outgrowths continued more over feathers could not have evolved without some plausible adaptive vaule in all of the intermediate steps to put it simply even in theory evoultion could not produce a feather unless each step on a long series of random inheritable changes in feather strucure significantly improved the animal's chances of survival even many evoultionists find it a stretch of the imagination that something as complex and functionally perfect as a feather could arise in such a way further if feeathers developed progerssively over long period of time the fossil record should cantain intermediate forms but none have been found only traces of fully formed feathers oh and that dino bird fossil was forged lol yeah wayne your right some adults on here are funny lol police dude or whatever or name is are you really that stupid rethink your answer then challenge me ahh again with the age thing its funny when adults are stupified thats all they can say okay paul im going to answer your little comment with this forged evidence some fossil 'evidence' that was once loudly hailed as proof that birds evolved from other creatures has since been shown to have been forged ng national geograhic magzine featured an article about a fossil of a feathered creature with a tail like a dino's the magazine delcared the creature to be a true misson link in the complex chain that connects dinos to birds the 'fossil' however turned out to be a forgery a composite of the fossils of two diffent animals in fact no such missing link has ever been found good question they can't answer your question so they pretend there is no question i think your question is quite clear Dinosaur Archaeopteryx Philosophy of language Evidence of evolution Bird The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Intelligent design Evolution Feathered dinosaurs Species Lebesgue integration Eye Pterosaur Origin of life Stall (flight) Human Creationism Feather Irreducible complexity Thermoregulation Tyrannosaurus rex Glider Renewable energy Equine conformation Space Shuttle program Morse theory Scientific method Bird flight Fermi paradox B-47 Stratojet Expert system Helicopter Theodicy Falsifiability Determinism Macroevolution Bayesian inference Biblical inerrancy Flood geology Marching band Heinkel He 100 Capercaillie Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Normal distribution Radio controlled airplane Second language acquisition Transitional fossil Color Wind turbine Microeconomics Jet engine Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Inception of Darwin's theory Meaning of life Dog Albatross Have I Got News For You Paragliding Exact solutions in general relativity CPU design Gliding Infant baptism Teleological argument Violin Industrial Revolution Animal Creation science Fossil DNA SR-71 Blackbird Ontological argument Puberty Energy development Timpani Skateboarding trick CPU cache Hash table Reincarnation Law of value Charles Darwin Evolutionism Peafowl Summa Theologiae Young Earth creationism Biology Age of the Earth C programming language Pok__mon Abilities Missingno.
