what happens when you say the phrase that converts you to islam but you really didn't mean to say it i said it to myself almost a year ago but i didn't mean to say it although i think islam is a good religion i have no interest to convert to it at least not yet i am actually glad to say that i'm a proud christian the phrase i am talking about is called the shahada and it goes like this there is no god but allah and muhammad is his prophet when i said proud i didn't mean it as pride i meant it as happy with my religion i hope by doing this i haven't offended allah or anyone of the islam faith if i have i very sorry bismillahi rahmani rahim in the name of allah the beneficent the merciful hello well i'm glad you are well disposed towards islam and i do hope you continue to learn about it you would be most welcome as a muslim inshallah if allah wills obviously no matter what you say there has to be intent behind your words converting to islam is based on belief and if there is no belief there is no conversion there is no compulsion in islam and even if someone were forced to say the shahadah it would not be valid allah knows what is in your heart and he knows how you feel about him may allah guide you to that which is best in this world and the next ameen fi aman allah nancy umm abdel hamid Allah Islam Shahadah Aqidah Abrahamic religion Predestination Muhammad Isa Sharia Apostasy in Islam Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Qiyamah Apostasy 99 Names of God Religion Sin Bilal ibn Ribah Islam and anti-Semitism Prophets of Islam Gospel of Barnabas Prophet John the Baptist Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Chosen people Tawh__d Islam and Judaism Salvation Women in Islam Historical persecution by Muslims Al-Ghazali Religious pluralism Abraham Islam as a political movement Ali Taqiyya Muslim ibn Aqeel Alawite Atheism Basmala Criticism of Islam Jizya Intercession of saints Abdul Qadir Jilani Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Holy Spirit Devil Status of religious freedom in Malaysia Magic (paranormal) Hijab Khabbab ibn al-Aratt Creed Shi'a Islam Coptic Christianity Divisions of Islam Jihad History of Islam Exorcism Muhammad Ahmad Battle of Bassorah Ascetical theology Fasting Ahmadiyya Muslim Community Idolatry Angel Liberal movements within Islam Abdullah ibn Abbas Yusuf al-Qaradawi Saint Sunnah Ethics in religion Khadijah bint Khuwaylid Love Noah Eschatology Sufism Origin belief Adnan Oktar Evolutionary creationism Muslim Adhan Kafir Ramadan Salman the Persian Intercession Inclusivism Jerusalem Islamic philosophy
