evolution vs intelligent design in public schools why do we teach either one people on both sides of the issue can't agree among themselves the age of the earth universe why can't we teach the sciences without any reference to origins and deal strictly with what we actually know to be verifiable at this point in time i think the issue should be decided by parents and what they want to teach their kids and let the schools only teach the facts not the theories btw i said facts that are verifiable with we know at this point in time that includes gravity you dolts and i didn't say which one i favor i just think it is wrong to push evolution as heavily as it gets pushed it is taught it is tested if you get the answer wrong you fail i think that along those lines i d should have equal time in the classroom it gets taught it is tested if you get the answer wrong you fail my point is that science in the public schools is very one sided i don't think teaching kids something you cannot prove is wise or responsible to address the person below me one thing they teach in schools is embyo's have gill slits this was exposed years ago as a lie and a made up fabrication first there is no evidence for spontaneous generation the belief that life evolved from non life contradicts both the cell theory and the law of biogenesis second there is no evidence for the evolutionary assumption that the universe is eternal evolutionists must accept this by faith religion evolutionists may assume that the universe evolved into existence from nothing but this assumption goes against all available scientific evidence stupidity third there is no evidence that intelligence could come from non intelligence intelligence shows evidence of design it could not have been produced by chance fourth no evidence has been found proving that multi celled animals came from single celled animals no proof the full genetic code in the human embryo is present at conception no evololution possible there fifth there is no evidence for the evolution of animals with backbones from animals without backbones though there should be multitudes of transitional forms between the two groups none have been found none sixth there is no evidence for the common ancestry of fish reptiles birds and mammals common anatomy could point to a common designer it does not necessarily point to common ancestry Intelligent design Evolutionism Evolution Creation-evolution controversy Teach the Controversy Intelligent design movement Creation and evolution in public education Creation science Religion Science Biology Irreducible complexity Evidence of evolution History of creationism Human Meaning of life Francis Crick Origin belief Evolutionary creationism Theory Abortion debate Determinism Species Atheism Supernatural God Fine-tuned universe Philosophy of science Mammal Recapitulation theory Bah__'__ Faith and Science Contract History of evolutionary thought Ethics Reincarnation Kitzmiller v.
