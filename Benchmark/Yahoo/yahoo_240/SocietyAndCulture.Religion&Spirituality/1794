do you believe that jesus is the one true almighty god manifested in flesh not second person many believe god to bethree seperate persons but the truth is god is one god manifested in three ways not three persons father in creation son in redemption and holy spirit in regeneration their is only one god who is our father paul also points this out cor this one god is known as the father not father son and holy ghost this one god has a holy spirit and it is also god but its that same god who is the father this one god who is our father manifested himself in flesh tim it was not a second person of the godhead that manifested himself it was god in general this is why jesus said the father is in me john when you see me you see my father also john i and my father are one john jesus is god because god is in him cor not god the son but god in general jesus and paul claimed that the father is the only god john cor what about the holy spirit and jesus god who is the father manifested himself in flesh this is why jesus says the father is the only god the holy spirit is also this one god who is known to be our father they are not seperate persons but one this is one god manifested in three ways not three seperate persons if you disagree please don't give me matthew john gen hebrews etc i already know all of these and can explain all these to you they don't mean a trinity of persons but manifestations month ago jesus is the son of god the son pertains to flesh because he was born of a woman gala also the bible says the son died god the son can't die if he was a second person of the godhead jesus is not just a man he is fully the one true god and fully man month ago matthew also doesn't represent three person present the dove was for john to see and believe that jesus was the messiah the voice was for the people to believe this was not three persons god is omnipresent and can be in jesus and heaven at the same time jesus is not just a man also like jw's and muslims claim i think it's a very hard concept for lots of people to truely understand i asked a similar question and i chose this as best answer here's an explanation by robert green ingersoll the new testament informs us that christ was the son of joseph and the son of god and that mary was his mother how is it established that christ was the son of god it is said that joseph was told so in a dream by an angel but joseph wrote nothing on that subject said nothing so far as we know mary wrote nothing said nothing the angel that appeared to joseph or that informed joseph said nothing to anybody else neither has the holy ghost the supposed father ever said or written one word we have received no information from the parties who could have known anything on the subject we get all our facts from those who could not have known how is it possible to prove that the holy ghost was the father of christ who knows that such a being as the holy ghost ever existed how was it possible for mary to know anything about the holy ghost how could joseph know that he had been visited by an angel in a dream could he know that the visitor was an angel it all occurred in a dream and poor joseph was asleep what is the testimony of one who was asleep worth all the evidence we have is that somebody who wrote part of the new testament says that the holy ghost was the father of christ and that somebody who wrote another part of the new testament says that joseph was the father of christ matthew and luke give the genealogy and both show that christ was the son of joseph the incarnation has to be believed without evidence there is no way in which it can be established it is beyond the reach and realm of reason it defies observation and is independent of experience it is claimed not only that christ was the son of god but that he was and is god was he god before he was born was the body of mary the dwelling place of god what evidence have we that christ was god somebody has said that christ claimed that god was his father and that he and his father were one we do not know who this somebody was and do not know from whom he received his information somebody who was inspired has said that christ was of the blood of david through his father joseph this is all the evidence we have can we believe that god the creator of the universe learned the trade of a carpenter in palestine that he gathered a few disciples about him and after teaching for about three years suffered himself to be crucified by a few ignorant and pious jews christ according to the faith is the second person in the trinity the father being the first and the holy ghost the third each of these three persons is god christ is his own father and his own son the holy ghost is neither father nor son but both the son was begotten by the father but existed before he was begotten just the same before as after christ is just as old as his father and the father is just as young as his son the holy ghost proceeded from the father and son but was equal to the father and son before he proceeded that is to say before he existed but he is of the same age of the other two so it is declared that the father is god and the son god and the holy ghost god and that these three gods make one god according to the celestial multiplication table once one is three and three times one is one and according to heavenly subtraction if we take two from three three are left the addition is equally peculiar if we add two to one we have but one each one is equal to himself and the other two nothing ever was nothing ever can be more perfectly idiotic and absurd than the dogma of the trinity how is it possible to prove the existence of the trinity is it possible for a human being who has been born but once to comprehend or to imagine the existence of three beings each of whom is equal to the three think of one of these beings as the father of one and think of that one as half human and all god and think of the third as having proceeded from the other two and then think of all three as one think that after the father begot the son the father was still alone and after the holy ghost proceeded from the father and the son the father was still alone because there never was and never will be but one god at this point absurdity having reached its limit nothing more can be said except let us pray
