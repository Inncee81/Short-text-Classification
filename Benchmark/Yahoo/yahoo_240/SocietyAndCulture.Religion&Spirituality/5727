christians what is one of your favorite scriptures on wisdom and why also how would you describe the difference between earthly temporal worldly wisdom and divine wisdom to start out earthly wisdom seems to be about observable consequenses trial and error etc and divine wisdom is much deeper also with eternal perspective empathy is talked about a lot these days in psycology as well there is also a scriptural understanding about how there is a moral law written in the hearts of mankind yet their concious becomes seared any insights about that mat but seek first his kingdom and his righteousness and all these things will be given to you as well this verse is the most important as it is the first step to gaining god knowledge and human knowledge i am also enclosing the doctrine on scar tissue of the soul to address the seared hearts aspect for u enjoy john doctrine of scar tissue of the soul a definition and description scar tissue of the soul also known as hardness of the heart is the result of prolonged residence and function inside the cosmic system there is generally a logical retrogression in which blackout of the soul precedes scar tissue of the soul or is coterminous with it what blackout of the soul is to the left lobe of the soul scar tissue of the soul is to the right lobe blackout of the soul is the believer saying no to doctrine which opens a vacuum in the left lobe that draws in false concepts there is a pseudo function of gap in the cosmic system scar tissue of the soul is this false information being processed in the believer's frame of reference his norms and standards vocabulary center memory center and is the basis for application to life negative volition expressed by gate two of cosmic one or gate one of cosmic two creates the vacuum in the left lobe called mataiotes blackout of the soul then spreads like a disease and results in the right lobe malady of scar tissue of the soul scar tissue of the soul has a detrimental effect on every part of the soul the cosmic system always stimulates the emotion a scar tissue of the soul results in loss of perceptive ability in the frame of reference the believer with scar tissue of the soul can listen to doctrine every day and still react and remain in ignorance b in his memory center he forgets what doctrine he learned and cannot apply doctrine his momentum is stopped c in his vocabulary storage all technical language related to perception and application is gradually destroyed d in his categorical storage scar tissue of the soul destroys categorical doctrinal understanding such as the rationales used in the second stage of the faith rest drill e scar tissue of the soul destroys the norms and standards related to the three categories of truth thus wiping out the conscience loss of norms and standards motivates the believer to function under the plan of satan f in the launching pad scar tissue of the soul destroys all application of doctrine and the modus operandi of impersonal love scar tissue of the soul is a guarantee of the destruction of true love personal love cannot survive without the integrity of impersonal love scar tissue of the soul is that spiritual malady of involvement in the cosmic system resulting in total loss of momentum and eventuating in the most awful discipline from god the greek word for hardness of the heart is found in mk and eph the noun is porosis and the verb is poroo which means to petrify or to harden b relation between blackout of the soul and scar tissue of the soul is found in eph therefore i communicate this and because of the lord i insist that you no longer walk as gentiles walk in the vacuum of their mind having become darkened in their way of thinking blackout of the soul having been alienated from the life of god because of the ignorance that is in them because of the scar tissue of their right lobe c the divine mandate regarding scar tissue jn stop loving the cosmic system or anything in the cosmic system if anyone keeps loving the cosmic system the love from the father is not in him we only obey this command by residence and function inside the divine dynasphere d scar tissue of the soul is the enemy of evangelism pet the unbeliever functions inside the cosmic system and hears the gospel but eventually he rejects the gospel like the dog returning to his vomit this phenomena is the function of scar tissue of the soul by the convicting ministry of the holy spirit the unbeliever is pulled out of the cosmic system for the moment they hear the gospel outside of the cosmic system if they say no they go back into the cosmic system and the latter stage is worse than the first scar tissue of the soul is what motivated judas mt after so many chances at salvation he finally went to the ultimate in arrogance suicide the scar tissue of the soul built up in his soul until he expressed it in maximum arrogance blackout of the soul and scar tissue of the soul combine to reject all forms of truth vomit here includes socialism communism the welfare state redistribution of wealth social equality and being saved by anything except faith in christ jn he has blinded their eyes blackout of the soul he has hardened their right lobe scar tissue of the soul lest they should see with their eyes and perceive by means of their right lobe and receive conversion and i restore them israel as a client nation thes and with all deception of maladjustment rejection of jesus christ for those who perish because they did not receive the love of the truth so as to be saved and for this reason god sends them a deluding influence blackout of the soul scar tissue of the soul so that they might believe a lie in order that they might all be condemned who do not believe the truth but take pleasure in unrighteousness e scar tissue of the soul does not hinder salvation this is illustrated by nebuchadnezzar he was an unbeliever in the cosmic system and a genius he became psychotic in the cosmic system revolution was the shock which removed him from the cosmic system it took him seven years to recover the ability to think dan scar tissue of the soul and arrogance caused him to be deposed of his throne he became a believer and was restored to his throne rom but because of your scar tissue of the soul and unrepentant right lobe you store up and accumulate wrath for yourself against the day of wrath even the manifestation of he just judgment of god nebuchadnezzar was positive at god consciousness which was the key to overcoming scar tissue of the soul for salvation f a synonym for scar tissue of the soul in the old testament is hardness of neck it emphasizes lack of enforced and genuine humility it emphasizes rejection of authority cor neh jer g scar tissue of the soul means discipline loss of blessing and for some believers the sin unto death the exodus generation a ps do not harden your right lobes as at meribah miracles are unimpressive to the person with scar tissue of the soul b ex the people complained against moses because of lack of water they ignored all the logistical grace provided for them those with scar tissue of the soul always distort any manifestation of or blessing from god into some form of the lie c scar tissue of the soul doesn't respond to grace only to discipline d num their scar tissue of the soul caused them to weep all night they only stopped when they heard their discipline that they would not go into the land e num is another revolution by this generation f cor most of that generation died the sin unto death failure of the last king of israel zedekiah chr and he did evil in the sight of the lord he did not humble himself before the authority of jeremiah the prophet who spoke for the lord he also revolted against king nebuchadnezzar who make him promise in the name of god to be loyal but he stiffened his neck and hardened his heart against the lord god of israel the result was the administration of the fifth cycle of discipline to the jews in bc zedekiah was blinded put in chains and marched to babylon ezek was thus fulfilled pharaoh thutmose iii rom ex a rom i have caused you to continue in history in order that i might demonstrate my power by means of you and in order that my person might be proclaimed throughout the entire earth b pharaoh represented all the power of human rulership but god demonstrated this did not even compare to his own power this evangelized the entire world josh tells us that rahab the prostitute was converted through the hardness of pharaoh's heart pharaoh set the world record for scar tissue of the soul human resistance to the divine will always reveals the power of god rom c in the first five plagues pharaoh hardened his own heart ex after these god permitted him to live for the next five plagues pharaoh had many opportunities to change his mind ex d he said no to god five times a world's record for scar tissue of the soul he should have died earlier after the first five plagues on egypt but god extended his life for five more plagues e when scripture says that god hardened his heart it means that god let him live to express his scar tissue of the soul far beyond anyone else had ever done in the past ex says that the last five plagues would include intense anguish to the soul f a person can hear and see the truth through miracles but because of scar tissue of the soul it makes no impression the believer in the cosmic system is not impressed with miracles he is only impressed with the lie g god didn't coerce pharaoh's volition he was a free agent his life was extended by divine decree god uses the wrath of man to praise him pharaoh even acknowledged that he had sinned he faced the reality because of the pressure but this did not save him h the allegation of supralapsarianism must be rejected god did not create evil in pharaoh but he made his own evil through his volition god used pharaoh's evil to evangelize the world i the divine plan in hardening pharaoh's heart was threefold liberation of the jews from slavery in order to form a client nation to god evangelization of egypt ex evangelization of the world ex j paul compares the jews of the first advent and church age with pharaoh to demonstrate that their negative volition and hardness of heart at the time of our lord broke pharaoh's record rom religious reversionism is locked in religious degeneracy this occurs through rejection of christ as savior resulting in implosion explosion and reversion blackout of the soul plus scar tissue of the soul is reverse process reversionism which equals religious degeneracy religious degeneracy is always persecuted by political historical degeneracy whenever the jews break pharaoh's record for scar tissue of the soul through rejection of christ as savior a holocaust results rom the jews were seeking the fulfillment of the unconditional covenant political deliverance from rome but were not seeking salvation they wanted the crown without the cross the kingdom of god without faith in christ compassion is the only christian attitude toward jewish scar tissue of the soul the unbelieving jews have their final holocaust at the second advent the baptism of fire the jewish unbeliever has ritual without reality therefore he cannot see the importance of the cross before the crown k the world's record for scar tissue of the soul is held by the jews who reject jesus christ as savior isa be shocked be amazed blind yourselves blackout of the soul and be blind they are drunk but not with wine holocaust judgments against israel they stagger but not from strong drink for the lord has poured over you a life of deep sleep scar tissue of the soul regarding the prophets he has shut your eyes regarding the seers he has covered your head scar tissue of the soul therefore the entire vision first advent shall be to you like words of a closed book sealed scroll which when they give it to someone who can read saying please read this ' he will say i cannot for it closed ' i see the words but i don't understand then the book will be given to the one who is illiterate saying please read this ' but he will reply i cannot read it ' the prophet is literate and perhaps a believer the seer is illiterate and perhaps an unbeliever then the lord said because this people draw near with their month and honor me with their lips ritual the shema but they remove their hearts far from me furthermore their reverence for me consists of traditions learned by memorizing them their worship of me is made up of rules taught only by men therefore behold i will once again deal graciously with this people wondrously marvelous second advent but in the meantime the wisdom of their wise men shall perish and the intelligence of their intellectuals shall vanish shutting the eyes is a synonym for negative volition to doctrine and a willingness to listen to false doctrine covering the head is a reference to scar tissue of the soul the jews drew near to god with their mouths by saying the shema but the words are meaningless to them ritual has no meaning apart from understanding of doctrine removing their heart far from me is scar tissue of the soul scar tissue of the soul worships god by traditions and rules learned from men and passed on to each generation scar tissue of the soul never has a historical future blackout of the soul is the beginning of religious degeneracy scar tissue of the soul is the perpetuation of religious degeneracy
