christians biblical definitions see details i have a question about the biblical definitions regarding lust and covet or coveting ok here are the websters dictionary definitions lust intense longing for possession or enjoyment passionate or lewd desire covet long for desire envously now my question is at what point does a desire become lust or coveting in this case i'm not talking about sexual desire but just a general desire the way i see it we really can't possess anything god owns possesses all things he puts various things in our lives as he chooses but it's all his anyway i also have no problem with people having things in general so i'm not sure about envy but aside from that i can't say i don't desire things including god himself but also other things i know nothing is more important than god but still i wonder if there's a point that desire itself could turn into one of those or some other sin for those who said if it causes one to sin that sounds ok but jesus said if you lust after a woman you have already committed adultery and if you hate your brother you have already murdered so it has to be somewhere in the thought and before the action the th commandment according to exodus states thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife nor his manservent nor his maidserveny nor his ox nor his ass nor anything that is thy neighbor's god is a generous god and gives to all so we are to be satisfied with what he gives us ibelieve he gives us what he can trust us with that being said we are a sinful people and millions of people have things god didn't intend them to have that's their choice what do you chose t Matthew 5 Original sin Love Mary, the mother of Jesus Virtue Sexuality in Christian demonology Sin Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Homosexuality and Christianity John Howard Yoder Salvation Criticisms of Christianity Theodicy Van Orden v.
