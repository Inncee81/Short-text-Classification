question for those who are pro choice if a pregnant woman is murdered is the criminal guilty of one or two murders if the mother were to survive but not the life inside should the criminal be charged with murder of the unborn if a pregnant woman is murdered i feel that two murders have been committed because the mother chose to carry her pregnancy she didn't terminate it this was done by outside forces same reasoning for an assault on the mother that results in the death of the fetus a murder has been committed because the mother chose to carry her pregnancy an abortion is not murder because it is the woman's body and it is her choice to do with it as she sees fit Abortion debate Abortion Pregnancy Roe v.
