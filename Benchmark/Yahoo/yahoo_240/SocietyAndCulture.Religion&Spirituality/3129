why do muslims use the word allah rather than god while speaking or writing in english i know the literal translation of god in arabic is allah but why do muslims use allah rather than god while speaking or writing in english it just gives us non muslims the impression that you have a different god it is very good question even christians are unaware that allah is the muslim god though it means only god in arabic if you look at the dictionary it says that muslim god allah is not god which is triune god like father son and holy spirit so it is better for us christians not to use that word to them we should specifically say jesus to them as they are specific in using allah in their talk God Allah Mary, the mother of Jesus Isa Qur'an Prophets of Islam Abrahamic religion Islam Holy Spirit Sharia Predestination Salvation Trinity Muhammad Abraham Tetragrammaton Saint Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Names and titles of Jesus Idolatry Arab Fundamentalism Christianity Qiyamah Criticism of Islam Jesus Islam and Judaism Religious perspectives on Jesus God and gender Exorcism Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Jizya Chosen people Religious pluralism Coptic Christianity Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Names of God in Judaism Christ Islam and anti-Semitism Nation of Islam Hell Sin Magic (paranormal) Blasphemy New Testament Angels in Islam Tawh__d Satan Christian Angel Religion Muslim Creed Creationism Devil Nicene Creed Gospel of Barnabas Women in Islam Origin belief Jihad Athanasian Creed Kafir Basmala Nontrinitarianism Five Pillars of Islam Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Demon Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Religious conversion Justification (theology) Arabic alphabet Fasting Ten Commandments Arianism Jerusalem Alawite Filioque clause Moses Sabbath Evolutionary creationism Apostles' Creed Apostasy in Islam Book of Mormon Binitarianism Ahmadiyya Muslim Community Book of Daniel Coptic language Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah
