do you think there is a correlation between growing up with sesame street and star trek and being an atheist if so could we name this the roddenberry effect i've just noticed that whenever someone asks a question about star trek or sesame street it's mostly atheists that respond not entirely but largely and get the reference is it coincidence solly i'm not suggesting that before star trek and sesame street there was no atheism i'm asking if those shows can help bring about atheism in a person i think you kind of missed my point entirely especially since this was meant mostly as a fun question based off an observation i had soley on this board sisterzeal i don't see how watching sesame street and star trek equates believing in a higher power or emotional appeal i'm suggesting that if you grow up learning from those shows you might be more inclined to think rationally john b yes science will do it sir it just so happens that both of these shows contain a heck of a lot of science hypnopope is probably right though it's probably not statistically relevant but it's still an interesting observation i believe you have found a logical conclusion both series taught us to be rational and that has to lead away from superstitions Atheism Star Trek Strong atheism Existence of God Religion Meaning of life David Hume Sesame Street Scientific method Star Trek: Enterprise Supernatural Gene Roddenberry Starfleet ranks and insignia Vulcan (Star Trek) Logic Theodicy Deism Creationism Creation-evolution controversy Infinity Soul Teleportation Antony Flew Causality Science fiction on television Epistemology Falsifiability Warp drive History of creationism Second language acquisition Avenue Q Nerd Agnosticism Nontheism Star Trek: The Motion Picture The relationship between religion and science Logical fallacy Francis Crick Richard Dawkins Artificial consciousness Andromeda (TV series) Autism Time travel Superstition Star Trek: The Original Series Objectivist philosophy Star Trek, other storylines Human Fermi paradox Randomness Star Trek: The Next Generation Fallacy Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Intelligence quotient Star Trek: First Contact Sabbath Trekkie GED Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country Mr. Spock God Social sciences Black hole Christopher Marlowe Freethought Unidentified flying object Determinism Social psychology Isaac Newton Monopsony Philosophy of language Appeal Borg Intelligent design Mathematics Deconstruction Alcoholics Anonymous Statistics Lost in Space Bertrand Russell Fundamentalism Simone Weil Transcendental argument for the existence of God Patriotism A Course In Miracles Galileo Galilei Star Trek: Voyager Leonard McCoy Paradox Franz Boas Theology Evolutionary creationism Bayesian inference Data (Star Trek) Milton H.
