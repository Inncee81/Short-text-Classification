why does islam draw you closer to god then christianity any and all religions are more about what its adherents put into it than anything else most islamic nations have only been allowed to partake in a limited degree to the economic prosperity that most of the planet has had for years this has resulted in the appearance of gross materialism in european commonwealth and american peoples to the point they have rejected the pursuit of god in pursuit of material pleasure especially the men but even now it is prevalent among women whereas in islamic nations the majority of the people are kept down by the ruling class most of whom only pretend to care about islam cf the wearing of gold jewelry silk by men and alcohol usage which is haram the common citizen has nothing in this life and so hopes for the hereafter and thus the extreme devotion but at one time christianity esp in america was a powerful belief and many people were convicted in it consider the preaching of jonathan edwards geo whitefield john wesley etc the devotion in most cases is to religion not god just because someone is a christian they may never come to a knowledge of god because they are caught up in religion bands feel good worship services etc Religion Islam Fasting Nation of Islam Fundamentalism Christianity John Wesley Church of Christ George Fox Judaism Alchemy Christian Identity Methodism Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Religious pluralism Sermon Hindu Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Calvinism Evangelicalism Separation of church and state God Baptism Trinity Jew Religious conversion Status of religious freedom in Malaysia John the Baptist Religion and sexuality Moses Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Rastafari movement Patriotism Zoroastrianism Sharia Religion in Israel Theology Criticism of Islam Roman Catholic Church History of Christianity Iglesia ni Cristo Yusuf al-Qaradawi Prophets of Islam Jehovah's Witnesses Origin belief Chosen people Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Religion in China Evil Brahmanism Angel Creationism History of Greek and Roman Egypt Urantia Trimurti Clothing Sabbath Marriage Socrates Prayer Hinduism Historicity of Jesus Gnosticism Leviathan (book) Divine grace Freedom of religion Eucharist Paul of Tarsus Religion in Japan Religious Society of Friends End times Islam in Bangladesh Status of religious freedom in Iran Monotheism History of Islam Cult Divisions of Islam Satanism Holiness movement Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Idolatry Legalism (theology) Saint Chinese in Singapore Baptist Ramakrishna Culture of the United States Judeo-Christian Magic (paranormal) Jesus Witch-hunt United Methodist Church Pacifism
