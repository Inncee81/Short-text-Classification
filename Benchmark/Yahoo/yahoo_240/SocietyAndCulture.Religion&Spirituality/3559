do you think heaven is a planet do you think it is as the bible discribes it do you think millions of virgins will be there do you think it is all fantasy i choose to believe it is as the bible discribes it yall i do know about the virgins are you sure you are reading the christian bible as opposed to the koran let me tell you what the christian bible says about heaven heaven will be out of this world this world is under a curse the environment is under a curse in the millenium when christ rules there will be no earthquakes hurricanes tital waves tornadoes the animals are under a curse in the millenium the lion and the lamb will lie down together today the lion will eat the lamb our bodies are under a curse they are subject to the law of entropy they get old and weak and sick and eventually die we also have an evil nature inside of us this nature is responsible for depression much of our fear and much of our anger and bitterness for those who get to heaven the curse will be lifted we will get new bodies resurrection bodies similar to christs' body after he rose from the dead they will be supernatural bodies and yet also physical bodies they will no longer have an evil nature so all the anger bitterness depression and fear will be gone revelations says and he shall wipe away every tear from their eyes and there shall no longer be any death there shall no longer be any mourning or crying or pain the first things have passed away most people think of heaven in terms of a physical shangri la and so it is but even more important heaven will be a psychological shangri la think of all the fear anxiety and even depression that you experience everyday over events you ll have to deal with that day or in the near future or whenever think of the problems you re dealing with on your job or in relationships marital family and friends all fear anxiety and depression will be gone that is part of the old sin nature which we will no longer have in our new bodies as will the problems themselves there will be no sun god is light the light of god will illuminate heaven but it will be a different kind of light light illuminates and it gives a certain amount of warmth the light of god will illuminate also but the light of god will emanate love the suns rays do not emanate love but when one is in gods light he or she will actually feel the love of god if when a person died the angels came to take him to heaven and they blindfolded him and plugged up his ears so he couldn't see anything or hear anything he would still know when he entered heaven he'd know because he would be able to feel the love of god and all the anger bitterness fear worry and stress would be gone gods light emanates love corinthians says however as it is written no eye has seen no ear has heard no mind has conceived what god has prepared for those who love him what does that mean it says no eye hath seen i've been to some pretty beautiful places on this planet yet that verse says that my eyes haven't seen anything that compares with heaven it says no ear hath heard i've talked to people who have said that they have been to shangra la type paradises or even said they had visions of such places and described them to me but even those don't measure up to heaven in this day and age of tv radio and the internet there are a million ways that you could put pictures of shangri la into your head much more so than in centuries past yet none of those images could compare with the real heaven it says no mind has conceived in other words go home some time lay down on your bed and close your eyes and try to conceive what paradise would be like if you were given omnipotent power to create it just as you please even that would fall short of heaven that verse says that your finite mind couldn't even think of what heaven was like the colors in heaven will be unreal it won't be just the few colors of the spectrum of light there will be thousands of colors we've never seen before the sounds will be unreal there will be musical sounds that no man has ever heard on earth there will be thousands of diamond like gems of many colors that reflect light and heaven will be filled with light to reflect god is light corinthians says i knew a man in christ about fourteen years ago whether in the body i cannot tell or whether out of the body i cannot tell god knoweth such an one caught up to the third heaven and i knew such a man whether in the body or out of the body i cannot tell god knoweth how that he was caught up into paradise and heard unspeakable words which it is not lawful for a man to utter this was paul the apostle taken up to heaven he said it was unlawful to speak what he saw because anything he would have said about heaven would have fallen short of a true description of the real heaven an accurate picture of heaven is incapable of being put into words and any description of heaven always falls short including the one i am giving now psalms says thou wilt make known to me the path of life in thy presence is fulness of joy in thy right hand there are pleasures forever heaven is a place where we will worship god but i don't think we will just be up there sitting on a cloud playing a harp we'll all have a function there and we'll enjoy what we are called to work at i see people everywhere making plans for social life plans for dating plans for education plans for marraige plans for career plans for children plans for buying a home plans for retirement and plans for everything under the sun but when it comes to eternity they have no plans their attitude is just i'll cross that bridge when i come to it never thinking that when you come to it it's already too late since we're going to spend about years here and forever in eternity and since death and what's on the other side is certain sooner or later i'd say plans for eternity is more important than temporal plans you do not want to miss heaven even if there was no hell and i assure you there is a hell you would still not want to miss heaven john says for god so loved the world that he gave his one and only son that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life unfortunately as simple as salvation may be there is going to be a whole lot of people who miss heaven Afterlife Purgatory Rapture John Wycliffe Emanuel Swedenborg
