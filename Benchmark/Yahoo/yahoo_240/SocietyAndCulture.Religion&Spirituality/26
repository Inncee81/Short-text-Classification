okay r s it's deep dark secret time what's yours i don't know you and you don't know me so it's all good i won't tell anyone one of mine is fat guys turn me on not huge guys just the ones up to lbs sigh here goes if i keep holding on to the humiliation i may never go outside again p from the age of on i had a mad crush on paul simon the lyrics and the music captured me and from there stemmed the physical attraction you know how women are when i lived in long island i was a town over from his summer home i met him four times the first time he was giving a concert at a ranch in montauk this was ' and a number of us were standing 'backstage' really just a field with a gated area waiting to see if we could meet him for a moment my roommate and friend were with me i had brought some stupid biography for him to sign but before he ever came i realized that having him sign an unauthorized biography would be pretty ludicrous so i dropped it down by my feet and realized i didn't want or need an autograph just a 'hello' would be nice mind you now i had strep throat thrush bronchitis and a degree fever as of yet the ent had not seen me and the hospitals kept misdiagnosing me so i got sicker and sicker this is not an excuse just a foreword that might explain my being so out of it later well paul walked on over and suddenly i realized he was coming straight toward me stop aarrgggh go see other people first paul i don't know what to say i love you i can't do this first stop stop ah but no he made a beeline for me hi he said are you enjoying the concert i looked at him everything suddenly went into slow motion i couldn't remember how to say hi this had happened to me once before during a statewide spelling bee when i was no memory of the alphabet whatsoever he smiled at me a bit pityingly having a good time he asked peter my roommate kicked my ankle my friend donna just looked at me grinning i stuttered out e eh eh which meant just exactly what you think it means nothing it was i love you i'm we're both not married you're brilliant i could hold the paper while you write the music and you can feed off of my stomach each night we'll have beautiful babies together but it certainly sounded nothing like that time kept moving and standing still peter my jerkoid roommate knelt down and picked up the book by my feet i wanted to say no no dumb idea but out of nowhere he was handing the unauthorized bio to paul saying i think she'd like you to sign this for her no i screamed inside my head not that peter no but it was too late paul held it looked at it laughed a bit said did your father write this jokingly to me i looked at him ashamed embarrassed mortified near death and said my first word dumbly n no he giggled a bit said i didn't think so i'd rather not sign this would you like me to sign your t shirt i nodded yes almost imperceptibly and stood there dumbly donna peter turned me so that my back shoulder faced him and he signed my shirt he touched my arm and my back so as to lean on something while writing i didn't want his signature i didn't want his autograph only babies want those only teenagers i had just turned what the hell was going on here when they turned me back to face him i burbled desperately i saw you in central park in ' i was in the second row on my friend's shoulders i saw you there you were playing it all came out like this however isawucentralparkiwassecrowonalexshoulderssawyou as if the rant wasn't ridiculous enough i mushed all my words together like i had marbles in my mouth as i heard the words pour from me i was beyond mortified you were there like he didn't know you played uh huh duh and he looked at me and said you did rather like someone would speak to a mentally retarded person or a very small child i turned scarlet he began talking to my friend donna i looked at peter and yup i burst into tears people looked at me a bit sadly and a bit like you might look at someone who you believe is about to blow up your ranch paul looked over at me sadly peter steered me away but by then i was blubbering hiccuping and everyone saw it i didn't want to go back peter said i had to that all our friends were waiting for us he tried to make me feel good about jimmy buffet coming on next i didn't want jimmy i didn't want anyone i wanted paul and i had acted like a mongoloid fool in front of him peter dragged me back to our friends i sat on the blanket still sobbing loudly they all looked at me sadly too and knew better than to ask what happened my closest friend came over to me and i told her she tried to be comforting i was inconsolable i never cry like that all sobby and hiccupy and loudly i couldn't help myself she talked about my fever affecting me i just looked at her all snottily and wished for internal combustion i started to have a good time watching jimmy but i thought i would never live the day down two weeks later i saw him again i was working in the outdoor cafe section of a gourmet farmer's market someone left a banana on the counter yes a banana it was a hot day no one was at the cafe for a moment so i decided to run the banana yes run the banana back to produce i ran because some very hoity toity people lived in the area who might get angry that i wasn't at their beck and call the moment they asked for a cappucino and some salmon roe i ran past the register and boom right into somebody we both went down i stood up about to apologize mightily he stood up it was him paul simon i had just knocked him over the words left me again he looked at me curiously like perhaps he'd seen me before he said oh i'm sorry excuse me even though it wasn't his fault i looked at him holding my banana out like some sacred offering he looked down at my hand i looked down at my hand a feeling of stupidity like i hadn't felt in oh two weeks washed over me i ran from him and into the produce section there i returned the banana to the apples and thought about blowing up again i was too mortified to move when someone yelled for service at the outdoor cafe because they'd been standing there ten whole seconds i couldn't do it i feebly asked one of the produce managers to go she didn't know how to make the cappucino or run the register i got myself outside and listened to a lecture as i made a really awful cappucino i don't like having to wait and nearly does fluffy skimpy little dog yelps angrily where is my cappucino why isn't it bubbly enough make me another i'm never coming back here if this is the service i'm going to get i thought about throwing her puppy on the grill and watching her scream while i ate it the third and fourth times were minor one was at a baseball game that the artists and writers in the town played simon was on the writer's team that year my friend jessi wanted to get a picture of us with him i thought i'd rather shrivel up and die but a picture at least i'd have a little something at the end of the game she walked up to him dragging me asking him if he'd take a photo with us he smiled said sure and then looked at me i was wearing a cap and had it pulled down to my nose i didn't want him recognizing me it was only a week after the banana incident he looked at me a bit strangely but stood in betweeen us snap went the shutter she still has that awful pic she's smiling he's smiling a bit uncomfortably and i look like a no eyed capmonster lovely the fourth was at a steve forbert concert at a small bar in amagansett i was with a guy i really liked he was with his wife and son my guy had his arm around my waist the place is just a tiny bar and it was jam packed people were just about on top of one another i was standing near the entrance someone's elbow was on top of my arm my guy whispered in my ear look who's got their arm against yours i looked it was paul i froze just at that moment the management came to scoop him toward a fresh table that had been put out thank goodness i thought if he saw me again he'd call the police think i was stalking him or something yeesh yup so there's one four part secret out in the open remember elfkin you promised to tell no one so if i see this printed i'll know you lied and no
