atheists agnostics and church i'm curious to see how many of you have grown up been affiliated with etc with any protestant denomination of church i don't mean visiting one time but actually going regularly if you don't mind state whether or not your grew up having to go as i did or if you used to be a christian etc also mention the denomination if you don't mind thank you my first memories are of a presbyterian church when i was about three we moved and began attending a pentecostal church when i was nine i think it might have been a first assembly of god but that memory is weak i hated the hypocrisy of that chuch where various preachers railed against science and technology while speaking over an electronic public address system in a heated room illuminated with electric lights to a congregation which drove to church in their own cars even as a child i could easily see those believers were as ignorant as doorknobs and damned proud of it i learned the meaning of the word atheist in that awful church and immediately started thinking of myself as one by the time i was twelve i was running away from home on sunday mornings to avoid being compelled to attend that church after they made me attempt to kiss a live rattlesnake's head to prove my faith i was terrified and turned myself in to the juvenile authorities asking for protection from my parents and from that church i got what i wanted a juvenile court judge issued injunctions against my father prohibiting him from ever beating me again or from compelling me to attend a church against my will my mother was diagnosed as a hallucinating schizophrenic and confined to a state mental hospital where they used ect and powerful anti psychotics to bring her back to reality i've never been back to a church since because they all cause me to feel nothing but anxiety and fear i've read the bible on my own cover to cover a couple times and that solidified my atheism i want nothing whatever to do with worshiping genocidal maniacs these days i think of myself as a secular humanist and i am an anti theist who considers religion a serious detriment to humanity Church of Christ Separation of church and state Ten Commandments Existence of God Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Religion Christianity History of Christianity Sabbath Supernatural Baptist God Messianic Judaism Church of Christ, Scientist United States religious history Charles Darwin's views on religion Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Great Apostasy Pentecostalism Fundamentalism Christian denomination Presbyterian Church (USA) Religious conversion Evangelicalism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism New Testament Eucharist Restorationism Agnosticism Methodism Evolutionary creationism Urantia Religious Society of Friends A Course In Miracles Culture of the United States Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Puritan Revivalism Simone Weil Infant baptism Strong atheism Unitarian Universalism Christianity and anti-Semitism Homosexuality and Christianity Anti-Mormonism Religion in the United Kingdom Church of Scotland God and gender John Wesley History of the Latter Day Saint movement Judaism United Church of Christ Pledge of Allegiance Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Bertrand Russell Trinity Russian Orthodox Church Lutheranism Persecution of Christians Presbyterianism William M.
