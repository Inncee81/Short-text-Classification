is there a worse sin in the eyes of a god a good friend who is very devout used theis argument for reasons i should be a believer in god if i was wrong i will burn in hell if he was wrong then nothing happens to him therefore i am risking the most and he is risking nothing therefore it would logically be correct for me to believe in god pot odds i guess to me if there was a god he or she would be pretty angry at someone believing in them as a sort after life insurance policy i mean this is a god who accepts nothing but full attention a sort of high maintance god yet i have heard this argument many many times i believe in god and i'm telling you that your friend is wrong judging others and loving god as an after life insurance isn't what being a christian or muslim or any other religion many people think as your friend does and there is nothing in the bible that says that non christians will burn in hell the bible says that you should love everyone even your enemy help them and guide them to god now if they live a good life being nice and stuff they will get a chance to be in heaven umm well if people didn't get the chance to know who christ is and were all their life loving and nice to persons and stuff they will go to heaven and answering your main question all sins are forgiven by god whatever they were even if you've done drugs killed stole and many things if one day you decided to be a believer again it is never too late and god will always forgive you for he loves you more than any person on the earth sorry if i'm a bit not understood here or anything but i'm only and well not that good in english just hope that something is readable p edit for the dumb guy that can't read god is fair and only he knows every person and knows how to judge him in the after life Salvation Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an God Sin Theory of conduct Pascal's Wager Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Hell Ten Commandments Problem of Hell Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Sola fide Religion Justification (theology) Creationism Resurrection of Jesus Eastern Orthodox Church Rich Mullins Baptism Meaning of life Heaven Christianity Divine grace Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Evil Soul Intelligent design Trinity Infant baptism Devil John Howard Yoder Biblical inerrancy Capital punishment Charles Grandison Finney Christian eschatology Free will Religious Society of Friends Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Merit Abrahamic religion Jesus Predestination Purgatory John the Baptist Gospel of Thomas Christian views of Jesus Great Apostasy C.
