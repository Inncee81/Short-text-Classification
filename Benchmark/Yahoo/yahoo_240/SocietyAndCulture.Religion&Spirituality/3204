why so much negativity in r s i've asked a similar question before but i ask again because i just don't get it why is this category so full of people who want to argue rather than intelligently discuss the issues for instance if someone asks is heaven part of our solar system why do the non believers have to chime in with negativity obviously the asker believes in heaven so he doesn't need you to tell him that it doesn't exist you don't have to answer every question you know i've heard people are snarky in this forum because it's fun okay but isn't there someplace else you can hang out why can't there be serious debate and conversation about religion and spirituality in this forum without the negative cutting snarkiness i don't expect everyone to agree with me in fact i welcome differing opinions that's how we learn from one another but why do people have to come in here talking so negative about something that is obviously important to someone else christy i understand there will be heated debate in fact i encourage debate but it just seems like some people think they have to weigh in on every question even if the only thing they have to say is god doesn't exist that's not debate that's just getting your points this is true even when you ask questions that are not asking for opinions but experience you receive negativity and mockery but you know it just makes me sad but also confirms that some people do not have a higher power whatsoever or that their concept of a higher power is skewed blessings Meaning of life God Goodness and value theory The nature of God in Western theology Soul Creationism Biblical inerrancy Philosophy of language Theory of conduct William A.
