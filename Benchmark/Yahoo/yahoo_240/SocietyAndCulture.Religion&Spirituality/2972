muslims do u think if i asked allah for a complete miracle allah will answer what im asking allah for is a miracle that could not just be a coincidence if it was answered im asking allah to take something i did out of my life do u think he will answer allah god answers everyones prayers but if he doesnt you shouldnt get upset cause he surely wouldve done it for your own good for example this tennis player had to travel by airplane to get to his match this was the last airplane to that place and there was no other way for him to get there he prayed to god pls help me i need to win this match he reached the airport but soemhow he couldnt catch his flight hed lost his passport i think he felt so unhappy and god hadnt answered his prayer but he understood things when he read in the newspaper the next day that the flight in which he was supposed to travel had crashed there were no survivors so whatever calamity befalls you you should always keep itin mind that whatever he does is for your own good i cant say that miracles dont happen i myself have witnessed a miracle but you cant ask for wrong things like you cant ask for death you cant ask for harm to befall someone unless theyve done harm to you etc and you should have faith in allah that he will inshaa allah answer to your supplication and you should keep repeatedly asking him for it without getting bored or impatient if this is of great importance to you browse or write to islam qa com and you may find it helpful remember allah hears you whenever you call on him Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Mary, the mother of Jesus Bilal ibn Ribah God Prayer Isa Religion Exorcism Qiyamah Muslim ibn Aqeel Saint Fasting Evolutionary creationism The nature of God in Western theology Apostasy in Islam Magic (paranormal) Miracle Nation of Islam Chosen people Virgin Mary in Islam Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Abrahamic religion Christianity Sin Vishnu sahasranama Hajj Five Pillars of Islam Cat Stevens Predestination Salah Angels in Islam Ten Commandments Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism A Course In Miracles Intercession Adnan Oktar Muhammad Theory of conduct Talaq (Nikah) Women in Islam Qur'an Intercession of saints Jizya United Airlines Flight 93 Allah Banu Qurayza Islam Ayyavazhi mythology Fiddler on the Roof Characters of Lost Aisha Salvation Devil Church of Christ, Scientist Noah Aqidah Supernatural Islam and anti-Semitism Holocaust theology Gospel of Mark Prophet Moral objectivism Musa (prophet) Charles Darwin's views on religion Battle of Bassorah B__b Ali Merit Survivor (novel) Yusuf al-Qaradawi Meaning of life Angel Idolatry Origin belief Israel ben Eliezer Battle of Badr Scientology beliefs and practices Prophets of Islam Fundamentalism Muraqaba Maimonides Judaism Al-Ghazali Rais massacre Charles Grandison Finney Funeral of Pope John Paul II Christian views of Jesus Alcoholics Anonymous Canonical hours Twelvers September 11, 2001 attacks timeline for the day of the attacks
