ever wonder what the difference between praying to the christian god and to any other god is because all god's answer prayers with yes no or wait meaning prayer is pointless no matter which god u pray to until i see some actual statistics that show prayer actually increased the chances of obtaining the desired outcome i dont see any reason to believe your god over another and a side question how come the christian god who has unlimited powers only answers prayers within the confines of natural law i have yet to see a prayer answered that could not have come about on its own accord prayer is just god through a vessel of mercy praying to god byway of the holy spirit if it's not done within these confines it's usually someone just rubbing their jesus genie lamp and then no it will not come to pass god inspired prayer is heard because it is his prayer returning to him through a saved believer but i know i speak to a blind man trying to tell him what it's like to see Eastern Orthodox Church Merit Prayer Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints A Course In Miracles Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Christian eschatology Judaism Predestination Sola fide Church of Christ, Scientist Holy Spirit Prayer in Christianity God Mary, the mother of Jesus Catechism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Simone Weil Religion God and gender Korban Roman Catholic Church Justification (theology) Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Abrahamic religion Rosary Charles Grandison Finney Soul Exorcism Sin Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Christian views of Jesus Pharisees Theology Angel Filioque clause Opus Dei Salvation Atheism The nature of God in Western theology Sabbath Anointing Idolatry Zohar Martin Luther Tetragrammaton Athanasian Creed John Wesley Funeral of Pope John Paul II Icon Christ Separation of church and state in the United States Jewish principles of faith Christianity Theodicy Separation of church and state Infant baptism Sacrifice Indulgence Church of Christ Michael (archangel) Supernatural Repentance Religious Society of Friends Magic (paranormal) Biblical inerrancy Summa Theologiae Miracles of Jesus Qur'an Ordination of women Good Friday Prayer Meaning of life Tridentine Mass Calvinism Religious pluralism Purgatory Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Resurrection of Jesus Origen Trinity Glossolalia Book of Daniel Lord's Prayer John Wycliffe Saint Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Jeremiah Urantia Idolatry in Christianity
