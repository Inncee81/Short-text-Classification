what is wicca i've looked it up but it didn't help i know it is a type of religion but i want more details wicca is a very complex faith which embraces widely varying practices and many different traditions the following however is what i consider to be the basics wicca is about years old with roots in masonic practices ceremonial magic and the romantic era's ideas of classical religions its founder was a british civil servant named gerald gardner http www geraldgardner com essays php it is in many ways a postmodern faith embracing religious relativism and one that resonates powerfully for increasing numbers of people the central tenet of the wiccan religion is the wiccan rede if you harm none do what you will this is a deceptively simple commandment which can take a lifetime to contemplate and to master many wiccans also believe in the law of threefold return sometimes called the rule of three whatever you do for good or ill will come back upon you three times over wiccans honor deity as both male and female god and goddess or at the very least as goddess many wiccans believe that the universe is the body of god dess and therefore that all things contain divine energy and that the world itself is sacred some wiccans are polytheists many god desses others are duotheists god and goddess of whom all other gods and goddesses are simply aspects others are monotheists god and goddess themselves are simply aspects of an unknowable source wiccans generally do not believe that god dess is separate from the world therefore we have no concept of salvation since god dess is present to all and always many wiccans believe that god dess is too big to fit inside one religion all religions spiritual paths are ways of reaching the same goal and atheism and agnosticism are honorable perspectives on the mystery of life each wiccan operates as their own priest ess we do not have a distinction between clergy and laity therefore each wiccan is responsible for their own personal development and for forging their own relationship with god dess some wiccans practice in covens which are generally initiatory and require a long period of study traditionally a year and a day before entering others practice in loosely affiliated groups of solitaries which are wiccans who practice outside of traditional coven structure others simply practice alone wiccans do not usually have churches we create sacred space as and where needed by casting circles of energy which function as temples when inside those circles we invite the spirits of the four platonic elements air fire water and earth to join us as well as the goddess and the god or at minimum the goddess wiccans have celebrations which are timed to both the solar and lunar calendars the solar festivals held at the
