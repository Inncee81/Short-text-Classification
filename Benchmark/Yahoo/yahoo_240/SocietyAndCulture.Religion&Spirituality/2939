how could the hebrews have been slaves to egypt if there was no native pharaoh ruling during the time they say they became slaves to egypt the new kingdom native dynasties of egypt were between bc to bc and in the bible it is written hebrews were slaves for a period of years to egypt most say it was the pharaoh rhameses ii reigned from bc that evenually released the hebrews between and around bc there were no native pharaohs ruling egypt only shepherd kings and the hyksos or hebrew ancestors do the math people the bible states about generations passed after the exodus up to solomon's temple building or the year bc so around years passed from release to solomon's reign add yet another years to that and you get the year bc no earlier so who made the hebrews slaves since history plainly says it was not a native pharaoh of egypt their own ancestry to the one who says their were different pharoahs ruling egypt i know that but still doesn't change the year truth supposedly written in the torah what i love of the bible is this need by ancient hebrew scribes to over exaggerate and if they did that what is to say anything they wrote was true what i have read in hebrew history is one fact they never expected anyone to discipher heiroglphics or of those stories they plagerized from the sumerian culture but over the last years truth and it's discoveries show this cultures embarrassing ancestry lafiite what this racial overtones hebrews have called themselves so many different names over the last years it is obvious race is what they do not wish to be linked up to and i am no racist but a researcher of religions they still haven't found historical evidence that it ever happened atheist Moses History of ancient Israel and Judah The Exodus Pharaoh History of ancient Egypt Bible Exodus Habiru Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Bible and history Hyksos Akhenaten Canaan Manetho Hebrew calendar 2nd millennium BC Ten Commandments Arab Solomon's Temple Monotheism Names of God in Judaism Tetragrammaton Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Jesus Plagues of Egypt Joseph (Hebrew Bible) Hatshepsut Ugarit Edom Egyptian mythology Black (people) Biblical canon Judaism Atenism Cultural and historical background of Jesus Jewish history Ancient Egypt Egyptian pyramids Hittites King Solomon Jeremiah Second Intermediate Period of Egypt Dating the Bible New Testament David Linguistics and the Book of Mormon Ark of the Covenant Book of Daniel Babylonia Egyptian chronology Beta Israel Tutankhamun Masoretic Text Kuzari Septuagint Hebrew language Immanuel Velikovsky Noah's Ark Pepi II Neferkare Book of Esther Religious conversion Achaemenid dynasty Historicity of Jesus Abraham Yemenite Jews Miracle House of Joseph Semitic Jewish holiday Horus Ammon (nation) Chronology of the Ancient Near East Afrocentrism Creationism Third Intermediate Period of Egypt Rastafari movement Middle Kingdom of Egypt Documentary hypothesis Book of Mormon Mishnah Berossus Deuteronomist Deuteronomy Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt Early history of Sudan Pharaoh (novel) Tefillin Archaeology and the Book of Mormon Israelite Altar
