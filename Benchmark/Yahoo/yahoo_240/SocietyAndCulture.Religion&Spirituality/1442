why do the atheists come up with the term of proof to not to believe read below please saying i don't want to do something then finding excuses to not to do it very very easy and can be done on any subject but i can't understand why so many atheists saying that there's no proof as a fact to back up their position indeed i really doubt that they thought on this or read the holy books or asked the people just to learn not to quarrel we go to school for years read lots of books half are useless and silly so don't say there's no need to read holy books as we all read extreme silly books even comics so why don't these atheists just pass by saying i don't believe but select an excuse by saying there's no proof someone may have tons of them but it is a matter of searching for the proof truth so i think coming up with the term there's no proof makes no sense i just don't believe is better if it does tell me saying i don't believe is accurate actually and they can say that and no one can tell them otherwise Atheism Existence of God The nature of God in Western theology Deconstruction Religion Bertrand Russell Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Theodicy GED Fundamentalism Intelligent design movement Logic Philosophical skepticism Guide for the Perplexed Theory of conduct Strong atheism Originalism Science God Philosophical Investigations Jon Secada Supernatural David Hume Agnosticism Religious conversion G__del's incompleteness theorem Evolutionary creationism Discordianism Phillip E.
