why would a church cancel a gay vets' memorial service if you go on msn i'm sooo bad with links computers etc it's under the recent headlines i feel that in a world that already has so much pain why would anyone deny a family their grieving process sexual orientation is trivial compared to so many things going on in this world today do you agree disagree with what they did all thoughts welcome namaste thank you mullah follow mullah's link for the story if you'd like to read it daisymae that's a very good point thanks for that many good answers by the way blessings why can't a church just hold it for the family then he's already gone so it would be for them i don't know i guess i really just don't understand some things and i'm not intending to offend anyone how many people get services that cheated on their wives husbands are drug addicted have stolen things etc etc why not screen everyone's 'sins' the church s pastor the rev gary simons said no one knew sinclair who was not a church member was gay until the day before the thursday service when staff members putting together his video tribute saw pictures of men engaging in clear affection kissing and embracing this is clearly the reason the video tribute is not something god would approve of being shown in the church no more than a collection of a porn stars films being show as a tribute in a church if the gay kissing and such was to be left out then i personally think that the funeral should have been continued for his family there is more to this man then just being gay he was a veteran and someones son i personally would have used the occassion to share the love that jesus has for all if they would only believe in him Homosexuality and Christianity Eastern Orthodox Church Sexual orientation Kurt Cobain Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Anglican views of homosexuality Marriage Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints EastEnders Rich Mullins Religion and sexual orientation Church of Christ Original sin Ex-gay Religious Society of Friends Theodicy Westboro Baptist Church (Topeka) Papal Infallibility Bisexuality Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Theory of conduct Religion and sexuality Funeral Blacks and Mormonism Cindy Sheehan Socrates Little Britain Evil Opus Dei Past teachings of Prem Rawat Soap opera Roman Catholic Church Baptist Laura Schlessinger Mortification of the flesh Pornography Mennonite Trinity Queer as Folk (U.S.) Mary, the mother of Jesus Jon Secada Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Guns N' Roses Homosexuality and Judaism Christianity Sabbath Unification Church John Howard Yoder Sun Myung Moon Anderson Cooper Boston Public Homosexuality Jane's Addiction Infant baptism Death and state funeral of Ronald Reagan Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Motion picture rating system Scientology beliefs and practices Clerical celibacy Funeral of Pope John Paul II Sola fide Zoophilia Uniting Church in Australia Summa Theologiae Polyamory Rick Santorum Saint Friends Minister of religion Evangelical Lutheran Church in America Perseverance of the saints Alan Campbell (pastor) Christian view of marriage Calvinism Criticisms of Christianity Transsexuality Merit Religion Humphrey Bogart Salvation John Wesley The Cure Lutheranism Goodness and value theory Bishop
