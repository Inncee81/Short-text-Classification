evolutionists if i understand the theory of evolution correctly we evolved and continue to do so is that correct if we evolved from an ape ape like creature or monkey does that mean the older members in your family tree are closer to being an ape than you are if mankind continues to evolve then changes however slight must be continuing all the time that should stand to mean that your older siblings parents grandparents great great grandparents etc etc are were closer to being a monkey ape whatever than you are is this true i didn't read any answer that did your question justice except the first let me explain according to the theory of evolution we have evolved from ape like creatures if not apes you are correct in this statement what you failed to understand and no one bothered to explain is that evolution does not necessarily occur in each generation remember the theory of evolution theorizes that one species evolves into another species i'm not going to go into evolution mechanisms here for one because i am no expert on the matter but evolution requires more than just adaptation to explain this point imagine a warlike society which valued only redheaded people imagine that they attained military superiority and destroyed all non redheaded people on the planet and likewise killed all non redheaded children in a few generations all other hair color might be removed from the gene pool altogether the fact that the race as a whole changed in a particular way is not evolution the surviving redheads are not an evolutionary step forward although it is in a manner of speaking natural selection only the redheads were able to survive there is no evolution occurring here they are all still human what is required in evolution is a genealogical change from one species to another this requires genetic mutation genetic mutation occurs naturally but rarely in other words there is no reason for anyone to believe that their parents grandparents or great grand parents are any less human than they statistically the farther you follow your family tree the more likely there are to be mutations but there is no guarantee of mutations either positive negative for any given period in other words evolution is not necessarily continuing all the time in all members of a species it could be that i possess an overall genetic advantage over my parents but that does not mean that it is an evolutionary one it could also be that i have an overall genetic disadvantage when compared to my parents that does not mean that i have devolved either as one answer suggested if you believe in evolution then you believe that your ancestors are generally closer genealogically to the creature that humans evolved from this does not mean that they are more ape like it only means that their genetic makeup though wholly homo sapiens is likely closer to the genetic makeup of our evolutionary predecessor though that predecessor would have been wholly homo whatever i hope this helps explain some things jim http www life after harry potter com Species Human evolution Intelligent design Evolutionism History of evolutionary thought Ape Natural selection Creationism Sociobiology The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Meme The Origin of Species Extinction Irreducible complexity Molecular evolution Sociocultural evolution History of creationism Altruism Evolution of sex Human skin color Creation-evolution controversy Teleological argument Macroevolution Patriotism Young Earth creationism Biodiversity Senescence Reproduction Bah__'__ Faith and Science Created kind Gene Evolutionary creationism Flood geology Franz Boas Fermi paradox Red Queen Creation science Genetic algorithm Origin of language Hominidae Primate Occam's Razor Origin belief Human extinction Charles Darwin Price equation Biology and sexual orientation Eugenics Intelligent design movement Mutation Punctuated equilibrium Anthropology Science Teach the Controversy Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) God Determinism Religion Supernatural Neanderthal Karl Popper Evidence of evolution Australopithecus afarensis Cradle of Humanity Culture Evolutionary psychology Xenomorph Memetics Darwin on Trial Chimpanzee Meaning of life Olduwan Whale Left-handed Inception of Darwin's theory Ecology Barbara McClintock Expert system Human nature Intelligence quotient Artificial selection Wraith (Stargate) Francis Crick Theory of conduct Immortality Carnivorous plant Human migration Mutant (fictional)
