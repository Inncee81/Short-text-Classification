muslims what do you think about this how does this make you feel i was watching this clip on youtube about the best ways of making dawah inviting one to islam to atheists and mashaallah what the speaker had to say brought me to tears the speaker was discussing that many muslims wonder what terminology they have in common with atheists that could open the way to making dawah the obvious would state that there would be none or little seeing as muslims and atheists have such different beliefs what the speaker said was that we should congratulate atheists why you ask his rationale was because an atheist believes that there is no god which is the st half of the shahadah the islamic declaration of faith there is no god but allah and muhammad is his messenger so half of our work is already done subhaanallah in spite of our differences there are still similarities that ties us together what are your thoughts on this i know that it has definately changed my outlook on making dawah to atheists jazakallah kheir i know that our faiths are very different there is no confusion about that but i am saying how ironic is it that the belief of atheists linguistically not religiously is a part of our shahadah i am just saying that even those that we should really have least in common with religiously there is still something that we share i read a book by jeffrey lang he is an american professor of methematics who converted to islam what he tells about his conversion is exactly the same line he was born a christian but drifted away from religion until through his studies of science etc and hid unanswered questions by christianity he reached the conclusion there is no god later in hisl ife he came upon muslims who were by the way not the best of examples and through them was intriduced to quran and studied it in detail and then he reached the latter part of shahada but god he ays in his book that it took him years believing and living the frist part of shahada but it was much later he was able to reach the second part Religious conversion Religion Atheism Apostasy God Christianity Aqidah Qur'an Five Pillars of Islam Nation of Islam Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Dawah Abrahamic religion Creationism Apostasy in Islam Islamic philosophy Muhammad Jewish principles of faith Prayer Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Alawite Existence of God Criticism of Islam Qiyamah Prophet Sharia The relationship between religion and science Supernatural Judaism Agnosticism History of creationism Divisions of Islam Status of religious freedom in Malaysia Apologetics Evolutionary creationism Sin Monotheism Shi'a Islam Predestination Trinity Jihad Gospel of Barnabas Religious perspectives on Jesus Ahmed Deedat Ten Commandments Religious pluralism Messianic Judaism Islam and anti-Semitism Bosniaks Magic (paranormal) Islam as a political movement C.
