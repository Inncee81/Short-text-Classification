when you pray to god do you repeat the prayers over and over like a broken record or do you speak to him like you would talk to a human being andrew does he really need to talk back you is superior i meant who is superior both i think obligatory prayers like grace tend to be shorter and fairly repetitious i'm not proud of that but i'm just being honest on the other hand when i pray for specific needs for myself and others i talk plain english as i would to a friend and tend to be very long winded sometimes thirdly when asked to pray publicly such as in church i tend to use bible quotes and king james words especially when i'm a little nervous about saying something dumb and embarrassing myself sorry that's not right but i think it is all too common king james words don't impress god or move his hand but it sounds good to fellow church familiies god forgive me for being aware of people i've heard folks pray as if preaching to the congregation that's not prayer to god although it might be prophesy Roman Catholic Church Mass (liturgy) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints King James Version of the Bible Religious Society of Friends Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Martin Luther Prayer John Wesley Expository preaching Opus Dei Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Lord's Prayer Church of Christ Puritan Abrahamic religion Book of Mormon Christianity Catechism William M.
