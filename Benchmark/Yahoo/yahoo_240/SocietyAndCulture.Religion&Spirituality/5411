how many here have read the bhagavta sp gita and believe jesus and krishna are the same in the gita krishna says he knew some of the indian patriarchs which had been dead for hundreds of years in the bible christ says he knew abraham who was hundreds of years before i see them as the same just different lives lived what is your opinion yes they are simply different cultural facets of the same gem of truth there are common themes for many of the schools within hinduism that can be found in the vedic scriptures and such works as the bhagavad gita remember yoga originated out of hinduism most people only know the physical forms of yoga called hatha but those techniques area actually preparatory techniques for the higher practices of the spiritual types of yoga such as jnana karma and bhakti you can practice a form of hatha but it helps to be grounded and centered in some sense in the higher forms of yoga or all you are doing is stretching in the highest practices of yoga they all lead to complete bhakti surrender if you are interested in the yoga teachings of lord krishna then one thing you may want to focus on to learn and practice in a more nonsectarian manner is the uddhava gita the uddhava gita is a summation of the essence of the bhagavad gita and the simplest and most direct practice of yoga and so it is eminently suitable for nonsectarian universal teaching which is the essence of hinduism here is a short summation of the uddhava gita which is found in the srimad bhagavatam also known as bhagavata purana epilogue lord krishna's last sermon at the end of another long sermon comprising of more than one thousand verses disciple uddhava said o lord krishna i think the pursuit of god as you narrated to arjuna in the bhagavad gita and now to me is very difficult indeed for most people because it entails control of unruly senses please tell me a short simple and easy way to god realization lord krishna upon uddhava's request gave the essentials of self realization as follows do your duty to the best of your ability for me without worrying about the outcome remember me at all times note that this is the point of chanting things like the mahamantra hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare kare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare which is often chanted in kirtan or a variation of it the whole point of kirtan and mantra is remembrance perceive that god is within every living being mentally bow down to all beings and treat all beings equally perceive through the activities of mind senses breathing and emotions that the power of god is within you at all times and is constantly doing all the work using you as a mere instrument and a trustee Hare Krishna Sant Mat Bhagavata Purana Aum Smartism A.C.
