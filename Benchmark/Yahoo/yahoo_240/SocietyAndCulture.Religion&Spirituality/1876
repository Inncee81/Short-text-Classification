why do men hate going to church there's actually a book out called why men hate going to church our pastor has been going through it with the elders at elders meetings the gist of the book says that a lot of guys hate going to church because churches have so feminized their services that it's not of interest to most alpha male types the songs are often 'love songs' instead of songs about the power of god the blood of christ or victory type songs which are more appealing to guys many times the sermons are geared towards women how to have a happy marriage instead of who we are in christ or the authority of god the father activities also include things like potlucks and bake sales instead of camping with the guys or fishing fellowship afternoons so many times guys think of church as a girl's place and would much rather do something more manly Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Priesthood (Mormonism) Community of Christ Baptist Metropolitan Community Church Religious Society of Friends John Wycliffe United Methodist Church Holy Orders Clergy Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite) Bishop Alan Campbell (pastor) Book of Mormon Roman Catholic Church Articles of Religion (Methodist) Polygamy Eucharist Elder (religious) Eastern Orthodox Church History of the Latter Day Saint movement Minister of religion Seventh-day Adventist Church Humphrey Bogart Church of God (Cleveland) Christian views of women Oliver Cowdery Council of Jerusalem President of the Church (Mormonism) Sola fide Blood atonement Same-sex marriage Justification (theology) Calvinism Jehovah's Witnesses Jonathan Edwards (theologian) Joseph Smith, Jr. Homosexuality and Christianity Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief John Wesley Disciples of Christ Heber C.
