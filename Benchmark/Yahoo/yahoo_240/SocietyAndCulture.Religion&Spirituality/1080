how did god come into existence is this explained somewhere in the bible because i can't find it anywhere if it's not explained anywhere then how can god be used as an explanation for the origin of anything if you say that god created the universe but can't explain who or what created god then we're no closer to understanding the origin of the universe than we were before we heard your explanation which begs the question if you don't know the answer why bother opening your mouth chris maybe god exists in a parallel dimension where day equals night up equals down and true false that way everything that's ever been said about god could simultaneously be accurate what a brilliant hypothesis here is just a simple theory some theologians have debated whether or not god lives in another dimension as to where in that dimension self creation is plausible and a reality then to get into contact with our physical world there is the holy spirit and jesus because the bible refers to jesus as the word and then later tells us that through the word all things in this world were created so basically god in that dimension created himself and then created jesus and the holy spirit within himself to reach us God Resurrection of Jesus Creationism Supernatural Intelligent design Trinity Origin belief Evolutionary creationism Theology Soul Religion A Course In Miracles Book of Mormon Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Nontrinitarianism Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses The nature of God in Western theology Miracle Time travel Biblical inerrancy New Testament Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Jesus Creation-evolution controversy Tetragrammaton Eastern Orthodox Church Theory Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Angel Creation according to Genesis Existence of God Theodicy Justification (theology) Moses Binitarianism Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an History of creationism Religious Society of Friends Determinism Christianity Teleological argument Multiverse Sabbath John Wycliffe Mary, the mother of Jesus Church of Christ, Scientist Fundamentalism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Kabbalah Modern geocentrism Devil Sefer Yetzirah Book of Isaiah Catechism Gospel of John Merit Flood geology Creationist cosmologies Occam's Razor Historicity of Jesus Teach the Controversy Gospel of Thomas Holy Spirit Presuppositional apologetics Godhead (Mormonism) Creation science Baptism Acts of the Apostles Philosophy of language End times Many-worlds interpretation Names of God in Judaism Salvation Cosmological argument Urantia Atomism Christian eschatology God and gender Opus Dei Jewish principles of faith Religious perspectives on Jesus New Testament view on Jesus' life Free will Simone Weil Bible Christian views of Jesus Saint Dispensationalism Scientific method Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism
