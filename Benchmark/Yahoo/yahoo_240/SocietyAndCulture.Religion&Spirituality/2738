why do you think why do you think that the quran was revealed in arabic i as a muslim and i know the answer because it is found in the quran why the quran is in arabic but do you if you did not read that part in the quran know why or maybe at least think why just wondering what people think so again why is the quran in arabic luke skywalker good guess but no inat sorry but can you try to spread truth next time and provide real evidence and let not your thoughts be supported by hate cuz the arabic language is so rich in vocabulary and it isn't so easy to be changed and modified like english and other languages for example besides it is very eloquent moreover the quran itself is miracle it came to challenge the arabs at that time whom the ppl of the prophet that what comes to my mind now and that is how it was preserved in brief the qur'an was revealed to the prophet muhammad peace be upon him via the angel gabriel and the prophet subsequently memorized the whole scripture thousands of the companions of the prophet learned the qur'an directly from the prophet pbuh they memorized it and were known in islamic history as huffaadh the memorizers and preservers of the qur'an moreover a number of companions wrote it down during the lifetime of the prophet peace be upon him and it was compiled in its entirety immediately after his death the entire qur an was written down during the lifetime of the prophet muhammad and trusting the fact that many scholars knew it by heart it was not collected in one volume it was personally arranged by him and the muslims memorized it in the same order in one particular battle in the time of the calph abu bakr a number companions who had memorized the qur an were killed thus the caliph of muslims at that time and the other companions decided that the qur an should be compiled into book form as a means of preserving it once and for all in the time of the calpih uthman he andthe other companions decided that official copies of the qur an should be inscribed using only the pronunciation of the quraysh tribe the arabic dialect that the prophet spoke allah has said in the qur an that he alone will protect his book and indeed he has kept his promise the qur an that we read today contains the same exact words that were revealed to the prophet muhammad peace be upon him over years ago this is quite a miracle Aisha Prophets of Islam Hadith Ali Abu Bakr Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Caliph Criticism of Islam Jizya Battle of Badr Quraish Arabic language Succession to Muhammad History of Islam Holy Spirit Apostasy in Islam Allah God Arab Sufism Moses Kufa Prophet Shi'a Islam Islam and anti-Semitism Virgin Mary in Islam Arabic alphabet Arabic literature Islamic calligraphy Tafsir Noah Mary, the mother of Jesus Hizb ut-Tahrir Abdullah ibn Abbas Fundamentalism Abu 'Abd Allah ash-Shafi'i Abraham Uthman Urdu Khadijah bint Khuwaylid Sahaba Religion Sharia Ahmadiyya Muslim Community Yusuf al-Qaradawi Isa Adnan Oktar Nikah Mut'ah Salman the Persian John the Baptist Battle of Bassorah Sunnah Dhul-Qarnayn Women in Islam Nahj al Balagha Qur'an alone Salah Gospel of Barnabas Jesus Basra Saint History of the Arabic alphabet Angel Muhammad's marriages Khabbab ibn al-Aratt Christianity Angels in Islam Religious perspectives on Jesus Islam as a political movement Mu'allaqat Genie Twelvers Exorcism Historical persecution by Muslims Muslim Aqidah Translation of the Qur'an New Testament Banu Qurayza Muslim ibn Aqeel Names and titles of Jesus Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr 99 Names of God
