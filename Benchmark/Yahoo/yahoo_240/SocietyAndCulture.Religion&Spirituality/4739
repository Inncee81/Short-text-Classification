what bends logic bends there is a way to describe logic that's flexible it's called fuzzy logic the best way i know of to describe fuzzy logic is the tadpole paradox imagine taking a picture of a tadpole then imagine waiting until it turns into a frog and taking another picture if you show either picture to anyone on the street they'll be able to identify it as either a tadpole or a frog it stands to reason then that if you took one picture every second of every day of the creature that eventually you would have one picture of a tadpole followed by a picture of a frog the problem is as you get closer and closer it becomes harder and harder to distinguish the tadpole from the frog and when you get past a certain point literally any picture will be as good as any other an easy way to resolve this is to say that the picture at the beginning is tadpole and that every day the creature loses some of its tadpole ness the picture of the frog on the other hand is frog now you can look at any frame in the series and correctly identify it as being a frog or a tadpole or exactly halfway between and you can also find the frame exactly halfway between that we wouldn't have been able to identify otherwise the best thing about this is that now that we can define the creature as being more frog than tadpole or more tadpole than frog we can use conventional rules of logic and math including statements like since this creature is a frog the tadpole and frog sets of pictures still run into eachother and there still impossible to tell apart in the middle but thanks to putting them in fuzzy sets you can tell them apart if for instance you have to tell a computer what a tadpole is and what a frog is since computers and anything that runs on logic need an exact definition of what a tadpole is if you're looking more toward things that can't fit into conventional logic and arithmetic you want to look at recursion recursion happens when something defines itself a good example is the barber paradox the barber paradox states that the barber shaves all men in town that don't shave themselves this is impossible because well who shaves the barber things that define themselves are traditionally hard to put into categories and often times it's impossible for them to exist the way they're described logic usually depends on puttings in categories so attempting to put things like that in categories usually requires bending the rules a little G__del's incompleteness theorem Russell's paradox Expert system Paradox Philosophy of language Complexity classes P and NP Mathematics Infinity Causality Computer Fuzzy logic Philosophy of mathematics Lambda calculus Halting problem Zeno's paradoxes Ethernet Time travel Scientific method Function (mathematics) Manifold Jacob Neusner CPU design Deconstruction Natural deduction Epistemology Digital circuit Perl Mouse (computing) C programming language Control system Philosophy of space and time Objective-C Truth The nature of God in Western theology First-order logic Recumbent bicycle Existence Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Predestination paradox Intelligent design Reverse mathematics Recursion W.
