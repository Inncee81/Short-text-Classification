question for the religious evangelicals what does my life have to do with you i live as i please have never commited a crime and take care of my family i do not believe any of the religions to be true my personal life is my own business and would probably be enough to send some of you to therapy if someone wishes to discuss religion i'm all for that if someone wants to preach at me and does not stop when i tell them to they're paid for i value life more than most of those who actually wrote the scriptures but will lose no sleep over taking it away in the right circumstances i respect those who show respect and consider those who do not show common courtesy less than dogs i believe that if there is a hell it is reserved for religious people who drive others away from their religion through their own ignorance i also believe that the majority of the population doesn't have the intellect to discuss emotional issues rationally i still don't understand why anyone would push their beliefs to the point of destroying any interest the listener may have those who killed or died for freedom did it so that not only could you practice whatever religion you prefer but so that others could have freedom from religion i have respect of all persons but will not sit here and shove god down your throat just as i expect you not to shove no god down my throat your statement could be said for all those who are religious and those who are not that act in this behavior and yes there are non believers who show their ignorance in pushing the no god theory down people's throats in this statement we could say that respect is even due to a dog thus you have your opinion and i have mine but we agree to disagree Religion Jehovah's Witnesses Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Soul Atheism Ten Commandments Church of Christ Trinity Jewish principles of faith Abortion debate Evil Religious Society of Friends God Fundamentalism Simone Weil First Amendment to the United States Constitution Religious pluralism Baptist Theory of conduct Reality Mind control Liberal Christianity Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses United States religious history Biblical inerrancy Religious conversion Christianity Intelligent design Resurrection of Jesus Animism Patriotism Ethics Scientology beliefs and practices Jacob Neusner Christianity and anti-Semitism Evangelicalism Immortality Children of God Sharia Pascal's Wager David Hume Yusuf al-Qaradawi Plame affair Prayer Baptism Opus Dei Roman Catholic Church Suicide Apostasy in Islam Homosexuality and Christianity Meaning of life Polyamory Socrates Free will Contract Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an A Course In Miracles New Testament Creationism Goodness and value theory Subud Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Separation of church and state Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Infantilism Religious views of suicide Theodicy Epistemology Philipp Melanchthon Freedom of speech Predestination Salvation Opposition to cults and new religious movements Jewish views of religious pluralism Abrahamic religion Objectivist philosophy Charles Darwin's views on religion Christian-Jewish reconciliation Hinduism Religion and sexual orientation Angel Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Religion and abortion Criticism of Mormonism John Wycliffe Religious studies Faith Mary, the mother of Jesus
