why do christians seem so against wicca compared to other religions i'm a christian and i am tried or wiccans getting treated as if their religion is fake or not good enough i am also tired of christians putting down other religions in general i thought we should love and treat eachother with respect what happened here cj i'm not a christian not matter what i say lol i'm a liar that is so so funny last i checked i believed jesus was my lord and savior i guess that is just a technicality i used to be wiccan before i converted a lot of people think that it is following satan because they think of witches and casting spells and associate that with evil but it's actually quite peaceful and respectful of the earth people have and always will judge and condemn things and people which they do not understand unfortunately Wicca Witchcraft Neopaganism Magic (paranormal) Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Historical persecution by Christians Satan Warlock Rich Mullins Salvation Persecution of Wiccans Witch-hunt Satanism Wiccan Rede Evil Trinity Devil Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Zoroastrianism Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Church of Christ, Scientist Christian views on witchcraft Angel Predestination Goddess Christian anarchism Anarchism and religion Abrahamic religion End times Prophet Resurrection of Jesus Religious pluralism Opus Dei Stregheria Jesus Charmed Nation of Islam Margaret Murray Demon Dianic Wicca Eschatology Theory of conduct Religion Baptist Hell Magic circle (Wicca) Gospel of Thomas Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Ten Commandments God Messiah Witches (Discworld) Christianity Sin Unification Church Eucharist Homosexuality and Neopaganism Gnosticism Book of Isaiah Christian eschatology Theodicy Jewish views of religious pluralism Atheism Sabbath Dissociative identity disorder Horned God Christian Identity Opposition to cults and new religious movements Fundamentalism Saint God the Father Paul of Tarsus Christ A Course In Miracles Articles of Religion (Methodist) Jewish Messiah Blood libel Legalism (theology) Chosen people Jehovah's Witnesses Black cat Justification (theology) Idolatry History of Christianity InterFaith Church of Christ Separation of church and state Heaven Hecate Evangelicalism Historicity of Jesus Ascetical theology Anti-Mormonism Perseverance of the saints Sola fide Supernatural LaVeyan Satanism
