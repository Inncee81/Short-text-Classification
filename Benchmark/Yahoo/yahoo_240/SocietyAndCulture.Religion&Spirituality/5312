would taoism be a good replacment for world religion if you don't know what taoism is just google it taoism is a philosophy not a religion so yes it would be a good replacement although i don't understand why the assumption is that there needs to be something to fill that gaping whole i think taoist philosophy is interesting and enriching but i'm not sure i like the idea of some universal ideology that would be kind of boring not to mention dangerous we need dissent that's what lets us improve and persevere and evolve and on a practical level how would this be possible with forcing it down people's throats i like thinking of things myself and if that means coming to same conclusions that taoism makes then so be it at least they'll be mine philosophy is better than religion to a certain extent as it has the cool ideas and leaves out the rituals and zealotry but in the end it may lead to religion then it would no longer be a philosophy instead becoming the new religion of the world lao tze's teachings about water for instance would probably lead to a water god i'd rather we all thought for ourselves for once instead of subscibing to latest issue of religion weekly Taoism Eastern philosophy Confucianism Laozi Tao Atheism Mysticism Anarchism and religion Philosophy Religion Theology Origin belief Religion in China Southeast Asia Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Predestination Neo-Confucianism Goodness and value theory Spirituality Metaphysics Meditation Meaning of life Republic Ethics Human Fundamentalism Philosophy of language New Age Intelligent design Philosophy of science Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Supernatural Hinduism Thelema Nakhi God Urantia Altruism Tai Chi Chuan Monism Sabbath Force (Star Wars) Mantra State Animism Punk ideology Property (ownership right) The nature of God in Western theology History of philosophy Socrates Determinism Torah Umadda Ideology Vedanta Theodicy Religious pluralism Mythology The relationship between religion and science Karl Marx Judaism Hell Epistemology Yoga Great Apostasy Intelligent design movement Noam Chomsky Scientology beliefs and practices Philosophy of religion Simone Weil Advaita Vedanta Feminism Buddhist philosophy Deconstruction Trinity Jiddu Krishnamurti Religious Society of Friends Reincarnation Originalism Past teachings of Prem Rawat Islamic philosophy David Hume Satanism William A.
