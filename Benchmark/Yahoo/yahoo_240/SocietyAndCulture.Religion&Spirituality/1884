give scriptural evidence of the sabbath being kept holy in new testament times matthew but in vain they do worship me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men doesn't sound like christ intended for your popes to change god's laws corinthians circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing but the keeping of the commandments of god titus not giving heed to jewish fables and commandments of men that turn from the truth john he that saith i know him and keepeth not his commandments is a liar and the truth is not in him to one and all sunday is not the sabbath of the bible sunday is not the christian sabbath there is absolutely no biblical justification for sunday being a day of worship sunday was taken from paganism sunday worship was introduced by the apostate church catholic of rome under the rulership of the roman emperor constantine constantine was a worshiper of mithra the sun god and never repented of it all who worship on sunday are sharing in the worship of this false god deuteronomy the idea that the resurrection was on a sunday is also false and stems from a lack of knowledge of the biblical holy days which was supressed by the catholic church read the passion story in john there were two sabbaths that week why folks hebrews read it carefully it mentions the th day not the first day as the sancified day of rest please look at your calender and see which day is which almost all christian churches agree that the commandments are valid except for the th few realize that the th commandment is a reflection back to creation when the very first thing god made holy was the sabbath thus the sabbath pre existed the siani covenant read genesis read matthew what is christ talking about matthew is in there for our benefit this is the messiah the savior of the world talking he did not intend for a single law of god to be rescinded by his sacrifice for those who broke that law why is the law important romans and others what is sin john whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law for sin is the transgression of the law what happens to sinners romans for the wages of sin is death because we are under grace and remember that the above verses define sin and the penalty for it are we free to do as we wish romans what is the sign of the true church the elect at the end of the age revelations here is the patience of the saints here are they that keep the commandments of god and the faith of jesus lets keep it simple forget for a moment that there are aproximately commandments in the torah and that yashua says that the least of them has not passed away again read matthew and really think about what is being said there still remains the lets suppose falliciously that all that there are are the are christians required to keep them please study the following verses will you take the plain word of the apostles of the christ and the christ himself over the false teachings of your chruches rev rev john jo john corinthians john mark matthew the th commandment states exodus keep in memory the sabbath and let it be a holy day on six days do all your work but the seventh day is a sabbath to the lord your god on that day you are to do no work you or your son or your daughter your man servant or your woman servant your cattle or the man from a strange country who is living among you for in six days the lord made heaven and earth and the sea and everything in them and he took his rest on the seventh day for this reason the lord has given his blessing to the seventh day and made it holy the sabbath was the first thing god created to be holy what god has made holy no man has the right to change it was holy before sinai it was made for man when man was made mark and others you really owe it to yourselves to study the following links before rejecting the true sabbath any longer for a study on how catholic doctrine came to be follow this link http philologos org eb ttb default h source s http www cbcg org rome's challenge htm http www biblestudy org bibleref holy http www biblestudy org godsrest main http www biblestudy org bibleref twoba edit i am not a seventh day adventist although i agree with them concerning the weekly th day sabbath i can assure you they will disagree with me over the necessity of keeping the annual sabbaths of god as well hogie if you do not believe the scriptrues that you are labeling proof texts then you may as well throw out the whole bible have you even studied the subject or are you just parroting the company line of the catholice chruch if it is not god's law then there is not and never was any law god says my sabbaths shall ye keep exodus god does not say moses' sabbaths ye shall keep or the jews sabbath ye shall keep it is god's sabbath please explain what scriptures paul was encouraging timothy to study to learn the way of righteousness ti all scripture is given by inspiration of god and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness be aware hogie that you may just be one of or a follower of one of the people mentioned below timothy this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come for men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy without natural affection truce breakers false accusers incontinent fierce despisers of those that are good traitors heady high minded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away for of this sort are they which creep into houses and lead captive silly women laden with sins led away with divers lusts ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth all of you who quote colossians read it in context please it is talking about a day set aside for fasting not a day of worship romans does the same thing this is not talking about the sabbath folks further if paul was teaching against commandment keeping he would have been in direct conflict with christ again have you really read matthew are you going to take christ at his word even further if paul had been teaching against the law as his jewish accusers were claiming then he never would have been allowed in the temple during his last vist to jerusalem in fact the scriptures show that paul was not teaching against the law at all acts and a final point if paul was teaching his jewish converts one thing and his gentile converts another he would have been making himself and god out to be hypocrites people who reject the sabbath and the law of god have no scriptural foundation whatsoever to stand on
