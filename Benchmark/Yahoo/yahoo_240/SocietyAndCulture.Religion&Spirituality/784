how long must we continue living in this dark age people continue to tell their children there are demons devils waiting to attack or possess them when they've never seen a demon devil themselves they still believe they will burn in some lake of fire for eternity because a book says so they believe it's a sin to change the words of their holy books yet the translations they read have been changed from their original texts so much it is doubtful the authors of the original text would even recognize the currently used one they teach things that have been proven false by science aka fact all i'm asking is why can't people keep an open mind and admit their religion which is thousands of years old have some flaws or be a little out of date i'm talking about all religions but i use christianity as an example because i used to be a christian and i want everyone to know i am not asking this question because i'm an atheist because i am not it will continue until every man women and child realizes that a book is a book and not the word of a make believe super entity i doubt that will ever happen as there will always be some who just can't live without something to worship and pray to for support Devil Religion Exorcism A Course In Miracles Satan Christian eschatology Ten Commandments Angel Urantia Demon Atheism Theodicy Soul Hell Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Sikhism primary beliefs and principles Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Sola fide Christianity Abrahamic religion Religious pluralism Eastern Orthodox Church Charles Grandison Finney Baptism Book of Isaiah Articles of Religion (Methodist) Biblical canon Roman Catholic Church Book of Mormon Apocrypha Sabbath New Testament Church of Christ, Scientist Gospel of Thomas Salvation Atomism Phillip E.
