to jehovah witnesses out there please explain why you guys disfellowship members in the congregation for committing a sin and please don't quote that scripture in the bible where paul was addressing the congregation saying if a brother is unrepentant cut him off from the congregation reason being if you read lower done in that same chapter you would see that paul told the congregation to keep admonishing him as a brother try explaining it to me some other way jehovah's witnesses practice the scriptural practice of disfellowshipping for unrepentance of such serious sins as fornication drug abuse stealing and apostasy baptized witnesses who join the military or publicly engage in worship with another religion are considered to have disassociated themselves from jehovah's witnesses contrary to the misinformation of anti witnesses it is quite possible to become inactive in the jw religion without becoming disfellowshipped as long as one's lifestyle does not bring reproach upon the congregation and as long as one does not advocate one's disagreements with the religion the congregation has no interest in investigating exposing and disfellowshipping an inactive former jehovah's witness for those who are disfellowshipped or disassociated a primary goal is to shock the person into recognizing the serious of their wrong so that they rejoin the congregation in pure worship since the primary bonds that are broken involve friendship and spiritual fellowship it is well understood that family bonds remain intact parents siblings and grown children of disfellowshipped and disassociated ones sometimes choose to limit what they may feel is discouraging or bad association but that is a personal decision and is not required by their religion former witnesses who are disfellowshipped or disassociated are typically treated in accord with the scriptural pattern explained in these scriptures corinthians quit mixing in company with anyone called a brother that is a fornicator or a greedy person or an idolater or a reviler or a drunkard or an extortioner not even eating with such a man remove the wicked man from among yourselves titus as for a man that promotes a sect reject him after a first and a second admonition romans now i exhort you brothers to keep your eye on those who cause divisions and occasions for stumbling contrary to the teaching that you have learned and avoid them thessalonians now we are giving you orders brothers in the name of the lord jesus christ to withdraw from every brother walking disorderly and not according to the tradition you received from us thessalonians but if anyone is not obedient to our word through this letter keep this one marked stop associating with him that he may become ashamed john if anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching never receive him into your homes or say a greeting to him matthew if he does not listen to them speak to the congregation if he does not listen even to the congregation let him be to you just as a man of the nations becoming baptized as a jehovah's witnesses is not a trivial step at a minimum a student must demonstrate months of regular meeting attendance and public ministry then must himself express the desire to be baptized the candidate then spends hours answering hundreds of bible questions wherein he expresses both a clear understanding and personal conviction regarding jehovah's witness teachings in at least three separate interviews with three different elders the candidate must vocally agree to be baptized in front of hundreds or thousands of eyewitnesses and must be publicly immersed in water this is not a momentary emotional decision by an unreasoning child dedication as a witness required hard work and determination at the time learn more http watchtower co uk e article htm http watchtower co uk e article htm Paul of Tarsus Iglesia ni Cristo Eastern Orthodox Church Dispensationalism End times Sabbath Church of Christ, Scientist History of the Latter Day Saint movement Book of Mormon Abrahamic religion Christian eschatology Children of God Catechism Charles Grandison Finney Sola fide Great Apostasy Apostasy Soul Authorship of the Pauline epistles Mormonism and Christianity Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Community of Christ Christian views of women Judaism A Course In Miracles Priesthood (Mormonism) Bible Student movement Mormonism and Judaism Christianity and anti-Semitism Criticism of Mormonism Religion Lutheran Church -
