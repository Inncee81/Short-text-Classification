muslims if abortion is a sin what about stem cell research that is from embryos anaboot what did you answer the question try again in english you say allah is the only creator then how can someone create a embryo and use it for stemcell and say it is ok if they are muslim at weeks you can see a heartbeat the brain is developing nerves etc you say months i'm not sure about stem cell research but that might be wrong since you are creating life and only allah swt has the power to make life and take life away as to abortion the child doesn't get a soul until months so it is not a human those first three months and abortion isn't allowed at all unless the mother's life is in danger like she could die if she were to continue with the pregnancy only then is abortion allowed and allah swt will forgive the woman and she will not get bad credit from allah swt also one should not kill a child anyway just because they don't want it or think that they won't be able to afford taking care of it since islam says that allah swt provides wealth from unexpected places to each new family member born Abortion debate Religion and abortion Stem cell Birth control Abortion In vitro fertilisation Prophets of Islam Isa Human cloning God Cephalic disorder Sin John the Baptist Abortion in the United States Culture of Life Qiyamah Yusuf al-Qaradawi Polygamy Miscarriage Partial-birth abortion Fasting Death Prenatal diagnosis Mary, the mother of Jesus Angels in Islam Original sin Hajj EastEnders Menstrual cycle Salvation Muslim ibn Aqeel Childbirth Apostasy in Islam Five Pillars of Islam Origin belief Nation of Islam Religion Peter Singer Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Sharia Muhammad Talaq (Nikah) Human rights in the United States Roman Catholic Church Abortion in Canada Hizb ut-Tahrir Emergency contraception Cloning Virgin Mary in Islam Chimera (genetics) Poliomyelitis Creationism Abrahamic religion Islam and anti-Semitism Bioethics Apostasy Bilal ibn Ribah Evolutionary creationism Rei Ayanami Alawite Magic (paranormal) Allah Maria al-Qibtiyya Aisha Women in Islam Islamic calendar Feminists for Life Artificial womb Qur'an Chosen people Margaret Sanger Islam Migraine Saint Demon Tocopherol Abortion law Down syndrome Twin Ten Commandments Burr Redding Banu Qurayza Religion and sexuality Unclean animals 99 Names of God Human brain Exorcism Intercession Suicide bombing Religious conversion Adnan Oktar Media and ethnicity
