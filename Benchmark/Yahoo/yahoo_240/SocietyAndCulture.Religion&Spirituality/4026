is it harder to fathom agnosticism than atheism i hear so many bad definitions of agnosticism agnostics believe in god but not religion agnostics believe in a higher power but don't have faith agnostics are fence sitters an agnostic accepts that there was a creator that there is a higher being than man an agnostic believes there is a god but does not worship an agnostic is an atheist that can't admit they don't believe in god so they play it safe and believe in all gods i've seen all of these is it too hard to get that an agnostic just doesn't know the answer atheists know there is no god theists know that there is agnostics just don't know for me personally in everyday life i see nothing to give me knowledge of a higher being consciousness power that could have created everything but as i go back billion years i can't fathom nothing not knowing what to believe about that i am agnostic a person who holds the view that any ultimate reality as god is unknown and probably unknowable capitalizing god when it refers to christianity is just gramatically correct whether you believe or not it's like the president of the united states versus the president of a corporation it implies no belief just a bit of education you are completely right i think that the first one is the most common one i hear from people especially those who do believe in god i think everyone is agnostic some are just unwilling to admit it i mean this in the sense that nobody knows for sure my religious studies teacher was explaining the difference to us the first day and this is how he explained it when asked a theist will say yes there is a god and he does exists an atheist will say there is no god and no he does not exist an agnostic will say lets go get a beer haha i thought it was funny edit in regards to what patty said agnostics are not athiests in the sense that they do not reject the idea that god might exist they just believe there is no way of knowing so agnostics are open to the idea just not sold on it yet if that makes sense Agnosticism Existence of God The nature of God in Western theology Supernatural Strong atheism Evolutionary creationism Nontheism Charles Darwin's views on religion Alcoholics Anonymous Theism Problem of Hell Theodicy Afterlife Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Christianity Origin belief Predestination Jewish principles of faith Monotheism Deity Evolutionism History of creationism Belief Friedrich Schleiermacher Judaism Apostasy Meaning of life Fundamentalism A Course In Miracles Liberal Christianity The relationship between religion and science Trinity Freethought Young Earth creationism Theology Immortality Soul Gnosticism Hinduism Pledge of Allegiance Weak agnosticism Advaita Vedanta Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Antony Flew Pascal's Wager Sin Intelligent design Creation-evolution controversy Christian apologetics Existentialism Separation of church and state Argument from morality Philosophy of mathematics Urantia Nihilism Freemasonry Bertrand Russell Maimonides Unitarian Universalism Islam Confucianism Evil Biblical inerrancy Faith Open Theism Problem of evil Intelligent design movement Hindu philosophy Objectivist philosophy Simone Weil Prayer Epistemology Ten Commandments Twelve-step program Scientology beliefs and practices Messianic Judaism Reconstructionist Judaism Religious conversion Apostasy in Islam Satanism Joseph Campbell Psychology of religion Calvinism Omnipotence Teach the Controversy Humanism God and gender
