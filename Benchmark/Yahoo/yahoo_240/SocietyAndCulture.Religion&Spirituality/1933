the bible christians only please what versions of the bible are there and what are they about or what are their differences i would like to know because i am becoming stronger in my religion and would like to buy one god bless ps no rude answers please warning if you choose to reply rudly i am not going to take it personally i am not trying to be rude to non christians by the way i am christian myself and am united methodist so i want to seek advice from others like me thank you there are different types of thoughts concerning translations some translations are not really translations at all but they are paraphrases these tend to be not very accurate to the original text these are basically commentaries and not true translations they are true only to the extent that the writers correctly understand and believe the bible next in accuracy is the thought for thought versions or sometimes refereed as dynamic equivalent these translators do not try to translate the individual words of the text but they try to convey the same thought that a passage conveys again these are more accurate than the paraphrases because the translators are trying to be true to the message of the original manuscripts but if the translators do not properly understand what a passage is saying there may be flaws in this translation process the most popular of the dynamic equivalent versions is the niv the most accurate is the word for word translations in these the translators try to translate each word as accurately as possible in my opinion this is the best approach give us the words that were spoken and the thought will take care of itself the goal of the king james version was to be an accurate word for word translation but because english has changed since some find it difficult to follow i prefer the english standard version or the new american standard bible sometimes your best option is to have more than one of the more accurate translations that way you can compare a verse between the versions if you have difficulty in understanding also the esv is very good to have footnotes that explain certain words or phrases the link below is a chart from zonervan that shows the various translations the paraphrases are on one side and the word for word translations are on the other this particular chart lists the least accurate as thought for thought instead of calling them paraphrases but zondervan is trying to sell bibles generally thought for thought are the ones in the middle a mixture of paraphrase and actual translation of what the text says again this depends in my opinion too much on the thoughts and understanding of the translators i would rather have god's word as accurately translated as possible History of the English Bible Bible translations New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures Gospel of Thomas A Course In Miracles Biblical inerrancy King James Version of the Bible Religion Ten Commandments Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Psalms Deconstruction English Standard Version Fundamentalism Creationism New Testament Predestination Names of God in Judaism Book of Mormon Translation God New International Version Tetragrammaton Anglo-Saxon literature King-James-Only Movement Abrahamic religion Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Creation according to Genesis Moses Fundamentalist Christianity Sabbath Names and titles of Jesus Book of Isaiah Christianity Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Qur'an Halakha Soul Church of Christ, Scientist Dispensationalism Theology Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Divine grace Historicity of Jesus Genesis Biblical canon Septuagint Islam Philosophy of language Gospel of John Talmud Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Textual criticism Holy Spirit Christian apologetics Meaning of life Antichrist Biblical inspiration Nontrinitarianism Holman Christian Standard Bible Gospel of Mark Prophet Book of Esther Homosexuality and Christianity Love Eastern Orthodox Church Microeconomics Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions John Wycliffe Swedish language Atheism Scientology beliefs and practices Christian eschatology Baptism American Standard Version Jehovah Book of Daniel Resurrection of Jesus Ontological argument Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible Trinity Vulgate Martin Luther Angel Expert system Bhagavad Gita Apocrypha History of Christianity Scientific method Pharisees
