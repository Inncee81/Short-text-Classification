what set the factors of the universe in place by factors i mean variations of matter instead of a constant singularity which supposodly started the universe and that singularity came from morey um yeah you look at the universe as not divine yet when comapred to the state of nothing it is and ever single with in it becomes divine also the factors only being limited to factors that they are or are presented to be what if everything could just change what it was a bunny into a bike thats now how it works the factors are divine and were set in place the factors that you ask about are many first is the issue of dark matter described mathematically and just now beginning to be fully understood see the work of the astronomer hubble i think first published in concerning this next there is the solar winds or atmospheric pressures created on the very faint gases of outer space these affect satelites as well as planets to a degree there are the roche zones where planets are ripped apart if they get too near one another although the moon is outside of our zone the effect of the moon created tides as well as shattering the earths crust into diamond shape fractures it is not yet known what effect the earth is having on the moon's internal structures there is gravity which is inversely proportional to the square of the distance our billion plus comets that circle the sun have extensive travell in their eliptical orbit some are belived to almost travel to the next star in their journeys some don't travel as far but go way beyond our ability to locate them at will there is the ever present black hole worries black holes eat everything including light however gravity escapes and hense we have the string theory to suggest that gravity is intradimensional in its existance you have electromagnetic radiation light that pushes things around in space and electromagnetic radiation that attracts things together and repells them apart you are surrounded by the greatest laboratory in existance and who can learn it all i can but that would be bragging and i'm not going to do that right now Sun Planetary orbit Planet General relativity Mercury (planet) Tide Jupiter Vacuum Moon Extrasolar planet Astronomy Planetary habitability Solar wind Saturn Spacecraft propulsion Cassini-Huygens Earth Gravitational radiation Fermi paradox Comet Timeline of the Universe Big Bang Physical cosmology Stellar evolution Universe Neptune Mars Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 Solar sail Creationist cosmologies Modern geocentrism Geology of the Moon Speed of light Kepler's laws of planetary motion Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica Dark matter Astrodynamics Dark energy Modified Newtonian dynamics Solar variation Geology of Venus Venus Project Orion Astronomical spectroscopy Observational astronomy Pluto Neutrino Time travel Terraforming Europa (moon) Comet Hale-Bopp Photon Equivalence principle Telescope Space elevator Hubble Space Telescope Astrophysics Extraterrestrial skies Extraterrestrial life Solar eclipse Phobos (moon) Bah__'__ Faith and Science Plasma cosmology Physics Colonization of the Moon Galileo spacecraft Dyson sphere Open cluster Cosmic microwave background radiation Asteroid Geodesy String theory Space colonization Earth's atmosphere Ultraviolet Titan (moon) Parallax Plasma (physics) Diamond Milky Way Astronomical seeing Luminiferous aether Compact star Apollo moon landing hoax accusations Voyager 1 Center of mass Solar radiation Aurora (astronomy) Impact crater
