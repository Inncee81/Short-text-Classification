is he my true love points for best advice thank you the special person and i love each other for years we went to undergrad college it was tons of chemistry but i don t want to have a relationship therefore i pretended to ignore him for years we had never spoken just enjoy looking at each other from distances before my graduation i told him that i am leaving although we did not really know each other but i knew he cared i was very sad because i miss him so much i thought i was going to forget him because we will never see each other again but with god wills i found his website he wrotes poetries about us he claims he does not know me but he loves me he does not know where i was and what to do but he is going to wait for me is he my true love thank you for your help he is not inlove with you per se he is inlove with the unknown mystery it arouses interest he is also probably attracted to you physically and wonders what it would be like to be with you physical attraction and mystery combined can have a huge affect on people and can control the way people think or feel as for the poems he wrote i know it's a sweet thing for a guy to do but maybe he is just into poetry and writing and used his fantasy of you to have something to write if a man really loves you he'll do whatever it takes to be with you and im not talking about just sitting around and writing poems or letters it takes action maybe sending these poems directly to you or contacting you writing you letters etc don't waste your time wondering about this guy because you might miss the guy who's really meant for you Socrates Avenue Q Social rule Time Out of Mind Love Human sexual behavior Sant Thakar Singh The Amber Spyglass Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Pitaten Jon Secada Friends Infantilism Paul Is Dead Humphrey Bogart Another Side of Bob Dylan Paradise Lost Plame affair Sexual orientation Poetry Fahrenheit 451 One Tree Hill (TV series) Bondage (BDSM) Sinfest Anglo-Saxon literature The Death Gate Cycle Cliff Richard Summa Theologiae Scenes from a Memory A Course In Miracles C.
