does it require faith to be an atheist can you without being omnipotent ominpresent and omniscent know for absolute certainty there is no super natural being that created the world both athesits and theists run into the same issues of first cause every effect has a cause cause and effect cause and effect it is a continuim that can be traced back until the begining of time however it is there that we have a problem if you are an atheist where did the mass come from to create the big bang if you are a theist believing that a super natural being created the world what is the cause of this being both beliefs that of the atheist and that of the theist require faith to be accepted because they both run into the logical problem of having no first cause we obviously have a lot of scholars here in order to make a statement that you believe there is no super natural being is the exact same thing as a person saying there is a super natural being logic does not support either side both sides have a logical quandry that they cannot get out of atheism is the belief in the nonexistance of gods if you cannot prove there are no gods and you have a logical quandry of causes then you have to accept this based on something else besides logic which is what theists would call faith but for whatever reason if you are not comfortable using that word i udnerstand atheism is simply the lack of belief in a deity it's the very rare atheist who claims to know positively that all gods don't exist if a person does claim a god could not exist logically or through the evidence we have now this is a belief and i'd say they've overstepped their bounds there are an infinite number of possible gods and atheists can't hope to disprove them all nobody knows what or whom created matter so instead of presuming something i think it's best to go with a policy of non belief and that is atheism in this case replying to your addition i will always doubt undetectable things and that doesn't require the same faith as it does to believe in them as you'll soon become aware if you visit any mental hospital you're right that i have to faith to believe an undetectable god isn't manipulating my life if you mean that i can't be certain that such a god doesn't exist however there are lots of undectable things that don't exist in fact more than i can count so you can't fault me because i don't believe in your own personal undetectable thing Supernatural Agnosticism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism The nature of God in Western theology Intelligent design God Religion Antony Flew Evolutionary creationism Ontological argument Epistemology Creationism Problem of evil Transcendental argument for the existence of God Goodness and value theory Cosmological argument Pascal's Wager History of creationism David Hume Omnipotence Problem of Hell Jewish principles of faith Creation-evolution controversy Miracle Falsifiability Alcoholics Anonymous Causality Summa Theologiae Origin belief Biblical inerrancy Christian apologetics Philosophy of religion Free will Theistic realism Monotheism Intelligent design movement Argument from morality G__del's incompleteness theorem Nontheism Weak agnosticism Nihilism Predestination Resurrection of Jesus Faith Trinity Presuppositional apologetics Charles Darwin's views on religion Scientific method Apostasy The relationship between religion and science A Course In Miracles Apologetics Fundamentalism Contract Existence Theory of conduct Pledge of Allegiance Meaning of life Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Infant baptism Theism Justification (theology) Abortion debate S__ren Kierkegaard Young Earth creationism Human Teleological argument Christianity William A.
