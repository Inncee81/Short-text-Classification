serious question if i prayed about my troll hater here do you think god would help me i have a stalker and he gets my questions deleted and he ruins my only fun hobby would god care about that or would god tell me to stay off the computer i love my pc that's one of those questions that god only knows for sure as to how he would help you god answers prayers according to his will to work out his purposes here on earth for instance god might actually send a person like that to get his child to consider what they are posting because he wants them to represent him here on y a better or to develop patience and love and a deeper prayer life over the issue it's not too likely that god would answer your prayer by causing the troll hater's computer monitor to blow up in their face and send them to the hospital but god could send the spirit of conviction upon them so that they saw them self as god sees them and repented of their behavior the best thing to do is pray and see what god does matthew ask and it shall be given to you seek and you shall find knock and it shall be opened to you for everyone that asks receives and he that seeks finds and to him that knocks it shall be opened or what man is there among you who if his son should ask for bread will give to him a stone and if he should ask for a fish he will give to him a serpent if you then being evil know how to give good gifts to your children by how much more will your father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Eastern Orthodox Church Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Prayer Roman Catholic Church A Course In Miracles Holy Spirit Justification (theology) Meaning of life Paradise Lost Ten Commandments Theodicy Internet troll Christian eschatology God the Father Muslim ibn Aqeel Baptism William M.
