muslims is the book of isaiah corrupt when it says the messiah will atone for sin the book of isaiah was written bc the dss has the intact book of isaiah dated bc in the gospel of luke jesus teaches from the prophesies of isaiah jesus claims this scripture is prophesy of him that he will fufill the qu'ran in written in ad muhammad's book disagreesw iht the prophsies of isiaiah the book of isiah we have today agrees wiht the scripture jesus read in luke and the dead sea scrolls where isaiah sas the messiah will atone for sin if the book of isaiah is corrupt now why is it the same as when jesus refered to it why is it the same as years before the birth of christ if this prophesy of christ is not corrupt why is the qu'ran teaching different than the prophets of god and jesus farid you do misinterpret scripture if we are to decide that the jews are correct we must surely believe jesus is not the messiah and that islam must surely be wrong farid in regards to the prohesies of the virgin birth and the word alma correct me sir if i am worng but the word refers to a young maiden now if a young maiden has a child is this a sign from god or is the young maiden a harlot if the word alma refers to a young woman is this a sign from god that a young woman bears a child i can't imagine this as a sign form god it seems to happen frequently daily are these all signs form god that young women bear children sahar i would reccomend you read isaiah and then read luke where jesus cliams this is prophesy of him and says he must fufill this prophesy sahar i have read muhammad's book enough to know he could not be a prophet of god he did not agree with god he did not agree with the prophets of god nor did he agree with jesus his allah is not the god of abrham as he claims and does not agree wiht the god of abrham nor does he follow the order of the god of abraham he is not the righteous god of abraham but does glory in deceit and the true god of abrham and jesus the son of god do call satan the liar and deceiver i encourage you to read the words of the true prophets of god and the wrod of jesus christ and the prophsies that demonstrate that jesus is the christ farid why are you arguing against your own qu'ran the qu'ran teaches jesus was the messiah born of a virgin the problem being isaiah teaches that the messiah will atone for sin read isaiah for yourself i hope people can see this but more that likely there will be a few that say something has been changed even though we have hard evidence today Chosen people Jewish Messiah Isa Christian eschatology Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Dispensationalism Gospel of Barnabas Messiah Sabbath Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Resurrection of Jesus Biblical inerrancy Sin Baptism End times Names and titles of Jesus Angel Apocalyptic literature New Testament Biblical canon Religious perspectives on Jesus Nation of Islam Salvation Second Coming Nazarene Justification (theology) God Paul of Tarsus Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Antichrist Prophets of Islam Religion Book of Revelation Priesthood (Mormonism) Trinity Jehovah's Witnesses Historical Jesus John Howard Yoder Bible Qiyamah Hell Mormonism and Christianity Articles of Religion (Methodist) Original sin Historicity of Jesus Fundamentalism Cultural and historical background of Jesus Soul Holy Spirit Satan Eschatology Abraham Christian views of Jesus Virgin Mary in Islam Endowment (Mormonism) Perpetual virginity of Mary Justin Martyr Divine grace Devil Gospel of Mark Coptic Christianity Matthew 1 Qur'an History of Christianity Judaism Christianity and anti-Semitism Gospel Religious conversion Gospel of Matthew Ten Commandments New Testament view on Jesus' life Demon Gospel of John Repentance Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Eastern Orthodox Church Jewish eschatology Book of Daniel Charles Grandison Finney History of the Latter Day Saint movement Great Apostasy Church of Christ, Scientist
