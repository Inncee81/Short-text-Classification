is god in charge of hell he is everywhere or not god is an elitist who gave hell a bad reputation just to keep it an exclusive club that is delightful for the few who dare to visit while most remain too afraid of hell and never experience its fiery bliss before anyone gets offended by my comment or to get more offended by it read the rest of my answer what is the hell that god is in charge of someone's version of god is another's version of devil someone's version of hell is another's version of heaven thus god is present wherever there is a devil and hell is the place of every heaven relativists claim all versions are true and thus they have a promiscuous affair with the truth so they could not disagree with my comment by contrast persons who recognize that the truth does not practice polygamy and that the truth is not married to falsity of course normally claim that their own versions of their beloved concepts are the true ones many persons irrationally fear hell forever in their heaven or in the mortal hells along their immortal heavenly journey instead they should first explore the possibility that the one whom they perceive as their enemy is their ally and that the one whom they perceive as their ally may actually be their enemy and that the place they perceive as threatening and dangerous may actually be a place of refuge and if i say god is the devil it need not be offensive whose god whose devil my heaven is what others call hell what i call hell is what others call heaven their versions of god are my versions of devils Hell Heaven Devil Roman Catholic Church Eastern Orthodox Church God Divine grace Ten Commandments Meaning of life Abrahamic religion Merit Bhagavad Gita Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Religion A Course In Miracles Reincarnation Immortality Mary, the mother of Jesus Evil Sola fide Paradise Lost Sin Angel Satan Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Soul Gospel of Barnabas Book of Mormon Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Phaedo Michael (archangel) Urantia Church of Christ, Scientist Truth Theosis Polygamy Church of Christ Mormonism and Christianity The Pilgrim's Progress Bangsian fantasy Death (personification) Liberal Christianity Socrates Buddhism Atheism Jehovah's Witnesses Afterlife Ascetical theology Mormonism Jewish eschatology Existence of God Gospel of Thomas Incarnations of Immortality Fitz Hugh Ludlow Shamanism Hamlet Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Jewish principles of faith Nihilism Mormonism and Judaism Apocalyptic literature Revelation Theodicy Holy Spirit Angels in Islam Scientology beliefs and practices Fallen angel Philipp Melanchthon Supernatural Sant Thakar Singh Westboro Baptist Church (Topeka) Unification Church Moral relativism Immanuel Kant Harrowing of Hell Goodness and value theory Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Purgatory Priesthood (Mormonism) Marriage Christian eschatology Deconstruction Beelzebub Problem of Hell Great Apostasy Monotheism Emperor Wu of Han John Howard Yoder Hinduism Kain (Legacy of Kain) Criticism of Mormonism Epistemology
