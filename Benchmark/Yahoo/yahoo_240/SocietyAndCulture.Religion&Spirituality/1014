are you a non believer because of something a person did or said to you if so why blame god because of a meesly person no it's not because of something a person did or said to me i was given free reign by not being brought up with any direction in terms of religion my parents are non practicing bhuddists my brother and sister are christian catholic not really sure i was pretty much just left on my own so i researched and looked into various religions didn't find one that felt right or made enough sense to me to devote myself to any of them the bible made no more impact on my life than the illiad or treasure island it just read to me like a collection of stories i realized that i didn't have any faith in any religion none of them made any real logical sense to me i had become a student of modern science where i needed hardcore proof of the existence of things i respect people's religions and can appreciate that they have this faith in a higher power it gives them comfort and makes them feel that they have a certain understanding of the universe my logical brain think they're mildly delusional but that's okay it works for them Religion Spiritism Existence of God Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Creationism Soul Trinity Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Supernatural Church of Christ, Scientist A Course In Miracles Evil Friedrich Schleiermacher Ten Commandments Apologetics Theology Religious Society of Friends Faith God Roman Catholic Church Fundamentalism Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Immanuel Kant Urantia Atheism Idolatry God and gender Sola fide Religious conversion Predestination Ludwig Wittgenstein Intelligent design movement Evolutionary creationism Asperger syndrome Presuppositional apologetics Evangelicalism Prophet Anglicanism Summa Theologiae Free will Witchcraft Thomas Jefferson Separation of church and state Bertrand Russell Reincarnation Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Sant Thakar Singh Salvation Human S__ren Kierkegaard Biblical inerrancy Scientology beliefs and practices Eucharist Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Immortality Sabbath Miracle Origin belief Rudolf Hermann Lotze Theodicy Nation of Islam Psychology of religion Jewish views of religious pluralism Spirituality Christian eschatology Christianity and anti-Semitism Religious pluralism Calvinism Christianity Emanuel Swedenborg Mythology Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Faith and rationality John Wycliffe Meaning of life Biblical canon Omnipotence Islamic philosophy Religious studies Simone Weil Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Baptism Opus Dei Storytelling Saint Ken Wilber Christian apologetics Jacob Neusner Protestantism Unitarian Universalism Islam History of philosophy
