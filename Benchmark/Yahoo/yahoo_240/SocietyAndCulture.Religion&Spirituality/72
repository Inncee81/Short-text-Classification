doubts about the christian god dealing with gays so about a year and a half ago i finally came out of the closet and told my family and friends that i was bisexual now i have come out as being a lesbian and am in love with my girlfriend i was raised as a christian first baptist and then non denominational now i consider myself to be agnostic because one i am the type of person who finds it hard to believe in something that i don't have proof of whether by physical proof someone else having some sort of experience or something anything and two because i don't want to think that this loving and caring god i have known all my life is going to send me to hell for all eternity simply because i have found love with another woman i'm not looking for gay basher i just want some friendly christians to give me their thoughts on whether god really does hate gays and also anyone who has had doubts and found a way to restore faith or even proof that gid exists thanks i consider myself agnostic if there is a god i believe it would accept all of its creations because they are a part of it i also don't believe god hates man yes but god no my advice love yourself love your life treat your life with goodness and the rest will take care of itself The nature of God in Western theology Homosexuality God Unitarian Universalism Homosexuality and Christianity Ex-gay Agnosticism Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Gay Christianity Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Bisexuality Transsexuality Avenue Q Sabbath Marriage Religion and sexual orientation Seventh-day Adventist Church Existence of God Same-sex marriage Sola fide Alcoholics Anonymous Afterlife A Course In Miracles Atheism Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Friedrich Schleiermacher Roman Catholic Church Evolutionary creationism Sexual orientation Theodicy Charles Darwin's views on religion Divine grace Biblical inerrancy Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Heaven Baptism Reincarnation Ten Commandments Origin belief Presuppositional apologetics Urantia Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Justification (theology) Trinity Meaning of life Infantilism Charles Grandison Finney Lesbian Human sexual behavior Effeminacy Church of Christ, Scientist Merit John the Baptist Resurrection of Jesus Baptist Gender role Evangelicalism Angel Creationism Young Earth creationism Socrates Soul Reparative therapy New Testament Gospel of Thomas Cliff Richard Phaedo Mormonism and Judaism Christian right The Amber Spyglass Immortality Book of Mormon Gay slang John Howard Yoder Domestic violence Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Judaism Bible and reincarnation Violence against gays, lesbians, bisexuals, and the transgendered Historical persecution by Christians Supernatural Christian view of marriage Laura Schlessinger Zoophilia Aramaic of Jesus Genesis Gay rights Israel ben Eliezer William A.
