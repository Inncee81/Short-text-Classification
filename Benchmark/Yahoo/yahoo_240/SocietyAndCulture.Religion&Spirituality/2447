why people do not follow one religion i think that the universe is created by a creator but why people don't search the true religion why they don't change their view to the world why media keep disvaluing a religion in front of other let's choose one religion which is the most reasanobale and the nearest to our hearts i basicly don't agree with multigod religion because if there had been many gods they whould made a chaos and i don't agree with ahteism because there is someone who created the whole universe even time and space and big bang so which is the one relgion time was not created by man it was only noticed by man time control man man didnt creat time be more rational islam is the one god's religion don't be fooled by media picture of islam it's spoiled because it's the one religion did you think that we had created you in play and that you would not be returned unto us the noble qur'an al muminoon what does islam mean the word islam itself means submission to allah the religion of islam is not named after a person as in the case of christianity which was named after jesus christ buddhism after gutama buddha marxism after karl marx and confucianism after confucius similarly islam is not named after a tribe like judaism after the tribe of judah and hinduism after the hindus the arabic word islam means the submission or surrender of one's will to the will of the only true god worthy of worship allah known as god the father in christianity anyone who does indeed submit to the will of allah as required by islam is termed a muslim which means one who has submitted to the will of allah many people in the west have developed the sad misinformed trend of calling islam muhammadenism and it's followers muhammadins this is a totally foreign word to muslims and unrecognized by them no muslim has ever called his religion muhammadenism or called himself a muhammadin what is the basic concept of islam islam teaches us that this life is a life of worship we are placed on this earth in order to worship allah and obey his command during this earthly life we are subjected to a series of trials we have the option of enduring these trials and conforming to certain laws and our reward will be great in the next life or we may decline to endure these trials and choose to not conform to the law then we will be made to regret it in the next life each person will be solely and completely responsible for their own final reward we are also told that god has designed these laws to make this life a better safer and more tolerable one for us if we elect to conform to them then we will see the result in this life even before moving on to the next we are told that the earthly life is a life of faith and work and the next life is one of reward and no work we have been placed on this earth to worship god fast pray be industrious good kind respectful and a source of uprightness and morality we are told that god has no need of our worship our worship can not increase the kingdom of god nor add to his power however it is in our best interests both in this life and the next that we do unlike some other religions which claim that god entered in a covenant with a certain group of people and that this group is genetically better than all other human beings or closer to god islam on the other hand teaches that no color race tribe or lineage is better than any other islam teaches that all humans are equal in the sight of allah and that the only thing that can distinguish them in his sight is their piety and worship o humankind verily we have created you from a male and female and have made you nations and tribes that you may know one another verily the noblest among you in the sight of allah is the most god fearing verily allah is the knower the aware the noble qur'an al hujrat levels of islam islam consists of three levels each building upon the lower ones they are islam testify that there is no god but allah and that muhammad is the messenger of allah establish the daily prayers pay zakat obligatory charity due the poor observe the fast of ramadan perform pilgrimage to the ka'aba in makkah once in your life if you are able faith iman to believe in allah to believe in his angels to believe in his books scriptures to believe in his messengers to believe in the day of judgment to believe in the divine decree divine fate whether good or evil excellence goodness ihsan to worship allah god as if you see him for if you can not see him he assuredly sees you in sahih muslim abdullah ibn umar ibn al khattab narrated my father umar ibn al khattab told me one day we were sitting in the company of allah's apostle pbuh when there appeared before us a man dressed in pure white clothes his hair was extraordinarily black there were no signs of travel on him but none among us recognized him this man came and sat beside the apostle pbuh kneeling before him and placing his palms on his thighs he then said muhammad inform me about al islam the messenger of allah pbuh said islam implies that you testify that there is no god but allah and that muhammad is the messenger of allah and you establish prayer pay zakat observe the fast of ramadan and perform pilgrimage to the house if you are solvent enough to bear the expense of the journey he the inquirer said you have told the truth he umar ibn al khattab said it amazed us that he would put the question and then he would himself verify the truth he the inquirer said inform me about iman faith he the holy prophet replied that you affirm your faith in allah in his angels in his books in his apostles in the day of judgment and you affirm your faith in the divine decree either good and evil he the inquirer said you have told the truth he the inquirer again said inform me about al ihsan performance of good deeds he the holy prophet said that you worship allah as if you are seeing him for though you don't see him he verily sees you he the inquirer again said inform me about the hour of the judgment he the holy prophet remarked the one who is asked knows no more than the one who is inquiring about it he the inquirer said tell me some of its indications he the holy prophet said that the slave girl will give birth to her mistress and master and that you will find barefooted destitute goat herders vying with one another in the construction of magnificent buildings he the narrator umar ibn al khattab said then he the inquirer went on his way but i stayed with the messenger of allah for a long while the prophet muhammad then said to me umar do you know who this inquirer was i replied allah and his apostle know best he the holy prophet remarked he was gabriel the angel he came to you in order to instruct you in your religion what are the pillars of islam islam is built upon five major pillars a muslim is taught that anyone who dies observing these five basic pillars will enter heaven as mentioned they are to bear witness that there is no entity worthy of worship except allah god alone and that muhammad pbuh was his messenger this establishes obedience to god almighty alone to perform five prescribed prayers to god every day according to a specific prescribed method and at specific prescribed times this continually reminds us to bear god in mind in all actions either before or after any given prayer to pay two and a half percent of ones wealth to charity every year if their savings exceed a certain minimum level which is considered above the poverty level this is the basic concept the actual calculation is a little more complex to fast the month of ramadhan from the islamic lunar calendar every year from sun rise until sunset this involves not eating drinking or having marital relations from sun rise until sun set to perform a pilgrimage to makkah in the arabian peninsula once in a muslim's lifetime if it is financially possible and their health permits during this period muslims come from all over the world to join together for six days in a prescribed set of acts of worship all muslim men are mandated to wear the same garment which was designed to be very plain simple and cheap to obtain mu'ad ibn jabal said i said to allah's messenger peace be upon him inform me about an act which would entitle me to enter into paradise and distance me from the hell fire he the prophet said you have asked me about a matter which ostensibly appears to be difficult but it is easy for those for whom allah the exalted has made it easy worship allah and do not associate anything with him establish prayer pay the zakat observe the fast of ramadhan and perform hajj to the house ka'aba narrated by ahmed al tirmathy and ibn majah prophet muhammad pbuh muslims are taught that prophets are humans who have been selected by god for a special purpose they are given miracles to assist them in their message but these miracles are not performed through their own power but through the power of god the prophets of god have no divine powers of their own nor even the power to decide who will go to heaven or to hell they are merely there to convey the message entrusted to them by god to the best of their ability in a similar manner muhammad pbuh was assisted by god with a number of miracles and entrusted to convey his message to mankind muhammad pbuh himself however was just a regular human being he could not issue passes to heaven he could not condemn people to hell he could not change what was in people's hearts he could only convey the message and hope that they would believe muhammad pbuh lived like any other man or woman of his people he dressed like they dressed he ate the same food they ate he lived in the same manner and in the same sort of houses they did it would be impossible for someone who did not know him to pick him out of a crowd muhammad pbuh taught his followers through example if he commanded his followers to do something he would be the first to abide by this command he never broke his word he was by far the most charitable man among his people he was the most god fearing and the least attached to this life he never in his life accepted charity but worked for a living he never lied it was not at all uncommon for him to spend months on end enduring severe hunger never seeing a single cooked meal he taught his followers to be merciful to their children and respectful to their elders he commanded them to never taste alcohol gamble engage in usury interest fornication envy deceit or back biting muhammad pbuh taught that no human being needs any other human being to intercede for him with god he showed them that god is within the reach of all his creation he hears and sees all and answers his servant's prayers muhammad pbuh further severely cautioned against promoting any of god's creation or groups thereof to higher levels of divine authority and closeness to god than others or the excessive glorification of any human being this includes the prophets of god themselves he taught that the very best of god's servants are those who continuously seek out knowledge and that god sees all that they do muhammad pbuh taught his followers to be industrious and to earn an honest living he taught them that the best muslims are those who are not overly obsessed with earthly wealth since excessive wealth usually leads to corruption however he also taught that a wealthy person who is not blinded by his wealth is not condemned by god and may even be able to utilize his wealth in acts of worship not available to the poor in other words muhammad pbuh taught moderation in all things there is much more that could be said about the teachings of muhammad pbuh however probably one of the most general summaries made by muhammad pbuh in this regard was righteousness is good conduct and sin is that which weaves inside your chest and you hate for it to be revealed to mankind no 'religious' hierarchy in islam there is no hierarchy of religious leadership such as the people of some other religions may have come to expect there are no priests bishops monks popes etc muslims define a scholar of islam as an 'imam' not to be confused with the imams of iran who claim to have boundless supernatural powers and divine attributes in any given neighborhood the imam is the person that a muslim seeks for religious rulings for example if a muslim dies and his sons want to distribute his inheritance they go to the imam and he presents them with the verses of the qur'an and the sunnah which describe the required procedure this man will also usually give religious lectures to teach the qur'an and the sunnah the muslim imams and scholars have no special divine powers they cannot forgive sins they do not receive divine inspirations they cannot issue passes to heaven they do not have knowledge of the unseen the can not change the law they are just regular muslims who have distinguished themselves with their study and their knowledge no monasticism monkhood islam commands muslims to obey allah and follow his command it specifies acts of worship which are acceptable it encourages muslims to work and be industrious it forbids 'monkhood ' and excessive 'spritualization' or 'zen' and other such practices a muslim is commanded not to forbid upon himself that which was made lawful by allah nor to introduce new and innovative acts of worship into the religion this means that a muslim should not decide that even though islam allows marriage he will forbid it upon himself and remain celibate he may choose not to marry but he can not forbid it upon himself if he wishes to perform extra worship there are many avenues open to him such as nightly prayer charity abstinence from sin etc muhammad pbuh once gave the example of two men one was practicing monasticism and excessive worship totally detaching himself from this worldly life the other was working for a living and paying for the food and drink that the monk was consuming each day muhammad pbuh told his followers that the man who was making an honest living and supporting the 'monk' was greater in reward in the eyes of allah the law islam like judaism is a structured set of laws and commandments the basis of islam is the five pillars mentioned previously anyone who dies observing the five pillars will enter heaven anyone who does not may enter hell there are exceptions however there are many subtle levels both above and below these these levels are governed by the law islam teaches us that muslims will be rewarded in proportion to their good deeds their restraint from evil deeds and their faith in this manner we will have people who will enter different levels of heaven as well as different levels of hell in direct proportion to their faith and deeds we learn about the laws of islam from the qur'an and the sunnah the qur'an is the holy book of islam which contains the words of allah almighty and the broad guidelines of islam the sunnah is the traditions of the prophet muhammad pbuh which included both his words and his actions the sunnah usually provides the details for those laws which are drawn out in broad outlines in the qur'an each one of these two sources has a dedicated and very complex science associated with it and we have sent down unto you o muhammad the reminder one of the names of the qur'an that you may clarify to mankind that which was sent down to them the noble qur'an al nahil al bukhari narrated upon the authority of abu hurairah that he said allah's messenger peace be upon him said allah said 'i will declare war against him who shows hostility to a pious worshipper of mine and the most beloved things with which my slave draws nearer to me is that which i have ordained upon him my slave continues to draw closer to me through performing 'nawafil' supplementary worship till i love him so i become the sense of hearing with which he hears and the sense of sight with which he sees and the hand with which he grips and the leg with which he walks and if he asks me i will give him and if he asks my protection i will protect him' the way of life islam is not the same as some other religions from the point of view that it is not confined to a certain place of worship or a certain act or acts of worship islam teaches it's followers that every single aspect of their life from eating to drinking to sleeping and everything in between can be done in one of two ways either a way that pleases god or one that displeases him islam is also a social economic and political way of life every single aspect of human existence is governed by the law of islam a muslim is commanded to respect his elders and to show humility and respect to his parents he is also commanded to show kindness and mercy to those who are younger or weaker than himself as well as all of god's beasts a muslim is commanded to have nothing whatsoever to do with usury gambling or alcohol a muslim however is not passive and weak he is commanded that if he sees the laws of god being violated or an injustice being committed he must stand up for the truth and fight to establish the law of god defend the oppressed and establish justice and peace a just but merciful law islam as mentioned above involves a structured set of laws and acts of worship some are more strict and rigid than others for instance there can be no excuse whatsoever for worshipping any entity other than allah alone here there is no room for compromise on the other hand islam is designed to also be flexible and lenient for instance if a muslim is sick and can not fast during the month of ramadhan without incurring bodily harm to himself then even though this is one of the five pillars of islam he is not mandated to fast in fact he is encouraged not to fast the law allows for leniency in this and most other cases muslims are taught that each good deed is multiplied by allah almighty till it becomes the equivalent of anywhere from ten up to seven hundred similar good deeds sometimes more an evil deed however is either counted as a single evil deed or is forgiven by allah a muslim is further taught that as long as there is life there is hope so long as death has not yet overcome him he can still repent from his evil deeds and if his intentions are sincere allah is willing to forgive all of his past evil deeds no matter if they exceed the drops of water in the ocean islam teaches muslims that god holds them responsible for their intentions and not necessarily for their deeds this is revealed by the prophet muhammad pbuh in the following saying which was narrated by umar ibn al khattab in sahih al bukhari the prophet pbuh said o people the reward of deeds depends upon the intentions and every person will get the reward according to what he has intended so whoever emigrated for allah and his messenger then his emigration was for allah and his messenger and whoever emigrated to achieve a worldly benefit or for a woman to marry then his emigration was for that which he emigrated for the good deed and the evil deed are not alike repel the evil deed with one which is better the noble qur'an fussilat verily allah does not forgive that a partner should be ascribed unto him he forgives all save that to whom he will whoso ascribes partners to allah he has indeed invented a tremendous sin the noble qur'an al nissa whatever of misfortune strikes you it is what your right hands have earned and he forgives much the noble qur'an al shurah and those who when they do an evil thing or wrong themselves remember allah and implore forgiveness for their sins who forgives sins save allah only and they do not knowingly repeat the wrong they did the reward of such will be forgiveness from their lord and gardens underneath which rivers flow wherein they will abide for ever a bountiful reward for workers the noble qur'an a'al umran he knows the treachery of the eyes and that which the chests do hide the noble qur'an ghafir he is the one that accepts repentance from his servants and forgives sins and he knows all that you do the noble qur'an al shurah the likeness of those who spend their wealth in allah's way is as the likeness of a grain which grows seven ears in every ear a hundred grains allah gives manifold increase to whom he will allah is all embracing all knowing the noble qur'an al bakarah say my slaves who have been prodigal to their own hurt despair not of the mercy of allah who forgives all sins lo he is the forgiving the merciful turn unto him repentant and surrender unto him before there comes unto you the doom when you cannot be helped and follow the better guidance of that which is revealed unto you from your lord before the doom comes on you suddenly when you know not lest any soul should say alas my grief that i was unmindful of allah and i was indeed among the scoffers or should say if allah had but guided me i should have been among the dutiful or should say when it sees the doom oh that i had but a second chance that i might be among the righteous but now the answer will be nay for my revelations came unto you but you denied them and were scornful and were among the disbelievers the noble qur'an al zumar abu hurairah narrated that allah's messenger pbuh said when allah completed the creation he wrote in his book which is with him on his throne verily 'my mercy has overcome my anger' narrated in sahih al bukhari abu hurairah furhter narrated i heard allah's messenger pbuh saying allah has divided his mercy into one hundred parts and he kept ninety nine parts with him and sent down one part on the earth and because of that one single part his creatures are merciful to each other so that even the mare lifts up it's hoof away from it's baby animal lest it should trample it narrated in sahih al bukhari names of god the people of christianity have been taught to refer to their deity as god if you were to ask one of them what is your god's name they would respond god there are some exceptions they object to muslims worshipping allah and usually picture allah as some pagan god some of them will even go so far as to curse allah not realizing that they are cursing god now the question becomes where did the name god come from did jesus pbuh ever say god did moses pbuh ever say god no the jews and arabs are both semitic tribes which descended from one father abraham pbuh their languages are quite similar the old testament tells us that moses pbuh referred to god as el or elohiym jesus pbuh too referred to god using a similar construct jesus pbuh spoke aramaic however the ancient copies of the gospel available to us today are mostly written in greek very little of jesus' actual words have been preserved to this day however we do know from mark that jesus pbuh referred to god as eloi eloi is an aramaic word which means my god it is pronounced as el o ee' the arabs would say the same word as elahi pronounced el ah ee' so muslims refer to god with virtually the exact same word jesus pbuh used muslims are taught that allah almighty has more than one hundred names the most well known among them being allah these names are to be found in many places throughout the qur'an they embody the major characteristics of allah almighty such as the gracious the merciful the majestic the supreme etc these names are usually considered adjectives unless they are applied to allah himself in which case they are treated as proper nouns for instance allah's are the fairest names invoke him by them and leave the company of those who blaspheme his names they will be requited what they do the noble qur'an al aaraf say unto mankind supplicate unto allah or supplicate unto the 'rahman' compassionate merciful gracious unto whichever you supplicate it is the same his are the most beautiful names the noble qur'an al isra allah there is no god save him his are the most beautiful names the noble qur'an taha not equal are the companions of the fire and the companions of the garden the companions of the garden they are the triumphant had we sent down this qur'an on a mountain verily you would have seen it humble rent asunder for fear of allah such are the similitudes which we propound to humanity that they may reflect he is allah other than whom there is no other god he is the 'knower' of all things both the unseen and the seen he is the 'gracious' the 'merciful' he is allah other than whom there is no god the 'sovereign' the 'holy one' the source of 'peace ' the 'guardian of faith' the 'overseer ' the 'majestic ' the 'irresistible ' the 'supreme' glory be to allah highly exalted is he above the partners they attribute to him he is allah the 'creator ' the 'innovator ' the 'fashioner' his are the most beautiful names whatever is in the heavens and on earth do glorify him and he is the 'mighty' the 'wise' the noble qur'an al hashir
