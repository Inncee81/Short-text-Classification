church cancels memorial for gay navy vet this is ridiculous i am a hindu but i think christian church's forgiving nature is its most prominent feature i hope it has nothing to do with religious teaching just a matter of a particular church acting out of line is it so arlington texas a megachurch canceled a memorial service for a navy veteran hours before it was to start because the deceased was gay on yahoo today august it's possible if that local body is anything like a very small minority of folks who have no message of forgiveness and transformation in christ are quite bitter and seek to stir up trouble like fred phelp's church my pastor used to say just because someone goes to church doesn't make them a christian no more than if you lived in a garage you'd claim yourself to be a car what's more likely is that the mass media who are quite bias against those who hold to the traditional views in which america was built upon including granting their freedom to say anything they'd like was trying to make more out of this than was really there an example of this is if one insisted that the funeral be conducted as an advertisement for his chosen lifestyle to the media rather than remembering him as a veteran as well as all the other aspects of his life Westboro Baptist Church (Topeka) Baptist Roman Catholic Church Second Vatican Council Christianity Christian right Funeral A Course In Miracles Church of Christ, Scientist Religious pluralism Holy Orders Chinese in Singapore Sin Religion and sexual orientation Marriage Paul of Tarsus Lutheranism Cremation Roman Catholic Diocese of Honolulu Baptism Religious Society of Friends Evangelicalism Trinity Eucharist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints God Heaven Russian Orthodox Church Anglicanism Seventh-day Adventist Church Calvinism Christian denomination Fred Phelps EastEnders John F.
