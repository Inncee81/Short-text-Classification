how would you stop or slow women from having illegitimate children out of wedlock solutions people what could they be why are so many women having children out of wedlock is it lack of education is it no respect for a childs welfare as parent households are clearly more stable you misunderstand not blaming women but they are the ones having giving birth point taken about it takes to do this but you are misunderstanding the crux of the question i see this is a serious question i applaud you for it its a problem in society but the question you must ask first is why the problem exists there needs to be knowledge of the source of the issue before a solution is made the main problem is that children aren't told about the sacredness of sex between husband and wife by their parents typically they leave it up to teachers in school to teach them about sex education of a child is the parents responsibility and not some teacher when parents send their children off to school they are sacrificing them upon the altar of the god of this world if you observe school is the place where the thought of casual sex starts to form in the child's heart along with drugs and many other things not only that since the majority of the time the parents themselves don't have any idea the sacredness of sex then the disease of ignorance keeps passing on and on our society is screwed up where men are raised to be like women and women start to believe they are men feminists most households don't even have two parents anymore that type of home probably started to end in the s before sex became casual and the husband and wife started to become more like a mere cohabitation in addition to that the government has replaced the male as head of the house by providing a single female with children with what the husband should be providing there is so much to address in this topic but i won't have enough space but you are very much correct when you say that the two parent households are clearly more stable a single woman can not provide the level of discipline the man could nor could the man provide the level of nourishment that a women can with either one of those elements missing from the house will make it very unstable this whole topic is very sad and disturbing when you look at it one of the solutions is to teach our children the sacredness of sex marriage man and wife and stop leaving it up to school systems to educate children with what their parents should be providing peace update for nicole yes its the female having the baby but its the male putting the seed in her i know your question is why does the woman allow herself to become pregnant outside of marriage because the more she stays inside the males sphere of influence the more she becomes like him women are reflective and intuitive by nature they reflect the male they are with there is a reason why the fathers at the marriage ceremony have the roles they do they are symbolically giving their daughters to their husbands no longer will the daughter be dominated and protected by her father's energy field but by her husbands problem is the majority of men are so consumed by their lower head that the women they choose to be with eventually become like them still it all refers back to teaching our children what its like to be a proper male and female the sacredness of sex and marriage and so forth without the values forged in the child's mind there will be no change division is evil which is why god didn't call the second day of creation good and which is why adam and eve fell a man should never be separated from his wife if you notice in the book of job after all the trials and tribulations he went through his wife was never taken from him a woman is a males immediate savior his goddess and vice versa its a shame that most males don't know how to treasure women peace Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Same-sex marriage Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Feminism Separation of
