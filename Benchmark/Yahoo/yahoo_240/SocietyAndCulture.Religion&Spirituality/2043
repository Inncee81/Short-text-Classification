if there is a hell how can there be a heaven let's assume most christians have at very least one loved one that will be sent to hell according to thier beliefs if they don't have a single loved one who will go to hell well we aren't talking about them if your in heaven is it really heaven if you are aware of a loved one suffering in hell what if it's your spouse or child how can heaven be heaven knowing you have family in hell ok let me guess uh god poofs away painful memories well now you live in a place called heaven and you aren't even aware of your loved one's existence if you have any memory of them at all and they aren't with you in heaven then you would still be aware they are in hell so he would have to poof the memory of them completely which gets complicated because he has to erase every other memory attached to that person ect see how this explaination doesnt make sense or were you going to say 'he puts you in a mental state of mind where you believe the person is in heaven with you' that raises another problem if god can simply put you in a state of mind then why does he send anyone to hell in the first place if he doesn't have to why not grant every one a little 'virtual reality' heaven no one loses and everyone wins you might say because they don't deserve it but what of benevolence what of mercy think about it if we are talking about an 'individual state of mind' where there is no harm in granting heaven to 'sinners' and no one has to suffer in hell and this god is benevolent in that he does not want anyone to suffer then why does god sentence people to hell so i conclude that one of the following is true a heaven cannot exist because of the suffering caused by hell's existence b god erases memory of your family who may have been 'sinners' who are in hell erasing everything attached to them god gives people severe amnesia to ease pain of loved ones suffering in hell what kind of heaven is that and is it even possible c god unecessarily sentences people to hell when he doesnt have to making him unmerciful and malevolent now i do agree with you here that it is severely flawed when you look at it i don't believe in hell simply because i don't believe a loving god could create a place of eternal torment if going to heaven meant i was to forget my life no thank you Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Theodicy Sin A Course In Miracles Soul Problem of Hell Reincarnation Purgatory Justification (theology) Summa Theologiae Salvation Simone Weil Theory of conduct Heaven Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Charles Grandison Finney Divine grace Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Demon Emanuel Swedenborg Indulgence Jewish eschatology Love Capital punishment Predestination Eastern Orthodox Church The nature of God in Western theology Christian eschatology Dualism (philosophy of mind) Merit Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind S__ren Kierkegaard Afterlife Limbo Sant Thakar Singh Meaning of life Rich Mullins Paradise Lost Sikhism primary beliefs and principles Original sin Roman Catholic Church Abortion debate The Amber Spyglass Scientology beliefs and practices Problem of evil Angel Gospel of Thomas Reality Pitaten Transactional analysis God the Father Religious views of suicide Religious pluralism Angel Sanctuary Westboro Baptist Church (Topeka) Mortification of the flesh Atheism Calvinism Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Ascetical theology Arthur Schopenhauer Pascal's Wager Ten Commandments Genesis Creationism Characters of The Sandman Free will Opus Dei Epistemology Human Karen Horney Supernatural Narcissism Trimurti Kain (Legacy of Kain) Karma Universalism Clinical depression Church of Christ, Scientist Infantilism Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Religious conversion Gnosticism Annihilationism C.
