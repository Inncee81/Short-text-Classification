is the movie the secret based on any religion when i first heard of the secret i never really gave it much thought i watched a part of it mins on u tube and it's amazing but i am wondering if it has any religious values or connections is it more spiritual than religious or just superstitious does it affect peoples belief and or faith in god personally i think it explains how god religion and healings occur if you believe in something enough anything you can make many things happen whether religion is involved or not i don't think it's superstitious at all it's kind of spiritual in a way it's learning how to control the god in yourself if that makes sense i consider myself agnostic but have leaned towards for quite a few years now pantheism that we are all god it's not some invisible guy in the sky for me so the secret concept really meshed with my existing beliefs and it has worked for us really well omg once you start being positive for things and really wishing it's strange how things occur like in the video i even got several unexpected checks in the mail a hospital visit years ago resulted in an out of the blue clerical error in payment and i got all this money back from the hospital without any kind of notice pretty cool Supernatural Agnosticism Religion God Atheism Theology Evolutionary creationism Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Predestination A Course In Miracles The nature of God in Western theology Soul Alcoholics Anonymous Witchcraft Spirituality New Age Philosophy of religion Superstition Pantheism Animism Scientology beliefs and practices Human Resurrection of Jesus Existence of God Creationism Psychology of religion Immortality Theodicy Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Kabbalah Origin belief Sant Mat Idolatry Evil Great Apostasy Faith Mythology Miracle Confucianism Sant Thakar Singh Exorcism Liberal Christianity Pascal's Wager Afterlife Deity Dualism (philosophy of mind) Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Christian apologetics Unitarian Universalism Sathya Sai Baba Protestantism Israel ben Eliezer Religious Society of Friends God Emperor of Dune Philosophical skepticism Brahmanism Milton H.
