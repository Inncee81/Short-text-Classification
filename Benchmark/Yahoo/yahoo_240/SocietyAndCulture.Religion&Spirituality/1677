will god protect you from harm from evil will faith in god prayer and trying to do his will instead of evil help shield you from the assault of evil sinful people or will it only accelerate their efforts i've been around long enough to realize that evil is real and a very real force in our society many people are like that or don't care or are sinners many many many but will having god on your side help you in anyway from all of this evil or does god not interfere with earthly mortal affairs i've come to realize that much of the evil or sin that i see around me isn't really because the people's nature is inherently bad but more or less because life's not fair everything's so expensive and there are hardships and these people are just pushed to snap and stop caring and they may react out of jealousy fear etc the list goes on i don't think it's pure evil and pure good it's a mixed bag and i have yet to run into real satanists however there are many ppl who pride themselves in their wit intellect etc which is devoid of god and if you're not careful you can be a pawn in their game this world is a mind f ck and at least god can shield you or open your eyes to see what's really going on out there so you're not lost enough to fall into the tentacles of something sinful or satanic yes if you believe in him Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Evil Sin Original sin Satanism Incarnations of Immortality Israel ben Eliezer Merit Demon Satan Summa Theologiae Church of Christ, Scientist Reinhold Niebuhr LaVeyan Satanism A Course In Miracles Sub-Zero Angel Sanctuary John Howard Yoder Jehovah's Witnesses Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Justification (theology) Vishnu sahasranama Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Urantia Exorcism Ascetical theology Hell Divine grace Repentance Karma Indulgence Seven deadly sins Devil Bhagavad Gita Day-Age Creationism Predestination Demonology Theory of conduct RuneScape gods Alignment (role-playing games) Predestination (Calvinism) Roman Catholic Church Eastern Orthodox Church Jewish principles of faith Contrition Rayden Maimonides Simone Weil Armageddon S__ren Kierkegaard Karma in Hinduism Fallen angel Purgatory Zoophilia Religious pluralism Trinity School of Salamanca Angel Friedrich Schleiermacher Value system Charmed Mortification of the flesh Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters Theology Immortality Charles Darwin's views on religion Grimke Sisters Heaven Theosis Holocaust theology Salvation Religion Christian eschatology Charles Grandison Finney Michael (archangel) Jakob B__hme Sola fide Confession The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Raistlin Majere Death Note Soul Isaac Luria Ten Commandments Kyoryuu Sentai ZyuRanger Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Divine Providence Unemployment Godspell Jack (comic) John Wesley Ethics in the Bible Religion and sexuality Human nature Doom enemies
