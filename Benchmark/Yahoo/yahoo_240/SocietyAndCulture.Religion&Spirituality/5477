are the neo pagan paths spiritually advantageous because they encourage one to develop one s own ideologies as opposed to adopting a creed or formula developed by some external group of people yes and no it is said of religious movements that the first generation receives the vision and invents the forms the second generation hears about the vision and learns the forms the third generation hears about the forms so in that sense spiritual and religious traditions need constantly renewed within each generation while i admire neopaganism's spiritual openness and emphasis on personal gnosis and revelation i sometimes think the buffet approach of picking some of this some of that from various indigenous and historical folkways and traditions based on what works is inherently self limiting at its best the quest for revelation eliminates the need for validation yes but at its worst it lacks discipline and shows profound disrespect for the cultures from which it steals millennia old wisdom becomes a cool new toy for the self obsessed i think everyone develops their own private ideology within whatever path they choose every thinking questing individual anyway for myself i find that i experience greater growth as an individual by working within a specific ethnocultural and historical worldview and tradition think of it this way i could learn any number of meditation techniques that work learning the way my norse ancestors accomplished the same ends whether it looks like meditation or not and finding my path within that is more difficult and the difficulty is what teaches Neopaganism Spirituality Yoga Satanism Christianity Alcoholics Anonymous Religious Society of Friends Buddhism Gnosticism God Rudolf Steiner Conservatism Hinduism Magic (paranormal) Germanic Neopaganism Past teachings of Prem Rawat Culture A Course In Miracles Human Religious pluralism Roman Catholic Church Meditation Trinity Prayer Psychology of religion Taoism Anthroposophy Reincarnation Black (people) Subud Reiki Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Ten Commandments Modern Orthodox Judaism Vipassana Tai Chi Chuan Book of Revelation Martial art Mysticism Music genre Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Torah Umadda Sri Aurobindo Conservative Judaism Postmodernism Neofascism and religion Soul Pacifism Coercion Jewish principles of faith Second language acquisition Sociocultural evolution Socrates Abrahamic religion Gautama Buddha Kabbalah Religious studies Meaning of life Ethics in religion Sant Mat Counter-Reformation Adi Da Guru-shishya tradition Sociology of religion Meme Kundalini Ch__gyam Trungpa Ideology Strategic management Resurrection of Jesus John G.
