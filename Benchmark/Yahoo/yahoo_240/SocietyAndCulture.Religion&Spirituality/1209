do jehovah's witness or mormons believe that christians will go to heaven just wondering even though they don't believe in their doctrine and when i mean christians those who were born again of the spirit and accepted jesus christ as lord and savior i guess i should add will christians who believe that jesus is god go to heaven or in mormonism celestial heaven not terrestrial we mormons believe that any person christian jw jew buddhist whatever who repents of their sins and accepts the gospel will have the opportunity to receive their just rewards heaven can be one of the three levels of degrees of glory celestial terrestrial telestial and all will be judged according to their works and faith in christ in my own personal opinion those who claim to be saved are taking away the requirement of justice i do not believe any person can know of their salvation unless personally visited by jesus christ and told they will have a place in the celestial kingdom we all inherit immortality that is a free gift but not all will inherit exaltation that requires more than accepting christ as your savior Salvation Baptism Heaven Book of Mormon Jesus Sola fide Abrahamic religion Mormonism and Christianity Justification (theology) Christian eschatology Mormonism and Judaism Endowment (Mormonism) Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Trinity Religious perspectives on Jesus Soul Priesthood (Mormonism) Church of Christ Celestial Kingdom Holy Spirit Mary, the mother of Jesus Eastern Orthodox Church Original sin Christian views of Jesus Charles Grandison Finney Resurrection of Jesus Ten Commandments Joseph Smith, Jr. Religious conversion Theosis Roman Catholic Church Paul of Tarsus God Hell Harrowing of Hell Epistle to the Romans Great Apostasy Excommunication Revelation Articles of Religion (Methodist) History of the Latter Day Saint movement A Course In Miracles Blacks and Mormonism Adam-God theory Sabbath Mass (liturgy) Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Infant baptism Baptist Catechism Chosen people Binitarianism Gospel of Thomas Second Coming Jehovah's Witnesses Repentance Protestantism Religious pluralism Dispensationalism Angel Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite) Sin Alan Campbell (pastor) Godhead (Mormonism) Christian and Missionary Alliance Calvinism Christ Ordinance (Mormonism) Restorationism Christian Book of Isaiah Criticism of Mormonism New Testament Salvation Army Noah United Methodist Church Catholicism Christmas Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Apostle Purgatory Free will Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief End times Religion Michael (archangel) True Jesus Church Christadelphians
