are only families with one mom one dad ideal could you tell a dead vet's kid his family wasn't ideal when conservatives say the ideal family consists of one father and one mother do they realize they are marginalized families where one parent died like perhaps a father who was killed in iraq could you tell a child of a dead war vet his family was not ideal what about a two opposite sex parent family where one parent is highly abusive wouldn't a single parent non abusive environment be better what about a two opposite sex parent family where both parents abuse narcotics wouldn't a stable financially secure loving same sex family be a better environment with so many one mother and one father families that are broken up by death and divorce or that have one or both parents as abusive neglectful drug addicted crazy etc isn't unrealistic to restrict children to a one mother and one father family i'm of the opinion that ideal families come with one single loving and capable parent or two loving and capable parents should we retire the every child deserves one mother and one father sloganeering especially since people like bush who use that slogan has torn so many families apart and sent so many parents to their deaths in iraq i agree with barbara when she says this is conservatives trying to push their own agenda i guess it can be hard to grasp that what is best in your own mind isn't necessarily the objective ideal there are perfectly functional families with one mother and one father but also countless dysfunctional families with traditional parents the same goes for single parents and same sex couples you can't make a blanket statement and expect it to accurately describe the group in every single instance and i can't even tell you how audacious i find it when people try to say that adoptions should only be allowed for opposite sex couples there are so many children out there in need of good parents of any number and gender to try and impose your own personal ideals on the situation could be depriving a child of a happy life i was raised by a single mom and i consider myself to be a strong well grounded woman who always sticks to her guns i'm pretty sure my mom couldn't have done a better job if there was a man in the picture Narcissism Laura Schlessinger About a Boy Knots Landing Gender role Family Kurt Cobain Polyamory Infantilism Same-sex marriage Abortion debate Theory of conduct Kodocha Intelligence quotient One Tree Hill (TV series) Cindy Sheehan Adoption Transsexuality Pedophilia EastEnders Humphrey Bogart Married... with Children Marriage The Marshall Mathers LP 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Barbara Boxer Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Friends South Park Plame affair Sexual orientation Domestic violence Good Times Abortion Fred Phelps Nudity Children of God Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Dead Like Me Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Sexual dysfunction Phoebe Buffay's songs Pitaten Terri Schiavo Microeconomics Reparative therapy Poker jargon MPAA film rating system Incest North American Man/Boy Love Association History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Motion picture rating system Sex and the City Masculism Moral Politics Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Paul Hackett Recurring South Park characters Shaggy dog story Rick Santorum Paternalism Child sexuality Economic inequality MoveOn Sex Karl Rove Objectivist philosophy Fathers' rights movement in the UK Autism Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Killian documents Human sexual behavior Ten Commandments Democratic Party (United States) U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 U.S. presidential election, 2004 Queer as Folk (U.S.) Karen Horney The Catcher in the Rye Value system Child sexual abuse Conservatism Political correctness Order of succession Opus Dei Ex-gay Adult attention-deficit disorder Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles and Fundamental Duties of India The Fairly OddParents Transactional analysis Boston Public Borderline personality disorder Serial killer 2004 Republican National Convention Federal Marriage Amendment
