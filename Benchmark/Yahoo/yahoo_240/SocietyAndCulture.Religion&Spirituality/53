part of our analysis of this situation please look it over and give your opinion inshallah as we can see how things have gotten way out of hand with this situation i forgive the rev albert einstein but i don't really understand his intentions because they are quite malicious rev let not the unbelievers think they will ever get away they have not the power to do so muster against them all the men and cavalry at your command so that you may strike terror into the enemy of allah and your enemy prophet muhammed rouse the faithful to arms if they the non muslims incline to peace accept islam make peace with them sura ankaboot wala yahsabanna allatheena kafaroo sabaqoo innahum la yuaajizoona and let not the disbelievers be relieved that they might have escaped the attention of allah for they will never manage to escape his attention waaaaiddoo lahum ma istataaatum min quwwatin wamin ribati alkhayli turhiboona bihi aaaduwwa allahi waaaaduwwakum waakhareena min doonihim la taaalamoonahumu allahu yaaalamuhum wama tunfiqoo min shay in fee sabeeli allahi yuwaffa ilaykum waantum la tuthlamoona and make ready for them all the armed forces whom you can muster and horses tethered throwing a scare in the hearts of allah's enemies and your enemies and of others besides them whom you do not know but whom allah knows whatever you spend for allah's cause you will get it back in full and there would be no short falls for you wa in janahoo lilssalmi faijnah laha watawakkal aaala allahi innahu huwa alssameeaau alaaaleemu and if they incline towards truce you too incline towards truce and put your trust in allah verily he hears everything and knows everything wa in yureedoo an yakhdaaaooka fa inna hasbaka allahu huwa allathee ayyadaka binasrihi wabialmu mineena but if their aim is to cheat
