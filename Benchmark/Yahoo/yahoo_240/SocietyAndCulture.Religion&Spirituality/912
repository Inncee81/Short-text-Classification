can someone explain this part of evolution to me i'm not astute at these sort of dicsussion but just want some opinions if people evolved from cells or rock or whatever the begining source was how did that source have life i mean even if it was a cell the cell had to be alive right so where did that life come from at some point matter turned from non living to living i guess the confusing thing to me is how life can come from non life the short answer is at this time we don't know how life began in the first instance it appears to have happened within the first few hundred million years of the earth's existence and has almost certainly changed its basic form several times over the millennia as from rna based to dna based the original traces have been rather thoroughly scrambled by subsequent life as well as by the natural processes of tectonics and erosion and i doubt that we will ever know the answer for sure but if you've got a worldwide laboratory and millions of years to experiment strange things can happen once life began evolution took over to create the enormous panoply of life that we see today an excellent read on the earth's evolutionary history is Evolution Biology Francis Crick Flood geology Evidence of evolution Life Creationism DNA Intelligent design Species Cell (biology) Macroevolution History of evolutionary thought Plate tectonics Virus Young Earth creationism Evolutionism Human Creation-evolution controversy History of science Science Solar cell Genetic code RNA world hypothesis Meaning of life Biodiversity Human skin color Theory Gene Teleological argument Molecular evolution Origin belief Geology History of creationism Supernatural Solar system DNA repair Old Earth creationism Senescence Biochemistry Sri Aurobindo Artificial life Panspermia Kryptonite HIV Mutation Philosophical skepticism RNA Molecular biology Altruism Irreducible complexity Human evolution Immortality Sociocultural evolution Transcription (genetics) Answers in Genesis Morphogenetic field Polymerase chain reaction Meme Gaia theory (science) Cambrian Explosion Reproduction Age of the Earth The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex James Hutton Natural selection God Richard Feynman Specified complexity Big Bang Stellar evolution Junk DNA Bioinformatics Earth Sequencing Y chromosome Abiogenic petroleum origin Action potential Software engineering Fermi paradox Creation biology Snowball Earth Many-worlds interpretation Dualism (philosophy of mind) The Origin of Species Sant Thakar Singh Xenomorph Religion Cerebellum Cradle of Humanity Atomism Created kind Climate change Conway's Game of Life
