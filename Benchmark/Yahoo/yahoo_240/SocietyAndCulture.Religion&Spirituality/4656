serious mental illness your thoughts i am not looking to antagonize anyone i am curious what people of different faiths atheism agnosticm included think about serious mental illnesses like schizophrenia manic depression major depression could you include your faith so that i can get that idea i find it hard to believe that you are not doing this to antagonize or to push buttons i think that any type of serious mental illness should be handled by those who are more educated and have the knowledge to deal them a mental illness does not define a person nor their spiritual beliefs it is a medical condition that needs treatment there are some diseases such as alcoholism and addictions that are defined to be an obsession of the mind and an allergy of the body and if one goes with that belief the only apparent solution to that problem would be in my opinion a step program this seems to have been working for people for almost a century now the step program claims that we are spiritually bankrupt that once the spiritual malady is overcome then the physical and emotional will follow where i have found this to be true there are still those in recovery who suffer from depression mania etc and need medical treatment and medicines to stabilize them either way any and all of it is a sickness and not one suited for religion to cure i do not take part in organized religion i consider myself an eclectic solitary pagan witch and you blessed be o trinity Bipolar disorder Alcoholics Anonymous Psychosis Clinical depression Medicine Schizophrenia Mental illness Religion Psychopharmacology Psychiatry Church of Christ, Scientist Insomnia Addiction Homeopathy Dissociative identity disorder Christianity Charles Darwin's illness Scientology Alcoholism Hypoglycemia Shamanism Scientology beliefs and practices Atheism Natural health Wicca Drug abuse Chronic fatigue syndrome Immortality Involuntary commitment Mind control Mania Witchcraft Transsexuality Mental Health Act 1983 Sigmund Freud Sexual orientation Reiki Anorexia nervosa Magic (paranormal) Electroconvulsive therapy Psychology Belief Traumatic brain injury Autism Prayer Psychotherapy Anti-psychiatry History of medicine Clomipramine Stroke Palliative care Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Drug addiction Decompression sickness Psychiatric hospital Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Twelve-step program Magical thinking Mental health Soul William James New Age Psychoanalysis Psoriasis Hypnosis Supernatural Buddhism Pseudoscience Meditation Common cold Psychology of religion Therianthropy Rudolf Hermann Lotze Post-traumatic stress disorder Neopaganism Allergy Transpersonal psychology Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Demonic possession Mental retardation Trinity Meaning of life Psychosurgery Reparative therapy Obsessive-compulsive disorder Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Traditional Chinese medicine DSM-IV Codes Combat stress reaction
