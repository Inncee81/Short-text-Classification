turned off by christianity if you are not a christian why aren't you one not being offensive just curious what are your reasons for not being a christian i think it is because a large number of people who claim to be christians give us true christians a bad rap i have heard from so many atheists and non believers in general that many people try to force beliefs on them remember that we chose god because he first chose us thessalonians but we ought always to give thanks to god for you brothers beloved by the lord because god chose you as the firstfruits to be saved through sanctification by the spirit and belief in the truth and this verse always knocks my sock off especially the last part acts and when the gentiles heard this they began rejoicing and glorifying the word of the lord and as many as were appointed to eternal life believed and as many as were appointed to eternal life believed think about that if someone is not appointed to eternal life and god has not chosen to save them we need to pray for them and love them this is a good explanation of what a true christian is many people who claim to be christians but aren't does have a lot to do with pride as well as pleasing people instead of god webster s dictionary defines a christian as a person professing belief in jesus as the christ or in the religion based on the teaching of jesus while this is a good starting point in understanding what a christian is like many secular definitions it falls somewhat short of really communicating the biblical truth of what it means to be a christian the word christian is used three times in new testament acts acts peter followers of jesus christ were first called christians in antioch acts because their behavior activity and speech were like christ it was originally used by the unsaved people of antioch as a kind of contemptuous nickname used to make fun of the christians it literally means belonging to the party of christ or an adherent or follower of christ which is very similar to the way webster s dictionary defines it unfortunately over time the word christian has lost a great deal of it significance and is often used of someone who is religious or has high moral values instead of a true born again follower of jesus christ many people who don t believe and trust in jesus christ consider themselves christians simply because they go to church or they live in a christian nation but going to church serving those less fortunate than you or being a good person does not make you a christian as one evangelist once said going to church doesn t make one a christian anymore than going to a garage makes one an automobile being a member of a church attending services regularly and giving to the work of the church cannot make you a christian the bible teaches us that the good works we do cannot make us acceptable to god titus tells us that it is not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to his mercy he saved us through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the holy spirit so a christian is someone who has been born again by god john john peter and has put their faith and trust in jesus christ ephesians tells us that it is by grace you have been saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god a true christian is someone who has repented of his or her sin and put faith and trust in jesus christ alone their trust is not in following a religion or a set of moral codes or a list of do s and don ts a true christian is a person who has put his or her faith and trust in the person of jesus christ and fact that he died on the cross as payment for sins and rose again on the third day to obtain victory over death and to give eternal life to all who believe in him john tells us but as many as received him to them he gave the right to become children of god to those who believe in his name a true christian is indeed a child of god a part of god s true family and one who has been given new life in christ the mark of a true christian is love for others and obedience to god s word john john to god be the glory i hope this answer helped Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) John the Baptist Mormonism and Judaism Messianic Judaism Christianity and anti-Semitism Urantia Christian views of women End times
