how does god teach you the truth of his word the lord gives me revelations of his word how does he teach you what a neat question thankx god teaches thru so many ways he teaches thru his holy word line upon line precept upon precept all leading to the full glorious plan of god we must know the word to know what it means and to hear from god about his perfect plan for all of us god shows me much in the word when we study scripture and not just read it the word comes alive the living word of god and boy do the windows of heaven just open up with truth oh yes god shows me much also thru talking to him thru prayer i ask god to show me more and he does so much new revelation comes especially coming thru heavenly prayer language directed by the holy spirit answers will just come to give me knowledge of all the things i am seeking the more i do bible study and prayer the more god shows me just all so real and relavent for me in my life and things i am to share with others also god teaches me thru experience in life i learn from watching others and god talks to me and i learn from the things i myself experience of just how i went wrong or right sometimes we will miss gods blessings due to an area we just didnt fully undersatnd yet but he persevers and continues to teach us god also teaches me thru another way that is just so huge and powerful at one point god really got thru to me it took awhile that when we sin it seperates us from god and until we come back we dont hear him nor does he hear us till we repent and go back to him so many blessings are lost during this time blessings still come from obedience and disobedience still leads to curse god made us to be overcomers not helpless pathetic little christians that say oh i cant do this or that with god all things are possible and jesus' shed bllood on the cross gives us the annointing power to live as he lived and do all he did its commanded of us to live unto perfection as jesus did but its taught that we cant yes we can dont limit gods power its not of ourselves ifs of jesus christ amen when we will obey as we know now to obey and surrdner our wills daily to his we will see major chagne as soon we are becoming more like jesus and then his desires become our own an dits easy to say no to sin as its as vile to us as it is to god does that mean we have reached perfection not yet but if we keep doing it his way we will we wont know it but he will we dont strive to be good enough for god noone is nor do we obey to stay out of hell god knows our heart we obey from love just as jesus did the father knwoing he knows best and we are thrilled to follow him all the way count it all as joy not oh i gotta do this no you dont gotta do anything folks if you arent in obedience joyfully you may as well not be there god knows the heart and we never fool him if you desire to sin you arent like jesus but if we give him our desires and do as he says even when our desires arent right then he will change them god showed me clearly that when we live in obedience thats when we can really learn t the most as there is no bondage of sin to block any of it once i got this and began to live in the kingdom of god as jesus did then god was able to really begin to talk to me and show me the even bigger picture of the gospel kingdom living obedience is the key to learning we dont strive to be good enough for god we strive to be just like jesus with gods leading the entire time just as he commanded us to do the current grace message is bullonie without grace noone can be saved always been like that thats the message of the cross but grace covered past sins and sins we dont know are sins now also will cover sins you are truly working on to overcome as you are still doing as god says grace does not cover willfull deliberate continued sin and then saying grace has me co vered jesus also died for us to overcome sin what do we have to offer the world if we are just like them this is a message god has given me in dreams and visions and speakly right to me that we are to tell the world grace saves and obedience keeps you saved amen Opus Dei A Course In Miracles Church of Christ
