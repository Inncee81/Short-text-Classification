what makes humans so special why is it so hard for creationists to accept the fact that we're the most advanced species of great ape is it that they don't want to be associated with smelly dirty animals we aren't that different from apes you know ever heard of koko the gorilla she can use sign language and has taught it to other gorillas koko likes to care for animals and when one of her cats died she showed sad emotions for days afterwards she has shown concern over the poaching of gorillas and has even created words for things she hasn't been taught for example she put the signs for finger and bracelet together when she couldn't say ring she knows over words in gorilla sign language and can understand even more words in english if koko can communicate think and show emotion what makes her any different from a human other than the fact that she looks different and can't speak humans are not special though they me too have developed a sense of superiority toward all other life forms perhaps this is the product of evolution in that the early hominids that did not think themselves better than other organisms did not acknowledge their prerogrative to comprimise the ability of other species to live in order to sustain a more than comfortable lifestyle themselves if that does not accurately explain what happened i have confidence in other evolutionary explanations i have heard of the gorilla koko and just now as i am writing find it shocking that despite the amazing signs of complexity and so on demonstrated by many different species humans recognize such qualities only in a select few animals e g koko i am suggesting an anthro proclivity toward suppressing the evidence of complexity in other animals this occurs so much that people are impressed with animals like koko in terms of creationism the intelligent design theory or story i am not sure how people refer to it one of the things i find interesting is the dichotomy of religious people a group to which i do not ascribe you some are creationists isn't that interesting that considering many have lost faith in god to create the world but still consider themselves religious a term creationism has been invented to set aside a group of religious people who acknowledge god as one higher being that created what we see as we see it we are witnessing the evolution of religion it suits the religious educated science oriented people to choose which parts of religion work for them i wonder if there are any signs of koko believing in a higher being then again an obvious prerequisite is suffering it is unlikely that the caretakers of koko will create such a situation oops what a tangent Human Evolutionary creationism Evolution Ape Creation-evolution controversy Evolutionism History of creationism Intelligent design Teleological argument Religion Supernatural Teach the Controversy Person God Intelligent design movement Great Ape language Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Human evolution Atheism Soul Lie Creation science The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Olduwan Gorilla Meme Bigfoot Phillip E.
