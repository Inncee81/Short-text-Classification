can you please explain to me this excerpt from gaudium et spes man judges rightly that by his intellect he surpasses the material universe for he shares in the light of the divine mind by relentlessly employing his talents through the ages he has indeed made progress in the practical sciences and in technology and the liberal arts in our times he has won superlative victories especially in his probing of the material world and in subjecting it to himself still he has always searched for more penetrating truths and finds them for his intelligence is not confined to observable data alone but can with genuine certitude attain to reality itself as knowable though in consequence of sin that certitude is partly obscured and weakened the intellectual nature of the human person is perfected by wisdom and needs to be for wisdom gently attracts the mind of man to a quest and a love for what is true and good steeped in wisdom man passes through visible realities to those which are unseen our era needs such wisdom more than bygone ages if the discoveries made by man are to be further humanized for the future of the world stands in peril unless wiser men are forthcoming it should also be pointed out that many nations poorer in economic goods are quite rich in wisdom and can offer noteworthy advantages to others it is finally through the gift of the holy spirit that man comes by faith to the contemplation and appreciation of the divine plan in the depths of his conscience man detects a law which he does not impose upon himself but which holds him to obedience always summoning him to love good and avoid evil the voice of conscience when necessary speaks to his heart do this shun that for man has in his heart a law written by god to obey it is the very dignity of man according to it he will be judged as i understand it the first part praises the accomplishments of man in this world however all earthly accomplishments must be directed toward heaven which is our true home the second part speaks of the conscience it's part of our human nature placed in our hearts by god and we will be judged by how well we follow it Summa Theologiae Simone Weil Merit Religion Eastern Orthodox Church A Course In Miracles Ten Commandments Urantia Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Soul Jewish principles of faith Friedrich Schleiermacher Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Salvation Church of Christ, Scientist Trinity Philo Sola fide Meaning of life Original sin Duties of the Heart God Reinhold Niebuhr Theodicy Zohar Revelation Angel Divine grace Justification (theology) Rudolf Hermann Lotze Socrates Bah__'__ Faith John Howard Yoder Mortification of the flesh Moral objectivism Charles Grandison Finney Articles of Religion (Methodist) Opus Dei Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Bah__'__ Faith and Science Aristotle Sin Second Vatican Council Predestination Human nature Reality Calvinism Sabbath Roman Catholic Church Christian apologetics Supernatural Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Religious pluralism Al-Ghazali Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Buddhism Jewish philosophy Holy Spirit Age of Enlightenment Bhagavad Gita Sri Aurobindo S__ren Kierkegaard Zoroastrianism Clement of Alexandria Reincarnation Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Mormonism and Christianity Eucharist Past teachings of Prem Rawat Ayyavazhi mythology Church of Christ Heaven Alignment (role-playing games) Great Apostasy Philosophy Christian eschatology Evolutionary creationism Michel Henry Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Theology Emanuel Swedenborg Pharisees Book of Mormon Victor Cousin Human Rosicrucian Fellowship Mary, the mother of Jesus Conscience Arthur Schopenhauer Jehovah's Witnesses John Wycliffe
