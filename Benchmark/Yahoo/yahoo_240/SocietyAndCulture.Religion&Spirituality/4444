do christians have to believe that all other religions are going to hell i want to hear from christians real sincere christians who do not believe this i know you're out there help me prove that the stereotypes about your religion are wrong sincere answers only no christian bashing i am trying to get past my own negative stereotypes and prejudices and i will be asking a series of questions like this some of them may sound silly these are sincere questions not intended to offend but to help me get past my own stumbling blocks i'm not looking to convert just to understand jesus loved people as they were and he loved people who were outcasts in his society and his example is what should guide us he asked us only to love god and to love others as we would wat to be loved i want to be loved the way jesus would love me if he met me right here and now with all my failings not judging or condemning but with compassion and not correcting me but helping me i really do not believe that jesus would say that other people who understand god differently would go to hell because i know there is no such place and he told us to love each other the way we would want to be loved i would not want someone else to try to turn me away from following jesus i would want them to support me in doing that the best way i can to be the best witness by my life to the love that jesus wants us to give each other and so if i am going to love my meighbor as myself then what i ought to do for buddhists is to help them be the best buddhist they can be or hindus or anyone at all not to preach or judge but to love them and from that love help them be faithful and devout and to love god the way they understand god Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Salvation God Urantia Religion Sin Religious conversion Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Paul of Tarsus Christianity Religious perspectives on Jesus Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Trinity Abrahamic religion Sola fide Christian-Jewish reconciliation Atheism Jewish views of religious pluralism Opus Dei Afterlife Catechism Gautama Buddha Past teachings of Prem Rawat Soul Hell Charles Grandison Finney Resurrection of Jesus Justification (theology) Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Religion and sexual orientation Religious views of suicide Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Nation of Islam John the Baptist Rich Mullins Biblical inerrancy Bible and reincarnation New Testament Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Religion and sexuality Christian eschatology Repentance Meaning of life Evangelicalism Baptism Restorationism Judaism Church of Christ, Scientist Four Quartets InterFaith Sant Thakar Singh Roman Catholic Church Origin belief Contrition Divine grace John Howard Yoder New Testament view on Jesus' life Mary, the mother of Jesus Hinduism Theology George Fox Witchcraft History of Christianity Love Christianity and anti-Semitism The Pilgrim's Progress Second Coming Homosexuality and Christianity Judas Iscariot Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Messianic Judaism Sant Mat Jehovah's Witnesses Qiyamah Religious Society of Friends B.
