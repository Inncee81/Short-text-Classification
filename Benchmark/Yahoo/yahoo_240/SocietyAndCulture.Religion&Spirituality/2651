god isn't alive god cannot live quit saying god is alive explain yourself ppl considering god exists god is an eternal thing existance being etc god doesn't live because god was never born and can never die god hasn't a life god simply exists god cannot be alive and well because god always was and always will be therefore the term alive doesn't work god must always be well because god is everything and if god weren't well everything would cease to exist if you insist on saying god is alive and well you'll have to explain the idea much better because it makes no sense whatsoever you seem to have a common misconception about god people often think of god as being found throughout the universe or as been everywhere the opposite is true all of the universe and everywhere is found insde of god but he transcends both those concepts by so much that they are nearly insignificent compared to him to state that god is alive is probably less accurate then to state that god is life the only reason anything or anyone else has life is because it is included inside of god who is life itself so he is able to birth other forms of life within himself and his universe the concept that life has to have a beginning exist only within the confines of a material or physical universe when you transcend that universe origin or beginning is no longer an issue life would exist without an origin or a birth as long as you try to confine god within the physical or the limits of time and space you are right that he would be an illogical idea once you understand that time and space are simply a small part of him the logics of his existence is simple The nature of God in Western theology Soul Creationism God Cosmological argument Deconstruction Existence of God Free will Arthur Schopenhauer Atheism Predestination Intelligent design Critique of Pure Reason Reincarnation Friedrich Schleiermacher Phaedo Falsifiability Theology Abortion debate Immortality Immanuel Kant Atomism Logic Brahman Meaning of life Origin belief Christian eschatology Creation-evolution controversy Biblical inerrancy A Course In Miracles Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Simone Weil Miracle Transcendental argument for the existence of God Summa Theologiae Evolutionary creationism Trinity Time travel Eastern Orthodox Church Presuppositional apologetics Omnipotence Sant Thakar Singh Original sin Michel Henry Problem of universals Bah__'__ Faith and Science Existence Determinism S__ren Kierkegaard Idealism Religion Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Where Mathematics Comes From Metaphysics Sin Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief John Wycliffe Physical law Philosophy of language Urantia Theodicy Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Mantra Yoga Sutras of Patanjali G__del's incompleteness theorem Force (Star Wars) Hinduism Creation science Pratitya-samutpada Causality Supernatural Monotheism Justification (theology) Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Al-Ghazali Merit Strong atheism The World as Will and Representation Ontological argument Theory of conduct RISC A New Kind of Science Joseph Campbell Tamriel Second Vatican Council Resurrection of Jesus Eternity Jacob Neusner Theosis Human nature Pantheism Afterlife Objectivist philosophy Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions
