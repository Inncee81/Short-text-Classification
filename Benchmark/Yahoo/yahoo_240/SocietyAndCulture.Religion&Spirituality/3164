can you give me your interpretation of the prophecy of ezekiel chapters and i am asking out of curiosity as to what others might think i have the interpretation but i would like to compare it to others god be with you the reverend william m butler st luke ministries ezekiel and corresponds to many other verses in the bible that's what matters what the rest of the bible states about ezekiel and peter stated that no prophecy springs from private interpretation the bible would explain the bible and when it comes to ezekiel and many other parts of the bible correspond to the pieces of the puzzle that it provides many verses hundreds almost i could go on for pages regarding the cross references for instance in vs it talks about the latter years the last days as well as the nation of israel vs talks about god's people israel seeming to be totally undefended just those few facts corresponds to many many other prophecies regarding the final part of the days the last days armageddon and how everything will play out the clues are there that lead to other verses many many things in ezekiel and point to other portions of the bible the bible explains itself but what does vs talk about everyone on the surface of the earth this seems to indicate something that would affect not just the literal israel and surrounding area but everyone on the planet states that all the nations would understand what was going on again this seems to indicate something earth wide as with many prophecies of the hebrew scriptures the initial fulfillment also sees secondary and even third fulfillments for example much of what is in and seems to cross reference to other verses such as at jeremiah the slain of yahweh shall be at that day from one end of the earth even to the other end of the earth they shall not be lamented neither gathered nor buried they shall be dung on the surface of the ground from one end of the earth to the other end of the earth though much of jeremiah dealt with israel many time s jeremiah made statements about god declaring a new covenant jeremiah with israel that would not include the law coventant this new covenant jesus established and was later extended to even gentiles in fullfilment of what god promised abraham in genesis that eventually all nations of the earth would bless themselves because of abrahams obedience paul explained that this new israel in galatians was the israel of god and even included non jews in a physical sense that the bride of christ was really israel john stated that a global war would take place jesus stated in matthew that the tribulation would occur on account of the holy ones and the world would be spared on their account spiritual israel is the annointed sons of god who will rule as king priests in heaven over those on the earth galatians revelation john they are comprised of both literal jews as well as gentiles who are chosen by god at the end of the last days satan the devil will attack these ones and release gods final anger from one end of the earth to the other end of the earth as the web bible states at that time the paramount issue is known as jesus said in the model prayer that the name of the father be cleared of lies what is stated over and over and over again throughout ezekiel what could be called it's theme because throughout the book it is stated again and again and again and again that the nations shall know that i am yahweh as one of those times is stated the nations shall know that i am yahweh who sanctifies israel when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them forevermore ezekiel Mormonism and Judaism Creationism Cultural and historical background of Jesus Book of Daniel Apostle Judaism Rapture El (god) Ezekiel Idolatry Jewish Messiah Book of Malachi Messiah King James Version of the Bible Christian Identity Documentary hypothesis God Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Saint Peter Noah Summary of Christian eschatological differences Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Christianity and anti-Semitism Devil Mary, the mother of Jesus Linguistics and the Book of Mormon Jews as a chosen people Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Moses Christian views of Jesus Gospel of Barnabas Historical Jesus Creation according to Genesis Infant baptism Apocrypha Origen Pharisees Book of Zephaniah Roman Catholic Church Soul Gospel of Thomas Jewish symbolism New Testament view on Jesus' life Gospel of Mark Apocalypse Kabbalah Deuteronomy Nation of Islam Land of Israel Homosexuality and Christianity Sin Religious conversion Acts of the Apostles Covenant Theology Adam-God theory
