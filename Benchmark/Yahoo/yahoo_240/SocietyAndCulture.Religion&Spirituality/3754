what's the religious point of view about plastic surgery since always i've felt that i wanted some i was too young when i started to think about that and i used to feel the necesity for the time to go fast and be and finally do it now that i am i haven't moved a finger about it mostly because i'm not sure if god is agrees with it it's affecting your natural way the way he made me when i was younger i wanted to make some dramatic changes that thankfully i don't think i'd do anymore especially after seeing that ashlee simpson stuff i think it's sick to change so dramatically the way you are the only think i'd still considering would be a rhinoplasty aka nose job anyways i have that little feeling of fear for god about it althought my way of thinking about surgery have changed a lot the idea of a little work in the nose makes me kind of happy is there an scripture in the bible and or the bom that talks about that why would it be wrong to do it as your friend i would advise against this as you said god made you the way you are for a reason plastic surgery is no picnic they had a special on it on nbc one night and it is actually a pretty scary thing most people who have it have to go back in later and have it done again and very few of these people are ever satisfied they usually want more the scriptures tell us to live in the world but not of the world i think that would apply here society tells us we can't be beautiful unless we look like this or have this this shows us where are world is heading besides you are beautiful and if other people can't see that then they are the one with the problem just be grateful for who you are a daughter of god hope i was of some help The Ashlee Simpson Show Theory of conduct Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism John the Baptist Religion Evil Goodness and value theory Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Plastic surgery Rhinoplasty Ashlee Simpson Fundamentalism Religious Society of Friends Church of Christ, Scientist Time Out of Mind Sabbath Friedrich Schleiermacher Merit Theology Bhajan Love The nature of God in Western theology Paula Jones Transsexuality Supernatural Sant Thakar Singh Phaedo Dualism (philosophy of mind) A Course In Miracles Social rule Presuppositional apologetics Rich Mullins David Hume Knots Landing Simone Weil Existence of God Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses MTV Reaction to Darwin's theory Discordianism John Wesley Salad Fingers Christian eschatology Ethics God Shaggy dog story John Wycliffe Cliff Richard Philosophical skepticism The Amber Spyglass K' Characters in the Smurfs Autobiography (Ashlee Simpson album) Fasting Kodocha Romulus and Remus Friends Legalism (theology) Sin City Philo George Fox Sant Mat Homosexuality and Christianity Year of the Spider Protestantism Justification (theology) Book of Isaiah EastEnders Anti-Mormonism Charles Darwin Modern geocentrism Philipp Melanchthon Predestination Omnipotence Microeconomics Abington School District v.
