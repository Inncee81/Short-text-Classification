curious about something please answer honestly please answer this question without looking at any of the answers below or checking a reference do plants breathe oxygen yes and no plants don't breath in the way a person breathes since they don't have lungs but the gases do pass through the skin of the leaf during the day plants take in carbon dioxide co which through photosynthesis they turn into food for themselves and excrete o or oxygen back into the atmosphere since photosynthesis requires light sunlight specifically in order to operate during the night the plants take in small amounts of oxygen and excrete out co but this is far less than the amount of o they produce basically without the sunlight used to create food and oxygen the plants are forced to do what we do and take in some oxygen in order to keep themselves alive so how is that remembering my biology courses from many years ago in the second semester we had to catch and dissect a triceratops Carbon dioxide Photosynthesis Ecology Rebreather Biochemistry Plant Lung Carnivorous plant Respiratory system Renewable energy Scuba set Sun Stoma Oxygen Botany Energy development Solar power Drowning Earth's atmosphere Leaf Decompression sickness Pulmonary alveolus Homeostasis Sunlight Carbon dioxide sink Methanol Sewage treatment First aid Snowball Earth Ozone depletion RuBisCO Breathing gas Breath Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Fire fighting Miller-Urey experiment Oxygen toxicity Hydroelectricity Ozone hole Bacteria Air pollution Radiocarbon dating Bird Cyanide Water (molecule) Gas metal arc welding Hydroponics Planetary habitability Hydrogen economy Apnea Permian-Triassic extinction event Diving cylinder Oxygen sensor Chlorophyll Global warming and agriculture Carburetor Venus Lake Alternative biochemistry Terraforming Hyperbaric oxygen therapy Swimming Biosphere 2 Coal Welding Greenhouse gas Water Power station Carbon cycle Paleoclimatology Effects of global warming Explosive material The Ark in Space Global warming Redox Mosquito Reptile Algae Alcohol fuel Liquid breathing Gas bladder Alkane Fossil fuel power plant Xenon Gas exchange Hyperventilation Origin of life Gasification CO2 retention Rainforest Carbon Combustion Fish farming Pebble bed reactor
