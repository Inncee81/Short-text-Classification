with the blood of the slain it was not alone the spectacle of headless bodies and mutilated limbs strewn in all directions that roused the horror of all who looked upon them still more dreadful was it

that all jews above the age of ten had been forced to wear in the year columbus set sail to conquer a new world more than jews were expelled from spain many died on their way mm chmielnitzki massacres in poland about jews were slain do i feel sick this goes on and on century after century right into the kilns of auschwitz native peoples beginning with columbus a former slave trader and would be holy crusader the conquest of the new world began as usual understood as a means to propagate christianity within hours of landfall on the first inhabited island he encountered in the caribbean columbus seized and carried off six native people who he said ought to be good servants and would easily be made christians because it seemed to me that they belonged to no religion sh while columbus described the indians as idolators and slaves as many as the crown shall order his pal michele de cuneo italian nobleman referred to the natives as beasts because they eat when they are hungry and made love openly whenever they feel like it sh on every island he set foot on columbus planted a cross making the declarations that are required the requerimiento to claim the ownership for his catholic patrons in spain and nobody objected if the indians refused or delayed their acceptance or understanding the requerimiento continued i certify to you that with the help of god we shall powerfully enter in your country and shall make war against you and shall subject you to the yoke and obedience of the church and shall do you all mischief that we can as to vassals who do not obey and refuse to receive their lord and resist and contradict him sh likewise in the words of john winthrop first governor of massachusetts bay colony justifieinge the undertakeres of the intended plantation in new england to carry the gospell into those parts of the world and to raise a bulworke against the kingdome of the ante christ sh in average two thirds of the native population were killed by colonist imported smallpox before violence began this was a great sign of the marvelous goodness and providence of god to the christians of course e g the governor of the massachusetts bay colony wrote in as for the natives they are near all dead of the smallpox so as the lord hath cleared our title to what we possess sh on hispaniola alone on columbus visits the native population arawak a rather harmless and happy people living on an island of abundant natural resources a literal paradise soon mourned dead sh the surviving indians fell victim to rape murder enslavement and spanish raids as one of the culprits wrote so many indians died that they could not be counted all through the land the indians lay dead everywhere the stench was very great and pestiferous sh the indian chief hatuey fled with his people but was captured and burned alive as they were tying him to the stake a franciscan friar urged him to take jesus to his heart so that his soul might go to heaven rather than descend into hell hatuey replied that if heaven was where the christians went he would rather go to hell sh what happened to his people was described by an eyewitness the spaniards found pleasure in inventing all kinds of odd cruelties they built a long gibbet long enough for the toes to touch the ground to prevent strangling and hanged thirteen natives at a time in honor of christ our saviour and the twelve apostles then straw was wrapped around their torn bodies and they were burned alive sh or on another occasion the spaniards cut off the arm of one the leg or hip of another and from some their heads at one stroke like butchers cutting up beef and mutton for market six hundred including the cacique were thus slain like brute beasts vasco de balboa ordered forty of them to be torn to pieces by dogs sh the island's population of about eight million people at the time of columbus's arrival in already had declined by a third to a half before the year was out eventually all the island's natives were exterminated so the spaniards were forced to import slaves from other caribbean islands who soon suffered the same fate thus the caribbean's millions of native people were thereby effectively liquidated in barely a quarter of a century sh in less than the normal lifetime of a single human being an entire culture of millions of people thousands of years resident in their homeland had been exterminated sh and then the spanish turned their attention to the mainland of mexico and central america the slaughter had barely begun the exquisite city of tenochtitln mexico city was next sh cortez pizarro de soto and hundreds of other spanish conquistadors likewise sacked southern and mesoamerican civilizations in the name of christ de soto also sacked florida when the th century ended some spaniards had moved to the americas by that time probably more than natives were dead sh of course no different were the founders of what today is the us of amerikkka although none of the settlers would have survived winter without native help they soon set out to expel and exterminate the indians warfare among north american indians was rather harmless in comparison to european standards and was meant to avenge insults rather than conquer land in the words of some of the pilgrim fathers their warres are farre less bloudy so that there usually was no great slawter of nether side indeed they might fight seven yeares and not kill seven men what is more the indians usually spared women and children sh in the spring of some english colonists found life among the generally friendly and generous natives attractive enough to leave jamestown being idell did runne away unto the indyans to live among them that probably solved a sex problem governor thomas dale had them hunted down and executed 'some he apointed sic to be hanged some burned some to be broken upon wheles others to be staked and some shott to deathe' sh of course these elegant measures were restricted for fellow englishmen this was the treatment for those who wished to act like indians for those who had no choice in the matter because they were the native people of virginia methods were different when an indian was accused by an englishman of stealing a cup and failing to return it the english response was to attack the natives in force burning the entire community down sh on the territory that is now massachusetts the founding fathers of the colonies were committing genocide in what has become known as the peqout war the killers were new england puritan christians refugees from persecution in their own home country england when however a dead colonist was found apparently killed by narragansett indians the puritan colonists wanted revenge despite the indian chief's pledge they attacked somehow they seem to have lost the idea of what they were after because when they were greeted by pequot indians long time foes of the narragansetts the troops nevertheless made war on the pequots and burned their villages the puritan commander in charge john mason after one massacre wrote and indeed such a dreadful terror did the almighty let fall upon their spirits that they would fly from us and run into the very flames where many of them perished god was above them who laughed his enemies and the enemies of his people to scorn making them as a fiery oven thus did the lord judge among the heathen filling the place with dead bodies men women children sh so the lord was pleased to smite our enemies in the hinder parts and to give us their land for an inheritance sh because of his readers' assumed knowledge of deuteronomy there was no need for mason to quote the words that immediately follow thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth but thou shalt utterly destroy them deut mason's comrade underhill recalled how great and doleful was the bloody sight to the view of the young soldiers yet reassured his readers that sometimes the scripture declareth women and children must perish with their parents sh other indians were killed in successful plots of poisoning the colonists even had dogs especially trained to kill indians and to devour children from their mothers breasts in the colonists' own words blood hounds to draw after them and mastives to seaze them this was inspired by spanish methods of the time in this way they continued until the extermination of the pequots was near sh the surviving handful of indians were parceled out to live in servitude john endicott and his pastor wrote to the governor asking for 'a share' of the captives specifically 'a young woman or girle and a boy if you thinke good' sh other tribes were to follow the same path comment the christian exterminators god's will which will at last give us cause to say how great is his goodness and how great is his beauty thus doth the lord jesus make them to bow before him and to lick the dust ta like today lying was ok to christians then peace treaties were signed with every intention to violate them when the indians 'grow secure uppon sic the treatie' advised the council of state in virginia 'we shall have the better advantage both to surprise them cutt downe theire corne' sh in sixty heavily armed englishmen cut down defenseless indian men women and children sh in a single massacre in king philip's war of and some indians were destroyed a delighted cotton mather revered pastor of the second church in boston later referred to the slaughter as a 'barbeque' sh to summarize before the arrival of the english the western abenaki people in new hampshire and vermont had numbered less than half a century later about remained alive a destruction rate of the pocumtuck people had numbered more than fifty years later they were down to destroyed the quiripi unquachog people had numbered about fifty years later they were down to destroyed the massachusetts people had numbered at least fifty years later barely were alive destroyed sh these are only a few examples of the multitude of tribes living before christian colonists set their foot on the new world all this was before the smallpox epidemics of and had occurred and the carnage was not over then all the above was only the beginning of the european colonization it was before the frontier age actually had begun a total of maybe more than million indians of both americas were destroyed in the period of to as an average two thirds by smallpox and other epidemics that leaves some million killed directly by violence bad treatment and slavery in many countries such as brazil and guatemala this continues even today more glorious events in us history reverend solomon stoddard one of new england's most esteemed religious leaders in formally proposed to the massachusetts governor that the colonists be given the financial wherewithal to purchase and train large packs of dogs 'to hunt indians as they do bears' sh massacre of sand creek colorado colonel john chivington a former methodist minister and still elder in the church i long to be wading in gore had a cheyenne village of about mostly women and children gunned down despite the chiefs' waving with a white flag killed from an eye witness account there were some thirty or forty squaws collected in a hole for protection they sent out a little girl about six years old with a white flag on a stick she had not proceeded but a few steps when she was shot and killed all the squaws in that hole were afterwards killed sh more gory details by the s in hawai'i the reverend rufus anderson surveyed the carnage that by then had reduced those islands' native population by percent or more and he declined to see it as tragedy the expected total die off of the hawaiian population was only natural this missionary said somewhat equivalent to 'the amputation of diseased members of the body' sh th century church atrocities catholic extermination camps surpisingly few know that nazi extermination camps in world war ii were by no means the only ones in europe at the time in the years also in croatia existed numerous extermination camps run by catholic ustasha under their dictator ante paveli a practising catholic and regular visitor to the then pope there were even concentration camps exclusively for children in these camps the most notorious was jasenovac headed by a franciscan friar orthodox christian serbians and a substantial number of jews were murdered like the nazis the catholic ustasha burned their victims in kilns alive the nazis were decent enough to have their victims gassed first but most of the victims were simply stabbed slain or shot to death the number of them being estimated between and in a rather tiny country many of the killers were franciscan friars the atrocities were appalling enough to induce bystanders of the nazi sicherheitsdient der ss watching to complain about them to hitler who did not listen the pope knew about these events and did nothing to prevent them mv catholic terror in vietnam in vietnamese freedom fighters the viet minh had finally defeated the french colonial government in north vietnam which by then had been supported by u s funds amounting to more than billion although the victorious assured religious freedom to all most non buddhist vietnamese were catholics due to huge anticommunist propaganda campaigns many catholics fled to the south with the help of catholic lobbies in washington and cardinal spellman the vatican's spokesman in u s politics who later on would call the u s forces in vietnam soldiers of christ a scheme was concocted to prevent democratic elections which could have brought the communist viet minh to power in the south as well and the fanatic catholic ngo dinh diem was made president of south vietnam mw ff diem saw to it that u s aid food technical and general assistance was given to catholics alone buddhist individuals and villages were ignored or had to pay for the food aids which were given to catholics for free the only religious denomination to be supported was roman catholicism the vietnamese mccarthyism turned even more vicious than its american counterpart by diem promulgated a presidential order which read individuals considered dangerous to the national defense and common security may be confined by executive order to a concentration camp supposedly to fight communism thousands of buddhist protesters and monks were imprisoned in detention camps out of protest dozens of buddhist teachers male and female and monks poured gasoline over themselves and burned themselves note that buddhists burned themselves in comparison christians tend to burn others meanwhile some of the prison camps which in the meantime were filled with protestant and even catholic protesters as well had turned into no nonsense death camps it is estimated that during this period of terror at least were wounded mostly in street riots people were executed had been detained or tortured and about were sent to concentration or detention camps mw to support this kind of government in the next decade thousands of american gi's lost their life christianity kills the cat on july anneliese michel a year old student of a teachers college in germany died she starved herself to death for months she had been haunted by demonic visions and apparitions and for months two catholic priests with explicit approval of the catholic bishop of wrzburg additionally pestered and tormented the wretched girl with their exorcist rituals after her death in klingenberg hospital her body was littered with wounds her parents both of them fanatical catholics were sentenced to six months for not having called for medical help none of the priests was punished on the contrary miss michel's grave today is a place of pilgrimage and worship for a number of similarly faithful catholics in the seventeenth century wrzburg was notorious for it's extensive witch burnings this case is only the tip of an iceberg of such evil superstition and has become known only because of its lethal outcome sp rwanda massacres in in the small african country of rwanda in just a few months several hundred thousand civilians were butchered apparently a conflict of the hutu and tutsi ethnic groups for quite some time i heard only rumours about catholic clergy actively involved in the rwanda massacres odd denials of involvement were printed in catholic church journals before even anybody had openly accused members of the church then in the newscast of s aktuell germany a station not at all critical to christianity the following was stated anglican as well as catholic priests and nuns are suspect of having actively participated in murders especially the conduct of a certain catholic priest has been occupying the public mind in rwanda's capital kigali for months he was minister of the church of the holy family and allegedly murdered tutsis in the most brutal manner he is reported to have accompanied marauding hutu militia with a gun in his cowl in fact there has been a bloody slaughter of tutsis seeking shelter in his parish even two years after the massacres many catholics refuse to set foot on the threshold of their church because to them the participation of a certain part of the clergy in the slaughter is well established there is almost no church in rwanda that has not seen refugees women children old being brutally butchered facing the crucifix according to eyewitnesses clergymen gave away hiding tutsis and turned them over to the machetes of the hutu militia in connection with these events again and again two benedictine nuns are mentioned both of whom have fled into a belgian monastery in the meantime to avoid prosecution according to survivors one of them called the hutu killers and led them to several thousand people who had sought shelter in her monastery by force the doomed were driven out of the churchyard and were murdered in the presence of the nun right in front of the gate the other one is also reported to have directly cooperated with the murderers of the hutu militia in her case again witnesses report that she watched the slaughtering of people in cold blood and without showing response she is even accused of having procured some petrol used by the killers to set on fire and burn their victims alive s as can be seen from these events to christianity the dark ages never come to an end
