lose your life to find it jesus and john appear to be monastic how do you see it the book at http gospelenigma com makes a strong case that jesus and john the baptist and the apostles were monastic and were encouraging others to seek god who is unseen which is a monastic endeavor it appears to me that jesus pulled the apostles away from their families how do you see it i see it according to what the scriptures have to say matthew and when jesus entered peter's house he saw his mother in law lying sick with a fever corinthians do we not have the right to take along a believing wife as do the other apostles and the brothers of the lord and cephas peter corinthians but because of the temptation to sexual immorality each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband the husband should give to his wife her conjugal rights and likewise the wife to her husband for the wife does not have authority over her own body but the husband does likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body but the wife does do not deprive one another except perhaps by agreement for a limited time that you may devote yourselves to prayer but then come together again so that satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self control some few people have been given the gift of celibacy but not many matthew and i say to you whoever divorces his wife except for sexual immorality and marries another commits adultery the disciples said to him if such is the case of a man with his wife it is better not to marry but he said to them not everyone can receive this saying but only those to whom it is given for there are eunuchs who have been so from birth and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by men and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven let the one who is able to receive this receive it Eastern Orthodox Church Roman Catholic Church Religion and sexuality Clerical celibacy Apostle Paul of Tarsus Mary Magdalene Saint Peter Church of Christ New Testament Baptism Christian view of marriage Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Sola fide Aramaic of Jesus Ten Commandments Marriage Mary, the mother of Jesus John Howard Yoder Gospel of Thomas Dispensationalism John the Baptist Polygamy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Homosexuality and Christianity Women in Islam Trinity Priesthood (Mormonism) History of Christianity Historical Jesus Saint James the Just Christian views of Jesus Sabbath Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Didache Sermon on the Mount Holy Spirit Catholicism Jehovah's Witnesses Plural marriage Acts of the Apostles Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Baptist Christian views of women Franciscan Salvation Eucharist Matthew 5:32 Abrahamic religion Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses History of sex Clergy Divorce John Wesley Book of Mormon Liberal Christianity Matthew 5 Christianity Biblical canon Ethics in the Bible Mass (liturgy) Soul Origen Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Canonical hours Christian eschatology Abortion debate Biblical inerrancy Harrowing of Hell John Wycliffe Sharia Asceticism Alan Campbell (pastor) Satan Martin Luther Mormonism and Christianity Religious conversion Bishop Original sin Divine grace Primacy of the Roman Pontiff Community of Christ Children of God Arjuna Apocrypha A Course In Miracles Cultural and historical background of Jesus Articles of Religion (Methodist)
