question about god and religion i was raised with a family that each parent had a different religion i get confused sometimes with those things my question is why should god care if we worship him or not if we are nothing compared to him isn't he more superior than humans why should he care so much if we insignificant humans worship him thank you in advance thats a good question well i thnk he shoudl care bc worshipin him shows that we are devoted to him and that we are really trying to be with him in heaven lets use this as an example when a women has a baby she imediatly has an attachment towards the baby god created us isnt that the same thing god wants us all to to make it to heaven and if worshiping him does that well then i thnk he would be quite happy Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism God Meaning of life Origin belief Religion Mary, the mother of Jesus Idolatry Athanasian Creed Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Ten Commandments Human Religious pluralism Swami Vivekananda Neopaganism Roman Catholic Church Angel Abortion debate Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Urantia Demon Heaven Trinity Soul El (god) Fundamentalism Chosen people Virgin Mary in Islam Qiang Theodicy The nature of God in Western theology Philosophy of religion Confucius Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Satan Devil Monotheism Deity Reincarnation Angel Sanctuary Judaism Justification (theology) Rich Mullins Idolatry in Christianity Humphrey Bogart God Emperor of Dune Kyle Broflovski Saint Bhakti Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Infant baptism Kuzari Prayer Fallen angel Bah__'__ Faith Afterlife Cult Baal Maya mythology Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Revelation Animism Patriotism Thomas Carlyle Ramakrishna Evangelicalism Free will Cult (religion) Laura Schlessinger Paul of Tarsus Confucianism Summa Theologiae Worship Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Sant Thakar Singh LaVeyan Satanism Angels in Islam Adam and Eve El (Canaanite god) God and gender Church of Christ Fasting Philosophical skepticism Ontological argument Book of Isaiah Goddess worship Pysanka David Hume Mithraism Gnosticism Apostles' Creed Storytelling Emanuel Swedenborg Socrates John the Baptist Sola fide Pitaten Christian eschatology Opus Dei The Second Coming (TV)
