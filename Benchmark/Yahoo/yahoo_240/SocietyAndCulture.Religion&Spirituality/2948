how is it possible that over different authors that make up the bible how is it possible that they all wrote pretty much the same story what is your opinion my opinion is the origin of the english bibles of today can be traced to a time when men supposedly under the divine inspiration of god first wrote the books of the bible before the fourth century ce there were more that different gospels some of which can be found on the gnostic apocrypha page many were officially outlawed during the council nicaea in ce and the council of laodicea in ce these councils eventually agreed on what is now considered the word of god under the direction of constantine collating the accepted teachings into a single comprehensive book the entire bible that is declared to be the 'word of god' is only the word of the few men that attended the councils of nicea cmw they are in harmony because the same group of men created what you see today in your bible disprepancies phoenix after all the council was made up of human men humans make mistakes i disagree with you but even given your explanation you leave wide open the entire mystery where did these men come up with the books they were to cannonize the books of the bible are by authors in languages in countries and about occupations spanning over years the fact that they are in such incredible harmony is the miracle those who wrote in babylon did not have a cell phone with which to contact those in egypt for example edit sorry but respectfully you are missing the point those men did not write the books the books existed or they could not have gathered them together Biblical canon Bible Trinity Gospel of John Eastern Orthodox Church First Council of Nicaea Gospel Book of Mormon Biblical inerrancy A Course In Miracles Gospel of Thomas Acts of the Apostles Abrahamic religion Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Origen Jesus Christianity Creation according to Genesis Coptic Christianity Divine grace Binitarianism John Wycliffe History of Christianity Heresy Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Nicene Creed Church of Christ Gospel of Mark Great Apostasy History of the English Bible Arianism Sabbath Documentary hypothesis Aramaic language Eusebius of Caesarea Satan Arius King James Version of the Bible Bible translations Book of Daniel Old Testament Gnosticism Authorship of the Johannine works Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Timeline of Christianity Angel Bible and reincarnation Dating the Bible Christian apologetics Icon Gospel of Barnabas Tetragrammaton Mormonism Mary, the mother of Jesus Creationism Cultural and historical background of Jesus Names and titles of Jesus Idolatry Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Book of Isaiah Guide for the Perplexed Original sin Deuteronomy Nontrinitarianism Maimonides Miracle Thomas (Apostle) Apocalyptic literature Resurrection of Jesus Soul Philo Church of Christ, Scientist Christian views of Jesus Christian denomination Charles Taze Russell The Bible and history Secret Gospel of Mark Alan Campbell (pastor) Talmud Kabbalah Filioque clause End times Paul of Tarsus Moses
