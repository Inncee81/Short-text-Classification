can a person that has faith in god sin what i mean is do you have to lose faith or trust in god before you sin i realize that a person can sin after they become a christian i think though that before a person actually sins they stop believing first adam and eve doubted god first and then proceeded to sin if they had believed god they would not have sinned everyone falls and most of us get back up i believe that it's a lack of trust that allows us to sin think about it if we all trusted god completely there would be no sin among christians Sin Theodicy Justification (theology) Eastern Orthodox Church Infant baptism Original sin Theosis Divine grace The Fall of Man Baptism Heaven Sola fide Salvation Indulgence Reinhold Niebuhr Roman Catholic Church Trinity Baptist The Pilgrim's Progress Articles of Religion (Methodist) Abrahamic religion Fallen angel Faith Predestination Imputed righteousness Evil Devil God John Wesley Immaculate Conception Perseverance of the saints Summa Theologiae Lutheranism Hyper-Calvinism Confession Calvinism Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Prevenient grace Epistle to the Romans Book of Isaiah Christian and Missionary Alliance Charles Grandison Finney Holiness movement Resurrection of Jesus Jehovah's Witnesses Urantia Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Religious pluralism Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Demon Irenaeus S__ren Kierkegaard Historicity of Jesus Religious conversion Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Church of Christ, Scientist Jakob B__hme A Course In Miracles United Methodist Church Fasting Satan Christianity Homosexuality and Christianity Philipp Melanchthon Covenant Theology Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Prophet Total depravity Virtue Adam and Eve Catholicism Albrecht Ritschl Christian Identity Independent Christian Churches/Churches of Christ Paul of Tarsus Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Christian Unitarianism John Howard Yoder Endowment (Mormonism) Religion Soul Sabbath Priesthood (Mormonism) Immortality Creationism Demonology Gospel of Thomas Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Mormonism Believers baptism Idolatry Holy Spirit Genesis Antichrist Atheism Evangelicalism Christian ecumenism
