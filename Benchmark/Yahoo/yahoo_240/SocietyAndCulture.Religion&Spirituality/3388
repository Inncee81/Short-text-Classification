to protestants why is it when a person is interested in learning catholicism you discourage that person what are you so afraid of why don't you wait until your opinions are asked i'm really wondering this is a serious question please no rude answer thank you wordoflifeb answer this why can't you protestants wait til that person who's interested in catholicism ask for your opinion what are you so afraid of jason s i said no rude answers but i guess that's too much to ask from the likes of you in my observation the ones who try to scare people away from catholicism usually fall into two camps those who are misinformed about catholicism and those who believe in salvation by assent i think anyone who's been around r s much is familiar with the sorts of wild misconsceptions some people have about catholicism so i'll concentrate on the matter of salvation by assent most protestant denominations lutherans and anglicans excepted believe that salvation is initiated though an act of assent on the part of an individual as you probably know we in sacramental churches believe that no person is capable of such assent unless his inner man is already regenerate catholics illustrate this belief vividly in the immaculate conception which they believe was necessary so that mary to whom christian baptism was not yet available would be capable of assenting to the conception of jesus at the annunciation since sacramental churches do not believe that salvation comes by an act of assent we are not considered true christians by non sacramental protestants since they believe that we do not preach the real gospel they consider us to be false churches so it's understandable that they would want to scare people away from us i include myself in this because those on that side who understand what lutherans believe think we're almost as bad as catholics Infant baptism Salvation Protestantism Sacrament Divine grace Catholicism Eucharist Mary, the mother of Jesus Catechism Sola fide Eastern Orthodox Church Baptist Holy Orders Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Christianity Christian denomination Philipp Melanchthon Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Anglicanism Religious pluralism Church of Christ Ordination of women Papal Infallibility Evangelicalism Religious conversion Lutheranism Confession Holy Spirit Sin Great Apostasy Trinity Christian Paul of Tarsus Christianity and anti-Semitism Ten Commandments Transubstantiation Saint Calvinism Heresy Counter-Reformation Church of Christ, Scientist Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod Apocrypha Confirmation (sacrament) Born again Biblical inerrancy Minister of religion Traditionalist Catholic Evangelical Lutheran Church in America Huldrych Zwingli History of Christianity Original sin Christian theological controversy Dispensationalism Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Apostles' Creed Christian apologetics Anabaptist Merit Abrahamic religion Indulgence Catholic sacraments A Course In Miracles John Wycliffe Salvation Army Priest Clergy Liturgical year Protestant Reformation Community of Christ Alan Campbell (pastor) Believers baptism Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Soul Real Presence Second Vatican Council Fasting Homosexuality and Christianity Heaven Pope Christian eschatology Religion and abortion Clerical celibacy Mass (liturgy)
