why do some people consider adapting a theory to fit the facts wrong a scientist say newton comes up with an idea say gravity he does many experiments and concludes that this force does in fact exist he observes the facts things fall thrown objects fall in a parabolic pattern etc he puts all of this together and forms the theory of gravity meaning that this is how he thinks it works and that although he can't prove it nothing we as a species know about the way things work contradicts that theory now lets wait a couple hundred years another scientist say einstein learns some stuff the stuff he has learned is fact like things falling he cannot deny these facts but they for once do not fit into newton's theory did einstein toss out newton's theory og gravitation no he changed it he took the known facts and made a theory that worked with everything we as a species know about the way things work this did not negate the theory of gravity it refined it to make it more true why is that a bad thing alleninthehills gravity is still a fact the change was in our understanding of how it works the same applies for yesterday's news about evolution it's only bad to people who feel they have to have the answer to everything these are the people that say things like the telephone is the devil those pictures in the tv are the devil cell phones are the devil computers are the devil etc etc when ever a new invention is made available to the public and it changes the way people live their lives everyone else can live with changes and can incorporate new findings into our lives we're the ones that try the new stuff thus encouraging scientists and engineers to further refine their ideas driving innovation that eventually makes computers smaller faster more powerful and less expensive of course over time the people who rejected the new stuff have kids who grow up with the new stuff all around them but still carry the biases instilled by their parents against innovation they accept what's there because it was there as they grew up but reject what's new because just like the innovations of their parents time today's innovation is new to them does religion play a part only so much as the views held by the religious leader that feeds them their beliefs if he she says that a thing is bad and backs it up with scripture no matter how vague the followers will accept that view as truth if the religious leader embraces change then so will her his followers in this regard the religious leader acts as the parent in the relationship giving guidance to his her children and instilling her his values into them teaching them to embrace them as their own science isn't bad innovation isn't bad people simply get locked into a way of thinking that makes them think it's bad we see the question every day if science is bad why do theists use modern technology the answer they grew up with it and can't don't know how to live without it it's change that they truly have a problem with having to embrace a new way of thinking when they've invested so much into the beliefs that they already hold edit alleninthehills the article you're referring to is not new news the theory that there are several branches instead of one long chain has been being discussed for years just because you see an article that says that evolution is being challenged does not mean that the new evidence proves the bible that's like saying that when your mechanic finds out that the fuel pump is causing the problem instead of the transmission you should throw out the car and invest in a flying carpet Intelligent design Supernatural Meme Logic Atheism Creation-evolution controversy Culture Goodness and value theory Sociocultural evolution Scientific method Ethics Isaac Newton Black hole Faster-than-light Human Modern geocentrism General relativity Theory of conduct Evolutionary creationism Luminiferous aether Technology Postmodernism Richard Feynman Intelligent design movement Physics The nature of God in Western theology Theodicy Determinism Special relativity Causality Flood geology Epistemology Existence of God Evolution Origin belief Quantum mechanics Evolutionism Creation science Sexual orientation Mass Speed of light Fundamentalism Teach the Controversy Species God Philosophy of space and time Free will Young Earth creationism Franz Boas Charles Darwin's views on religion Biblical inerrancy Modified Newtonian dynamics Equivalence principle Church of Christ, Scientist Francis Crick Phillip E.
