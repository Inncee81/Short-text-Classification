if evolution is so factual then why is it always subject to change and do what they call re test itself eventually and even now the original theory has been debunked to many times to have a solid foundation so through new findings the family tree has to be re vamped if it was fact it would never change so how can it be both ways without a bunch of new theories in the name of re testing itself be fact in the first place you really do need much more faith in evolution than the consistant fact of creation look at the new findings always thwarting the old theory and testing and re testing and re thinking of ways to keep the faith alive this is what the so called intellctual part of this belief comes from alway thinking of ways to keep evolution alive that re creating evolution again and again is the only true evolution taking place there is no solid foundation and without that the house falls well the house has fallin and all you are doing is rummaging through the rubble of fallen theory trying to rebuild with an occasional new x that does not fit anywhere fact is not fact you see the lame excuses above and below this is proof that evolution is subject to change how can fact change and then change then change and then change again and again it had to become a non fact when discovery of new findings exposed the lie so until you have all parts of your scattered puzzle don't try and pitch it as fact by the time all the pieces are put together it won't be called evolution anymore it will probably be called creationism or something like it at least that is the trend right now Creation-evolution controversy Scientific skepticism Evolution Creation science Mathematics Origin belief Sociocultural evolution God Evolutionism Day-Age Creationism Kitzmiller v.
