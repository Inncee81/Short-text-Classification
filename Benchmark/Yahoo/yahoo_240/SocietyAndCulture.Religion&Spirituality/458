why is there such a big deal with christians and mormons there just seems to be some kind of dispute between the two religious sects every other time someone wants to talk about them both i know they follow a ton of the same commandments and have similar moral values but what's the big deal i have many christian and mormon friends i have the feeling it doesn't matter what your religion is as long as if you're a good person but why such the big deal the big deal is that mormons have an additional book of scripture called 'the book of mormon' which contains as they believe another testimony of christ mainstream christianity rejects the claims and beliefs of mormons because they do not appear to be in harmony with the bible mormons believe the bible is only good as far as it has been interpreted correctly that essentially the bible is corrupted and that the bom is the most correct book on earth funny thing is they make similar claims the muslims do about the quran add to that joseph smith whom mormons claim as their prophet a lot of mainstream christianity rejects smith as a prophet but claims he was a charlatan and adulterer a con man and criminal we're not ever going to get away from 'warring religious factions' that is just the way people are remember the saying the church believers in christ would be perfect if it weren't full of people Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Book of Mormon Mormonism Mormonism and Christianity Fundamentalism Biblical canon Mormon Linguistics and the Book of Mormon Restorationism Christianity Prophet Religion Priesthood (Mormonism) History of the Latter Day Saint movement Religious perspectives on Jesus Church of Christ Community of Christ Trinity Islam Abrahamic religion Baptism Sabbath Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Chosen people Anti-Mormonism Jesus Criticism of Mormonism Mormonism and Judaism First Vision Religious conversion Bible Ten Commandments End times Polygamy Heresy Messianic Judaism Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Biblical inerrancy Blacks and Mormonism Joseph Smith, Jr. Jehovah's Witnesses Latter Day Saint History of Christianity Nation of Islam Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Homosexuality and Christianity Millerites Apocalypse Baptist New Testament Godhead (Mormonism) Liberal Christianity Curse and mark of Cain Noah Qur'an Christian Identity Judaism Controversies regarding The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Reincarnation Archaeology and the Book of Mormon Angel Endowment (Mormonism) Creationism Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Christianity and anti-Semitism Second Coming Latter Day Saint movement Nontrinitarianism Adam-God theory Apocrypha Church of Christ, Scientist Christian eschatology Christian denomination Protestantism God and gender Discordianism Cult President of the Church (Mormonism) Religious pluralism Resurrection of Jesus Christian views of Jesus Nazarene Heaven Christian anarchism Religious Society of Friends Sin House of Joseph Church of Christ (Mormonism) Young Earth creationism Separation of church and state Charles Grandison Finney Original sin Jewish principles of faith Predestination
