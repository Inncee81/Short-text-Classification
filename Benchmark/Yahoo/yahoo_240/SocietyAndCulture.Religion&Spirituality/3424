how can a physical body exist in a non physical realm some people are saying that jesus's body the one made of atoms and molecules which was supposedly brought back to life after being dead for days is now in heaven well how can physical atoms and molecules exist in a non physical realm of existence surely the whole point of the supernatural is that it does not consist of natural physical things is it not atoms and molecules are physical and require a physical realm in which to exist which part of the story do we have to give up in order to make this work exactly we may not know the physics of imaginary ville but we have a better than fair understanding of the way things work in the known universe things like friction molecular bonding and newton s rd law every action has an equal and opposite reaction in practical terms for example that means no being natural or supernatural can both move an object say open a door and have the ability to pass through the object or door in a ghost like manner in order to move something or just to move your physical being you must be able to apply force to something physical so not only is your position correct but so is its opposite a spiritual entity cannot interact in our world anything that messes around in our world has to leave physical evidence and that means we can track it down and kick the snot out of it Supernatural Physics Newton's laws of motion Classical mechanics Energy Chemistry Summa Theologiae Science Atomism Explosive material Force Mass Origin belief Friedrich Schleiermacher Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Temperature Computational chemistry Religion The nature of God in Western theology Gravity Meaning of life Water (molecule) Polymer Immortality Francis Crick Vacuum Molecule Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Quantum mind Intelligent design Nature Rudolf Hermann Lotze Equivalence principle A Course In Miracles Determinism Emergence Animism Philosophy of mathematics Creationism Nuclear magnetic resonance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Umbra (World of Darkness) Scientific method Causality Ghost Appeal Person Moral objectivism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Particle physics Planetary orbit God Photon Luminiferous aether Coercion Soul Homeopathy Baptism Simone Weil Hydrogen Big Bang Information warfare Physical science Potential energy Kepler's laws of planetary motion Molecular nanotechnology Abortion debate Thermodynamics Atheism Miracle Modern geocentrism Justification (theology) Permittivity Ten Commandments Scientology beliefs and practices Reality Heat Mole (unit) Free will General relativity Spiritism Dharma Electron Hydrogen bond Alchemy Orbital hybridisation Falsifiability Force (Star Wars)
