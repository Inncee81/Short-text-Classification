what is the difference between being religious and being spiritual to me religion is the practicing of a particular faith and spirituality is what we have inside what's your interpretation religion is just a word it's a word i can do without it is too general it's too lumpy it puts alot of things together that do not need or want to be together spiritual is different some people like to call it what you are but i'm not sure that is right the term is thrown around alot and i'm not sure anyone can truly define it so that leaves it open to the person this i do know what is truly important is your personal relationship with god nothing else matters whether that relationship is moving forward stalled growing or in conflict it is important that you are having it if that makes me spiritual then ok Religion Theology Spirituality Christianity Meaning of life Religious Society of Friends Religious pluralism Atheism Predestination Supernatural Saint Eucharist Mythology Human God Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Aikido Faith Infant baptism Heaven Trinity Second Vatican Council Minister of religion Religious conversion Church of Christ Past teachings of Prem Rawat Subud Idolatry Justification (theology) Neopaganism Jehovah's Witnesses Creationism Hindu Magic (paranormal) Ten Commandments Opus Dei Judaism Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Mormonism and Christianity Messianic Judaism Evil A Course In Miracles Wicca Karl Marx Homosexuality and Bah__'__ Faith Voodoo Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Who is a Jew?
