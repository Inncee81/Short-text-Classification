what is life about recently i was listening to one of my current favorite songs and there are these lyrics in it and life s gonna drop you down like the limbs of a tree it sways and it swings and it bends until it makes you see it got me wondering if the image of life was accurate do you agree or disagree with this statement about life why do you answer this way consider that the tree itself was once a seed that grew over time into limbs and leaves which bend and sway consider that this tree in time will produce seeds of its own which will in their turn produce other trees you understand that planting a seed any seed under the good auspices of soil sun air and water causes it to germinate into a perfect representative of its kind and only its kind in time and the plant does not die or cease to produce more seeds as long as it is surrounded by the conditions for its continued growth and development life is not just the time you see the plant or the tree or the animal or the person or the planet or the star or universes in bloom life is what causes these forms to become what they are in what appears to us as an ever changing never ending succession considered another way the song you listened to is also a form of life it consists of lyrics rhythm music and perspective it grew from the seed of an idea in the artist s mind into the bloom of feeling and perspective it produces in the soil of your experience you shared that perspective with us in a question from which our understanding flowers into a more complete appreciation of life as we discuss these ideas or think about them think about how the idea germinated within the artist who produced your song life is the continuum in which all this happens and you can feel it swinging and swaying and making you see other ideas waiting to flourish and grow a myriad of forms into maturity through you just as that tree does orin Seed Flowering plant Pinophyta Plant Acorn Wood Time Out of Mind Reality Kudzu Simone Weil Germination Weed control Biological dispersal Philosophy of language Orchidaceae Biology Hemp Coast Douglas-fir Black pepper Honey locust Biblical inerrancy Apple Coconut Pollination Goodness and value theory Leaf Modern geocentrism Autism Olive Fruit tree propagation Root Pachypodium ambongense Infant baptism Tree Music genre Genetically modified food Carnivorous plant Vegetation Pachypodium Flax Fundamentalism Soul Jon Secada Eucalyptus The Ashlee Simpson Show Socrates Pine Alternation of generations Giant Sequoia Wood carving Bonsai Pachypodium bicolor Apricot Sampling (music) Common bean Ethylene Lychee Music history of the United States Bladderwort Botany Atomism Past teachings of Prem Rawat Puberty Extraterrestrial life The nature of God in Western theology Houseplant Animism Bamboo Evolutionism G__del's incompleteness theorem Music Cerebellum Beethoven's musical style and innovations Gravity Cycad Current teachings of Prem Rawat Classical music era Cannabis cultivation Liriodendron Blues Morphology of Pachypodium Jute Epistemology Biodiversity Jazz Equine conformation
