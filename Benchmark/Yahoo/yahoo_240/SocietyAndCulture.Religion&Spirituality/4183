lutheran vs methodist can someone please tell me the differences between the lutherans and methodists i was baptised a lutheran as a baby but never attended a lutheran church and have been a methodist for several years would really like to know how these two are different from one another i'm talking the elca side of lutherans i forgot to mention that it may be a perception thing but here in canada there is little difference in doctrine between methodists and the canadian branch of the elca elca has almost completely abandoned the lutheran confessions and now bases its doctrine more on popular opinion personal interpretation political correctness not the literal interpretation of scripture therefore they are lutheran in name only elca and the episcopal church are now in full altar and pulpit fellowship elca does however still retain some superficial vestiges of lutheranism such as liturgical worship candles altars vestments and crosses and crucifixes belief in the sacraments as a means of grace and the real presence in the holy eucharist is also optional sounds methodist to me if it walks like a duck gene edward veith refers to confessional lutherans as evangelical catholics not as protestant or reformed his book spirituality of the cross is probably the simplest easiest to read description of confessional lutheranism ever written if you are truly interested in what true lutherans teach believe and practice get a copy of mr veith's book basically only confessional lutherans accept all of scripture as divinely inspired word of god all teachings doctrine and practices must pass the test of scripture and scripture alone all other denominations by their own admission base doctrine on the bible but also on human tradition reason personal experience and political correctness lutheran church missouri synod lutheran church canada and the wisconsin evangelical lutheran synod are examples of confessional lutheran churches however there are a number of non confessional congregations within all these synods i don't want to sound negative but years ago lcms and the canadian branch of elca were more or less in fellowship we even shared a seminary in saskatoon sk fellowship ended when contrary to scripture the elca began ordaining women recently they elected a woman as their top bishop in canada also they are pro gay pro choice and for the most part do not accept the old testament as either historically correct or theologically correct mark addendum in the last issue of christian news an article stated that the elca's st olaf's college has just appointed a hindu as head of religious studies program st olaf's is a lutheran christian college Creationism Priest Apostolic Succession Abrahamic religion Sola scriptura History of Christianity Transubstantiation Mormonism and Christianity Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Church of Christ, Scientist Reformed churches Church of Scotland Sacrament Confession Biblical studies Traditionalist Catholic Pentecostalism Christian-Jewish reconciliation Liberal Christianity Anglican views of homosexuality Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Puritan Justification (theology) Mainline Seminex Religious pluralism Christianity and anti-Semitism Messianic Judaism Religious perspectives on Jesus Dispensationalism History of the English Bible Separation of church and state Community of Christ Jehovah's Witnesses Mary, the mother of Jesus John Wycliffe John Wesley Christian theological controversy Church of the Lutheran Confession Opus Dei Trinity Holy Spirit Fundamentalist Christianity Icon Restorationism Minister of religion Protestant Reformation
