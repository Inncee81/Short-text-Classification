i really enjoy working with children but i don't enjoy the pay i am currently an ags assistant group supervisor at a non profit organization and i make an hour if i had a degree in early childhood education they would only pay me i know they say do it for the kids not the pay but realistically how can one survive and why is it that we are teaching foundations and you have to have a strong foundation for something to be strong and they pay so little i am in the poconos pa and this area is known not to have well paying jobs thats why everyone commutes back to jersey and ny how do the daycares pay where you live hi i live in ne philadelphia not too far from the poconos i am an elementary education major with certifications in special ed and early childhood education the daycares and nursery schools down here are the same way i've learned that childcare as a field is just horrible with pay and benefits unless you got your degree and began teaching in a school district i'd say there is no future as a career working in daycares i am as saddened by that fact as you are something so important as shaping young minds and caring for children you'd think they'd value your services and care much more than they do it's just one of those things in life that doesn't make any sense i agree though that there is no way to support yourself living on those wages that would be impossible Kindergarten Graduate school Early childhood education Apprenticeship Childcare Education in Portugal Education in Japan Nurse Child Economic inequality Culture of the United States Division of labour Education in Germany Education in the People's Republic of China No Child Left Behind Act Education in Romania Capitalism Laura Schlessinger Education in Scotland Software engineering Waldorf Education Education Public education College Education in England Independence Party (Iceland) Pitaten Librarian Education in Hong Kong Anarchism and society The Fairly OddParents The Poconos Social work Charter school Minimum wage Medicine Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Springfield Elementary School Trade union Paralegal United Nations Children's Fund Infantilism Community college Philosophical skepticism Epistemology Unemployment Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Charles Dickens Labor theory of value Principal-agent problem Physician Economy of the United States Education in the Republic of Ireland Sweatshop The Giver Androgen insensitivity syndrome Centrelink Education in Australia Teacher Rudolf Steiner Japanese tea ceremony Education in India School choice General practitioner Abortion debate Logic Tenshinhan Wal-Mart Hikaru no Go Publicly funded medicine Motivation Columbia University Ranma __ characters Philosophy of education Glen Ridge, New Jersey Northeastern United States A Course In Miracles Tai Chi Chuan Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Anarchism and capitalism Hillary Rodham Clinton Education reform Professor Special education Supply and demand Humphrey Bogart Philosophy of language Vegeta Doctor of Philosophy Pennsylvania Brown v.
