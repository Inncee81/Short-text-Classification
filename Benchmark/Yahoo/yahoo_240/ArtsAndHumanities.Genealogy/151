could the wertenberg on old census records actually be w rttemberg germany i was just wondering because during my genealogical research i came across a census record from the th century that listed my great great great grandmother's birthplace as being wertenberg i looked for places in germany with that name and the closest place names i came to were wartenberg which is in berlin and w rttemberg which was an independent state before the german empire was formed in i'm assuming that my great great great grandmother came to the states before so what do you think it is likely w rttemberg as this is was a large community with many folks emigrating remember census folks back then didn't always know how to spell very well and they often had trouble understanding the accent of our german ancestors Census Former countries in Europe after 1815 Karlsruhe Stuttgart Genealogy Prussia W__rttemberg Baden States of Germany Franco-Prussian War Elections in Germany German language The Revolutions of 1848 in the German states Schw__bisch Hall Prince-elector Adolf Hitler First French Empire Rhineland-Palatinate Compendium of postage stamp issuers (Ga - Ge) Pennsylvania German language Strasbourg Brandenburg English language Victoria of the United Kingdom Germany Umlaut Ludwig van Beethoven Greek language Left Party (Germany) Marlene Dietrich Baden-W__rttemberg History of Finland Russian language Line of succession to the British Throne Bavaria Music of Germany Mary of Teck Latin alphabet Folk music Franz Boas German reunification History of the Jews in Germany Danish language German as a minority language History of Germans in Russia and the Soviet Union Confederation of the Rhine Wilhelm I of Germany Friedrich List Gau (German) Jesse Owens Numerus clausus Swabian Alb Wilhelm II of Germany Transport in Germany Non-native pronunciations of English Berlin S-Bahn Joschka Fischer Federation of Expellees Political subdivisions of New York State Hanover Anschluss Austria-Hungary Swabia German Mediatisation Constantine I (emperor) Magyars The Pied Piper of Hamelin Theodor Heuss Reichstag (institution) Hesse Albert Einstein Tamriel Occitan language Humboldt University of Berlin Austro-Prussian War New Zealand English History of Africa English-speaking Europe Cradle of Humanity Erwin Rommel Status of religious freedom in Germany Max Planck George V of the United Kingdom Weingarten (W__rttemberg) Klaus Fuchs Pietism Biberach an der Ri__ Ferrari Civilization III Nicholas I of Russia Theodor Adorno Expulsion of Germans after World War II Salzburg History of the English language Gda__sk Metz City-state History of Vilnius Volksdeutsche Evolutionism
