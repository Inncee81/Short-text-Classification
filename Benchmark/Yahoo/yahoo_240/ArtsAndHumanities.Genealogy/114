how do we find out what happened to my nans other children we have recentley found a document saying that my nan my moms mom had children all together we only know of she says he had still births but how do we find out obviously we have no names or dates would there be a record of all her children somewhere can anyone help i believe that still births are still registered in the normal way because you have to have a funeral even if this is carried out by the hospital and an undertaker can't bury a body without a death certificate being produced births marriages and deaths are always registered in the area where the event happened so you could have a look at the registrations in your nan's home registration district look at the dates you have the for other children and anywhere there is a suspiciously long gap the probability is that right in the middle of one of those will be a still birth if it was local to me i would just pop in the register office and have a chat with the superintendent registrar she is very helpful and will let me do a short search for free don't go on a monday which is their busy day Census Indian nationality law Genealogy Trademark British nationality law Domain Name System History of British nationality law Charmed 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, vote suppression EastEnders General Register Office for Scotland Whois Civil unions in the United Kingdom 2004 U.S. election voting controversies, Ohio Warren G.
