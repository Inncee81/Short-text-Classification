if your vision is in one eye and in the other is that bad enough to require glasses i took my son in for his well baby check up today in which the nurse did a vision and hearing test on him and it came back he failed both i know she isn't an eye doctor and i don't wear glasses so i don't really know anything about what those numbers mean i mean i never see him squinting or anything i don't have vision insurance or an additional bucks laying around is why i am asking i am taking him to a ear nose and throat specalist covered by insurance to have his hearing tested thanks i forgot to add that he is years old if there is a correct optical in your neighborhood i suggest going there to check his eyes out the eye exam is given by a licensed optometrist and it's only then if you choose to buy his glasses there it's only that includes frames lenses and fitting that's where i used to go to get my glasses when i didn't have insurance is ridiculous if he's starting kindergarten this year you may find that the school will give an eye exam i seem to remember the school doing that for my son if he needs glasses the school will tell you if money is an issue you can tell them that then and usually schools have a family resource center that can help out families in need of something the school might pay for your son's glasses at any rate you should get it checked out if his vision is bad it's liable to only get worse when he starts school correct optical might be spelled with a k korrect optical something like that Glasses Eyeglass prescription Optometry Pitaten Stereoscopy Education in Germany Sunglasses Insurance Medical prescription Contact lens Health insurance Movie projector Ophthalmology Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma The Shining (film) Prostate cancer Physical examination Intraocular lens Medicine Eyepiece Cable television Eye Myopia Stomach cancer Graduate school Annuity Driver's license Publicly funded medicine Education in Romania Actuary Blackjack Poker jargon Life insurance Unemployment Friends GED German car number plates Education in Portugal Compact disc EastEnders The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Physician Humphrey Bogart Automatic number plate recognition Lawyer Keratoconus Milton H.
