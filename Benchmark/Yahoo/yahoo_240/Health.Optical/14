how can i change my eye color i just wanted to know if i can change my eye color without using contacts my eyes are brown right now and i want them to be green please can you tell me how to do so please help no there is nothing you can do to change your eye color some medications illnesses and hormones are known to change eye color by changing the amount distribution of melanin on the iris causing the light to reflect a different color these factors cannot be controlled to intentionally change the color of your eyes for a desired color if you have lighter brown eyes you could try changing the color of your makeup and clothing to make your eyes appear slightly different shades you will need color contact lenses for a drastic change of eye color there is an iris implant surgery but it is very risky and impractical due to the inability for dilation constriction of the pupil it is also not approved in the usa and done in another country so i personally do not even see that as a viable option i always think a person's natural eye color suites them best otherwise you could try some opaque color contact lenses Iris (anatomy) Intraocular lens Heterochromia Contact lens Hair color Pupil Sunglasses Eye Human skin color Eye contact Color Stereoscopy Red-eye effect Abortion Melanin Ultraviolet Albinism Binoculars Cornea Medicine Eyepiece Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Sunscreen Technicolor Uvea Hypoglycemia Glass Stage lighting Glaucoma Red hair Eye examination Light-emitting diode Transsexuality Enlarger Color blindness Cat coat genetics Diabetic retinopathy Lighting Ray tracing Sun Iridology Rainbow Color theory Glasses DLP Camouflage Polarization Street light Urinary incontinence LASIK Dragon Booster Traumatic brain injury Cornea transplant Eyeglass prescription Macular degeneration Headlight Diamond Homosexuality and transgender Refractive surgery Epilepsy Cat Common cold Nuclear weapon design Aberration in optical systems Chronic fatigue syndrome Diabetes mellitus Telescope Prostate cancer Digital photography Primary color Billiards Tocopherol Atari 8-bit family Gravitational lens Conjunctivitis Consensus decision-making Chameleon Epinephrine Transgender Visual system Parallax Bicycle lighting Game Boy Legal aspects of transsexualism Meriones unguiculatus Oculomotor nerve Insulin Clinical depression Drowning Green Anaglyph image Lightsaber Gamut Scrubs Puberty Radiation therapy Dog Titanium
