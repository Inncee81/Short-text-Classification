which contact lenses do you have to replace the least i'm thinking about getting contacts and i was wondering which ones i should get if i don't want to have to replace it every weeks you would have to get a daily wear contact lens however the daily wear lenses require a great deal of maintenance to ensure that they stay clean throughout the year they require nightly cleanings and weekly enzymatic cleanings this is important so that bacteria and protein does not build up on the lens and cause an eye infection many solutions claim to do all the work with one solution but in my experience they are not fully effective disposables may cost more in the long run but are thinner therefore more comfortable less maintenance and healthier for your eye that should give you something to consider before making a decision Contact lens Psoriasis Body piercing Sunglasses Water Herpes simplex virus Sewage treatment Glasses Cell (biology) Eye LASIK Common cold Keratoconus Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cinematography Stereoscopy Motility Intraocular lens Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Binoculars View camera Brewery Mattress Energy development Diseases of the honeybee Dairy Conjunctivitis Aberration in optical systems Prostate cancer Escherichia coli O157:H7 Antiseptic Iris (anatomy) Fugu Eyeglass prescription Breastfeeding Extreme Programming M16 (rifle) Malaria Consensus decision-making Insulin Lens (optics) Air New Zealand Social rule Hygiene Tire Political economy Embalming Autonomous building Galactic Civilizations Hydrochloric acid Domestic rabbit Ophthalmology Upholstery Strategic management Items in the Metroid series Customer relationship management Guinea pig Nutrition Protein-energy malnutrition Multiple sclerosis Toxoplasmosis Menstrual cup Dog Diabetes mellitus Stopping e-mail abuse Fancy rat Cataract Tooth Plutonium Baldness Francis Crick Molecular biology Composting toilet Refractive surgery Strap-on dildo Eye contact Traditional Chinese medicine Space Shuttle program Methamphetamine Len Wein Menstrual cycle Presbyopia Hamster Violin Cornea Motor oil Eyepiece Wound Telescope Acne Vaccine Haloalkane Campfire Silver Linux Sterilization (microbiology) Growth hormone treatment Church of Christ, Scientist Marine aquarium Table saw
