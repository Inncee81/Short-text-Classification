what are the building blocks to a uc hi i'm going to be an incoming sophmore and i was wondering what steps do i take to get into a uc like uc san diego etc what classes are impressive on transcripts what should i prepare for what do colleges mostly look for in an applicant what impresses them what can i do to increase my chances of being accepted if you want to get into a uc living in ca helps you need a high gpa to get into the top uc's generally if you have at least a gpa you can get into the lower uc's like riverside or merced you mentioned ucsd it's a very competitive school of course there have been exceptions for students with low gpa's to get in my friend had a gpa but a sat and years of piano under his belt among other extracurriculars and he got in to sd my friend's brother had a gpa sat years of piano and numerous awards and still got into ucla with a grant so as you can see gpa isn't everything but make sure your sat and extracurriculars are pretty good when you apply you should work well on your personal statement also don't take super easy classes to pad your gpa try to take some ap honor classes and do well in those but don't overwhelm yourself Grade (education) College admissions University of California, San Diego Graduate school Lowell High School (San Francisco) University of California Law school Education in the United States Regents of the University of California v.
