transferring college waste i am currently attending a not much known suny college because it is like the only affordable college with the major i thought i wanted to do now i want to change my major to psychology which most schools have so i was thinking wouldn't it be better for me to transfer to a better known school if i want to study psychology the school i attend now does not have a good psychology department the problem is i am a sophmore already and chose all the courses of previous major for the coming fall already i can't drop the courses and add other courses because they are all full or not available so i will be paying two year's tuition including the coming fall of studying things i don't wanna study wouldn't that be a waste if i transfer to suny binghamton i get no credit equivalency which means i have to start all the way from the beginning liek as a freshman which means i'll have to stay yrs at binghamton and pay years of tuition any advices plz wait wait are you sure that you can't get any credits although they are same suny that's so wierd i will totally double check on that because that sounds wrong i am sure suny accepts transferred students from other than suny and trust me they will not come there if they are going to become another freshman if this is the case then this is what i think u should do don't go to suny college and instead go to community college and take all the easy classes that you can transfer to suny binghamton call or meet with the advisors what classes you can transfer at the same time get a part time job relate to psychology or even volunteer so you could get that first stp on the door that way you will able to save money and make some money hope this helped you good luck Education in Germany Education in the United States Binghamton University Student loan Graduate school Community college Student Education in the People's Republic of China State University of New York Tuition Associate's degree Brown University University at Albany Affirmative action Poker jargon Kwantlen University College University of Michigan State University of New York Maritime College Education in Australia Syracuse University State University of New York Institute of Technology The Amazing Race Statutory college Credit card Pennsylvania State University Franklin W.
