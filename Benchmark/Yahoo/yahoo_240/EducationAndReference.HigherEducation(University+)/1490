what would be a better choice after i get my bachelor's go for my cfa charter financial analyst certificate or go to graduate school major finance or economics both take years of study i am just not sure which to do or which make me more marketable any opinions would be appreciated thanks i wrote this in another similar question and felt it would help out here as well if you know you're going to have a career in finance by all means please go with the cfa first i majored in finance and all my finance professors stated how much more valuable you present yourself to any future employer if you have the cfa designation the cfa designation shows to any future employer that you are fully aware of all of the important concepts in finance bar none the master's in business is still so general while the cfa specifically deals in finance there is so much rigourous training followed by some of hardest exams known in america that with the eventual weeding of all the cfa hopefuls who last until the very end there is no better way to put yourself ahead of the pack to prospecting employers i know somebody who is going to start the path of obtaining her cfa this fall and i wholeheartedly agreed with her decision to pursue it instead of hopping straight into an mba program i would also recommend obtaining a series license while you're doing your cfa if you can you'll need sponsorship from a major organization though the only problem with a cfa is that while it'll show how valuable you are to an employer in terms of finance you still can't legally sell or talk anything about securities bonds treasuries investments and so on without the series making the cfa kind of mute until you get the series i myself plan on getting the series first soon then move onto the cfa path hope this helps Chartered Financial Analyst Financial analyst Graduate school Software engineering Lawyer Juris Doctor Master of Business Administration Security (finance) Paralegal Bond Education in Portugal Economy of Niger CFA franc Citigroup Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Law school Finance Strategic management Poker jargon Physician Accountancy Economy of Africa Insurance Architect Mediation Life insurance Model (economics) Bretton Woods system Management information system Economy of Senegal Comorian franc Corporate finance College Economy of Russia Teacher Master of Laws Warren Buffett Social Security debate (United States) Strategic planning Copyright Investment bank Capitalism U.S. generally accepted accounting principles IBM PC compatible Michael Milken Expert system Apprenticeship Nurse Social Security (United States) Master's degree Technical analysis Economy of C__te d'Ivoire Niger Athabasca University Wealth Monetary policy Charter school Yield curve Personal finance Corporate governance Annuity Georgetown University Keynesian economics Divorce Identity theft Temasek Holdings City and Guilds of London Institute Electrical engineering Education in Australia Education in Romania Mortgage Education in the People's Republic of China Microeconomics 2004-05 NHL lockout Consensus decision-making Trade union Arbitrage Enron Corporation Intellectual property United Nations Plame affair Law of the People's Republic of China Mutual fund Copyleft Emerson College Government of France Bank fraud Education in Germany Surplus value
