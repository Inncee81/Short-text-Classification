accounting i am interested in majoring in accounting looking at going to bentley college in ma i was just wondering if that is a good job what all does it involve is it boring because ive heard it sometimes is also what type of math does it involve and anything you could tell me would be great also going to a business school will i be surrounded by a bunch of kids who think they are better than everyone will it not be a fun college time to much work to do will the kids be to serious to have any fun also any information you have on marketing would be great i dont really know much about it and what all it involves accounting is the language of business if you are looking to gain an understanding of how business works accounting will get you there right now it a very hot career path i e there are more jobs than applicants starting salaries are in the mid forties right out of college in the nyc area the accountants i work with are typically quiet but intelligent and level headed not many big egos while we deal with numbers highly technical math is not required you will need to be familiar with algebra and statistics overall it is not an easy major but definitely doable if you are willing to put in the work required if you are unsure you start by being a business major and try principles of accounting and intermediate accounting you will know after that if accounting is for you good luck Mathematics Game programmer Computer BASIC programming language Management information system Psychology Computer vision Gross domestic product Education in the People's Republic of China Offshoring Logic Business ethics Wayne Corporation Corporate governance SAT Use case W.
