how do online classes work are they like chat rooms do they use voice calls or something like that or just text how does the teacher do his work and how do you take exams isn't it easy to cheat that's bad thing i know there are many formats i think the most popular is video streaming where the lectures are pretaped and you download the video stream in some cases you may be able to download the whole video file at once and wathc it locally it is not live or interactive you can try free previews of some fall semester courses at columbia at this web site http www cvn columbia edu previews php some programs broadcast television live to students again i think it is receive only no real time interaction a few programs may still be sending cd's or videotapes some courses have web logs i have not seen one with a chat room but they may exist i am doing a master's thesis and my professor and i have communicated by videoconferencing through pc webcams that is completely interactive but you need high bandwidth internet the professors either write on the blackboard as usual and that is videotaped or preferrably they write on a large sheet and this is sent to you along with a video clip of the professor in a small window in the better programs exams must be proctored this means you have to find an aapproved local proctor generally someone you do not otherwise know many universities screen the proctors well and that helps prevent cheating i know some programs have on line exams and i am skeptical of that approach as a means of learning Streaming media Internet pornography Internet Macromedia Flash PHP BitTorrent MSN Messenger Videoconferencing Graduate school Opera (web browser) Professor Wget Podcasting Juris Doctor Web crawler Education in Portugal Internet Relay Chat Cross site scripting Managed learning environment Spyware ITunes Computer-supported collaboration Short message service MP3 Videotape Ajax (programming) Stopping e-mail abuse Voice over IP America Online AOL Instant Messenger Grade (education) Steam (content delivery) Education in the People's Republic of China Skype Blog GED Lawyer Warez Web browser Bulletin board system Windows Vista Apache HTTP Server Video on demand Video Website Peer-to-peer Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Interactive fiction Vlog H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Education in Germany HyperText Transfer Protocol CPAN University of Massachusetts Amherst Java programming language Commodore 64 Forth programming language Bbc.co.uk Online music store File sharing Web page Python programming language Social software MDAC Bluetooth Law school Computer and video games Thread (computer science) Education in Australia IBM PC compatible Community college Web server Perl Mozilla Firefox Minesweeper (computer game) Internet radio Education in Romania The Internet Movie Database Karaoke Cyberspace Linux Doctor Who Internet fraud Cybersex Morse Code Common Unix Printing System File Transfer Protocol
