what's more important to an employer what your degree is in or the school that you got it from for example i have a chance to go to u of oklahoma which i would like to do but at the moment i can only take online classes and the degree they offer online is 'liberal studies ' currently i am attending southern new hampshire university which isn't as reputable but offers the social science degree online which is the degree i want i don't really know what i want to do after graduating so i'm pretty felxible just wondering what's more important the type of degree or the school thanks for any opinions as an employer in higher education i look for the quality of the educational institution as well as the type of degree however i would be more inclined to hire an applicant who graduated with honors in liberal studies from a small accredited college than a person who nearly flunked out of harvard just be sure that the school you select is accredited grades and academic honors are important that is the first thing i look for on a resume of a recent graduate not the major Education in the United States Juris Doctor College Graduate school Columbia University College admissions Education in Australia Grade (education) Education in Portugal Harvard University University of Bristol Law school Associate's degree Georgetown University Johns Hopkins University Pennsylvania State University Education in the People's Republic of China Software engineering Education in Taiwan University of Houston University of Central Florida Education in Hong Kong Brigham Young University Academia Education in Japan University of Toronto Education in Germany Dublin City University College and university rankings Northeastern University, Boston Affirmative action School accreditation Higher education in Japan Emerson College Education Harvard Division of Continuing Education Education in Austria Brown University Seneca College University of Alabama Trinity College, Dublin Boston College University of North Texas Lawyer Education in Sweden Ateneo de Manila University Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania Cornell University High school Education in the Republic of Ireland University of Notre Dame St. John's College, U.
