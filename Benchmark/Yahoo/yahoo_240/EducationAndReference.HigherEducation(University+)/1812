how can i prepare for medical school i'm and a junior at cal state northridge majoring in biology i recently have considered going to medical school for dermatology if anyone knows anything about that field please let me know what i can do to be well prepared and what cautions i would have to take i know i would have to take loans because it will cost a lot and most probably i can't have a job at the same time what universities would offer dermatology school and besides a high gpa mcat score what other things would i have to do in order to have a higher chance of getting accepted thanks first of all medical school isn't specialized for one particular specialty or another every doctor goes to medical school and then goes on to a residency afterwards for the specialty he or she chooses dermatology is a very competitive specialty to get into and requires excellent performance in medical school as well as top scores on the national board examinations just as not everyone who applies to med school gets in not everyone who wants to be a dermatologist gets into a derm residency but first things first to optimize your chances of getting into medical school you should as you know have a good gpa and mcat score it also helps if you have done volunteer work medically related or not and have demonstrated your desire to go into medicine by getting some experience in a medical setting paid or volunteer research experience isn't strictly necessary but it does help especially at the more research oriented schools which tend to be the top ranked schools going to a top ranked school will fairly or unfairly help your chances of getting into a derm residency a few people i know have worked a little in med school but you certainly don't have time to work enough to support yourself much less to pay for the tuition which is exorbitant at most schools some state schools especially in the south charge more reasonable fees most of us make do with huge loans scholarships and for a few lucky ones help from mom and dad hope that helps to answer your question good luck Education in the United States Graduate school Medical school Education in Germany Grade (education) Student loan College admissions Education in Australia Education in the People's Republic of China Medical College Admission Test Dermatology Affirmative action National Certificate of Educational Achievement Publicly funded medicine Law school University of Southern California Health insurance California Polytechnic State University SAT University of Central Florida Software engineering Education in Portugal Tuition General practitioner Economics Stevens Institute of Technology Acne Professor Prostate cancer Scholarship Alternative medicine Stanford University Science Academia Sexual orientation Insurance Master's degree Transsexuality Doctor of Philosophy Law School Admissions Test Ivy League University of Bristol Education in Taiwan American Medical Association Cornell University Doctorate Psychiatry Tai Chi Chuan Nurse GED Quizbowl Traditional Chinese medicine University of Connecticut Food and Drug Administration University of Maryland Baltimore County Physical therapy College Conscription Regents of the University of California v.
