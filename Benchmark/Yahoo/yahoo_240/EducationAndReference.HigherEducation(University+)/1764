open university i have a degree in popular music and technology but unfortunately it was a waste of time money and effort in terms of employment i'm thinking about doing a bsc in computing with the open university mostly due to financial reasons does a degree from there hold as much credit as a 'normal' degree would with employers hi david the ou is very well respected in my opinion their teaching materials books etc are superb you also have exclusive access to masses of ou material online if you enrol students at the open university remain more satisfied with the quality of their higher education than those at any other university according to the results of the national student survey you have expressed an interest in computing do you have a particular career path in mind i've been told that bsc computing is more suited to programming software design artificial intelligence if your interest lies more in the practical 'hands on' stuff it may suit you better to do a different type of non uni course and qualification it will also be considerably cheaper than a year spell at uni if you are interested more in the practical aspect of computers i suggest you vist the comptia link below and have a look at what is on offer if you do take your training with a private provider there's masses of them beware of any company that promises mega qualifications in a short period of time it's impossible if you allow yourself a couple of years you can gain some serious it certification that will be help you find employment many decent employers will take you on at a low level of qualification a or similar and will often fund further training i guess what i'm trying to say is that whilst a bsc is a worthy qualification there are other qualifications that would be better from an employability point of view good luck whichever route you take Education in Portugal Software engineering Education in Australia Education in the United States Teacher National Certificate of Educational Achievement Copyright law of the United Kingdom Scottish Qualifications Authority Education in the People's Republic of China Graduate school Social work Computer High school Chinese University of Hong Kong City and Guilds of London Institute Paralegal Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus A-level Education in the Republic of Ireland Bologna process Apprenticeship Dublin City University Mortgage Australian Qualifications Framework Master's degree Academic degree W.
