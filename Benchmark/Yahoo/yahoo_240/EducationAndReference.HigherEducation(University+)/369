pre law major i am currently a freshman at north carolina state university i am planning on attending the university of north carolina at chapel hill school of law after i earn my bachelors degree i am considering mechanical engineering or a double major in mathematics and physics which major would increase my chances of being accepted to law school the answer is follow your heart while it might be true that people in some majors have higher acceptance rates than people in other majors it is probably just due to factors like people in certain majors might be better students or at least more hard working you can still get into law school with an engineering major what ever major you do it will be a good idea to take some humanities courses and especially to take courses in philosophy courses like logic will prepare you well for law school and to show that you are capable of logical thinking it would be a good idea to at least the two semesters of calculus to be completely honest if i wanted to go to law school i would just do a math major and take some philosophy english and or history courses on the side so that i can show my ability to defend arguments write for law school as well as to take some business and economics courses so that i would have something to fall back on if i didn't get into law school math majors have the second highest acceptance rate into law school while philosophy majors have the highest rate i think majoring in philosophy would be boring to me and if i didn't make it into law school i wouldn't be able to do much with my bachelor's degree Education in the United States Graduate school Education in Portugal Juris Doctor Master's degree Philosophy of mathematics Mathematics Massachusetts Institute of Technology Doctorate Science Georgetown University Education in Romania Logic Education Economics Advanced Placement Program North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics Free will Theory of conduct American University Falsifiability Law school Degrees of Oxford University Education in Hong Kong Physics Lawyer Causality Chinese University of Hong Kong G__del's incompleteness theorem Education in Taiwan University of Michigan Princeton University Ontological argument Associate's degree Rudolf Hermann Lotze University of Pennsylvania Bachelor's degree A-level SAT Cooper Union Philosophy of science College of William and Mary Community college Education in Germany University of Massachusetts Amherst University of Central Florida Willard Van Orman Quine Academic degree University of Notre Dame The Catholic University of America ELO rating system No Child Left Behind Act Stuyvesant High School Supernatural Education in the People's Republic of China Duke University Junior Certificate University of Genoa Washington University in St. Louis One Tree Hill (TV series) Grove City College University of S__o Paulo Far Eastern University GED Scientology beliefs and practices Aristotle Education in France California Polytechnic State University Objectivist philosophy Belmont Abbey College Jaime Escalante Medical school General relativity Kurt G__del University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Physician Intuitionistic logic Bachelor of Arts Kingston University Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy John Locke Randomness Where Mathematics Comes From St. John's College, U.
