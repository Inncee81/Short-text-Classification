financing medical school am graduating from college in years and am wondering what percentage of financial aid does not pay for medical school expenses where do i find information on this if accepted i plan to work per week would this be possible considering the graduate school work load thanks most medical schools prohibit or strongly discourage students from working while attending medical school the workload in school is simply too difficult to maintain a job in addition later in medical school you'll be assigned to clinical duties that won't necessarily adhere to a to work schedule which will make an outside job even more difficult medical school financial aid offices are in my opinion fantastic on average they'll help you acquire the loans you need to live rent food clothes equipment etc if you don't have outside funds if you're trying hard to avoid debt you might consider one of the military health professions scholarship programs in the us all branches of the military have competitive scholarships available for folks attending medical or dental school and some have scholarships for vet school and more these are extraordinary scholarships that pay of your tuition in medical school and an additional monthly stipend to cover your living expenses your pay back rate is essentially to for number of years of scholarship not counting any residencies you might pursue anyway you can graduate from med school debt free and only owe a few years of service contact your university's health pre professional committee chairperson or a pre professional advisor for more information they should also be able to put you into contact with military recruiters if you're interested in those hpsp scholarships good luck Graduate school Education in the People's Republic of China Education in the United States Scholarship Tuition University of Michigan Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Credit card Unemployment Medical school Publicly funded medicine Affirmative action College admissions Cornell University Medicare (Canada) Education in Germany Ivy League Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Law school Students' union Education in Australia University of Central Florida Divorce Barbara Boxer Plame affair Mortgage Nurse Duke University Health insurance Hillary Rodham Clinton Canadian and American health care systems compared Child support Physician Economy of the United States Doctor of Philosophy Culture of the United States Mutual fund Temple University Rice University Juris Doctor FairTax Money University of Connecticut Princeton University Dentistry United States Army Education in Japan University of California, Los Angeles Medicine Chinese University of Hong Kong Open access Air Education and Training Command National Health Service United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East Bond Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Community emergency response team Tufts University Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Paralegal Financial endowment Personal finance Medical prescription Navy Reserve Officer Training Corps National Institutes of Health Emory University Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards Microeconomics Assignment (law) Hyperinflation Lawyer 401(k) GED Public bodies and task forces of the UK government Reserve Officer Training Corps Call centre Carnegie Mellon University Johns Hopkins University Economy of India New York University Librarian Professor Salary cap Tai Chi Chuan Donald Rumsfeld Government debt University of Maryland Baltimore County Life insurance Ambulance
