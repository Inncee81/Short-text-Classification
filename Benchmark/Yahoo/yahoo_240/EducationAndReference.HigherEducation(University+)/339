college transfer question i currently live in california and am going to a community college i might be moving to florida in a year and i wanted to know if anyone has transfered from a junior college to a year between states as in year in ca then final in fla thanks okay for your question it's a little bit tricky because of the state to state transfers what i mean by this is that since the colleges and universities in california has different standards in other states there classes sometimes do not carry over what i mean by this is that lets say you took psych as general education to meet the standards to transfer to a university from a jc in california however the school that your applying for in florida might not accept that class as a ge and ask you to take a different class to meet the ge requirements you must talk to you transfer agreement counselor and see the colleges that you will be attending in florida accepts the classes you have right now this allows you in the yr period to finish any classes you need Education in the United States Community college Bush v.
