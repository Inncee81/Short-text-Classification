i have my ged and now i am getting ready to take the act how can i avoid going to a year college how can i go directly to a major university and in addition how can i improve my test scores first congrats on the ged it shows you have the will to persevere now it looks to me like no one taught you how to plan your college education you're going about it backwards not that you're necessarily doing things wrong yet but i suspect you are going to make a mis step at some point first yes take the act and or sat try to score as high as you can and yes the act sat test preparation books and programs and classes can help but don't obsess over it there are some universities that don't even consider test scores and others that will accept anyone regardless back in the ' s i was aware of oklahoma city u where the average act score for entering freshmen was around that's a lower score than you get if you flip a coin for every multiple choice answer but before you decide what higher education to pursue get career counseling even if you already are fairly certain what career you want it's a good idea to double check you can probably get good career counseling free if you visit a nearby community college they'll have the tools to test your attitudes and aptitudes and to recommend what degree to pursue and what colleges offer it they'll provide the service for free because they honor that community part of their name they might think they're recruiting you as a student maybe many universities and four year colleges would also let you use their career counseling office on that same basis you probably would do yourself a favor to open your mind about community colleges i don't know what you've been told but here's the straight deal i've taught at a community college for years i've also taught at four different universities the quality of instruction is roughly equal in fact students who transfer to universities after finishing two years at a cc wind up earning precisely the same grade averages as students who started at the university at the cc you're more likely to get in a small class with a full time faculty member tho' a lot of courses are taught by part timers at the university your courses to start will often be in seat lecture halls or in classrooms with a graduate teaching assistant in charge universities are often difficult on students community colleges specialize in non traditional learners who need personal attention and guidance a cc would be a good transition from a ged program through to the stringent impersonal university world finally ccs cost far less too few students get this message yes you can attend any university that will accept you and pay with a mix of scholarships grants and loans but those loans will come due and if you take on in debt or more some wind up over six figures then it will take you decades to pay it off the usa is just dumb for allowing so many of our best 'n brightest to start adult life saddled with almost crushing debt i advised my own son to do his first years at a cc not the one i teach at we found better deals elsewhere our projections were that he'd finish his bachelor's degree with less than out of pocket and that wasn't counting any of the special financial aid that he might get when he transfers to the four year university in a year and finally some professions only require a two year associate degree if that's the case do the community college finish fast and get on to earning real bucks that's my best advice in general it's a long run but you have shown you have the stamina for it provided someone shows you the course Student loan Lawyer Education in Germany College admissions Education in Hong Kong Law school Education in Portugal Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Juris Doctor Grade (education) Education in Japan SAT Education in Romania Associate's degree Trinity College, Dublin No Child Left Behind Act Alexander Technique Master's degree Affirmative action Homeschooling Advanced Placement Program Barrister Tuition Paralegal Teacher Brown University Scientology beliefs and practices Cornell University Secondary education in Japan Franklin W.
