how hi dose my gpa have to be to get into harvard i have a gpa i'm very clever probably smarter then you how do you get into harvard or other ivy league schools i think im definetely smart enough for it what do you think i think you aren't even close you better pray that you have extra curricular activities that they need to make their quota realistically i hope for your sake you applied somewhere else to get an acceptance letter harvard is very tough to get into and i wouldn't expect them to look at you seriously without atleast a gpa and that shouldn't be too hard to get in public school anyway sadly although you may be smart enough for harvard your gpa does not reflect it Grade (education) Ivy League College admissions Education in the United States Regents of the University of California v.
