nursing recommended colleges pathways navy i am a senior in high school thinking about nursing once i become a nurse i'd like to join the navy and i have a few questions what would be the best pathway to become a nurse in the navy and how long would it take what public california colleges provide great nursing programs i've been looking at sfsu and san diego colleges but not so sure should i take my prerequisites at a community college first then move on to another college thank you in advance i could be wrong but i'm relatively certain that nursing school requires a bachelor's degree for entry i wouldn't worry too much about choosing a nursing school just yet community college can be an excellent way to get prerequisites out of the way however i had many friends who tried that route and ended up dropping out rather than completing their degrees i went to a university in town in san diego actually and was able to still complete my degree on the cheap by living with my parents once you're at a year school there should be very smart advisors who know all about what prerequisites you'll need for nursing and potentially how to get the navy to pay for it i'm a fan of keeping options open though try to not sign your life over to the navy until you're completely certain get your bs first and see if you're still interested in nursing or if something else has managed to intrigue you good luck Nurse Graduate school Education in Portugal Juris Doctor Medical school Community college Lawyer City and Guilds of London Institute Georgetown University Chinese University of Hong Kong California State University University of California, San Diego Athabasca University No Child Left Behind Act Associate's degree San Diego State University Doctorate Nursing University of Central Florida United States Navy Kwantlen University College College admissions Education in Finland College Paralegal Education in Hong Kong University of California, Los Angeles Seneca College Northeastern University, Boston Law school Student loan University of Pennsylvania Academic degree Johns Hopkins University Education in Germany University of San Francisco Education in the Republic of Ireland Quizbowl Education in Sweden Knots Landing A-level AMA Computer University University of Houston University of California Education in Japan Education in Canada Midwifery Western Kentucky University High school College football Human sexual behavior Education in Malaysia GED Physician Teacher The College of New Jersey Doctor of Philosophy University of Phoenix General practitioner Reserve Officer Training Corps Hunter College John Kerry Bachelor of Arts University of Alabama Humphrey Bogart California Polytechnic State University Ateneo de Manila University USS Walke (DD-723) University of Virginia California Community Colleges system State university University of Connecticut Australian Defence Force Academy Colegio de San Juan de Letran Nicomachean Ethics Master's degree Oregon State University Far Eastern University University of Santo Tomas University of Texas at San Antonio Duke University Academia Texas Woman's University USS Volador (SS-490) USS Alfred A.
