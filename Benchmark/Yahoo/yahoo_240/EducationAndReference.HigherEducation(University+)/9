how hard is university generally i guess it matters where you are i live in indiana and it really isn't that hard everyone always tells you it is horribly difficult i actually found high school to be more difficult it matters what you are studying i suppose i am an english major and i love it which is probably why it isn't too hard but occasionaly i find a class that is really hard you just have to learn how to budget your time to allow for studying but also for having fun you don't want to be totally stressed out worrying about everything i have found in my university the and level classes are sometimes much easier than the or level classes just take control once you get there and it shouldn't be too bad as long as you pay attention to your grades and don't fall into a hole that you can't get out of Graduate school Education in the United States John Lott Esperanto as an international language Philosophical skepticism Procrastination Pitaten Dog training Tai Chi Chuan Password Theory of conduct Education in Japan Craps Social rule Kodocha Singlish IP (complexity) IBM PC compatible Great Teacher Onizuka Humphrey Bogart Grade (climbing) Education in Malaysia Martial art GED Grade (education) Jumpstart 3rd Grade Team Fortress Classic A-level Plame affair Black hole YuYu Hakusho Education in the People's Republic of China Transactional analysis Species Piccolo Junior Saga Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Kitesurfing Avenue Q College Russian joke Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword High school Minesweeper (computer game) Aikido Boston Public 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Non-native pronunciations of English Friends Fast bowling Beatmania IIDX Lie Pump It Up Deflation (economics) Unemployment Tenshinhan The Book of Five Rings 10 Things I Hate About You Hungarian language Education in Australia Bart Sells His Soul Tag question The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Education in Taiwan E.L.E.C.T.I.O.N.S.
