to become an entrepreneur must i pursue business administration or there are still other route which are better more professional and allow me to have higher qualification there are many people who want to get involve in entrepreneurship in their later life their get a bachelor's in management with a concentration in entrepreneurship and small company management or through some other ways does this mean that i can actually take up business admin courses in my later life and become a successful entrepreneur as well most pioneering business leaders don't have qualifications in business management they leave that to the ceos successful entrepeneurs come from all walks of life housewives accountants film directors economists lawyers doctors engineers scientists and of course computer programmers business management is a terrible degree unless you already have a trade or practical degree behind you and some industry experience to support your studies and even then it is not really necessary since no business management degree course can ever pass on the entrepeneurial spirit a successful millionaire told me that business admin tends to groom people for middle management positions good entrepeneurs are practical people their education comes from the streets they build up a business through hard graft trial and error and only some theory and then when the hard work is done and their business is a runaway success they typically employ a managing director to run the business afterwards while they either sit back and reap the financial rewards or more likely given their entrepenurial spirit move onto something else in the pipeline which is almost always bigger and better richard branson is a great example of a highly successful entrepeneur he dropped out of school early but despite his lack of academic success setup a series of big businesses which lead to him becoming one of the richest people in the world with a fortune of bn dollars you can't teach the qualities of an entrepeneur this comes from life experience not by going to university and learning a mickey mouse degree like business management of course management schools won't tell you this they want you to spend thousands of dollars on a business qualification there are far more business school graduates than millionaires that must tell you something Entrepreneur Master's degree MIT Sloan School of Management Master of Business Administration Academia Nurse Graduate school Education in Portugal Chinese University of Hong Kong Education in the People's Republic of China Juris Doctor NHH Doctorate Software engineering Stevens Institute of Technology Medical school ITESM Lyceum of the Philippines Capitalism Ross School of Business Education in the United States Education in Hong Kong Education in Germany Business Australian Qualifications Framework Entrepreneurship Enron Corporation City and Guilds of London Institute College Wall Street Law school Management Dublin City University Education in Sweden Far Eastern University Pennsylvania State University Teacher Affirmative action Tianjin University Academic degree Nanjing University Seneca College Law of the People's Republic of China Architect Kingston University Accountancy University of Chicago Paralegal Outsourcing Economic inequality University of Central Florida Physician Management information system Microsoft Strategic management Capital accumulation University of Santo Tomas Open University Tufts University American University Social work York University Education in Japan Nanyang Technological University McMaster University University of Houston Education in Romania Barrister University of Pennsylvania Associate's degree Vienna University of Economics and Business Administration W.
