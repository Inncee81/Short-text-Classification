do you have an option for this little problem im planning on moving to new york not now but later im finishing high next year so im going to college in there but im thinkig in staying at the dorms but i also have a little parrot that i buyed like years ago so i dont think they let her in with me so what should i do i wana stay with the parrot but i also would like to stay at dorms what should i do a lot of schools here don't have dorms but student housing i am from nyc look into an apartment with others your age more likely to accept the parrot a pet in a dorm is not a good idea it's not safe for the pet if you get caught they will make you get rid of him her which will be unbearable i am sure i got an apartment in college i have cats it was an all student building in ct though not any different than the dorm several of my friends moved in too you can look at places near school and buy a meal plan too so you don't have to cook every day Dormitory Macalester College University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Oh My Goddess!
