do you talk to a school advisor before or after applying i have a lot of questions on what classes i want to take even what major i want to go for nobody in my family has gone to college and i don't know many people that have knowledge on the college system i was in your same situation i was the first in my family to go to college don't be nervous about that you're asking the right questions you can call the admissions office and discuss these things now before you even apply that's completely normal in fact if you can do an on campus visit you can take a tour and also speak with an admissions rep in person some schools will even hook you up with a student guide and let you see their dorm room you don't necessarily have to decide your major yet you are in the us right because that's not true if you're in the uk still you want to be sure that the school has most of the majors you might be interested in to make your life easier once you get there talk to them about how easy it is to change majors or enter a major once you enroll Education in the United States College admissions California Polytechnic State University Education in the People's Republic of China Georgetown University Florida Institute of Technology Theory of conduct Pitzer College University of Massachusetts Amherst University of Central Florida University of Michigan Social rule Middle Tennessee State University Graduate school Northfield Mount Hermon GED Bridgewater State College Franklin W.
