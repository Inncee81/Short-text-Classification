is college fun i start my freshman year of college in days i am excited but i am not too thrilled about the school work thats for sure i am not a lazy nor a bad student but i just wish my summer lasted longer should i be more excited than i actually am i think you will find that college is a really nice time of your life it's not much harder than high school depending on what type of high school you attended you'll meet all kinds of people and have the chance to discuss oodles of interesting ideas with people it's ok if you aren't excited yet just rest but soon the fun starts Student Education in the United States Undergrads Social rule High school Phillips Exeter Academy Lynbrook High School Student loan Education in Germany Academic term One Tree Hill (TV series) W.
