msw or mph i have been currently thinking about attending graduate school for a joint degree in mph msw at first i could not decide between the two and then i noticed that there was a joint degree lucky me anyway it turns out that i may not be able to do this because i need to still work full time to get my tuition benefits and this dgree will be hard to complete on a part time basis my question is if you have either of these degrees or both what do you do also which one would be a better degree overall which one would have more job opportunities thanks for your help mph is a masters in public health i do not feel that i have to elaborate more if you need me to obviously you shouldn't be answering my question i have an msw and i'm an lcsw i have found that i have more job opportunities and significantly more pay due to being an lcsw i'm not sure what an mph degree is but if you are looking to expand your job opportunities and paycheck pick a program area of study that will help you to get a professional license later on Master's degree Graduate school Social work Full cost accounting Academic degree Education in the United States Washington University in St. Louis Professional Master's degree Academia Lawyer Affirmative action Education in Australia Juris Doctor Education in Portugal Education in the People's Republic of China Community college Education in Germany Education in Finland Professor University of Maryland Baltimore County Avenue Q Education in Japan Quizbowl University of Michigan Physician Student loan University of Central Florida Pennsylvania State University Medical school Chiropractic Unemployment Nurse Master of Business Administration School choice Walt Disney World College Program Georgetown University Simon Fraser University Columbia University Law school Civil engineering Economic inequality Federal Marriage Amendment Software engineering Paralegal Tai Chi Chuan Centrelink Equal Protection Clause Higher education in Japan Social Security (United States) Architect Chinese University of Hong Kong Osteopathy Bologna process Medical University of South Carolina Temple University Liberalism Dalhousie University Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Social rule GED Miami University Master of Laws Education in Canada Rail tracks Doctor of Philosophy Dentistry Doctorate Psychoanalysis City and Guilds of London Institute Rabbi Tuition Tufts University School of Medicine and Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences __cole Polytechnique Fight Club Education in Austria Heinkel He 100 Education in Sweden John Lott Education in Hong Kong Microeconomics Ethics Associate's degree Scholarship Severe weather terminology (United States) Electrical engineering Anthroposophy Autobahn Rick Santorum Harvard Division of Continuing Education Game programmer Public domain University of New England, Maine Education in France Brigham Young University FairTax College Statistical survey Drew University Occupational Therapy
