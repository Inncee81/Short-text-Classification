need help choosing my degree i have a variety of fields i can apply to for a degree and i was wondering which one of these is better networks engineering networks security telecommunications chemical engineering material engineering alright let's narrow it down engineering degrees get you a good paying job right out of college so go for either or now it all depends on what you want to do if you're good at computers go for networks computer engineering if you're good at chem obviously go for and if you are decent in science and math go for and you also should consider what you would like to do in life and look at the career paths you could take good luck Computer Computer science Electrical engineering Cryptography Engineering Software engineering Game programmer University of Waterloo Stevens Institute of Technology University of Michigan College of Engineering Seneca College Cornell University College of Engineering Florida Institute of Technology Master's degree Mapua Institute of Technology Civil engineering Graduate school Chemistry University of Central Florida Moore School of Electrical Engineering Rochester Institute of Technology Dublin City University Self-replication Ethernet Mathematics Cooper Union Chinese University of Hong Kong Massachusetts Institute of Technology University of Maryland Baltimore County Doctorate Georgia Institute of Technology Public policy Bachelor's degree Harvey Mudd College University of Pennsylvania W.
