so did i just screw myself out of money and credits i went to college a for about semesters did mediocre in the beginning but then bombed and have a cumulative gpa of sucks i know however after working i want to go back to school i found out what i want to get a degree in and figured i can do a semester at a community college and then transfer over to the new university however when looking at the transfer for the new college i want to go to not the cc information i found i saw this students transferring credits must have a minimum cumulative grade point average gpa in all course work presented for transfer from each institution attended so does this mean i just lost all those credits from the first college or could i roll them into the cc and do two semesters instead of one semester and get at least gpa each semester and transfer all the credits from the cc or will i still lose out on the credits classes with at least c's and some b's from the first college advice help appreciated thanks i think i will do a semester at a cc get the gpa up and hopefully the credits from the first uni go get transfered over to the cc and then to the new uni without a problem i just concerned about the credits from the first uni not transfering over although i would assume that they should granted i get above a c in the courses because even though it's semesters losing the time and money and gaining nothing would suck your best option is to call the school you're interested in and discuss your situation with admissions since your gpa was so close to a and i imagine you've done better since then and you've matured they may be able to be a bit more flexible in your case at minimum it's worth a discussion at worst as you said you can transfer your old credits to your cc enroll there for a semester or year raise your gpa then transfer to the other school Grade (education) Education in Germany Education in the United States Graduate school Juris Doctor Chiropractic Medical school College admissions Community college Education in the People's Republic of China Academic term Affirmative action Kwantlen University College Education in Portugal National Certificate of Educational Achievement Brown University Tulane University Student loan Montgomery Blair High School Professor Education in Romania Cornell University Law school Education in Taiwan Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy High school University of Michigan Massachusetts Institute of Technology University of Central Florida Gwinnett University Center American University University of Tennessee Concordia University Education in Japan North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics Physician Brigham Young University Stonehill College Western Kentucky University Education in Hong Kong Yale Law School Bologna process A-level Hunter College High School University of Arizona Lowell High School (San Francisco) Stern School of Business California Polytechnic State University College University Virginia Military Institute GED University of Bristol Education in Australia Education in Singapore King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals Stevens Institute of Technology Salt Lake Community College Freed-Hardeman University Hampshire College Life insurance University of Pittsburgh Education in Austria Carnegie Mellon University Caldwell College Georgetown University Cooperative education Virginia Commonwealth University Reed College Athabasca University University of New England, Maine Cooper Union Education in Malaysia Trinity College, Dublin HOPE Scholarship Yeshiva Paralegal Yale University Franklin W.
