help me about australian university i wonder what school is better rmit melbourne or university of ballarat i know rmit ranked higher worldwide but i wanna study multimedia which i heard that university of ballarat is considered rd school in australia to have good education in visual art could someone help me to make a choice g'day yes if you are comparing the rmit is more famous however for multimedia design there are other university in victoria the state where rmit and uni of ballarat uob in who are offering the same quality course as well they are swinburne university www swinburne edu au monash uni www monash edu au victoria uni www vu edu au deakin uni www deakin edu au these universities are part of only soon to be universities in australia all of them are fully accredited and they are tightly regulated therefore the quality and recognition of their graduates are equal from wherever university you are studying from the most important thing is you have to read the course information carefully since some courses may have the same name but different content so to narrow down your selection this is what i suggest what kind of place do you want to stay and study in uob is located in the city of ballarat it is hrs drive from melbourne and smaller and quieter the campus itself is terrific with complete student amenities available on campus rmit is located right smack in the middle of cbd area so campus is located in building blocks around the city lack of 'campus feeling' more like 'working in the office building feeling' and accommodation is expensive the other universities are located in the suburbs of melbourne and most of them have their own campus although not as big as uob's read and compare the courses from the other uni as well i know swinburne and deakin have gained quite a reputation in multimedia as well hope this helps unfortunately nobody can make the decision for you as you are the one who will be studying in the uni so you will need to feel confident abt your choice based on the information that you got i also suggest that if there's an australian education exhibition nearby visit talk to them to get the feeling abt the uni maybe you can even got a chance to speak with the alumni during the exhibition although the information maybe somewhat biased e mail me at mikegun at studentfirst com au if you have more questions abt study in australia good luck for your study and welcome to australia Deakin University Victoria University of Technology University of Melbourne Melbourne RMIT University Monash University Caulfield Grammar School Technical and Further Education Education in the United States Swinburne University of Technology Association of Commonwealth Universities Victoria (Australia) Queensland University of Technology University of Bristol History of Melbourne American University Flinders University University of Sydney Australian Qualifications Framework ITESM University of Michigan Sydney College admissions University Bendigo, Victoria Macquarie University SAT Education in Portugal Trinity College, Dublin Tertiary education fees in Australia Far Eastern University Washington University in St. Louis Dublin City University Graduate school University at Albany Spice Girls University of California, Santa Barbara College Shrine of Remembrance Georgetown University Florida State University Auslan Ballarat, Victoria National Union of Students of Australia Education in Malaysia University of British Columbia Adelaide Oregon State University Middle Tennessee State University Juris Doctor Boston College University of Central Florida Northeastern University, Boston College and university rankings University of North Carolina at Charlotte University of Maryland Baltimore County Johns Hopkins University University of Waterloo University of Notre Dame Education in the People's Republic of China University of Warwick Melbourne High School Cairns, Queensland Education in Germany Chinese University of Hong Kong University of Houston Melbourne Grammar School Florida Institute of Technology Academia Suburbs of Johannesburg Ohio Wesleyan University University of Toronto Emerson College Voluntary Student Unionism Bilkent University University of Chicago Southern Cross University University of South Australia Kennesaw State University Intelligent design movement University of Queensland York University Eureka Stockade High school Seneca College Simon Fraser University
