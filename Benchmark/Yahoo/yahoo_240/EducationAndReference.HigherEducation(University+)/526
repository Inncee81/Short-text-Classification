commute or dorm please share your own experiences whether you are commuting to or dorming at a college i'd kinda like to know the pros and cons of each thanks commuting is nice because you have a place to get away from everybody and can shut everybody out if you want you can also save money if you are living with family members however i have to say that from my experience your social life can take a big hit if you commute you miss out on some last minute burger runs or midnight craziness that can happen in a dorm say you and friends decide to go swimming in a fountain at am the dorm food can lack in quality however you will meet many more people living in the dorms than you will commuting another down side could be that you might get stuck with a horrible roommate however you can change i got matched up well with a compatible room mate we had many things in common so life was tolerable Undergrads The Catcher in the Rye Freed-Hardeman University Dormitory Georgia Institute of Technology Phillips Exeter Academy Bridgewater State College The Class Menagerie New York University Shaggy dog story Truman State University Beavis and Butt-head Connecticut College Futurama (TV series - season 2) Claremont McKenna College University of Massachusetts Amherst Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Kingdom Hospital Friends The Sims 2: University The Amazing Race University of Tennessee at Chattanooga Felicity Haverford College Trinity College (Connecticut) IBM PC compatible Blood on the Tracks Avenue Q CPU cache Garfield Oh My Goddess!
