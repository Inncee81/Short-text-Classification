some general questions about college are girls who don't join sororities considered weird i am going to a large college next year where frats sororities are kind of a big deal but i don't think i would fit in with those people is it hard to make friends the friends i have now i've known since elementary school i haven't had to make friends since then and i'm so awkward sometimes any tips on getting along with your roomate in your dorm the girl i'm rooming with is one of my best friends but i'm afraid we'll get sick of each other actually just tips on dorm life in general the do's and don'ts this may seem weird but all of my friends are wondering too what are you supposed to take to class like in high school i had ring binders for every class but i don't know what to bring in college i wouldn't consider you weird then again i'm in the same boat i refuse to join a sorority it isn't hard to make friends if you keep yourself approachable leave the door to your room open attend wing cube floor hall events join a club talk to some people that sit by you in class it's really easy i was nervous about that too and on the first weekend i met someone with whom i've spent pretty much every day of college don't live with your best friends it can seriously ruin the friendship my advice is that your best bet is to get a random roommate but maybe stay in the same hall as your friend you may get an amazing roommate that way and if you don't you've still got a futon to crash on somewhere else other dorm advice do make friends with your r a c a buy sandals for the shower go to wing cube floor hall events make homemade meals every now and then bring pictures from home buy posters those rooms are seriously boring try to meet new people in your dorm just go door to door and introduce yourself get your parents to send care packages homemade cookies a picture of your pet an extra don't shower without sandals be afraid to ask a loud neighbor to turn down their music if you're trying to sleep or study be the loud neighbor overwhelm yourself with classes college isn't just about homework drink in the dorms although it's usually better if you do it there than at a party no underage tickets usually be afraid to try new things i have binders that i take to class each class is a separate color it's good to have them this way because if you're sick tired hungover just don't want to go to class you can still get the notes from someone and put them in the right order also for books check out http www half com and get them for a lot cheaper if you have anymore questions concerns etc please feel free to email me i've been there and i've been a peer mentor for incoming freshmen seriously just send a note Avenue Q The Catcher in the Rye Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Shaggy dog story Humphrey Bogart One Tree Hill (TV series) Poker jargon Theory of conduct Undergrads Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Social rule Garfield Freed-Hardeman University Oh My Goddess!
