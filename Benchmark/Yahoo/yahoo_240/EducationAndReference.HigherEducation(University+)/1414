what should i major in i want to be a physical therapist graduate program so what should i major in it doesn't really matter what my major is since its a graduate program but what would be good you are right your overall major doesn't matter what matters more is that you've completed the prerequisite courses for the pt program to which you wish to apply that being said i would try to choose a major that encompasses many of those classes in fact some schools will offer a health sciences degree which allows you to take all your prerequisites the actual health sciences degree doesn't mean a whole lot you still need to go to grad school to complete the pt degree however some other popular choices include kinesiology exercise science biology etc it really depends on what your school offers good luck Physical therapy Graduate school Education in the United States Master's degree Chiropractic Physician Simon Fraser University University of Connecticut Education in Hong Kong Johns Hopkins University Georgetown University Education in Taiwan College admissions Education in Australia Juris Doctor Medical school Cornell University Education in Sweden Chinese University of Hong Kong Medicine Education in Germany Associate's degree IB Diploma Programme A-level Doctor of Philosophy University of Michigan Northeastern University, Boston Brown University Ontario Academic Credit Nurse Bachelor of Arts Memorial University of Newfoundland Lawyer Columbia University Massachusetts Institute of Technology Washington University in St. Louis Law school Georgia Institute of Technology City and Guilds of London Institute University of Pennsylvania Oregon State University Secondary education in the United States __cole Polytechnique University of North Carolina at Charlotte College Seneca College California Baptist University Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences University of Toronto Grade (education) Florida State University GED California Polytechnic State University Harvey Mudd College Texas Woman's University Sonoma State University Temple University Novosibirsk State University Stevens Institute of Technology Smith College Australian National University Education in Romania Cooper Union Doctorate Alexander Technique Education in Finland Tai Chi Chuan Drew University Scientology beliefs and practices Christian Brothers University University of California, San Diego Neuro-linguistic programming Stanford University University of Alabama Heidelberg College Advanced Placement Program Far Eastern University Academic degree Bilkent University Queen's University American University Ryerson University Nicomachean Ethics Education in the People's Republic of China Pharmacist Clements High School University of Victoria University of Texas at San Antonio Community college History of science and technology Bob Jones University Cornell University College of Arts and Sciences University of Scranton Hartwick College Hopkins School Logic Tufts University School of Medicine and Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences
