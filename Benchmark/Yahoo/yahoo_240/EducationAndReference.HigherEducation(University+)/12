why was an th grade education equivalant to a bachelor's degree today seriously many in my parent's and grandparent's generations had good white collar positions when they never even got to attend high school sure doctors lawyers etc went to college but not the average person with a good job in management because in your grandparent's day they received a much better basic education than we do today math english science geography and history were mandatory courses children didn't have calculators or computers so they learned to do math in their heads or with a pencil your brain is like a muscle the more you exercise it the better it gets in english class they didn't watch tv or put on plays they learned phonics and grammar and had spelling drills every day they learned to sound out words and use grammar correctly that meant that they could read and communicate properly they read age appropriate books and of course they read the newspaper in geography and history they learned first about the geography and history of their local community then their county or region then their state province then their country and their country's relationships with other countries and finally about the world and its history and geography in that way they became knowledgeable about their own surroundings and developed a curiosity about the world which they satisfied by using their reading skills to broaden their understanding of their world same thing in classes like biology they went out into the field behind the school and collected plants and bugs and learned how to classify them and related them to their local geography and history so their education started with specifics and went to generalities and built on strong understanding of basic reading writing and math to be fair they had some advantages that students today do not have changes were not as rapid as they are now they could focus on local issues because they didn't know about stuff like catastrophes in asia for days after they happened we are swamped with information and we do not know what is important and what is not so we do not know where to focus tv has encouraged a decline in children's ability to focus on something for longer than minutes technologically they had less to learn whole fields of study had not be developed yet the education system concentrated on the r 's reading 'riting and 'rithmatic and not on the stuff that kids are taught these days if you give a child the tools to learn then as they get older they will learn on their own we don't do that we try to teach everything and end up teaching nothing so that takes care of education the other thing is that employers expected to train a worker and keep that worker for the whole of their working life years they made investments in workers and it paid off for our economy these days there is little employer loyalty and of course that means that workers feel little loyalty to their bosses a person will change jobs every years so employers want people who are already educated and with as much education as possible so they do not have to invest in them so there are a couple of reasons there are lots more and i suggest that you talk to your grandparents and older relatives and ask them what they learned in school you would be surprised my grandfather went to grade he took latin and started greek in grade he took english composition and grammar and literature he took history geography science math and phys ed shop music and art was compulsory he was in school hours every day monday to friday except the summer holidays and time at christmas spring break did not exist there were not many 'professional development' days he had homework every night and if he didn't do his homework he got the strap my child attended school hours a day with time out for lunch she took english no other languages history geography was a combined class and had math and science classes days a week in addition to weeks at christmas week in the spring weeks in the summer she has all statutory holidays and the teachers do not do any teaching on the friday before the holiday she gets 'development' days her teachers cannot maintain discipline in the classroom so what she learned depended on how bad some ofthe other kids were that day she's never had homework it makes a big difference Education in Australia
