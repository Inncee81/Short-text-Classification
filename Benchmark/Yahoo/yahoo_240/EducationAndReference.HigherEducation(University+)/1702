st augustin educational services bogus school need help my y o son wanted a better job and so took an online cna course from this school he completed the course which costs which he paid for himself he did this so he could work this summer while taking it he was sent a certificate of completion but no certificate number for the state registry even though it said they were accredited he did this all on his own to show us he could do it we are unable to reach them by phone and they do not return emails if anyone knows what options i have please tell me i will not rest until something is done there is one payment left and we sent an email saying this will be held until they contact us i will be contacting the bbb and whoever else i can to put a stop to this if you know anything about this please tell me thank you this is their site http nursingassistant us have contacted the bbb and am calling the attorney general's office now since he is and i did not sign for him to do this maybe i have a chance ok what i'm going to write here may not make you a happy camper but here it is on reviewing the site for st augustine i don't see anywhere that it says their program will qualify one for a state registry as a nursing assistant i don't see where they say this is a cna certified nursing assistant program they say they will issue a nursing assistant certificate which you write that they did and not that they will qualify you for any state certification while they do write that they are accredited i can't find by what agency accreditation doesn't imply that you'll qualify for certification though depending upon which agency issues the accreditation it may not imply anything at all it's very possible that he learned more than worth of information in this program it seems to me that this school has done exactly what they said they'd do it's possible that you and your son have read more into what they promised than what they really did a nurses aid assistant we used to call them orderly doesn't require any certifications generally that is a different thing than a cna certified nursing assistant remaining open minded when you consider this question did he just finish a program to train nursing assistants or certified nursing assistants st augustine has an address on their web page as being in atlanta ga you can contact the ga state board of education to register your complaint and they will investigate Paralegal Nurse Nursing Internet fraud Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Physician Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Domain Name System Software engineering Plame affair Education in Australia Certified Nursing Assistant Juris Doctor Certification School counselor Phishing Pretty Good Privacy Trademark No Child Left Behind Act Medical Assistant E-mail spam Associate's degree Barrister Whois Teacher Gmail Education in Portugal Midwifery ISO 9000 Medical prescription Public domain Advance fee fraud Accountancy Spam (electronic) Public-key cryptography Open access School accreditation Physical therapy Notary public Lawyer Community college Probation officer Karl Rove Podiatrist National Kidney Foundation Singapore 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines SCO-Linux controversies Spyware Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East Unemployment benefit Pilot certification in the United States Nurse anesthetist August 2005 in Malaysia and Singapore Legal research Information Technology Infrastructure Library Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Centrelink Attorney at Law Copyright law of the United Kingdom Bush v.
