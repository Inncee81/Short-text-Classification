the course eee has a scope or not yes eee has good scope as the other are having such as ece mechanical eie and others but you should be well in practicals means you should have get the knowledge of emi electro magnetic inductions eee refers to electrical electronics engineering most of the machines will work with the electrical motors like induction motors synchronous motors and so on Electric motor Phonograph Electrical generator Magnetic field Electromagnetism Alternator Electrical engineering Digital circuit Linear motor Sound recording Transformer Computer George Westinghouse Engine Magnet Relay Fan (implement) Timeline of invention Fuel injection Magnetic resonance imaging Brushless DC electric motor World Columbian Exposition Internal combustion engine Automobile self starter Maxwell's equations Piezoelectricity Microtechnology Perpetual motion Power factor correction Eric Laithwaite Electromagnetic field Electrodeless lamp Electric vehicle High-voltage direct current Variable Frequency Drive Locomotive Electricity Railgun Electronic music Engineering Technology Magnetic cartridge Three-phase Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology Movie projector Electricity meter Wind turbine Capacitor Polyphase system Drill Electro (music) Embrace, extend and extinguish Three-phase electric power General Motors Electro-Motive Division Machine gun Alternating current Electromagnet Logic Coil Automobile Gas turbine Ignition system Electric guitar Loudspeaker Ion thruster Magnetic levitation train Battery electric vehicle Magnetism History of computing hardware RS-232 Seismometer Nikola Tesla Stirling engine Gramophone record Michael Faraday Resonance Electron Spacecraft propulsion Automotive lighting Inductance Canon T90 Mechanics Fluorescent lamp Plasma (physics) Saab 9-3 Industrial engineering Circuit design Richard H.
