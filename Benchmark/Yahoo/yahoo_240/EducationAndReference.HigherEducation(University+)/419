mcat questions confused okay so if i want to take the mcat should i take all the courses that the exam will deal with in my university program like should my program include biochem biology chem anatomy organic chem genetics etc should i take all the courses so that i am prepared for the mcat thanks in advance well i obviously know that i am supposed to take the courses before taking the exam but some people do not take some of the courses in university and they just get a book to review for the mcat and pretty much teach themselves what they need to know so i was simply wondering what people suggest doing aside from what courses are specifically required by the med school s you are applying to pre reqs you don't necessarily need to take all the courses that deal with the mcat's subject matter for instance the medical school that i want to attend doesn't require genetics or biochemistry both these subjects are included in the mcat however so whether i take the courses or not depends on how comfortable i am with these subjects if i think that i can study and learn the material on my own then i will just buy a textbook and study it some people have done this on the other hand taking the course will give you access to a professor who may offer insights that aren't in the book or may be able to answer your questions in addition taking the course will force you to study as you have a grade to worry about a lot of times independent study doesn't work because it is too easy to put off especially when your other classes with grades to worry about start becoming more demanding in some schools students are allowed to sit in on the class essentially you just attend the lecture as an observer you listen and learn but don't get any credit for the class you also shouldn't have to pay some schools will try to make you pay i think this is called 'auditing a class' but if you speak to the professor who teaches the class and explain why you want to sit in he or she may allow you to sit in without paying personally i am taking genetics this fall mainly because i don't trust myself to have enough discipline to study thoroughly enough for that portion of the mcat alone xd and also because the professor teaching the course has a good reputation good luck Education in the United States Medical school Graduate school Education in Portugal Medical College Admission Test Juris Doctor Professor Education in Hong Kong Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Australia Biochemistry Education in Romania Lawyer High school Advanced Placement Program GED IB Diploma Programme Physician Master's degree Theory of conduct SAT Education in Malaysia Biology Alexander Technique A-level The Princeton Review Economics Law school College Scientology beliefs and practices Trinity College, Dublin American and British English differences Community college Species Graduate Record Examination Junior Certificate Education in Taiwan College admissions Extreme Programming Academia Education Massachusetts Institute of Technology Secondary education in France Stevens Institute of Technology Philosophy of language Linus Pauling Franz Boas Education in Sweden University of Bristol Secondary education in the United States Social rule Physical therapy Education in Austria Test (student assessment) Brown University Doctor of Philosophy Game theory Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Intelligent design Intelligent design movement Rudolf Steiner Logic Victor Cousin Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination Tripartite System Chinese University of Hong Kong Martial art Charles Darwin's education Scientific method Prostate cancer Teacher Leaving Certificate Second language acquisition Doctorate Physics Japanese tea ceremony University of Maryland Baltimore County Microeconomics Reiki Milton H.
