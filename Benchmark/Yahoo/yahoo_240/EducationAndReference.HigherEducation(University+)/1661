spelman or uic i'm so confused i'm a junior in high school and i need to start picking my colleges and my dream school is spelman it just seems so elegant and together and the sisterhood is so close my family wants me to stay in illinois and go to a university here they think that if i go to an black college that i might have to take over some classes because there not the same as the diverse or white colleges they feel that the other colleges have better book and technology than the historically black ones my grandpa said that back in the 's i could go to spelman but now days its better to go an more diverse college what do you guys think my best friend went to spelman and i went to a different women's college she had an incredibly experience there she felt incredibly academically prepared and also found it to be a really nurturing environment there are a lot of studies that suggest that women's colleges in general provide really great places for young women to grow and get wonderful educations i know my time in a women's college was great in terms of spelman though my best friend went on to attend a masters program at mit and i know lots of her graduating classes went on to super graduate programs so i wouldn't worry about the books or technology being outdated i think it has a really strong reputation with graduate programs i know the professional networking and mentoring there and at women's colleges in general are really great i'm sure it would be a wonderful empowering liberal arts experience that said univ of illinois is a great school with wonderful faculty you might want to think about the urbana champaign campus though because i've heard undergrads have better experiences there good luck College University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Champaign-Urbana Metropolitan Area Clark Atlanta University University of Illinois at Chicago The College of New Jersey Education in the United States Georgetown University Florida Institute of Technology University of Houston American University Trinity College, Dublin Columbia University Harvard University Pennsylvania State University York University Seneca College University of Pennsylvania Urbana, Illinois University of Connecticut Graduate school High school University of New England, Maine University of Alabama Affirmative action Emerson College Duke University Associate's degree Merrimack College University of Toronto University of Central Florida University of Arkansas Cornell University Chinese University of Hong Kong Heidelberg College Alpha Phi Howard Zinn Piccolo Junior Saga Johns Hopkins University Brown University Vanderbilt University Tulane University Mount Holyoke College Temple University Community college University of North Carolina at Charlotte University of Southern California Brigham Young University Massachusetts Institute of Technology Academia Caldwell College Education in Japan Otterbein College Middle Tennessee State University Juris Doctor Carnegie Mellon University Morehouse College Oregon State University Northeastern University, Boston Babson College Harvard Division of Continuing Education Augsburg College Dallas Baptist University University of California, Los Angeles Georgia Institute of Technology University of Ottawa Florida State University Homeschooling Academic degree The Catholic University of America Medical school Kansas State University Master's degree Purdue University Bates College Christian Brothers University Middle East Technical University Stanford University Regent University University of Texas at San Antonio Champaign, Illinois Wesleyan University Tufts University Lawyer Education in Taiwan Swarthmore College Education in the Republic of Ireland University of Waterloo Caulfield Grammar School Far Eastern University New York University
