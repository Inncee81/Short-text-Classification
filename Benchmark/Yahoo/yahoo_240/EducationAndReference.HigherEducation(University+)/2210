is online education that bad i have been an online student with devry university for about two years now and overall the experience has been great but lately i've been thinking about changing my program of study and as i started looking at other universities i decided to research them and i found the most terrible things about them but even though i know that a traditional university or community college is a lot better i simply don't have that option because i have a young child that i have to care for so online education is my only choice so since i've ruled out university of phoenix i just wanted to know what you all think about other online schools like kaplan university aiu and other online universities have you looked around to see if there are any traditional universities offering an online degree in your subject that's your best bet you'll get a degree of unquestioned reputation that way additionally you might find that you can do your course at a public university which could even end up saving you money in addition to getting a better education and a more respected degree Education in the United States Education in Portugal Kaplan Columbia University Medical school Master's degree Associate's degree Graduate school SAT Chinese University of Hong Kong High school Distance education University of Phoenix No Child Left Behind Act College admissions Cornell University Juris Doctor Pennsylvania State University Education in Sweden Theory of conduct GED Education in Romania Education in Australia Education in Hong Kong Education in the People's Republic of China Athabasca University Johns Hopkins University Community college Florida State University American University University of Central Florida IB Diploma Programme Homeschooling Ryerson University DeVry University Student loan University of Pennsylvania University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Bachelor of Arts York University Doctorate Education in Singapore University of Maryland University College Trinity College, Dublin Open University University of Alabama Hogwarts subjects Academia Education Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Education in Malaysia Economics Lawyer Blackjack Education in the Republic of Ireland Education in Austria Northeastern University, Boston A-level Seneca College Education in Taiwan Craps Physical therapy Charter school Dublin City University Joseph Soloveitchik Law school University University of Ottawa School choice The College of New Jersey Academic degree University of Hawaii University of Houston Chiropractic Doctor of Philosophy UCAS University of Hawaii at Manoa Temple University University of Tennessee Marylhurst University University of Judaism Pitaten Software engineering Medical University of South Carolina University of Maryland, College Park North Carolina State University Higher education Nurse Education in Finland University of California, San Diego Portland State University Loyola University Chicago Education in Canada University of North Texas Robert Hutchins Higher education in Japan Baruch College
