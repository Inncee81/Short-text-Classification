neuroscience or psychology ph d i'm an undergrad psychology student with plans to go to grad school my question is for those who have experience in these fields i'm debating on whether i should look into an interdisciplinary neuroscience doctoral program or a psychology program with a concentration in cognitive or behavioral neuroscience ultimately i want to study the mind brain and philosophical issues aside the brain is where it's at knowing that cognitive psychology will eventually be explained by a robust cognitive neuroscience i'm concerned that not studying the brain on all levels will leave me in more of an area of abstraction traditional psychology and i won't really be in the know or have as many opportunities for understanding how the mind brain works in an academic setting or elsewhere i would appreciate any comments or even questions thanks if you like the brain limbic lobe too then go for interdisciplinary neuroscience doctoral very difficult because of heavy neuroscience subjects psychology does not requires a lot of neuroscience subjects job prospect is also better with a neuro background Psychology Cognitive science Neuroscience Cognitive neuroscience Cognition Social psychology Brain Science History of psychology Second language acquisition Philosophy of mind Neuropsychology Developmental psychology Philosophy of mathematics Cognitive psychology Cognitive neuropsychology Neurotheology Attention Philosophy of perception Neuro-linguistic programming Connectionism Schizophrenia Hampshire College History of brain imaging Artificial consciousness Race and intelligence Drew University Psycholinguistics Graduate school Philosophy of language Human brain Mind Animal cognition History of science Religious studies Medicine Psychoanalysis George Lakoff Behaviorism Functional magnetic resonance imaging Biological neural network Person Hypnosis Academia Journal of Consciousness Studies Mind control Franz Boas Evolutionary psychology Behavioral finance Intelligence (trait) Psychiatry Emotion Brenda Milner Reality Holism in science Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Human Philosophy Where Mathematics Comes From Hippocampus Sex and intelligence Free will Cognitive bias Intelligence quotient Neuroeconomics Comparative psychology Parapsychology Maurice Merleau-Ponty Physician Mental imagery Near-death experience Kundalini Sigmund Freud Western philosophy Aspartame Epistemology Brainwashing A Course In Miracles Frontal lobe Transpersonal psychology Religion Brain imaging University of Connecticut Meme Sleep Memory Cognitivism (psychology) Brain-computer interface Cerebral hemisphere
