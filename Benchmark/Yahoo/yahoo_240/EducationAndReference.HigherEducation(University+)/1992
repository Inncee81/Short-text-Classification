in college is it better to use spiral notebooks or a binder with notebook paper in it to take notes if you type quickly a laptop may be the best option if you are going to use paper for notes i would go with a perforated notebook that is hole punched that way if you accidentally grab the wrong notebook you can just take notes in it anyway and tear the sheet out neatly and put it in to a ring binder later i perfer to have several small ring binders one for each class that way i'm not lugging around all of my notes for every class syllabi etc all day actually i usually have one big binder to store everything in a a color coded folder like a trapper keeper folder for each class that way everything is together in my office and i jsut grab what i need for each class if i have statistics that day i take the green folder the green notebook perforated not spiral bound and the green textbook as well as my pens etc i find color coding each class to be the easiest way to organize i use the color of the textbook as my guide i even have a master calendar with color coded post its again stats would use green post its that shows me what needs to be done when i use red ink for exams blue for assignments and black for reading etc so a final in statistics would have information on green post it pads the exam date would be in red ink on a green post it assignments and the work proceeding them would be scheduled in blue ink on green post its etc sounds a bit anal but an hour or two with some basic office supplies and a big wall calendar will save you headaches later in the semester i normally used a big peice of posterboard for each month but you could use a large desk calendar Notebook Laptop Cascading Style Sheets Postage stamp separation Computer System 7 (Macintosh) Postage stamps and postal history of the United States Book Stamp collecting Piano roll Traditional animation Unreal Atari 8-bit family Monster Manual System/36 Floppy disk Medical prescription Windows Vista Mac OS X Desk Drill bit CPU cache Windows 2000 Punch card Color Getting Things Done CMYK color model Paint Windows XP Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Mario series enemies The Citadel (Military College) Final Fantasy (video game) Marching band GED 2004 U.S. election voting controversies, Ohio Screenplay Postage stamp Lynbrook High School File folder Ballpoint pen Anne Frank Color printing Palm OS Lighting Hard disk Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Daylight saving time Liturgical year Fountain pen GameFAQs Juris Doctor One-time pad German car number plates Compiler optimization Gmail Light-emitting diode The Time Machine Mimeograph machine Guy Davenport Drawing Professional wrestling throws Typewriter House of Leaves Blood on the Tracks Toilet paper Strap-on dildo Fecal incontinence Computer printer Gregorian calendar Abortion Agnes Scott College Compact disc System/34 Education in Germany Tattoo Steganography Spider Ink Judo Wallpaper group Moe Berg Microsoft Office The Diary of a Young Girl M-209 Chiropractic Quest for Glory Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Gramophone record Shaggy dog story M.C.
