how much does childcare normally run we are going to be brand new parents and originally my mother had opted to care for the newborn but now she is wanting more than we can afford to pay her is a month too much i'm actually in austin texas so the answers you gave about texas were excellent i know in smaller cities it's going to be cheaper but here it's becoming such an expensive town depends on where you live how old your child is how often your child will attend and sometimes the quality of the facility i live in texas in a mid sized town so it is not too bad here my daycare cost month for my year old to go full time days wk pm my month old little boy will be starting the same school when he is months and then it will cost me almost twice as much i have a friend who lives in austin big town and they pay twice as much as me for only child also although this is not always the case it is something to consider if you think a price is too cheap it probably is for a reason on the bad part of town there are many child care centers that are half the cost of the one i take my daughter to however if you look up these centers you will find they have many many problems during inspections this is not always true though so just do your research most states have websites where you can go to research for child care if you are in tx i can post you a link i already have good luck edited http www dfps state tx us child care search texas child care here is the link that i use to research with it won't tell you prices you'll have to call for that forgot to mention that the price usually drops when a child hits about months the daycare i am at does not do that same price for all ages but i love the place so much that i kept my daughter there when looking around a daycare trust your instincts if something feels wrong don't use their services Day care Kindergarten Childcare Social rule Education in the United States Publicly funded medicine Health insurance Growth hormone treatment Mutual fund Breastfeeding Wal-Mart Pharmaceutical company Craps About a Boy Theory of conduct Canadian and American health care systems compared Outsourcing Poker jargon University of Texas at Austin Laura Schlessinger Grief Student loan Infantilism Dairy Kodocha Sport utility vehicle Digital photography Food and Drug Administration Adoption Postpartum depression Pitaten Divorce Cindy Sheehan EastEnders Hydrogen economy Social Security (United States) The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio Filling station Transsexuality Mystique (comics) Jon Secada Abortion debate Glen Jacobs Legal research Shawn Michaels Bicycle lighting Hollyoaks Health care in the United States Fathers' rights Good Times Privatization Education in the People's Republic of China AIDS in Africa Goodness and value theory Free trade Centrelink TLC Nintendo XERF One Tree Hill (TV series) Jean Grey Unreleased Madonna songs United States Postal Service CPU design FairTax Bond Political subdivisions of New York State Education in England Sami Brady Hyperinflation Billboard Hot 100 Laserdisc Supply and demand Abortion in the United States CPU cache Kimberly-Clark Corporation Gross domestic product Public Eye Game show Medicare (Canada) Children of God Graduate school Nuclear power Full House No Child Left Behind Act Airline Humphrey Bogart Economics Broadband Internet access Destiny's Child Babylonian law Fancy Crane Open access Emperor Yuan of Han Microeconomics Days of our Lives
