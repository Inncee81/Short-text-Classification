how do you get a five week old infant on a schedule my five week old daughter has both feeding and sleeping issues the past couple of days she seems to get hungry crying hungry after hrs instead of that's with at the doctor's instructions after feeding her for solid active minutes at each breast i have continued to feel like my milk just does not sustain her prior to the past couple of days she'd have feeding marathons where i'd nurse for an hour and a half the doctor told me basically to stop being a human pacifier the doctor also seems to think my daughter really should be on a schedule now no more on demand feeding but at set times each day you can't really do that with a hour schedule any advice her sleeping issues are that basically she doesn't unless you are holding her or she has been supplemented sometimes oz sometimes a bit less than oz with formula i am not comfortable with co sleeping but it seems letting her sleep on my or my husband's chest is the only way we can get any rest help interestingly i called a lactation specialist and they suggested i call my pediatrician which is why i did that i'll be calling them back today too but others' experience and suggestions may be helpful during the day we can't put her down for a nap she cries to be held she will sleep in your arms where baby wearing goes she doesn't like the sling and i can get away with front pack once in a while most times she just cries and roots at this age she won't be on any kind of schedule i know it may seem like they should be but you could try and probably not get any results until they are around months old schedules just frustrate you more if you are breast feeding you should feed on demand especially right now since she is having a growth spurt right now and her feeding more frequently is going to increase your milk supply so she will have enough to eat after she grows she is just going to be much hungrier than usual because her body is working extra hard they ususally hit growth spurts close to weeks at weeks months and months i can't remember the last one but i think it was or maybe as for sleeping we had the same problem he would only sleep with me i just waited and at months he was comfortable being in his own bed you do what feels right for you and your family good luck and congrats on the baby girl edit oh yea i agree that you might want to change doctors to one that is going to promote breast feeding it sounds like this doctor either doesn't support it or doesn't know enough about it also you can consult with a lactation consultant and they really really help la leche league has a website too that is very informational just so you know too try not to supplement and just put her to the breast more often right now so that you don't accidently decrease your supply Fertility awareness Urinary incontinence Breast Prostate cancer Sleep Puberty Milk Folic acid Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an EastEnders Equine conformation Infant Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Amazing Race Cat The Contender (television series) Guinea pig Fecal incontinence Saturday Night Live Tocopherol Brassiere Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Friends The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Dairy Little Britain Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Milton H.
