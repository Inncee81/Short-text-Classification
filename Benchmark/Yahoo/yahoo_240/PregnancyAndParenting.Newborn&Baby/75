why are some women hostile to babies i have a month old son and he's buddy buddy with everyone some couples have fun with him hold him talk to him while very few others would not want to be bothered there was one woman who gave him a nasty look on the train after my son tapped on her shoulder which made me want to smack her one time my son went to say hi to a woman the woman physically became irate she looked for his mom when i was more than feet away when she saw me she yelled at me is that your son go grab him as if my son was molesting her i have a friend with her husband and they say they don't want any children my son walks toward the woman she walked backwards and avoided touching him my question is what kind of woman of child bearing age cannot handle a baby there may be an underlying issue one of my mother's long time close friends refused to come to my baby shower then when i brought my newborn daughter to their bridge night every woman held her except that one she acted like my baby had coodies turns out that she had a miscarriage when she was younger and just couldnt handle being around babies give them the benefit of the doubt and accept that not all people like babies and kids Social rule Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Childbirth Professional wrestling aerial techniques Knots Landing 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Eddie Guerrero Baby Blues Abortion debate About a Boy Swingout Sin City Shaggy dog story Phoebe Buffay's songs Ron and Fez Katelyn Faber Tag Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Professional wrestling holds Maury Milton H.
