breastfeeding troubles help my son is weeks old and we have been doing this exclusively without problems since he was in the hospital at birth after the first week there were basically no issues latching on and he is growing very well as i have a good milk supply within the pat week he has been going through a growth spurt ever since this started after he feeds on each breast for minutes he's content for maybe minutes afterwards this includes one burp after each breast well once he is content he stops and minutes later he begins to act like he's hungry shoving his fist in his mouth open it wide in mid air while awake etc etc this is minutes after that feeding remember so i offer him a boob he'll suck for about minutes and become detatched and try and latch back on when he tries to latchback on he brings his fist to his mouth and tries to get a mouthful while pratically pushing my boob away on accident and also kicking his legs franctically and arching his back cont and eventually he'll get back on for a few more minutes and this will start all over it gets progressively worse over the next few minutes to the point where he'll be latched on and so frustrated he cries with my boob in his mouth i thought maybe he's not hungry and trying to give another signal but his diaper will be clean no gas that i know of and he gives me all the signs of eing extra hungry what is the deal and why the sudden problems with staying latched he has no problem getting a mouthful it's when he open his mouth wide he pushes his head back while trying to grab on i'm getting so frustrated and i feel like i'm doing something wrong oh and i have to mention this only happens at night before bed no other time not in the middle of the night and no time during the day oh and i have to mention this only happens at night before bed no other time not in the middle of the night and no time during the day babies at this age hit a growth spurt he's growing and so is his appetite the more he sucks the more milk you'll have at the next feeding let him nurse as long as he needs he's just trying to make sure without knowing it that he has enough milk for the next feeding he may also be just a bit restless at night not wanting to go to sleep but not wanted to stay awake either try wrapping him up tight this will prevent him from knocking the breast away give him a week or so it will all straighten out i've been a laleche volunteer for years i know it's a trying time but you made it this far and don't give up Shaggy dog story EastEnders Traumatic brain injury Infant Childbirth Puberty New York Giants Equine conformation Breast Aerial (dance move) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Red Hot Chili Peppers Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Knots Landing Swingout Fecal incontinence Piccolo Junior Saga Professional wrestling throws Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Shawn Michaels M60 machine gun Mattress Carburetor Eddie Guerrero Characters in the Smurfs Dairy Breaststroke The Amazing Race Bong Diving Professional wrestling holds Urinary incontinence Undergarment Stroke Hypoglycemia Milk Cat Elephant STS-61 National Football League Insomnia She Loves You Knife Glossary of American football Sin City The Contender (television series) Milton H.
