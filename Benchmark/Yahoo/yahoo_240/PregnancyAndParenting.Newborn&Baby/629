taking away a pacifer at what age do i need to take away the pacifer my soon is months old i never had to go through this with our first son because he never liked them i am curious because i see these people with and yr olds still sucking pacifers and i think that is just way to old is your baby sleeping through the night yet i say take it away right away before it gets harder i am trying to get rid of it now that my baby is months old because she constantly wakes up at night whenever the pacifier falls from her mouth it's terrible one thing i am sure if i ever have another baby i won't give her a pacifier but seriously don't let her get used to it Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pacifier Lisa's First Word Peace Vampire Maggie Simpson Satchel Paige Jon Secada Shaggy dog story R.E.M.
