why dont i see baby walkers as much anymore are they not recommended or what i think this question is good but most of the answers are poor the ones who said dangerous seem to be speaking out on what they have heard but not had experience with the ones who said they hinder walking strong muscles early development and concept of moving through space i also find incorrect my opinion at least would be based on personal experience i used one for all six of our natural born children numerous foster children we raised and passed it on for the use of neighbors and now two grandchildren no children were left unattended so no accidents occured but then again we didn't leave them unattended in the bathroom either or a bucket of water from washing a floor out and not emptied either so we didn't need to remove these items from sale because they caused drownings lighters and matches aren't bad in themselves unless of course you want to allow children to get them or play with them unattended our six children were ahead of normal developement under age five because they had interaction and more access to their world instead of stuck on a blanket playpen or bed to develope on their own constructive play and feeding the mind is how we get intelligence but supervised with all children most were sitting standing and walking by age one or under age one because of the use of a walker one was walking by age months without the continued use of a walker all had grade scores in school at honor roll level state tests given were at the highest level schools or college shows gpa's of children need close supervision in all things what might be great for one child with supervision can cause the death of another without proper supervision i do agree with the nurse who has to see how many children are injured because of lack of parents to supervise and watch their children i also feel for the police who see dead children from car accidents because parents didn't use car seats seat belts or didn't use them correctly bottom line is they couldn't control parents who didn't want to properly watch their children so it was easier to reduce deaths by removing them from the market place Urinary incontinence Drowning Milton H.
