how should i begin a feeding routine for my son i hear it's better to do that i mean times and quantity of bottles and ounces in each bottle my son was approximately weeks old or maybe a bit older he sort of had a routine but it could be off by almost an hour at times what i did takes patience was push the feed he wanted either forwards or backwards minutes until he was on a schedule ie every hours or hours etc by doing it this way it did not upset him he was still being fed as much and often as he wanted important they are hungry but we managed to manipulate it gently so that he was truly on a schedule it made life so much easier for us also as we were able to know when he would be hungry and have his bottle breast ready and were able to run about and do things much easier he also was very happy about it what i did from early on was write down the time and amount of feed he would have i did this religiously kept a notepad where i would get everything ready then after so many weeks i could see his own pattern of sorts forming that is how i was able to know his need and manipluate it gently to get him on a really great schedule Breastfeeding A Day in the Life IBM PC compatible Scientology beliefs and practices Bong Boston and Lowell Railroad Fertility awareness CPU design Milton H.
