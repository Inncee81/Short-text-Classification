is it rude to register for baby shower gifts this is my first pregnancy and my mom is throwing me a baby shower i was wondering if i should register for the shower or just let my family friends buy what they want you should register its not rude at all i felt the sameway as you did but if you don't register its more likely that you'll recieve extra of things you don't need also keep in mind that even though you register and say you dont need clothes someone will still buy you whatever they want i recently had my babyshower and was registered at babys'r'us i recieved all of the big ticket items but didn't get much of the smaller stuff which is fine with me by the way put a large price range from all the little things that cost dollars to the big ticket items and also if you do need a lot of clothes only put in one or two onesies ect so peole get an idea of what you want and what you like because otherwise you'll have a page registry The Apprentice 2 Little Britain Social rule Shaggy dog story Humphrey Bogart Intellectual property The Price Is Right Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film) Phoebe Buffay's songs World Championship Wrestling Supply and demand RuneScape quests The Beatles discography Addressing mode Characters in the Smurfs Friends Doug Avenue Q Let's Make a Deal MMORPG Knots Landing EastEnders RuneScape weapons CPU cache Neopets Jon Secada The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie MapleStory Marilyn Monroe My Little Pony The Amazing Race Time Out of Mind RuneScape locations Mr. and Mrs. Turner Jennifer Lopez Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Married... with Children Wal-Mart Empire Burlesque Advance fee fraud Self Portrait Laura Schlessinger The Smoking Room Kender The Catcher in the Rye AFI 100 Years series Euphemism Milton H.
