m old son sticking fingers in throat often my son is m i'm pretty sure he has acid reflux is it normal for a formula fed child of his age to still spit up often he does eat table foods and baby foods also he goes to the allgergist on the th with me he is on isomil advance because he was allergic to the regular milk based formula he doesn't drink cow's milk yet i'm wondering if he's sticking his fingers in his throat because of the reflux or if it's for some other reason i called the dr office yesterday and the nurse said that it's probably just a behavior but it could also be from his tummy bothering him cuz of the reflux she also said to avoid citrus foods if anyone has any suggestions on what we can do for him or to stop him until he sees the allergist i would appreciate it he isn't being treated for the relfux currrently but i'm hoping that the allergist will do so he does this to the point of gagging and choking if you pull his hand out he sticks it right back in what to do my daughter went through two stages where she did that she would put her fingers into her mouth and gag herself often to the point of vomitting for her it was just a behavior we ignored it and she eventually stopped when my husband used to react she thought it was funny and kept doing it Breastfeeding Gastroesophageal reflux disease Urinary incontinence Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Salad Fingers Heartburn Elephant Joke Gag (BDSM) Drawn Together Dairy Food allergy The Marshall Mathers LP Coeliac disease Kodocha Milton H.
