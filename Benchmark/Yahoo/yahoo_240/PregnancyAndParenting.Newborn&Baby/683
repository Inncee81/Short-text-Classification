breast feeding mastitis if i have been breast feeding and i feel theres a lump in my breast called mastitis why does that occur an how do i get rid of it from dr jack newman mastitis is a bacterial infection of the breast that usually occurs in breastfeeding mothers however it can occur in women who are not breastfeeding or pregnant and can occur even in small babies of either sex nobody knows exactly why some women get mastitis and others do not bacteria may gain access to the breast through a crack or sore in the nipple but women without sore nipples also get mastitis and most women with cracks in the nipple do not mastitis needs to be differentiated from a plugged or blocked duct because a plugged or blocked duct does not need treatment with antibiotics whereas mastitis often but not always requires treatment with antibiotics a blocked duct presents as a painful swollen firm mass in the breast the skin overlying the blocked duct is often quite red similar to what happens during mastitis but less intense mastitis is usually also associated with fever and more intense pain as well however it is not always easy to distinguish between a mild mastitis and a severe blocked duct both are associated with a painful lump in the breast without a lump in the breast one cannot make a diagnosis of mastitis or a blocked duct a blocked duct can apparently go on to become mastitis in france physicians also recognize something they call lymphangite that is fever associated with skin which is hot and red but there is no underlying painful mass they do not believe this requires treatment with antibiotics i have seen a few cases that fit this description in my practice and indeed the problem resolves without antibiotics but then often a full blow mastitis also resolves without antibiotics as with almost all breastfeeding problems a poor latch and thus poor draining of the breast sets up the situation where mastitis is more likely to occur the links below have great information on getting better take care of yourself drink lots of fluids nurse all you can and feel better soon Pneumonia Group A streptococcal infection Chronic fatigue syndrome Androgen insensitivity syndrome Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Urinary incontinence Psoriasis Intravenous therapy Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Childbirth Traumatic brain injury Conjunctivitis Cellulitis Cancer Gonorrhoea Nipple Fertility awareness Cytomegalovirus Common cold Lyme disease Dialysis Hepatitis Cirrhosis Pharyngitis Medicine Crohn's disease Fancy rat Brassiere Nipple piercing Erysipelas Herpes simplex virus Sickle-cell disease Medical analysis of circumcision Meningitis Prostate cancer Obstetrics Hip fracture AIDS Protein-energy malnutrition Gout Infant Malaria Reiter's syndrome Diarrhea Anthrax First aid Stomach cancer Mammary gland Appendicitis Abortion Ebola Infectious mononucleosis Insulin Botulism Stroke Autism Guinea pig Milk Bubonic plague Syphilis Chlorpromazine Penis Radiation therapy Escherichia coli O157:H7 Folic acid Tuberculosis Traditional Chinese medicine Otitis externa Penicillin Body piercing Spider Hypoglycemia Eczema Lymphatic system Psychosis Needle aspiration biopsy Lupus erythematosus Rheumatic fever Fibromyalgia Asthma Shrimp farm Mumps Jaundice Legionellosis Puberty Lymphogranuloma venereum Leptospirosis Cholecystitis Premature birth
