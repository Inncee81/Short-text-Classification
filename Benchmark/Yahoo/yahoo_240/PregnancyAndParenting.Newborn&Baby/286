question about breastmilk i had to stop breastfeeding cuz i got a really bad infection and the anitbotics i was on wouldn't allow me to breastfeed so now that i am off of it my milk has dried up and i have been formula feeding well i heard that there was this pill that the doctors can give you to help bring in your milk again has anyone heard anything about this or know how to make my milk come back in thanks it is possible to relactate there are even some adoptive moms who are able to relactate without ever being pregnant or breastfeeding in the past there are a few ways to do this nipple stimulation via pumping and or latching baby on sends the message to your body to make milk usually you would use a supplimental feeding system that would let the baby get formula while latched to the breast you'd only use it until your full supply came back there are also herbs you can take to promote lactation and to increase your supply and there are also prescription drugs available as well i assume that is what you had heard about it would not be a easy as just taking a pill and starting back up but it is possible if you want to look into it i'd talk to your doctor and contact a lactation consultant the hospital or the local la lache league leader should be able to recommend one good luck no matter what you decide Breast Fertility awareness Infant formula Nipple piercing Nipple Prolactin Infant Breast pump Breast milk Milk Folic acid Nestl__ boycott Protein-energy malnutrition Haloperidol Baby bottle Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Psoriasis Urinary incontinence Guinea pig Oxytocin Veganism Mammary gland Jaundice Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Omega-3 fatty acid Dairy Patent medicine Brassiere Emergency contraception Medical cannabis Intravenous therapy Neighbours Nestl__ Prostate cancer Male lactation Abortion Doxepin Antidepressant Phoebe Halliwell Vitamin D Medical prescription Trazodone Platypus Indianapolis 500 Traditional Chinese medicine Coeliac disease Garlic Premature birth Boom Town (Doctor Who) Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Baldness treatments Malaria Cannabis (drug) Coffee Pharmaceutical company Chocolate Kodocha Caffeine The Caves of Androzani Nutrition HIV Rickets Knife Requiem for a Dream Illegal drug trade Medical analysis of circumcision RuneScape quests Penis enlargement Breast cancer Theory of conduct Methamphetamine Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Anabolic steroid Oily fish Elephant Orgasm Friends Doctor Who (Enemy Within) Conker's Bad Fur Day Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Sulfasalazine Breast fetishism Terri Schiavo Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Stomach cancer Physician Insomnia Sleeping Murder Allergy Jon Secada Hyperprolactinaemia Masturbation
