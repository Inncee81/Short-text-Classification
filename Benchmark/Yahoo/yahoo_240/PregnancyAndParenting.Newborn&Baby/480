would my parents have a right to not let me pierce my baby's ears i don't think my parents are a huge fan of getting that done for my little girl when she turns months i am taking her to get it done i am yrs old so would my parents have the right to not let me get it done for her i mean she is my child so i should be able too everyone else has covered the whole dont do it so all i am going to say is if your parents are watching her all the time chances are they will take the earings out which will allow the holes to close very quickly and then you are out your money that you wasted doing it in the first place and your parents are mad at you spend the money on something useful or put it away for your daughter dont waste it on something so frivilous everyone harps on me to get my daughters ears pierced they have since she was about months old and i have never been happier to not have done it she is months old and all she does is pull at her ears also if you do plan to get it done that early in order for it to be safe for her i recomend you get it done by your doctor and not a claires or walmarts their guns are not proper for a baby i think the earliest they will do the piercing is when the baby can sit up on her own here is what dr greene says Humphrey Bogart Knots Landing EastEnders Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Urinary incontinence Comanche The Inside Body piercing Friends History of As the World Turns (2000-present) What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?
