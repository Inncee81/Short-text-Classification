month old son can't cope with solid food i'm worried about my baby he can't cope with anything other than sloppy puree and stage baby food anything with lumps in it makes him gag so much he will be sick i've tried offering him finger food and my own food and he doesn't know what to do with it it never goes anywhere near his mouth i've offered him baby biscuits slices of banana and apple cooked veg strips bread crusts cheerios etc he just plays with them if i show him what to do by putting them in his mouth he immediately gags violently until he is sick he's always been breastfed and doesn't even like bottles veyr much will only take a few sips of water from a bottle my health visitor is useless and keeps telling me to offer him adult food but he can't cope with it all the books say they should be starting to self feed from months do you think he's unusual what should i do my baby was month old when he started to take food i had been trying to give him food since six months and he just wasn't having any of it i think basically he was happy as he was on breastmilk and he wants to control the food now he can pick his own things up and put them in his mouth he will i have never got anything pureed into his mouth bought or cooked by my own fair hand i actually gave up for a few weeks tried again every day for a few weeks and then gave up again for at least a month we have him sit with us at meals and eventually he has started taking our food when we put bits to his mouth initially mince and bolognese sauce and now bits of veg fruit meat fish mashed potatoes etc how about crunchy biscuits like carrs 'table water' they only have wheat and oil in them and baby t loved them i also find that the vegetarian hot dogs that you can buy in the freezer dept of tesco and sainsbury's went down very well baby will try when ready but don't let anyone worry you about this my gp couldn't understand it and kept giving me lame advice but the health visitor has seen it all and she was not worried it's actually amazing how broad the range of 'normal' weaning is you will know if there is a problem with weight gain otherwise don't worry i know its hard on you though as you have to be around to breast feed all the time Breastfeeding Cuisine of the Philippines Pizza Japanese cuisine Bread Tofu Hamburger Cuisine of Denmark MRE German cuisine Bengali cuisine Hot dog Peruvian cuisine British cuisine Fish and chips Veganism Cuisine of Brazil Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Jewish cuisine Shaggy dog story Korean cuisine Cuisine of Singapore McDonald's French fries Food preservation Dim sum Soul food Breakfast Pie Cuisine of the Southern United States French cuisine Hamster Domesticated turkey Kodocha Cantonese cuisine Chinese cuisine Cuisine of Malaysia EastEnders Piccolo Junior Saga Salad Fingers Fasting Cuisine of Africa Coeliac disease Little Britain Dumpling Australian cuisine Dog training Roman eating and drinking Cajun cuisine Social rule Ice cream Ramen Fecal incontinence Food Alcoholic beverage Kashrut Organic food Sandwich Cuisine of Laos Comanche Knots Landing Cuisine of Argentina Childbirth Drawn Together Sauce Pizza Hut Culture of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Soup Russian cuisine Hot pot Jam (TV series) Prostate cancer Vitamin C Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler RuneScape skills Sant Thakar Singh Fancy rat Folic acid Polish cuisine Kitchen Hypoglycemia Japanese tea ceremony Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Marilyn Monroe Milk Book of Isaiah Meat Loaf Potato Tooth
