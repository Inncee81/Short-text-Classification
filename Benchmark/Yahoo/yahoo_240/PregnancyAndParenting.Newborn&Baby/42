is it ok to sleep my baby in her pack in play i am pregnant but am getting ready i live with parents and don't have a lot of room so i would rather use a pack in play than a crib is that ok what age should i start in a crib thanks yes it is ok until your baby can roll over on his her own i assume you mean the bassinet that sits on top of the pack and play when you baby starts rolling over and sitting up you might want to either get a crib or toddler bed with a rail i think the weight limit on bassinets is lbs also personally i co sleep with my little guy months it just makes me feel better to keep a close eye on him at night since the risk of sids goes up between months i plan on introducing him to his crib at around months of course you dont want your baby sleeping in your bed if you're too sound of a sleeper or if you roll around in your sleep Sudden infant death syndrome Friends Co-sleeping Premature birth Cribbage EastEnders Passenger car Knots Landing C__ile Ferate Rom__ne The Sims 2 Sleeping car Pregnancy Breastfeeding Rugrats Lisa's First Word Urinary incontinence Professional wrestling holds Bed (furniture) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story Sharon Tate Buddy Guy Slow Train Coming The Sims Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story!
