why do i hate my baby i cant stand him i hate him crying sometimes i wish i was dead to get away from him im just too young im and my life is over i thought id get better but its getting worse hes weeks i just cant have any feeliongs for him and its killing me i wish i could run away but id miss my partner help hi dany do not panik u will get over it i knew it straight away the baby is very young i went through the same kind of feelings not hate you can not say it is hate u dont hate your baby it is the novelty it is because you do not know much about being a mum but you are learning every day it is the trauma u went through at birth is is because he's changed your routines your life it is the realisation of responsability it also makes me believe that you do not have much support from your partner either probably he's as young as u r and then u may find that there are better things to do out there it is nothing wrong with doing what u were doing before but obviously the proportions will change u r obviously too young to have a baby a child with a child get some help from your parents either your ones or the in laws someone to help you out someone experienced you will definitely get over this also would be of much help to get some counselling as by the sound of it you are going through a postnatal depression u will be alright with professional help do not delay it as it will go worst by the day and it will also affect the relationship with your partner think about the fact that it isn't baby's fault he came in this world they are so helpless but you as mummy now you need to do whats best for your family and baby in particular once you decided or it just happened to have the baby good luck and think about the baby as being a flesh from your flesh your blood runs through his veins he is sooooooooooo innocent too try and get close to him by playing with him whenever he's settled just play with his tiny little hands look into his innocent eyes and think that he is an angel and you are his protective angel Pitaten About a Boy Infantilism Jon Secada The Amber Spyglass Abortion debate Charmed Childbirth YuYu Hakusho Shaggy dog story Fathers' rights Kodocha Jennifer Lopez Breastfeeding Humphrey Bogart Theory of conduct Divorce Vernon Schillinger Scenes from a Memory The Subtle Knife Romulus and Remus Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Prenatal diagnosis Autism Milton H.
