my month old is using my breast as a pacifier i have tried bottles and pacifiers but my son will not take either i am noticing that in order for him to go to sleep he has to be on my breast some of the times he is not even sucking when i pull him off he tries to get it back what can i do to break this habit there is a technique described in the no cry sleep solution by elizabeth pantley it involves unlatching a sleeping baby and when baby roots or wakes up allowing him to latch back on wait until baby is in deep sleep again and try again eventually he will accept being unlatched and will stay asleep lots of women say don't let him use you as a pacifier what did babies use for comfort sucking before the invention of pacifiers in the uk they're known as dummies because it's a false substitute for the real thing like a crash test dummy nursing for comfort is fine and babies are born with the drive to do so the best solution is to relax about it it won't last forever and when he is old enough to stay out all night you'll long for the safety and coziness of those late night nursing marathons if you don't have a command center you can make one the command center is what i called my nursing spot i had an all night nurser my record is hours in one day i had all the pillows in the house all the remotes the phone a book a glass of water a healthy snack and a bar of dark chocolate for emergencies only get comfortable put on some music and enjoy the nursing years we might as well enjoy it because we have to go through it no matter what Breastfeeding Urinary incontinence EastEnders Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Mattress Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Amber Spyglass Knots Landing M60 machine gun The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Jon Secada STS-61 Time Out of Mind Shaggy dog story Ocean's Twelve Childbirth Hamster The Shining (film) Social rule The Beatles discography Sleep Coffee Avenue Q Out-of-body experience Macbeth Jam (TV series) Insomnia Humphrey Bogart AFI 100 Years series Owen Hart Narcolepsy Sukkot Friends Hera Fertility awareness Pacifier Lucid dreaming Neighbours Glass Something Positive The Inside Donald Neilson Conker's Bad Fur Day First aid The Curse of Fenric Infant Black Sabbath Cruising (maritime) Undergarment Housebreaking History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Characters in the Smurfs Sin City Drawn Together Ron and Fez Saturday Night Live Apollo 8 Characters of The Sandman Crash test dummy Sudden infant death syndrome Aphrodite 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Days of our Lives Opportunity rover timeline for 2005 March Billboard Hot 100 Lisa's First Word Indianapolis 500 Naval mine The Tracey Ullman Show shorts 9/11 conspiracy theories Bryan Adams What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?
