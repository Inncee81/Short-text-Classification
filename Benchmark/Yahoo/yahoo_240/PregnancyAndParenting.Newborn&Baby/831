did you see the montel episode with the man who was disciplining his week old my mother told me about it since we do not have tv in our house apparently he was disciplining his week old because he would cry when he was hungry he wanted him to learn that he will be fed whether he cries or not how ludicrous is that let me tell you if i would of saw even a slight second of that show i would of turned it off and this man should be reported to children family services for abuse and should not be allowed to have this child for some reason they get weirdo's sometimes on thier shows that it is all made up but maybe not this one i would think that montel would have better sense then to show something like this i would of been so angry i would of called and emailed this show i don't watch such garbage anyway so i would of never of seen it but this man does have problems and we wonder why our children are the way they are now a days at weeks old teaching this type of instruction is child abuse how sick to waste eye site air time on such stupid topics when this man should of been turned in Shaggy dog story The Ashlee Simpson Show Good Times Jam (TV series) 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Married... with Children Laura Schlessinger About a Boy Daria Spanking The Amazing Race Obi-Wan Kenobi Infantilism Stolen Generation Sin City Domestic violence Air traffic control Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Night (book) Pitaten South Park James Dobson Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Military unrest since the Fiji coup of 2000 Breastfeeding Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Invader Zim Johnny Cash All My Children The Contender (television series) Germaine Greer Spam (electronic) Knots Landing The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Make money fast Cindy Sheehan "Weird Al" Yankovic Montel Williams Kodocha The Marshall Mathers LP Homer Simpson YuYu Hakusho The O.C.
