will my baby suffer adverse affects if she stays with my husband while he's on vacation in his home country i only get one week vacation and my husband wants to show off our baby she's months now but will be months for the vacation i recently heard that children this young would suffer being without their mother we'll be separated about weeks baby should be fine the first few months are essential bonding months though this time is important too if you have made a good bond with your baby thus far and her father is loving and attentive then she shoud be fine it is a long time but i suggest frequent phone calls so she can hear your voice during the time you are seperate i am sure that with his family she will be getting plenty of attention i would only worry if she were in danger of being neglected Breastfeeding Melanie Wilkes Infant Madonna (entertainer) Days of our Lives Neighbours Kodocha Rugrats Love Social rule Hollyoaks Baby Blues Infantilism Childbirth Good Times Roy Meadow Laura Schlessinger Generation Y Stewie Griffin Adoption Phoebe Halliwell Paige Matthews Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Journey (band) Domestic violence Britney Spears Tina Turner Divorce Knots Landing The Family from One End Street Tiny Toon Adventures Bond Miscarriage Abbie G.
