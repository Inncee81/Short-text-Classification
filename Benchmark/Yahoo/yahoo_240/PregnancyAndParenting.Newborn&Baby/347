my week old son has his days and nights confused he started sleeping through the night at weeks old and the past nights hes wanted to stay up all night and nap a lot during the day how can i correct this i have a year old as well and i have got to get some sleep hi i understand your situation i have a month old terrible toddler and a month old i desperately need my zzz's anyhow i wish i could tell you to set a routine and everything will be fine but it doesn't always work with newborns i also wish i could say don't let him nap after a certain time or keep him awake but that also isn't realistic because he is little and doesn't understand i would suggest the method of tiring him out sit him up during waking hours and keep him busy this will also give your year old a task i do this with both of my kids i sit on the floor with my toddler daughter and tell her to bring the baby a specific toy we also sing and play hello and bye bye games for at least an hour i also make sure my newborn sits and listens to books and i even get him involved with noggin channel and stuff it keeps them both occupied i never stop him from sleeping though if he dozes off then i let it go but i am not going to tip toe around him and keep things quiet either if he wakes from loud sounds then that is because it is time to play and laugh also if he is not sleeping when we are ready for bed i put him in his nursery and set up some link a doo toys on his bed to keep him entertained i keep a dim light on for a while and then after an hour or so i turn it all off and tuck him in if he cries i offer him either a bottle or his binky but i do not advocate picking him up because that gives him the idea that he has to be entertained and he just seems to do a lot better when i don't mess with him a lot he does well at night but the only trouble i have had is that he likes to get up early in the morning sometimes and wants my attention but that is much better than sitting up all night try different things and see what works every baby is different and if it means moving his crib into your master bedroom just to get some sleep then do it don't feel guilty about it and just follow your instinct Shaggy dog story EastEnders Dog training Time Out of Mind Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sleep Milton H.
