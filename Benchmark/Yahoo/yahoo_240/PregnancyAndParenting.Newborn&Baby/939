advice for a month old my daughter is supposidly starting teething according to my mother she says she can feel the tooth coming in but i can't feel anything my daughter does slobber alot and she is starting to bite instead of suck and she chews on everything i was wondering if people think she is teething and on another note is it normal for my daughter to suck on her index fingure instead of her thumb like normal babies teething can begin as early as months and continue until a child's third birthday typically between the ages of and months you will notice your child's first tooth pushing through the gum line the first teeth to appear are usually the two bottom front teeth also known as the central incisors these are usually followed to weeks later by the four front upper teeth central and lateral incisors about month later the lower lateral incisors the two teeth flanking the bottom front teeth will appear next to break through the gum line are the first molars the back teeth used for grinding food then finally the eyeteeth the pointy teeth in the upper jaw most children have all of their primary teeth by their third birthday this is a general rule if your child experiences significant delay speak to your child's doctor whenever your child begins teething you may notice that your child seems to drool more and seems to want to chew on things for some babies teething is painless others may experience brief periods of irritability and some may seem cranky for weeks experiencing crying episodes and disrupted sleeping and eating patterns teething can be uncomfortable but if your baby seems very irritable contact your child's doctor here are some tips to keep in mind when your baby is teething wipe your baby's face often with a cloth to remove the drool and prevent rashes from developing give your baby something to chew on make sure it's big enough so that he or she can't swallow it and that it can't break into small pieces a wet washcloth placed in the freezer for minutes makes a handy teething aid just be sure to wash it after each use rubber teething rings are also good but avoid the ones with liquid inside because they may break if you use a teething ring be sure to take it out of the freezer before it becomes rock hard you don't want to bruise those already swollen gums rub your baby's gums with a clean finger never tie a teething ring around a baby's neck as it could get caught on something and strangle the baby if your baby seems irritable acetaminophen may help but always consult your child's doctor first never place an aspirin against the tooth and don't rub whiskey on your baby's gums also sucking on any finger is normal some children suck their three fingers some suck one some suck a thumb nothing is the standard Breastfeeding Mandible Maxilla Domestic rabbit Happy Tree Friends Strap-on dildo First aid The Shining (film) Dental caries Chewing gum Urinary incontinence Oral sex Cocaine Hamster Fecal incontinence Professional wrestling holds Drill bit Mattress Cephalic disorder Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Dog training Textile manufacturing Diving Carpal tunnel syndrome Garfield Cat Vampire Childbirth Bong Dog Aerial (dance move) Stomach cancer Knife Milton H.
