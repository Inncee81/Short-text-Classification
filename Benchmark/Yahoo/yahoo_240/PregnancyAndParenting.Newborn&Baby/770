how can i get my month old to sleep through the night my son is now months old and he has never slept through the night he goes to bed at with no problem and only takes one minute nap a day he wakes up because he wants a bottle and will generally go back to sleep after he drinks it this happens times a night sometimes he is wide awake though and laughing and it takes forever to get him to sleep we talked to his doctor and he said that we feed him plenty during the day so there is no nutritional reason why he needs a bottle we have tried everything from rocking him to letting him cry it out and nothing works he recently has been standing up in his crib and shaking the bars and i am afraid he will hurt himself any advice as hard as it is you have to let him alone he has to know that when it is bed time its time to go to sleep you are the parent he doesn't need another feeding at night he just wants to be up and play but you need your rest too i didn't do this with my oldest he was almost before he quit trying to sleep with me and coming into my room at night so with my next one my husband and i vowed that we would break this bad sleep habit we only got him up at night until he was about months old then we let him go thru the night he didn't like it at first but once he realized we meant business he got over it kids are way smarter than we give them credit for they will push your buttons as soon as they can Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Shaggy dog story Avenue Q Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Breastfeeding Insomnia The Shining (film) Sin City Lisa's First Word The Catcher in the Rye Sleep Mattress Urinary incontinence Babe Ruth Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Knots Landing One Tree Hill (TV series) Futurama (TV series - season 5) Social rule Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Otello Phoebe Halliwell Ron and Fez Apollo 8 Pitaten Siesta Maison Ikkoku The Contender (television series) Milton H.
