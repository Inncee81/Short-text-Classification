what does it feel like when you have a c section done i was wondering what it feels like during the c section process what does a woman feel when half her body is numb doesn't that drive you crazy not having any feeling in the lower part of your body hi there sweetie i know that every woman is different and every childbirth experience is different but i will share with you what i have learned from giving birth to four babies via cesarean section i see by your answer that you already know that you are having an epidural great decision it is the very best way to go i can tell you one thing by the time you get to that point you are so ready for that baby to be born your are so ready to hold that baby and not be pregnant any more and so excited that the last thing in the world that you will be thinking about is that half your body is numb look at it this way if half your body was not numb you could not be awake to see your baby and you would not get to share in the birth of your child i can also tell you that the epidural is the worst part of the c section by that i mean that when the epidural is done the pain is done also i always loved it when the epidural was done because i knew that was the last bit of pain i would feel until i held my baby in my arms and the epidural does not hurt it is uncomfortable and it is an icky feeling but it is not awful or anything they have you curl up on your side as much as you can it is kind of hard with a beach ball in your stomach and then they scrub your lower back so hard with what feels like a brillo pad lol then you will feel a few little stings or pinches no biggy that is the local that numbs you so you don't really feel the needle that really numbs you then they do the epidural part you won't feel the initial poke of the needle because you are numb you will feel a weird pressure deep inside your back i hated it and that is about it i had of them and they were all different one i hated one i did not even know they did and the others were somewhere in between okay so now you are numb they tell you to turn back over on to your back you are so excited because your baby is coming everything starts happening very fast now and your husband or whoever comes in and holds your hand he sits in a chair beside your head and they construct a little tent like thing in front of you so that you cannot see a darned thing i always asked them to lower it so i could see my baby being born but that is of course up to you if you do chose to see your baby born let me tell you that they have you draped so well that you will not see anything but all the blue sheets draped everywhere then they are pulling your baby up and out you do not see any blood or icky stuff all you see is that gorgeous baby that you cannot wait to get your hands on they will wipe him or her off a bit and wrap her him in a blanket and hand him or her to you oh how does it feel it does not hurt nope no hurting you will feel some pushing and some pressure honestly just like if someone was pushing around on your tummy it does not hurt but it does feel strange while you are holding your baby they have to put everything back it only takes about five minutes to get to your baby but it can take up to an hour to put everything back together properly that time goes fast as you will be holding your baby and counting toes and all that important stuff that mothers do they actually let me nurse my babies while i was in the operating room but i suppose that depends on the hospital and how your baby is acting my boys were starving so they let me feed them that was an odd feeling because my breast was really numb it felt so funny but it was still wonderful at some point they will take the baby away they have to weight them and give them their bath and all that stuff i was still on this incredible emotional high crying and so happy and talking to my husband and all that finally you are ready to go back to your room they make you all clean and comfortable in my case they gave me one of the those devices that you press the button when you need a pain shot it is awesome the important thing to know here is to get your pain shot before you are in a lot of pain don't wait until you are really really hurting you need to anticipate your need for the pain meds and get them before you are in pain that way you stay ahead of the pain and you stay in control of it no matter how much it may hurt be sure to move as much as you can one of the exercises that we learned in the cesarean childbirth classes is where you turn your ankles in little circles around and around that is what you should do as soon as you have feeling in your feet important the pain wears off from the bottom up so you will feel your feet first then your lower legs you get the idea that is what i mean about the pain when feeling gets close to your thighs that is time to get pain medication important they will want you to turn from one side to the other in bed use your arms to move do not try to use your stomach muscles to do anything they may or may not tell you this a couple of times i had nurses that never said a word use your arms to move grab the side rails of the bed and pull your arms do not hurt and it will not hurt at all if you use your arms to pull yourself around i had the baby in the room with me from the very first night but that is of course up to you i did not trust them not to give him a bottle or something so i kept him with me when you nurse the baby at home and in the hospital make sure that you have one or two bed pillows underneath him to bring him to the right height you do not want to have to lean over to reach him it will give you a back ache also the pillows will protect your incision important breastfeeding is the single most important labor saving device that you can utilize it is wonderful you do not even have to get out of bed keep the baby with you and let her or him nurse as much as possible the more the baby nurses in those early days the more milk you will have it is wonderful you do not have to do anything you can sleep all night and all day if you want all you have to do is remember to change sides and to change diapers every once in awhile and you are all set seriously if you are new to breastfeeding it may be a good idea to keep a small night lite next to your bed and to sit up so that you can see what you are doing later you will not have to it is so much easier than messing with bottles i have done it both ways so i know this is turning into a novel so i will let you go if you have any more questions or if there is anything that i did not go over that you would like to know just write to me and i will be happy to write back you have so much to look forward to and i envy you do not be sad that you are having a c section i loved them i had incredible experiences and my husband and i were laughing and crying and so happy and so excited it was fantastic and unbelievable to me that i could have a baby with so little discomfort and so much fun i literally loved it i guess i know now why the super rich and celebrities choose to have c sections there are some big pluses write to me if you have any questions love and blessings lady trinity i don't know where carmen had her cesarean section but i really feel sorry for her i can actually truthfully say that my c sections were fun maybe it is because i had taken the classes and knew what to expect i remember asking my husband after the birth of my second son how soon we could have another baby i was so excited and happy i am sorry that she had such an awful experience but believe me it is not typical i feel sorry for her Sin City Abortion debate Massage Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Prostate
