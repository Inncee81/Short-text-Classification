don't you think i'm correct i know someone with a year old daughter who sadly has fallen pregnant i refuse to aknowledge this girl as the child's mother i don't believe she is a mother is a woman who raises her child correctly and capably a year old girl can do neither of those things do you think that's fair and don't you think that baby's who are born to teenage incubators should be placed officially in the care of an adult until the teenager reaches or i do agree that many notice i said many not all teenage mothers are completely incapable of handling the raising of a child but that's not because they are teenagers only in the last couple of hundred years has it been the norm for you to wait until you are no longer a teenager to have children thousands of years ago you started having children as soon as you got your period the difference is in the way our children are raised thousands of years ago children were raised with the assumption that they would soon become mature adults with responsibilities today children are raised as children a distinction that began to be made around the tudor line of england i believe instead of as tiny adults this has led to a lack of maturity in teenagers whereas a long time ago those same teenagers would have been more than capable of raising their own children Abortion debate Infantilism Androgen insensitivity syndrome Pregnancy Alois Hitler Adolescence Puberty Divorce Gender role Child sexuality Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal Polyamory Sharon Tate The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Teenage pregnancy Premature birth Kakapo EastEnders Lolita Second language acquisition Nile crocodile Statutory rape Hollyoaks Motion picture rating system Girl My Life as a Teenage Robot Breastfeeding MPAA film rating system Generation X Neighbours Full House Edward III of England Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Ranma __ characters In vitro fertilisation The Amber Spyglass Spice Girls Infant baptism Human height Pedophilia Anne Boleyn History of intersex surgery Little Britain Hall & Oates The Subtle Knife Laura Schlessinger Marriage Incarnations of Immortality Child sexual abuse Child Avatar: The Last Airbender Transsexuality The Sims 2 Arjuna One Tree Hill (TV series) Miss Saigon Head louse Knots Landing Emperor Yuan of Han Emperor of Japan Supergirl The Fairly OddParents Hikikomori Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Coming of age About a Boy Fertility awareness Julia Stiles R.
