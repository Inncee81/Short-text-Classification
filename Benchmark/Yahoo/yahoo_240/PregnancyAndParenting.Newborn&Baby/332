transferring expressed breastmilk twice ok if i pump into medela bottles but decide to freeze that breastmilk can i safely transfer the milk to medela bags made for freezing freeze that milk then transfer the milk again to a bottle avent when i am ready to use it someone told me that sometimes stuff baby needs the fat gets stuck to the bottles and is left behind when you transfer it i'm wondering if pouring the milk from one place to another twice is not ideal i know i can pump right into the bags but i'm at a point with pumping where sometimes the output is less than an ounce and thus not worth wasting two bags and the storage space yet sometimes i can pump an ounce or more i just don't know until i do it i think the stuff only gets stuck if you freeze it in the orignal container defrost it and then refreeze it you are not supposed to re freeze it after its been defrosted just throw it away if it hasnt been frozen it can be transferred to a different contailner to be frozen Breastfeeding Coffee Dairy Milk Ice cream Baby bottle Food preservation Futurama (TV series - season 4) Brewery Refrigerator Tea Plastic Breast pump Tofu Bong Autonomous building Futurama (TV series - season 1) Futurama (TV series - season 3) Bottle Philip J.
