depression and a new baby part i just had a baby boy ten days ago i love him so very much my husband i planned him and were vert excited for him to come home since i have had him home i feel down and upset most of the time i am breast feeding and it seems like he wants to eat as soon as he is done at night he just cries and cries for no reason its like he is never getting full let me add i also do give him some formula at night emfamil lipil nursettes and he has always taken both just fine well he has been fussy and gassey at night and thats the only time i give him the formula so i thought it was wrong for him and to hard so i made him a bottle of similac advanved the no milk one he was drinking it all almost then he threw up it all out his nose and mouth it was horrid he did it twice i was just crying i feel like the worse mother on earth i do not know what to do my husband is not making me feel any better he always has some rude comment or mean thing to say to me he will not help me bc he saiod he was not a nanny its like he just does not want to deal with a fussy baby and its left all up to me i can hardly shower without it being thrown in my face i am a bad mom for this or for that and his mom is driving me crazy i am so sick of my mom said do this or dont do this if i tell him i do not want him to do something his mom says he does not care he underminds everything i do i feel like his mom and him are my sons parents and i have nothing to do with it all like she said give him water i said no hes a newborn but my husband i catch him doing this he clearly could care less what i say i have tried talking to him he just dont care i do not know what to do i am loosing my mind i am so upset and depressed feeling and i do not think i am doing anything right someone please give me advice can you clarify why youre giving him formula in the night and not just breast feeding him then i think the best thing is to explain this situation to your pediatrician since i am not a medical professional and cant give you the specific reason why the formula is upseting him sweetie youre not a bad mom youre just overwhelmed this is maybe the hardest time because youre not sleeping properly and youre so focused on the baby it sounds like you are neglecting to take care of yourself men can get a little weird in this time as all your attention is away from him and on this new family member and its a huge change and disruption from the way your lives used to be together just hang in there talk toyour doctor and take any spare time you can to unload all your honest feelings to your husband sometimes we forget they cant read our minds or possibly understand how we feel unless you tell them straight out good luck Breastfeeding Shaggy dog story Social rule Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Infant Characters in the Smurfs Avenue Q Theory of conduct Jon Secada About a Boy Pitaten The Catcher in the Rye Childbirth Knots Landing Scientology beliefs and practices One Tree Hill (TV series) Phoebe Buffay's songs Laura Schlessinger Kodocha Cindy Sheehan The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Yoko Ono Joke Transsexuality Friends Humphrey Bogart Jam (TV series) Eric Cartman Sin City Poker jargon Boom Town (Doctor Who) Ethics Futurama (TV series - season 2) Hollyoaks Recurring South Park characters The Shining (film) The Smoking Room Miss Saigon Kimi Finster Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Charmed Conan the Barbarian Adoption Le Malade imaginaire The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Fiddler on the Roof Time Out of Mind The Amber Spyglass Megan Griffin K' Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Pok__mon Live!
