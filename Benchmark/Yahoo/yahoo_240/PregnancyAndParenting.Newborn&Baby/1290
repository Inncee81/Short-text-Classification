what the hell is wrong with me ok please no one critisize me i am asking because i need some help not to get made to feel worse i am a first time mom to a week old and sometimes i find my mind getting sooo cluttered and i feel like i am a different person and then i have to walk away from my crying baby because i don't want to hurt him but then i feel even worse because he is crying and im not in there for him but i was always taught its better for him to cry then to hurt him but i just don't know what to do i feel like a crazy mess no criticism here you are doing the right thing by setting him down and walking away have you told anyone how you feel if not i think you need to you really need some help you are probably sleep deprived overwhelmed and exhausted and when you combine the three with a demanding baby you can become someone that you normally aren't what you are feeling is normal for a lot of moms it's okay to get frustrated because motherhood is hard but you do need to act on it and recruit your mom or a friend or a bf or spouse to help you out so you aren't at your breaking point i feel for you just remember to keep doing what you are doing when you are overwhelmed walking away and coming back is the best thing to do Shaggy dog story Theory of conduct Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Social rule EastEnders Time Out of Mind Treehouse of Horror V Jon Secada The Contender (television series) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Humphrey Bogart Phoebe Buffay's songs Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Pitaten Cindy Sheehan Germaine Greer Out-of-body experience Futurama (TV series - season 2) Slow Train Coming Kodocha Blood on the Tracks Friends Jam (TV series) Blonde on Blonde The Shining (film) The Amber Spyglass Love and Theft Richard Rahl Avenue Q Kender RuneScape quests R.E.M.
