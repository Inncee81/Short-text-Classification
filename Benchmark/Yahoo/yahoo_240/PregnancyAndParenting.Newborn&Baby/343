teaching baby to eat from a spoon i want to introduce a spoon so that my baby can eat things like yoghurt and soup she's never eaten from a spoon before how is best to go about introducing one she is nearly nine months old thankyou all you're right my baby has never eaten pureed anything or rice cereal and like i said never eaten from a spoon there are other ways she feeds herself and has done since day one and is now able to eat everything i eat where i live foods containing cow's milk can be introduced after six months but not cow's milk as a drink till after one year unless there is a family history of allergies which there isn't my daughter happily eats cheese sandwiches crackers with cream cheese or just big chunks of cheese so i don't think yoghurt will cause a problem thanks so far but i want to find a way of introducing the spoon without her wanting me to feed her at every meal any ideas you don't need the spoon mama steam vegetables in cubes and put them on her tray she can eat most everything with her little hands which is awesome for fine motor skills and she can also pick and choose what her body needs there is alot of research available online if you'd like to feed her yogurt just dip it in the jar and hand her the spoon she might play the drums or take a little lick you'll have to try and see Dairy Yoghurt Milk McDonald's Tofu Korean cuisine Cheese Japanese cuisine Bengali cuisine Veganism Vegetarianism Food Cuisine of Denmark Breastfeeding Jewish cuisine Ice cream Cuisine of the Philippines Chinese cuisine Joke Vegetarian cuisine Mnemonic Cuisine of Laos French cuisine Soybean Cuisine of Malaysia MRE German cuisine Rice pudding Fecal incontinence Soup Livestock Persian cuisine D__ner kebab Chopsticks Coeliac disease Bread Sandwich Peruvian cuisine Cat Cha chaan teng Breakfast cereal Porridge Spoon Curry Mochi Idli Drink Happy Meal Cuisine of Greece Cuisine of Thailand Pea soup Elephant Peanut butter Meal Healthy eating Hot dog Kosher foods Salad Fingers Cuisine of Africa Kashrut Cuisine of Brazil Dairy cattle Polish cuisine Mayonnaise Dairy product Swedish cuisine Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Ramen Malwa Peanut Biscuit Hamster Taboo food and drink Culture of the Netherlands Russian cuisine Atkins Nutritional Approach Cuisine of Vietnam Cuisine of the Southern United States Oreo Mango Pizza Potato Maize Street food The dozens Basic English The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Halitosis Cuisine of Austria Comanche
