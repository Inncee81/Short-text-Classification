why are people like this when people ask how much cereal to put in a babies bottle or anything about putting cereal in a babies bottle even if they dont ask is it ok to put cereal in a bottle people always start this whole big thing by saying they say its not good for a baby did they ever ask if it is ok to do it no they asked a different question i feel like it isnt there child so why do they care what someone else is wanting to do to there child when the doctor said it was ok to do it makes me so mad same goes for breastfeeding everybody knows its best to breasstfeed but not all women choose to do that and when they find out that you dont breastfeed they are all over you criticizing you why hypermama i understand that i ask alot of questions because i am a year old concerned mom you dont no if my family is tight on money or not so maybe we dont have alot of money to buy a book so if you would like to donate one to me then go ahead otherwise stop saying get a book hypermama and no i did not give up on breastfeeding and get on here and complain it isnt my fault my daughter wouldnt latch on i worked very hard getting as many people to help for the first weeks of her life go somewhere else and criticize people if you want to be like that l w f if i am reading this wrong please tell me but you think that people who formula feed are selfish formula may not be just as good for a baby but it gets the job done it makes them gain wait and i no people who have never even given there baby breastmilk and are very healthy i think that everyone is exclusivly breastfeeding needs to not criticize because we choose not to breastfeed coffee pot so are you saying you dont drink cows milk because if you do obviously your a baby cow thats how you make it sound it's not safe or healthy to put cereal in a bottle it doesn't help a baby sleep through the night these people could ask the doctor but they know the doctor will tell them not to do it this might be a free for all site but it doesn't mean i will give bad and possibly dangerous answers Breastfeeding Milk Theory of conduct Poker jargon Childbirth Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Infant formula Humphrey Bogart Infant Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Friends Social rule The Apprentice 2 EastEnders International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes Fertility awareness Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Joke Fiddler on the Roof Alcoholics Anonymous Breast milk Knots Landing Nestl__ boycott Nestl__ Kodocha RuneScape quests Avenue Q Baby bottle Phoebe Halliwell Characters in the Smurfs The Catcher in the Rye Rose (Doctor Who) The Lovely Bones Infantilism Red Hot Chili Peppers Le Malade imaginaire Conker's Bad Fur Day Atomic Kitten Sudden infant death syndrome Kyle Broflovski Ben Johnson (athlete) Nipple piercing Jennifer Lopez Internet fraud Abortion debate Moral Politics Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Urinary incontinence Ocean's Twelve Kibbutz Dairy Recurring South Park characters Pitaten Trailer Park Boys House of M AFI 100 Years series Big Brother UK series 6 Breakfast cereal Phoebe Buffay's songs Wal-Mart Sant Thakar Singh Soy milk Co-sleeping The Super Milk-chan Show Shaggy dog story Prostate cancer Great Teacher Onizuka Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Nicomachean Ethics Fecal incontinence Jon Secada Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Michael Garibaldi Current teachings of Prem Rawat Public domain The Curse of Fenric Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses $ale of the Century Kimi Finster Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Veganism Camp Lazlo Tony Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) Kosher foods Pregnancy Doug Ted Kennedy Incarnations of Immortality Shit About a Boy 2000 Australian Grand Prix Laura Schlessinger Boston Public Hiberno-English
