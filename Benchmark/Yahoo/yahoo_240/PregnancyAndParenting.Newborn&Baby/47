help spoiled baby so im a first time mother dont have my own mother around to help and assist me and basically teaching myself and of course learning as i go along of course i've been given advice all different fr different people pick her up u cant spoil a newborn let her cry for a while she'll get smart and learn how to take advantage you dont have to bathe her everyday she's still young make sure you bathe her every night around the same time get her used to a routine it's better for her and it'll make it easier for you of course confused trying to learn on my own and tried everything suggested my baby girl now almost mnths next week is only good about going to sleep after her bath i did the routint thing that definately helped but all she wants is to be carried and only by me omg is this just a phase and what can i do to unspoil her i'm not good at letting her cry i've actually done that but she just cries and cries for as long as half an hour also breastfeeding i used to pump and give her bottles as well as my breast she'd refuse at first then finally take it but now she doesnt take it at all i need her to use the bottle bc i need to go back to work in a month or so any help about that would be greatly appreciated hugs this job is hard you will find out what works for you and remember that everything is just a phase with kids everyone has advice to give but at the end of the day you need to trust your instincts and do what works best for your family ok so here's my advice to add to the list you can't spoil a baby developmentally they can't understand that they are a separate person from you until they are months old you are her whole world right now and she looks to you for comfort and security she is not trying to take advantage of you or manipulate you she is trying to tell you something when she cries she doesn't have words to say mommy i'm scared right now and dont' want to be alone most moms aren't good at letting babies cry we are programmed to try and meet their needs have you thought about trying a sling or a baby carrier i have one i really like from www kimzkreations com that way she can be close to you when she's fussy and you can have your hands free to get stuff done when she falls asleep you can transfer her to her bed so you can get a break routines are good for babies but it depends on how old your baby is the younger they are the more flexible you have to be for me around mos i tracked my son's patterns that he naturally falls into and then i built my routines around that also keep in mind that your routines will have to change as baby grows and her needs change as far as the bottle thing goes can you get someone to give her a bottle of pumped milk once a day sometimes babies don't want to take a bottle from mom because they want the real thing lol try doing it the same time each day so she knows to expect it just be consistant and she will figure it out you can also try another type of bottle the breastflow bottles by first years are designed for nursing babies and they are the only ones my son would take they are available at babies r us i can tell you are a great mom because you trying your hardest to do the best job you can hang in there it does get a little easier Breastfeeding Childbirth Social rule Infant Humphrey Bogart Milk Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Jon Secada Fertility awareness Friends EastEnders The Catcher in the Rye Dog training Shaggy dog story A Course In Miracles Milton H.
