how do i make our relationship work any opinions on this matter i'm he is we have a month old little boy his farther works hours a week and pays for everything so he states i'm supposed to do everything with the baby he's changed diapers since birth and feeds him maybe once a week if i need to go to the bathroom or something i was put on zoloft a month ago but stopped taking it everytime we fight he tells me go take your medicine he wants me to take it so i'm happy and jolly all the time and do whatever he wants me to he still would rather go out than spend time with his family he's always mad at something something's always wrong in his life very negative he doesnt care about me either i would cry myself to sleep and he'd roll over and pass out i askeed him for help i've tried to talk to him he won't listen he's very hardheaded he says he doesnt want us to leave when i ask but when i suggest i will tomorrow not a peep out of him i want to make it work but should i just give up already why put all your energy into a man that obviously doesn't care and when you live with someone as a married couple the money becomes a shared asset i would make him leave and then if he is willing go to counseling unfortunately babies place huge stresses on a relationship i don't know about zoloft but from the sounds of it you are depressed and he is not making life better for you you need to get some support from your family and friends and you need to find inner happiness i am sorry if your relationship fails but best if its now before the child gets bigger and by the way you are doing a great job good luck and best wishes EastEnders Divorce Knots Landing Kodocha Social rule Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Clinical depression Humphrey Bogart Pitaten Piccolo Junior Saga Shaggy dog story W.I.T.C.H.
