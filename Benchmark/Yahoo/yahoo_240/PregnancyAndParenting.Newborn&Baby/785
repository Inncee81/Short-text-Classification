neutral or all out boy girl we find out what we are having next friday hopefully anyways we plan on having another baby when this one is months old we were wondering if it is better to buy neutral stuff that way if one is a boy and the other a girl they can still use it what have you done i'm leaning more towards getting neutral stuff for most of it and then just a couple of either boy or girl stuff which ever the baby is as someone who went crazy with having everything pink when i found out we were having a girl i can honestly say i wish we would have gotten more neutral stuff i realized this when she only used some of the stuff for a month and thought what if we have a boy next time so my suggestion is if you are buying blankets for example buy one pink or blue whatever you are having and the rest white or neutral colors also what you can do is use the neutral stuff at home and save the pink or blue for when you go out Max Martin Knots Landing Kate Vaiden Mr. and Mrs. Turner Phoebe Buffay's songs Timmy Turner Jon Secada Blood on the Tracks The Inside The Jeffersons (South Park) Chao (Sonic the Hedgehog) Neighbours Empire Burlesque Rainbow Brite Sin City Friends Vanessa Lynn Williams Anime Yoshi FLCL Great Teacher Onizuka Kurt Cobain Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Cliff Richard Shaggy dog story Beatles for Sale Infantilism Kodocha Beavis and Butt-head Ron and Fez W.I.T.C.H.
