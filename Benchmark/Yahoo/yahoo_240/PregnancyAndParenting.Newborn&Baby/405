swollen lymph node loss of appetite lack of energy in year old my year old daughter has little energy no appetite and seems to get sick quite a bit at her year check up her doctor said she had a swollen lymph node on her right side and to monitor it that was in june and it is still there almost months later we went to her ent doctor the one who took her tonsils out and he says to monitor it as well it's probably nothing i'm just concerned and wish i knew if it was something or just nothing and what to do next to be proactive on finding out what if anything it could be we thought once her tonsils were out she would regain her appetite and energy but there hasn't been any dramatic changes in either any suggestions or if someone knows anything that would help i'm making myself sick worrying about her thanks i would definitely be bugging the pediatrician about it until i was satisfied lack of energy in a child so young is an indication that something isn't right also a loss of appetite isn't good either i think you better bug that doc again as two months seems a long time if the ent and doc both don't investigate further then i would get in with another specialist let them know exactly how she has been doing and that you have this feeling that something isn't right you are the mother and have the most knowledge of your child's usual health and routines anyone would be stupid not to listen to you i really hope it get better for you i have had trouble with my tonsils all my life and still have mine i didn't get them surgically removed because i heard they can grow back instead i went to a homeopathic doc who gave me drops for it i took them for a few months straight and never had a problem again not sure of the ingredients it could be they are coming back maybe check it out Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stomach cancer Prostate cancer Tuberculosis Breast cancer Debugging Group A streptococcal infection Breastfeeding Lymphatic system Shaggy dog story Lymph node Radiation therapy Cancer Colorectal cancer Chronic lymphocytic leukemia Kodocha Cancer of the larynx Malignant melanoma Leukemia Haven (TNG episode) Chronic fatigue syndrome Milton H.
