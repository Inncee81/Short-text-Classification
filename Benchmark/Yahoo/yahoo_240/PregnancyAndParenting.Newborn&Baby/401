in your opinion when do you feel its safe to take a newborn baby outside my baby is days old i am so happy but cautious even though he's my nd child what do you think taking your newborn outside is not a problem fresh air is wonderful for babies the real question is when is it safe to expose your baby to other people because of the baby's relatively immature immune system in british hospitals newborns are placed on verandas almost every day despite the weather to get them some fresh air you can take your baby outside for walks and to visit friends and relatives the real objective is to avoid exposing your baby to the possibility of infection the baby's immune system is not developed until to weeks of age the baby has an immune system with antibodies derived from the mother's placenta and from breast milk if mom is breast feeding it has cell mediated immunity the real defect of a baby's immune system is localization a baby's immune system cannot keep infections in one place instead they spread rapidly through the entire body for example an ear infection in a newborn can spread rapidly through the brain and nervous system a throat infection can spread rapidly to the lungs and kidneys therefore when a pediatrician is confronted with an infant younger than months with a fever indicating an infection that baby undergoes what is called a sepsis work up this includes a blood test a urine test and a spinal tap the baby would then be started on intravenous antibiotics so as to prevent the possibility of a severe infection from spreading rapidly throughout the baby's entire system obviously this is not something that parents or pediatricians want to do so the best thing to do is to avoid crowds and illness when you take your baby out if you must go shopping with the baby go early in the morning before the stores are very crowded if you take your baby to visit friends or relatives make sure they're free of illness even a cold can be dangerous to a newborn anyone who handles the baby should wash his or her hands in short avoid crowds and sick people another common dilemma is how much clothing you should put on a new baby a baby should be dressed the same way his or her mother is dressed a good rule of thumb the same amount of layers that the mother wears the baby should wear it's always better to be underdressed then overdressed a baby who is overdressed tends to get dehydrated get fevers more easily and eat less there is also a higher risk of sudden infant death syndrome among babies who are bundled beyond reason a baby who is underdressed really has no specific risks the other rule of thumb for dressing your infant wear what grandma says divided by four Cancer Group A streptococcal infection Infant Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma AIDS Herpes simplex virus Premature birth Intravenous therapy Malaria Chronic fatigue syndrome Traumatic brain injury Bone marrow transplant Tuberculosis Obstetrics Escherichia coli O157:H7 HIV Urinary incontinence Psoriasis Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Lyme disease Vitamin C HIV test Milk Diabetes mellitus Foodborne illness Diarrhea Asthma Legionellosis Multiple sclerosis Prostate cancer Immunosuppressive drug Insulin Allergy Lupus erythematosus Sickle-cell disease Gonorrhoea Tocopherol Aspergillosis Androgen insensitivity syndrome Hyperthermia Stem cell Autoimmune diseases Poliomyelitis Chlorpromazine Jaundice Paracetamol Breast cancer Miscarriage Decompression sickness Toxoplasmosis Blood type Hepatitis Protein-energy malnutrition Hearing impairment Coeliac disease Schistosomiasis Rabies Menstrual cycle Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Hay fever Radiation poisoning Drowning Tattoo Newborn screening Immune system Glycogen storage disease type I Folic acid Chlamydophila pneumoniae Abortion Pregnancy Acute lymphoblastic leukemia Gastroenteritis Stroke Leukemia Sudden infant death syndrome Infant formula Vitamin D Influenza Anthrax Autism Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Lassa fever First aid Medical analysis of circumcision Dialysis
