non religious home school programs do these exist i'm currently using a beka books in the th grade program previously we just skipped the bible classes because i wasn't religious and we didn't have to send any reports in this year we do i know nothing about the bible and all of that and for next year i was wondering if anyone has heard of home school programs that do not revolve around religion and please do not come into this question and preach to me about religion there are alot of home school programs that do not revolve around religion i use james madison high school because they offer a college prep diploma and regular diploma the tuition runs around for all years but you can pay it monthly which will run about a month there are many other programs that are affordable too a million other people will probably recommend pennfoster which is a good program but they don't offer advanced courses and i found that the number of credits required to graduate wasn't enough for my local college they required a min of credits keystone is a bit pricier than jmhs or pennfoster but they are an excellent program as well there are many other options out there too simply google high school correspondence school correspondence schools are were they send you text books and you mail the work back to be graded some also offer online courses and you'll get alot of information check the accreditation of the program though you'll want it to be regionally accredited if you plan on going to college do some research on accreditation southern association of colleges and schools sacs is one regional accreditation alot of these programs are work at your own pace and ment to be done independently but if you have someone teaching you the material i'm sure that would work out fine too check k too your state may offer a virtual public school which is free and you can take classes through them with a virtual public school you'll have a teacher available to you and have deadlines just like a regular class good luck Education in the United States Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Australia Education in Germany Graduate school Law school Education in Malaysia Juris Doctor Advanced Placement Program Athabasca University Homeschooling Distance education Associate's degree Education in Portugal Community college Education in Canada Pennsylvania State University Education in Hong Kong No Child Left Behind Act Independent school (UK) Education in Taiwan High school Grade (education) Education Master's degree College Education in Romania Education in France Credit card Intelligent design movement Education in Japan IB Diploma Programme GED University of Michigan Medical school University of Central Florida Librarian United States Postal Service School choice Teacher Cornell University Brown University Ontario Academic Credit Education in Singapore Franklin W.
