i need help my th grader has decided to be homeschooled i need to find out what kind of homeschool academies are out there i don't want christian liberty academy does anyone know what is there to help that isn't bank breaking we can't afford alot of money on this i already homeschool my th grader but i make up her curriculum as we go along he has a desire to go to a public high school so i want to get all my ducks in a row for him thanks for your help you can do the same thing for your th grader that you do for the th grader until they reach high school if you plan to re enroll them accreditation is not generally an issue since the junior high credits generally won't apply toward graduation unless they're on the advanced track doing high school level work in junior high if you do re enroll him for high school the school will most likely test him for grade level proficiency and placement so all you really need is a maybe a math program if you desire and a library card most everything else english science writing history can be done with library books Education in the United States Homeschooling Graduate school Advanced Placement Program Stuyvesant High School GED Education in the People's Republic of China No Child Left Behind Act Lynbrook High School Education in Taiwan High school Shreveport, Louisiana Education in Australia Florida Institute of Technology Waldorf Education University of New England, Maine Pennsylvania State University Education in Romania Junior Certificate Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Education in South Korea College Associate's degree Chinese University of Hong Kong Columbia University Public high school Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Secondary education in Japan Education in Portugal Education in England Law school University of Michigan Worcester Polytechnic Institute Grade (education) Miami Dade College Miami-Dade County Public Schools Education in Hong Kong Secondary education in the United States Community college SAT Patrick Henry College Experiential education Suncoast Community High School Carey Baptist Grammar School Cooper Union Librarian University of Central Florida University of Alabama Standardized testing Education in Japan Middle East Technical University Master's degree Education in Singapore American University Princeton High School, Sharonville, Ohio Physical therapy A-level University of North Carolina at Charlotte Higher education in Japan St. John's College, U.
