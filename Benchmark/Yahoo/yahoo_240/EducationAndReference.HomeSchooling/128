high school well i'm and going into high school but i've been homeschooled since the rd grade i'm not sure if i should head into public school now or wait a year because i know it will be hard on me not going to public middle school i am asking for advice on what i should do because i am at a loss well i am not going to offer commentary on your choice ok do you not know anyone in your area that attends the school if you do talk to them and get to know them a little better my opinion is waiting another year isn't going to make it easier or increase the amount of people you know at the highschool if you seriously want to go to public school and your parents are prepared to do this then go ahead and go now this will give you an opportunity to get to know some people plus you can begin working on your diploma program and not have to worry about transfer credits or anything and remember most highschools take in students from several area middle schools so no one is going to know everyone just be friendly open and discerning had to add this i'm sensing your difficulty is not because you are not socialized it is because you do not know anyone at the school i wanted to point out there is a difference big changes like that are nerve wracking for anyone in any situation lots of kids entering that school are going through the same thing you are right now and they have not been homeschooled remember that Homeschooling Education in the United States Education in Romania High school Secondary education Education in Portugal No Child Left Behind Act IB Diploma Programme Community college Waldorf Education Education in Malaysia Education in Germany French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Education in Taiwan Poker jargon Graduate school Education in Japan Education in Hong Kong Theory of conduct Master's degree Pump It Up School choice Prostate cancer Social rule Breastfeeding Miami-Dade County Public Schools Education in the People's Republic of China Science Bowl Redundant array of independent disks Hearing impairment Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Education in Australia Education in Austria Ontario Academic Credit Secondary education in Japan Education in Finland National Certificate of Educational Achievement Numerus clausus Juris Doctor __cole Polytechnique The Book of Five Rings Independent school (UK) A-level Malcolm in the Middle Education in Canada Philosophical skepticism Sento Generation Y University of California, San Diego Education in Singapore Advanced Placement Program CPU cache College admissions Diving Piccolo Junior Saga Fecal incontinence Backgammon Appeal Caulfield Grammar School Fast bowling School SAT Boston Public Pitaten Public high school Insurance Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hunter College High School Microeconomics Lamar High School (Houston) RuneScape quests Stomach cancer Lawyer Edison, New Jersey King City, Ontario Property (ownership right) Grade (education) Education in the Netherlands Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Mnemonic Education in Qu__bec Japanese tea ceremony Houston Independent School District Associate's degree Can't Hardly Wait Law school The Amazing Race Unemployment Goodness and value theory The Big Goodbye (TNG episode) Mike Harris Treehouse of Horror V Community High School, Ann Arbor, Michigan Jeopardy!
