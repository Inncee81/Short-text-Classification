question about a structured day i am going to be homeschooling my yr old twins this yr i have purchased alpha omega lifepac's and my plan is to do a structured day i think that my boys and myself need the structure i am aware that it may not work out this way but i am just wondering what your day is like also i would like to take either friday or monday's off to just go and do something fun does anyone do just day school weeks i also want the day that we take off to be our field trip day and go to museums and stuff i know that it is all part of learning thank you there's a big difference between having structure and having routine structure can be quite limiting as it means putting restrictions on activities whether academics if social what i usually say to new homeschoolers is to look at the routine you already have in your home when you wake when you rest when you eat when you bath find your natural rhythm and find how best to put the homeschooling in there to be quite honest no matter what you do it takes so little time to homeschool it seems silly to structure your day around that rather than vice versa we finished a full curriculum in two hours a day in less than four months that was with four kids we had several trips out a week at that age learning is best by living Homeschooling Education in the United States GED Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Rudolf Steiner Waldorf Education Education in Romania Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 March Boy Scouts of America Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus The Family from One End Street Vegeta Spirit rover timeline for 2004 February Fraternities and sororities Garfield Academia Bipolar disorder Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Urinary incontinence Ben Johnson (athlete) Social rule Hunter College High School Graduate school United States House of Representatives Fasting Hollywood Squares Ocean's Twelve American and British English differences Wheel of Fortune Independent school (UK) Autodidacticism STS-62 New York Giants University of Houston Gregorian calendar Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Extreme Programming About a Boy Daylight saving time Final Fantasy: Unlimited Star Trek: Enterprise Intelligent design movement Another Side of Bob Dylan Subud Teachers (film) USS Wasp (CV-18) Education in the People's Republic of China Charles Darwin's education Vince McMahon Experiential education USS Yorktown (CV-10) Plame affair Parsifal Fertility awareness USS Wallace L.
