ymca lifeguard heres the deal i turn in feb so i will not be elligable to take the lifeguard class until the summer after next because of where my bday falls i am going to email the instructor and see if he would let me take the class and hold my card till i turn in feb my question is if any of you are lifeguards at a ymca are you full time or do they only staff lifeguards in the summer for the outdoor pools the reason is because if they are full time then if i got the cert next summer then i could apply in feb as soon as i turn as opposed to waiting till the following summer and useing some of the time i could be working takeing the class thanks my suggestion would be to call your local ymca for example the y near my house has an indoor pool so lifeguards are hired all year round plus when i took the cert class they only let you enroll in it when you are you can always check with the swim guy at your local y Swimming pool YMCA Boy Scouts of America Lifeguard Community emergency response team Volleyball Swimming Poker jargon Walt Disney World College Program Glens Falls, New York Franklin and Marshall College Cranford, New Jersey Draw poker Dartmouth College Betting (poker) Tag Junior Certificate Adult Swim E-mail Drowning Ben Johnson (athlete) Caulfield Grammar School Melbourne High School Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story!
