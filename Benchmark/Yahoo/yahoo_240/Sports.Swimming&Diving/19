high school swim team question i swim in the summer and i really want to make the swim team this year at my high school i can swim about a free without stopping and i am pretty good with the others as well my best stroke is breast i am working out now and i really hope that its paying off any advice about what a high school practice consists of how long meets are etc ok so the odds are that unless your school has a really tough team to get on you will be able to be on the team and they will put you with the beginners for now swimming is a cool sport because usually in the first year people improve a ton so if you keep with it and swim every weekday for like hours this is how long my practices were you should be way past the beginner level by the time next year's season starts here is the way my practices went there were easy practices and there were hard practices when you don't have any meets coming up you do hard practices that go something like this nice long warm up speed training do s and exert yourself more each time repeat or times as desired arms and legs training use paddles on your hands and don't kick to strengthen your arms use a kickboard to strengthen your legs special work on your strokes of course the actual practice can and does vary so you don't get too bored don't be scared off by the idea of a hard practice they start to get easier after a week or two easy practices have similar things in them but they don't encourage you to work quite as hard or swim quite as far a lot of times you will do these before meets so you save up your strength for competition sometimes you get to play fun games in them like sharks minnows also depending on your team you may do some exercises like lunges and sit ups weight training and running before your swims in my experience these things help you build strength that you can then translate in the pool to domination also meets vary but most high school meets are just against one team and they take hours most people only swim or events in them they usually have a limit to how many you can swim teams go to big meets sometimes on the weekends which are against tons of schools like regional state meets and can last anywhere from days again most people won't swim more than events so when not swimming you end up hanging out with the team playing cards going out to eat and fun stuff like that i encourage you to definitely go check out practice and enjoy swimming is a wonderful sport and it's great for making friends i swam for all years of high school starting as a beginner and finishing as a starter Breaststroke Butterfly stroke Tag Diving Triathlon Norway national football team Medley swimming Backstroke Aerial (dance move) Equine conformation Swimming pool Weight training Volleyball Star Trek Customizable Card Game History of swimming Poker jargon Tennis Professional wrestling slang Badminton Paragliding Extreme Programming National Football League Front crawl Cross-country skiing Golf Sauna Craps The Amazing Race New York Giants Football (soccer) Sport rowing Table tennis Education in the United States Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Diving suit Ultimate (sport) Parachuting Mixed martial arts 2000 Australian Grand Prix Water polo Beatmania IIDX Little Britain Social rule Stuttering Dragon boat RuneScape Fanny Blankers-Koen Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 1896 Summer Olympics Chinese martial arts Scientology beliefs and practices Unreal Super Mario 64 Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Ocean's Twelve Fencing Team Fortress Classic Drowning Lance Armstrong Time Out of Mind Martial art Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game Pittsburgh Steelers Cleveland Browns Georgia Institute of Technology American football Playoff Aikido Skateboarding trick Major League Baseball television contracts Dog Kitesurfing Singlish New York Jets Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Glossary of climbing terms Horizontal bar Indianapolis 500 Ceroc Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Batting (cricket) Marching band Piccolo Junior Saga Ice hockey Kodocha The Contender (television series) Theory of conduct Paintball Drifting (motorsport) Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles Satchel Paige Frogman
