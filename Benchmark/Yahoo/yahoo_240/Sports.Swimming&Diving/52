how do you kickglide ok so it might sound a bit stupid but i just took my first swimming lesson today and i was told to use the kickboard and kick to move problem is though i don't seem to be getting anywhere am i kicking wrong or what yep you're kicking wrong but don't sweat it kicking is not a terribly efficient way to propel yourself i have been swimming my whole life and i'm still not much of a kicker unless you are talking breaststroke kick but i bet that is not what you learned on your first day flutter kick is probably what you are trying to do again not an easy thing to learn it does take some practice even to just move so my advise relax the flutter kick will create some splash but it doesn't have to when done properly creating splash for the sake of splash is not effective at all point your toes and flick your lower legs from your knees to your toes to develop propulsion another great learning aid are swim fins your instructor may frown on the use of them however they do teach the proper motion yes it is artificial but once you have the correct muscle memory you may find it easier to propel yourself without them good luck and don't give up Breaststroke Backstroke Front crawl Diving Equine conformation Aerial (dance move) History of swimming Theory of conduct Cross-country skiing Embouchure Drowning Professional wrestling holds Social rule Wing Chun Alexander Technique Parade (military) Piccolo Junior Saga Spacecraft propulsion Dog Poker jargon Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Kick Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Chinese martial arts Bicycle Skateboarding trick Stuttering Glossary of climbing terms Medley swimming MS-06 Zaku II Propeller Anatomical terms of location Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Tetrapod Tank Martial art Kender Field hockey Marching band Muay Thai The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Naruto jutsu Quake III Arena Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Characters of Naruto Tenshinhan Bass drum Japanese tea ceremony Professional wrestling attacks Shaggy dog story Anal sex Taekwondo Sauna Punt (boat) Snowboarding Karma Spanking Professional wrestling aerial techniques Richard Feynman Weight training Tai Chi Chuan Horizontal bar Dog training Craps Galactic Civilizations Fecal incontinence Goofy The Butterfly Effect Blood (computer game) Hyperthermia Mnemonic Capoeira Samuel Goldwyn Kitesurfing Singlish Pitaten Avenue Q Friends Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban National Football League Lore Basic English Great Teacher Onizuka Glossary of partner dance terms Cardiac arrhythmia Lightsaber combat Computer numbering formats Protoss Paragliding Luminiferous aether Proprioception Carburetor Hapkido Reservoir Dogs Chess strategy and tactics
