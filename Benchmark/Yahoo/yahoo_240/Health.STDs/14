if you have herpes how many days out of the year can you not have sex b c of painful outbreaks or just outbreaks in general not necessarily painful between a girl having her period and her partner having outbreaks i am concerned by how often sex will have to be avoided i know it is different for everyone but would appreciate examples from people that have it or whose partners have it bad examples or good please share once i got herpes i learned very quickly that outbreaks can be triggered by stress since i am a type a individual i had to learn to take things slower not do so much all the time and relax of course this was better for me as a person also but it took getting herpes for that to happen i would say i had outbreaks maybe once a year or once every years for several years and then less and less i never get them anymore probably not for years or so that's what happens every time you have an outbreak your body builds up antibodies and even though it will live in your nervous system forever it will eventually stop coming out in the form of outbreaks of sores on your genitals i have known people who had outbreaks much more often than i did but they also lived much more stressful lives and i think you can choose to change that even though it might be difficult painful sores in your genital region can really motivate you to change though when i had an outbreak i stopped having sex as soon as i felt the tingling that might signal an oubreak waited to see if it was an outbreak stayed off the sex while the sores were visible and waited to have sex until all symptoms had been gone for several days since an oubreak for me would last about a week or so this means i would not have sex for about weeks i hope this is helpful Herpes simplex virus Breastfeeding Sexually-transmitted infection Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Herpes zoster Chronic fatigue syndrome Psoriasis Human sexual behavior Mouth ulcer Oral sex Urinary incontinence Transsexuality Stomach cancer Herpesviridae Multiple sclerosis Transactional analysis Pain Infantilism AIDS Cytomegalovirus Transgender Transmission (medicine) Carpal tunnel syndrome Influenza Obsessive-compulsive disorder Massage Repetitive strain injury Syphilis Anxiety Panic attack Prostate cancer Autoimmune diseases Body piercing Pneumonia Hay fever Gender role Premature ejaculation Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Post-traumatic stress disorder Orgasm Cancer Traumatic brain injury Female genital cutting Migraine Sexual orientation Penis Antibody Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Social rule Group A streptococcal infection Spider Borderline personality disorder HIV test Child sexuality Serial killer Domestic rabbit Virus Asexuality Anorexia nervosa Ebola Jon Secada BDSM Masturbation Insomnia Child pornography Stress (medicine) Dog training Sento Reflexology Chancroid Psychosis Androgen insensitivity syndrome First aid Fertility awareness Equine conformation Lupus erythematosus Radiation therapy Poliomyelitis Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Polyamory Strap-on dildo H5N1 Hepatitis C Clinical depression History of intersex surgery Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Puberty Self-harm Fibromyalgia Genital wart Coeliac disease Lucid dreaming Jam (TV series) Menstrual cycle Gender identity Traumatic incident reduction Common cold
