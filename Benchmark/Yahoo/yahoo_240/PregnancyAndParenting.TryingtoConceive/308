if i am supposed to ovulate on and cant have intercourse until what are the odds of conceiving i know its possible but i am more curious about the time frame it takes the egg to disinigrate hours is the travel usually quick such as the hours or the latter the hours hopefully i'll ovulate on yeah i think the egg does die in the hour time frame you also need to think about the fact that sperm should already be waiting at the end of the fallopian tubes for the release of the egg therefore your best chance for conception is actually from sex the days before ovulation you also don't know exactly what time of day you ovulate could be in the middle of the night i have heard that stress can delay ovulation any chance you can dream up a reason for being stressed out Menstrual cycle Ovulation Fertility awareness Emergency contraception Infertility Fertilisation Pregnancy Female reproductive system (human) Oral contraceptive Ovary Sexual reproduction Niddah Birth control Sexual intercourse Sexual abstinence Puberty Ovum Time Artificial insemination Apollo 8 The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Spider Abortion debate Jon Secada Carpel Androgen insensitivity syndrome Intersexuality Social rule Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Quicksort Characters of The Sandman Saga (band) Time Out of Mind Boom Town (Doctor Who) Drosophila melanogaster Polycystic ovary syndrome Flowering plant Oral sex Prostate cancer Spermatozoon Fetal development Old wives' tale Bedbug Bicycle frame Twin Strap-on dildo Speed of light Estrus cycle Orgasm Albatross Craps Time travel Operation Market Garden Sydney Riot of 1879 The Time Machine Game show Digimon The Amber Spyglass Sex organ Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Who Framed Roger Rabbit Have I Got News For You Glossary of partner dance terms Human sexuality Triage Cricket Ovarian cyst Gonorrhoea Snooker Prosecutor's fallacy Noam Chomsky Ontological argument Fasting Ravi Shastri Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia The Inside Ectopic pregnancy Ovarian cancer Louie, Louie Aluminium Andrew Dice Clay Pregnancy test Aphid USS Tunny (SS-282) Pelvic inflammatory disease Stroke South Park Ocean's Twelve Phaedo Dead Like Me 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Edward's syndrome Angling G-Man (Half-Life) The Flaming Lips Gypsy moth American Pie (song) Property (ownership right)
