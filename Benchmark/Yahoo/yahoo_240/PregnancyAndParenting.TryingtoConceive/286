i've heard that sometimes when sperm fertilizes a female egg she can have some bleeding is this true also how much bleeding would there be actually no it is not true not the way you have said it anyway you do not bleed when the sperm fertilises the egg that is incorrect fertilisation will occur without your knowledge the bleeding that you are referring to occurs when the fertilised egg implants itself into the uterus the egg forces its way into the uterine lining and some women experience bleeding because of the break in the uterine tissue it really is more spotting and shouldn't be heavy at all that is why it is called implantation bleeding not everyone gets it though and it is not a sign that if you don't get it you are not pregnant i am currently months pregnant and did not get it Menstrual cycle Pregnancy In vitro fertilisation Miscarriage Fertilisation Twin Infertility Endometrium Uterus Emergency contraception Ovary Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Childbirth Human cloning Puberty Fertility awareness Ovulation Endometrial cancer Female reproductive system (human) Sexual reproduction Progesterone Stem cell Ovum Abortion Male reproductive system (human) Hydatidiform mole Oral contraceptive Gynecologic hemorrhage Birth control Spermatozoon Sex Estrus cycle Intrauterine device Ovarian cancer Embryo transfer Obstetrical hemorrhage Multiple birth Pregnancy (mammals) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Intersexuality Moss Sterilization (surgical procedure) Placental abruption Fetal development Ploidy Polycystic ovary syndrome Asherman's syndrome Premature birth Androgen insensitivity syndrome Urinary incontinence Uterine fibroids Hysterectomy Orgasm Parthenogenesis Vaginal bleeding Mammalian embryogenesis Spider Sex reassignment surgery female-to-male Dysfunctional uterine bleeding Traumatic brain injury Cervix Gonorrhoea Surrogacy Adenomyosis Human development Intersex surgery Sea Otter Sexual intercourse Human Pelvic inflammatory disease Human sexual response cycle Intravenous therapy Friends Frog Sexual differentiation Spina bifida Stroke Vagina Gynaecology Breech birth Man Gamete Hearing impairment Cancer Ocean's Twelve Octopus Oral sex Artificial womb Cryptorchidism Cellular differentiation Swyer syndrome Adverse effect (medicine) Digenea Breastfeeding Earthworm Von Willebrand disease Diabetic retinopathy
