i think im going crazy i am on the pill and have been on antibiotocs for the past days i know antibiotics cancel out the pill so i am really nervous my husband and i have been together im trying to keep it clean quite a bit in the past week i feel like im going crazy because i keep looking for pregnancy symptoms i know its too early i really want to be pregnant and i am ready to be a parent does anyone have any advice to calm me down thanks oh i forgot to explain i am on the pill because i am and recently married my husband and i have not had the baby talk yet yes i am ready to be a parent however my husband needs to be too i hope that explains it and clears up any confusion i would have a relaxing bath and sit back and do nothing treat yourself and if you are wanting to become a parent then i suggest you talk to your partner and let him know how you feel he may want the same and then go off the pill good luck but if you are always thinking of being pregnant your body will think you are and give you false hopes trust me that's what i did and once i realised that i fell pregnant months later just relax and take it easy Pregnancy Breastfeeding Oral contraceptive EastEnders Psoriasis Menstrual cycle Neighbours Folic acid Knots Landing Birth control Sharon Tate Urinary incontinence Jam (TV series) Syphilis Social rule Childbirth Guinea pig Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Endometriosis One Life to Live Caffeine Phoebe Halliwell Boston Public Charmed Abortion debate Friends Kodocha Sedative Sento Miscarriage Elvis and Me Acne Insomnia Infantilism Meditation Autism Alanis Morissette Sexual abstinence Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Symbiosis (TNG episode) Marriage Shaggy dog story Quarashi Milton H.
