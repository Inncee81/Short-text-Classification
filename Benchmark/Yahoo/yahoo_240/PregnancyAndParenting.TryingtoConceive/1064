is this my biological clock ticking let me start by saying i do not have a bf i have a friend with benefits who lives with me we do everything together and are only sleeping with each other nobody else so lately while we are having sex i have been having the urge to try and get pregnant i have always said i do not want kids and while around children i get frustrated and upset when they touch my things especially b c something always seems to break don't get me wrong i love my nieces and nephews but being around children make me not want to have one but somewhere inside me i keep getting this feeling like i do is this what they mean about your biological clock ticking is there any way to overcome these urges i am on birth control and would never even think of doing anything without consulting him first it sounds like a clock is ticking i think its just this innate urge to want to procreate even though you say you get frustrated with kids i'm sure if you had one of your own things would completely change i'm not sure there is anyway to overcome the urges you're having but if you really truly do not want to have kids then please use protection however from the way things are sounding and the fact that you are asking a question in a pregnancy trying to conceive section tells me that you do want to have a child good luck with whatever you choose to do Birth control Friends Abortion debate The Human Stain EastEnders Human sexual behavior Biology and sexual orientation Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Humphrey Bogart Laura Schlessinger Pregnancy The Smoking Room Radiohead Knots Landing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sexual abstinence Everwood Pitaten The Death Gate Cycle Childfree One Life to Live Adoption Parsifal Ex-gay Eddie Guerrero The Time Machine Theory of conduct Childbirth Family Neighbours Avenue Q Religion and sexuality Condom Doctor Who (Enemy Within) Breastfeeding Miguel Alvarez Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Characters in the Smurfs Sexual orientation Darth Vader Hearing impairment Vernon Schillinger Same-sex marriage Teenage pregnancy Social rule Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) T'Pol One Tree Hill (TV series) Milton H.
