is taking ibprophen bad for implantation bleeding and cramps that accompany it i took an mg ibprophen about hours ago for the cramps i have been having i thought i started my period days early but then i thought it might be implantation bleeding because its light pink and only on the toilet paper when i wipe my cramps were like period cramps i dont do well with pain and it was also strange that all of my periods have come in the morning and this one came at pm so could this be possible implantation bleeding and if it is will that medication effect the fetus if there is a possibility that you are pregnant stay away from ibuprofen use tylenol if you have to but ibuprofen or motrin isn't safe or suggested as it can cause fetal heart defects and maternal bleeding also stay away from asprin for the same reason what you took shouldn't be a problem because the risk of defects are highest between weeks after conception and you are still rather early especially if you're just implanting if you are pregnant but stay away from it in the future tylenol is considered a safe alternative for pregnant women Pregnancy Miscarriage Menstrual cycle Obstetrics Paracetamol Abortion Ectopic pregnancy Childbirth Abortion debate Stroke Folic acid Ibuprofen Congenital disorder Emergency contraception Breastfeeding COX-2 inhibitor Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Chemical abortion Tocopherol Hearing impairment Urinary incontinence Fetus Premature birth Placental abruption Androgen insensitivity syndrome Migraine Progesterone Endometriosis Prenatal diagnosis Intact dilation and extraction Malaria Oral contraceptive Spina bifida Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Psoriasis Alzheimer's disease Acupuncture Scientology beliefs and practices Placenta praevia Stomach cancer Withdrawal Cephalic disorder Gonorrhoea Prostate cancer Birth control Breast implant Person Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Needle aspiration biopsy In vitro fertilisation Anencephaly Roe v.
