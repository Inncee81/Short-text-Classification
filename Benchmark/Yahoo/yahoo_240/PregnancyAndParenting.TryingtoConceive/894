late period negative pregnancy test i am days late i am never late i always start on the exact day i'm due to but i've taken two pregnancy tests that have been negative the first one i took the day after i should have started and i took one this morning i haven't had any cramping or spotting which i always have the week before my period the only thing that feels weird is i feel a tightness in my lower abdomen sometimes and yesterday i had a little lower back pain my lifestyle hasn't changed still normal eating exercising habits and normal stress how long should i wait to test again is it normal to have to wait this long to get a positive result if you are pregnant i'm using the error proof tests it's supposed to have to crossing lines if positive on both of the negative tests just the one line appeared there was a gap in the line i've never seen that before think they're defective or i'm just imagining things it is not normal to not get a pos result if you are that late for your period but it could be that you need to wait a few more days if you still do not have your period or a postitive result you should call you dr there are many things that could effect your being late you could have ovulated late even if you have never had a late period before you still can get a late one you could have implated late and thus you would get a late pos result there are many things that could cause you to not have a pos test yet but after days you should get a pos if you were pregant i did know someone who did not get a until she was dpo and went on to have a healhty baby so it could happen if it were me i would call the dr and ask that they draw blood and test the amount if any of the hcg in your blood Pregnancy Pregnancy test Obstetrics Fertility awareness Miscarriage Endometriosis HIV test Urinary incontinence Diabetes mellitus Coeliac disease Prenatal diagnosis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Human chorionic gonadotropin Breastfeeding Androgen insensitivity syndrome Childbirth Abortion Stomach cancer Breech birth Drug test Anemia Multiple sclerosis Psoriasis Insulin Hypertension Ovarian cancer Twin Folic acid Stuttering TGV Angina Spina bifida Vitamin C Friends Tocopherol Cryptorchidism Jon Secada Experiment Operation Market Garden Ovarian cyst Abortion debate Premature birth Milton H.
