i started charting i have a question regarding cm i was wondering for charting purposes if experience a creamy cm once during the day would i still mark creamy on the chart or no also those of you who are charting and observing your cm do you have the same type of cm during the day or various types i was just wondering because i experienced some creamy cm earlier and nothing else so far i think i should be ovulating any day now and i usually have more cm during this time in my cycle but my cm quanity is low does it mean anything i just started charting this month but had been checking cervical mucus and position a few months i always put the most fertile mucus of the day down on my chart we are all different i get creamy cm a couple of days after my period ends then it just seems watery until after i ovulate then builds again if you are getting close to ovulating i would expect watery or ewcm are you using opk strips too i just started those this month and helped to know how to evaluate my cm cp and temps as for why you are drier this month are you usually moist down there all month or just get wet around ovulation time if just around o time maybe its still a few days away this cycle good luck trish Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Ovulation Oral contraceptive Birth control Pregnancy Puberty Estrus cycle Polycystic ovary syndrome Tobacco Maya calendar Emergency contraception Climate of the United Kingdom Ovarian cyst Infertility Progesterone Water Tide Conifer cones Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pregnancy test Cystic fibrosis Fruit Cervix Urinary incontinence Niddah Top 40 UK Singles Chart Stomach cancer Apollo 8 Breastfeeding Hebrew calendar Time In vitro fertilisation Human chorionic gonadotropin Slug Thermal power station Lake District Carpel Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Prince (artist) Julian day Medical record Childbirth Hyperinflation Calendar Mountain Gorilla Cervical cancer Chinese calendar STS-62 Miscarriage Salvia divinorum We Belong Together Asthma Trish Stratus Full moon cycle Sauna Mucus Ozone depletion Monsoon Global warming Opportunity rover El Ni__o Poker jargon Paleoclimatology Variable star Human papillomavirus Estradiol Seismometer Astrology Navigation Hemp 2005 Atlantic hurricane season Common cold Triage Gregorian calendar Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Leap year Ozone hole Jute CPU cache Radiohead Cricket pitch Climate of Salt Lake City Sexual abstinence Sleep Four-stroke cycle Pachypodium brevicaule Sea level rise Dominical letter Daylight saving time Temperature Social rule Dishwasher International Phonetic Alphabet Pop punk Single (music) Vowel Karma
