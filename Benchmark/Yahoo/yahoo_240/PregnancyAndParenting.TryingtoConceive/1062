missed period i am ttc month this month i completely skipped my period and obviously thought i was preg not the case the dr prescribed me provera for days to make me get a period anyone had to do this and if so did anyone get preg soon after it thanks for your answers hi it is common for doctors to give hormone pills to regulate your cycle if the doc did this it was for two reasons first to regulate you temporarily and secondly to see if it will stay regular afterwards if it doesn't then the doc may give you pills to take continuously until you get a positive and become pregnant my specialist told me a funny thing he said 'if i hear horses hooves then i look for horses but if i continue to hear horses hooves then i look for zebras' so basically it is a process and just takes time to investigate you will be just fine don't worry but be sure to closely follow the instructions of how to take them pills and what specific day to start a secondary hormone if it was prescribed i did that and by the third month of hormones i got pregnant with my firstborn and as a bonus when she was five months old i got pregnant unexpectedly i had a boy and we are a happy and complete family now Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Oral contraceptive Urinary incontinence Birth control Sleep Prostate cancer Emergency contraception Depo Provera Baldness treatments Milton H.
