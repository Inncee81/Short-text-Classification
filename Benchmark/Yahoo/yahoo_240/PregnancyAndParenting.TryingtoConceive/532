jinxing a pregnancy my husband and i have been ttc for a year but everytime i get the smallest sign he gets really excited wants to get a test and starts acting like im pregnant i swear ive taken atleast tests in the past year but it always turns out im not pregnant do you think we are jinxing it by getting so excited over nothing if i get a small sign should we just act like its nothing yeah im kinda superstitious i think that you should try to stay calm before you know for sure but not because you would be jinxing anything but because the letdown after getting excited is harder on you two and could really wear you down fast also try not to look for signs because you could be faking yourself out by mentally forcing your body to produce signs or also seeing them when they don't exist at all i wish for the best and hope and pray you get a bundle of joy soon EastEnders Knots Landing Quarashi Days of our Lives Cytomegalovirus Menstrual cycle Anne Boleyn Pregnancy Friends Pitaten Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Elephant Neighbours Guinea pig Toronto Streetcar System Marilyn Monroe Abortion Autism Sharon Tate Phoebe Halliwell Jinx English cricket team Taken Roswell UFO incident Survivor (novel) Ravi Shastri Toronto Transit Commission Superstition History of Test cricket (to 1883) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) One Life to Live Muslim ibn Aqeel Pressurized water reactor Abortion debate Mental retardation Toronto Blue Jays Toronto Subway and RT Sacrifice The Lovely Bones Joy (novel) Origin belief Abortion in the United States Cliff Richard Urinary incontinence Turner syndrome Ron and Fez Cephalic disorder Obstetrics Ocean's Twelve Dawson's Creek Partial-birth abortion Drawn Together Marie Antoinette Mary, the mother of Jesus One Hundred Years of Solitude Alcoholics Anonymous Pete Sampras Homer Simpson The Amazing Race Usher (entertainer) Mouse (computing) Kender Condom Fertility awareness Phoebe Buffay Aes Sedai Blood on the Tracks Jon Secada Mystique (comics) Tom and Jerry (MGM) Single certification Jean Grey Noel Gallagher Eastern Orthodox Church Heracles Elvis and Me Electrophysiology Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Coeliac disease Bene Gesserit Human sexual behavior Miss Saigon Horse Gene Tierney Futurama (TV series - season 5) Anne of the Thousand Days Hulk (comics) Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Ron Weasley The Ashes AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted Australian rock Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Eucharistic discipline Zoophilia The Death Gate Cycle Louis XV of France
