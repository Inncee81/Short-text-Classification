so i thought my husband wanted a baby we have been ttc for the past months my fertile peiod this month is anywhere between the th th last night we made love and he pulled out before he ejaculated we used to use this as a method of birth control before we got married i don't know what to think was it an old habit or do you think this means he really doesn't want a baby yet first of all talk to him unless you have an open and honest discussion about this you'll never know for sure it could be just an old habit like you said has he done this any other time since you've been ttc he may also just have cold feet men see having children as a huge responsibility and rightly so they feel compelled to make sure you have the financial resources and right situation to have a baby maybe he's just a little shaken up by the reality of it all now that you're actively trying just talk to him and and see what's up if claims it was habit and he doesn't do it again let it go there's no use worrying Sexual intercourse Birth control EastEnders Breastfeeding Friends Milton H.
