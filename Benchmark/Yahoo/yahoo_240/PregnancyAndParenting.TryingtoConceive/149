i had two healthy pregnancies and now m c could taking birth control have ruined my hormone balance after my second uneventful pregnancy i was almost years old and felt i was done with having babies i went on two different birth control pills in an eight month timeframe one was ortho trycyclen one was a progestin one one caused my migraines to worsen the other i wouldn't stop bleeding so off i went and got pregnant within two months i m c at weeks the heart had stopped my hormones were out of whack all through it nightsweats hot chills weird stuff my dr said probably chromosome problem seven months later i was pregnant again m c at eight weeks bleeding started after intercourse that was two years ago two months ago i finally got pregnant again but spotted and then stopped and then m c at weeks bleeding started the day after intercourse my period seems to always follow sex too when i am late i joke with dh that we need to get busy to get rid of my pms now i am in my late 's and am trying again anyone else had m c after birth control pills sorry for your losses i have also had m c's and still birth at weeks that was a cord knot i was not on birth control at any point with the loses but i know with my m c's all i had problems with my hormone levels it seems that hormones levels being wacky is responsible for the loses in both of our cases i'm sure your hormone levels being off could have come from the pill thing while mine was due to pcos either way they are both hormonal related what helped me was using clomid it works opposite of birth controll it tells the body that progesterone and estrogen are low and your body in turn makes a ton of both hormones it also makes your eggs really mature and you get a lot of eggs when you ovulate so your chances are increased dramatically clomid works for women who have simple infertility issues i got preg the st i ever used it i'm weeks now with a healthy baby and things are going perfectly it maybe worth a try to ask about it it's a pill so insurance covers it except the co pay and many women have success using it hormonal issues almost always have to be treated with medication of some sort hope you have better luck next time Fertility awareness Endometriosis Progesterone Birth control In vitro fertilisation Pregnancy Polycystic ovary syndrome Urinary incontinence Miscarriage Androgen insensitivity syndrome Obstetrics Emergency contraception Breastfeeding Abortion debate Puberty Turner syndrome Ectopic pregnancy Depo Provera Folic acid Hormone replacement therapy Ovulation Acne Twin Hormone Cancer Childbirth Chronic fatigue syndrome Homosexuality and transgender Abortion Prostate cancer Testosterone Psoriasis Migraine Prolactinoma Tocopherol Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Growth hormone treatment Intersexuality Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Transsexuality Estrus cycle Transgender Premature birth Spina bifida Anabolic steroid Sexual intercourse Gonorrhoea Legal aspects of transsexualism Sex assignment Knots Landing Ovary Ovarian cancer Ovarian cyst Neighbours Cryptorchidism Morning sickness Sexual abstinence Teenage pregnancy Oral sex Diabetes mellitus Gonadotropin-releasing hormone Stroke Radiation therapy Anemia Sex education Sexual differentiation Baldness treatments Breech birth Growth hormone deficiency Nutrition Baldness Stomach cancer History of sex Androgen Obesity Postpartum depression Chemotherapy Human sexual behavior Breast Amenorrhoea Osteoporosis Sexual dysfunction Multiple sclerosis Delayed puberty History of intersex surgery Hypoglycemia Clinical depression Guinea pig Prenatal diagnosis Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Insulin
