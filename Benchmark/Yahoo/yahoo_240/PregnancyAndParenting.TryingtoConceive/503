i am trying to conceive can i eat sushi i have already quit everything else that is bad during pregnancy someone please tell me that this is ok what do doctors suggest what about tiny pieces of fish like in sushi rolls thanks for any advice it's fine to eat sushi when you're pregnant or trying to conceive as long as any raw fish used to make it has been frozen beforehand this is because occasionally fish contain small worms which could make you ill if they are still alive when you eat the fish freezing kills worms and makes raw fish safe to eat lots of the sushi sold in shops is bought in already made not made at the shop this type of sushi should be fine to eat because if a shop or restaurant buys in ready made sushi the raw fish used to make it must have been frozen at minus c for at least hours but if a shop or restaurant makes its own sushi on the premises the fish might not have been frozen if you're concerned ask the staff if you make your own sushi at home freeze the fish for at least hours before using it you can eat most types of fish when you're pregnant or breastfeeding eating fish is good for your health and the development of your baby but you should avoid some types of fish and limit the amount you eat of some other types when you're pregnant or planning to get pregnant you shouldn't eat shark swordfish or marlin you should also limit the amount of tuna you eat to no more than two tuna steaks or four medium size cans of tuna a week this is because these fish contain more mercury than other types of fish the amount of mercury we get from food isn't harmful for most people but if you take in high levels of mercury when you're pregnant this could affect your baby's developing nervous system when you're breastfeeding you don't need to avoid shark swordfish or marlin or limit the amount of tinned tuna you eat there is no need to limit the amount of white fish you eat when you're pregnant or breastfeeding apart from shark and marlin Breastfeeding Fishing Swordfish Oily fish Healthy eating Japanese cuisine Pregnancy Conveyor belt sushi Omega-3 fatty acid Vegetarianism RuneScape skills Fish and chips Childbirth Cuisine of Denmark Foodborne illness Food Ramen Hamburger Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Egg (food) Angling French cuisine Tofu Folic acid Thimerosal Shark German cuisine Salmon Bento Whaling Vitamin C Birth control Kosher foods Coeliac disease Tsukiji fish market Stomach cancer Guinea pig Escherichia coli O157:H7 Friends Veganism RuneScape locations Tuna Coffee French fries Finding Nemo Abortion debate Tooth Customs and etiquette of Japan Sashimi Charmed Oceanic Whitetip Shark Common Fisheries Policy Pizza Hypoglycemia Hamster EastEnders Insulin Pacific saury Milk Nutrition Economy of Maldives Fugu Health insurance Prolactinoma Fish Jaws (film) Mercury (element) In vitro fertilisation RuneScape economy Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cuisine of the Philippines Menstrual cycle Anorexia nervosa Wasabi Bottlenose Dolphin Tobacco smoking Raw food diet Great White Shark Albacore Cantonese cuisine Whale Premature birth Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Dairy Taiwanese cuisine Jewish cuisine Sauerkraut Taboo food and drink Urinary incontinence One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish Stuttering Restaurant Boom Town (Doctor Who) GunBound Jackass: The Movie
