trying to conceive i have always had a day period ever since my menses started at i am now yrs old and my husband and i have been trying to have another baby after months we have not conceived i am wondering if this might be due to the fact that for the past year i have been having such a short period days could this day period be affecting my ability to conceive period length doesn't really have anything to do with conception i would try to pinpoint when you're ovulating and count the number of days between that and when your period starts your luteal phase i read anything less than days means conception will be really tough your body needs that long to deliver a fertilized egg into your uterus and if you start your period sooner than days the fertilized egg might be lost i spent a good amount of money and got the clear plan fertility monitor to help me pinpoint ovulation i was ovulating on day i would never have known that and it would have taken a lot longer than months to conceive had i not purchased it i tried the cheaper ovulation kits but had a hard time interpreting them and never thought to continue using them as long as day anyway try those methods for a few more cycles and then contact your ob for further help good luck Menstrual cycle Pregnancy Fertility awareness Ovulation In vitro fertilisation Puberty Infertility Emergency contraception Maya calendar Fertilisation Birth control Oral contraceptive Endometrium Estrus cycle Childbirth Time Sexual abstinence Tsetse fly Niddah Female reproductive system (human) Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Extreme Programming Ovum Microeconomics Progesterone Bipolar disorder Gregorian calendar Polycystic ovary syndrome Ovary Miscarriage Sexual reproduction Conifer cones Human chorionic gonadotropin Hebrew calendar Guinea pig Computus Month The nature of God in Western theology Theory of conduct Galactic Civilizations Androgen insensitivity syndrome Fibonacci number Calendar Flowering plant Twin HIV test Grammatical aspect Central processing unit Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Orgasm Abortion Endometriosis Multiple birth Inflation Labor theory of value Numerology Mountain Gorilla Obstetrics Second Battle of the Atlantic Digital photography Solar variation Leap year Infantilism Gross domestic product Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency Friends Labour economics Fermi paradox Octopus Simone Weil Ontological argument EastEnders Hyperinflation Wealth Abortion debate Philo Battle of Kursk Sea-Monkey Chinese calendar Entropy Apollo 8 Astronomy on Mars Julian day Kodocha Sexual differentiation Friedrich Schleiermacher Traumatic incident reduction Rudolf Hermann Lotze Biorhythm Logic Craps Strap-on dildo Scientology beliefs and practices Telephone numbering plan Attic calendar Soil science Monetary policy Lancelot
