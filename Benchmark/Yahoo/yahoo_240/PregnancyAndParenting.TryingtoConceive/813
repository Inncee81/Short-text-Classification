ovulation mood swings pregnancy i have been reading some past q a's and from what i can gather it is normal to have mood swings after ovulating so my question is if you fell pregnant during ovulation would these mood swings still occur also i usually get sore breasts a week before my period is due but this time i have had sore breasts since a few days after my period why is this i used some ovulation tests and i think i ovulated between the st and th of august could the sore breasts be related to pregnancy if i was feeling the symptom as early as when i ovulated i'm a little confused by your question but as a woman who is currently pregnant let me say that the first symptom i experienced that led me to believe i might be pregnant was the fact my breasts were sore i was pregnant last year and lost a baby at weeks and i had sore breasts during that pregnancy as well my boobs hurt like never before i don't remember my boobs hurting quite like this during my period good luck Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Obstetrics Oral contraceptive Polycystic ovary syndrome Breastfeeding Miscarriage Cytomegalovirus Abortion Pregnancy test Ovarian cancer Ovulation Progesterone Urinary incontinence Emergency contraception Psoriasis Premenstrual stress syndrome Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Haloperidol In vitro fertilisation Paroxetine Breast cancer Ovarian cyst Folic acid Breast Prolactinoma Puberty Endometriosis Premature birth Equine conformation Childbirth Alcoholism Stomach cancer Turner syndrome Estrus cycle Endometrial cancer Stroke Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Sharon Tate Cancer Hypoglycemia Gynecologic hemorrhage Maprotiline Transsexuality One Life to Live Breast implant Traumatic brain injury Rape Gregory Goodwin Pincus Spina bifida Clinical depression Everwood EastEnders Infertility Group A streptococcal infection Herpes simplex virus Melanie Wilkes Abortion debate Tocopherol Diabetes mellitus Pregnancy fetishism English grammar Seizure Methotrexate Birth control Ectopic pregnancy Niddah Androgen insensitivity syndrome Prenatal diagnosis Pelvic inflammatory disease Human chorionic gonadotropin Sexual abstinence Morning sickness Schizophrenia Grammatical tense Clomipramine Breech birth Syphilis Toxoplasmosis Anemia Inflation fetishism Tom Coburn Hyperprolactinaemia Psychosis Cephalic disorder Friends AIDS Multiple birth Twin Coeliac disease Estradiol Breast fetishism Diabetic retinopathy Roe v.
