trying to conceive on meds last month i took provera along with metformin for the last months for pcos and had my period on july th when will i most likely be ovulationg and when can i get a pregnancy test iv been feeling sick lately but it could be the pills and am woundering what to do and when you can figure out when you're ovulating by keeping track of how long your period is because you ovulate days before the first day of your period so if you were to always start your period on the th day of your cycle the day you start your period is considered day then you would have ovulated on day does that make sense it's pretty easy if your period is a bit less predictable like sometimes you start your period on the th day and sometime it's the th then you subtract days from both of those numbers and you get day so you would want to have sex on both of those days good luck and baby dust to you Pregnancy Polycystic ovary syndrome Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Birth control Maya calendar Oral contraceptive Ovulation Progesterone In vitro fertilisation Depo Provera Estrus cycle Miscarriage Emergency contraception Breastfeeding Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Niddah Infertility Ovarian cyst Sexual abstinence Full moon cycle Metformin Folic acid Leap year Computus Abortion debate Insulin resistance Puberty Human chorionic gonadotropin Multiple birth Conifer cones Fertilisation Apollo 8 Chronic fatigue syndrome Diabetes mellitus Multiple sclerosis Gregory Goodwin Pincus Gonadotropin-releasing hormone Time Napier's bones Ovarian cancer Social rule Month Obstetrics Tsetse fly Solar eclipse Endometriosis Japanese calendar Real number Premenstrual stress syndrome Hebrew calendar Autism Kodocha Calculating the day of the week Charles Darwin's illness Dominical letter Sexual intercourse Julian day Sulfonylurea Ice age Friends Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Sexual reproduction Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 2000 Australian Grand Prix Saros cycle Darwin from Orchids to Variation Urinary incontinence HIV Infantilism HIV test Estradiol Ovary Knife The Beatles discography Chagas disease Oral sex EastEnders Epact ENIAC Sunspot Eclipse cycle Binary numeral system Gregorian calendar New Zealand cricket team in Zimbabwe in 2005-06 USS Wahoo (SS-238) Ra (board game) Year Clock of the Long Now Luck Prolactinoma Big Brother UK series 6 IBM 700/7000 series Variable star Sharon Tate Numerology Narcissism Natural family planning
