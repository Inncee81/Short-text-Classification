i need some opinons with ovulation ok so i am having painful cramps in the middle of my lower abdominal i had a tiny bit of blood when i checked my cervical mucus it is clear and stretchy does not break does this sound like ovulation my chart says i am not suppose to ovulate until the th also one more question when you ovulate can you have the same symptoms you would if you were about to get your period or being pregnant thank you ovulatory spotting occurs during ovulation when estrogen levels drop suddenly causing blood vessels in the uterus to release small amounts of blood estrogen is high right before ovulation and dips when the egg is released and then within a matter of hours progesterone starts to be secreeted in high amounts but during the couple of hours or so that the estrogen is low and progesterone is just starting to climb a little blood may be released so the spotting should occur immediately after ovulation but for some women it will take a few hours before they see the spotting on their panties or when wiping so by the time you see the spotting you have already ovulated but ewcm mixed with blood is still considered extremely fertile so it's a good time to bd symtpoms of ovulation mild abdominal cramps mittelschmerz breast tenderness bloating increased sex drive increased cervical mucus that is watery or like raw eggwhites cervix is at show soft high open wet Oral contraceptive Progesterone Ectopic pregnancy Puberty Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Endometriosis Obstetrics Endometrial cancer Polycystic ovary syndrome Birth control Androgen insensitivity syndrome Cervix Emergency contraception Miscarriage Ovarian cancer Hormone replacement therapy Urinary incontinence Estradiol Abortion Premature birth Cervical cancer Ovarian cyst Estrus cycle Ovary Premenstrual stress syndrome Childbirth Breastfeeding Gonorrhoea Equine conformation Breast cancer Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency First aid Swyer syndrome Spider Turner syndrome Sexual reproduction Decompression sickness Infectious mononucleosis Human chorionic gonadotropin Hypoglycemia Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Breast Uterine fibroids Pregnancy test Infertility Colorectal cancer Cystic fibrosis Dialysis Undergarment Abdominal pain Atherosclerosis Testosterone Aspartame Estrogen Fertilisation Coffee Sexual differentiation Prostate cancer Flowering plant Intracranial pressure Aortic dissection Osteoporosis Physical examination Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome Traumatic brain injury Diabetes mellitus Conifer cones Asthma Chiropractic Prolactinoma Married... with Children Herpes simplex virus Common cold Cholesterol Capercaillie Autonomic nervous system Gout Twin Menstrual cup Blood pressure Tsetse fly Tide Non-human animal sexuality
