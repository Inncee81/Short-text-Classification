i'm days late we're trying to conceive and now i'm days late my period is always regular so i was confident that i was pregnant however the test i took this morning was negative i called my doctor who said that it may be that i didn't ovulate last month and therefore skipped a period or maybe i just wasn't far enough along for the test to pick up on the hormones i've been pregnant before and have always been able to test positive the day after i was supposed to start my period about days before and up to about days before i should have started this period i had some clear disharge with a little blood in it i thought of it as implantation bleeding since i've never experienced any bleeding between periods what do you think if you feel you are pregnant i would give a test another try but wait a week i am pregnant with my second child and this pregnancy took negative tests one positive test to get the result i wanted i know it's hard to wait but chances are you'll get your results good luck Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Oral contraceptive In vitro fertilisation Prostate cancer Endometriosis Obstetrics Polycystic ovary syndrome Abortion Childbirth 2000 Australian Grand Prix HIV test Infertility Emergency contraception Ovarian cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Birth control Ovulation Blood type Stomach cancer Ben Johnson (athlete) Puberty Gynecologic hemorrhage Estrus cycle Coeliac disease Prenatal diagnosis EastEnders Tocopherol Abortion debate Cytomegalovirus Diabetic retinopathy Human chorionic gonadotropin Friends Twin Extreme Programming Knots Landing Drug test Stroke Gonorrhoea Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Premature birth Breastfeeding Progesterone Slow Train Coming The Contender (television series) Ectopic pregnancy Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Blood on the Tracks Apollo 8 Alois Hitler Traumatic brain injury Charmed Heinkel He 112 Days of our Lives Sharon Tate Piccolo Junior Saga Bayesian inference Ovary Alcoholism Sami Brady Babe Carey Social rule Psoriasis Anemia Clinical depression Acne Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Folic acid Neighbours Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Humphrey Bogart Operation Market Garden Brian Close Kodocha Niddah Endometrium Hal Trosky Chris Candito Indian cricket team in Zimbabwe in 2005-06 Schapelle Corby Guinea pig Morning sickness Poker jargon Ovarian cyst Child sexuality Leo Wyatt Transsexuality Endometrial cancer Paget's disease of bone One Life to Live Pitaten Cancer Insulin Alex Ferguson
