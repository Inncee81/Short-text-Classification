why cant we have a baby we've been trying to have a baby for about years now its crazy how people who dont want to have babies are popping them out left and right maybe we should get divorced and start jumpin out our parents bedrooms windows and see wut happens then can anyone help us well it depends when you're having sex there are only few days in the cycle month that you can get pregnant and that is when you're ovulating releasing the egg do you know when you ovulate have you tried ovulation predictor kits every woman is different and although the web and even the doctors say that you ovulate on day th it's not always true some ladies ovulate on day or even day you start counting from the day you start your period day this cycle stops when you start your next period day again with your new period sperm can live inside your body anywhere from days depending on cervical fluid your wetness inside of you sorry for too much information make sure you're not using ky jelly astroglide saliva or other lubricants because believe it or not this kills the sperm you may want to try out preseed which can be purchased and read more about at www preseed com this type of lubricant is inserted inside your vagina about minutes before sex it doesn't kill the sperm and it's affordable too it's helped a lot of women get pregnant but then again as long as you partner are healthy i would highly suggest purchasing the clearblue easy digital ovulation kit which can be bought at target for instead of which is at most retail shops this digital kit has tests which you pee on every morning preferrably in the afternoon time and if you're about to ovulate hours it will show you a digital smiley face if you're not about to ovulate then it will just show you a circle the test detects lh surge which is a hormone that is at it's top peak when you're about to ovulate release the egg once you see that smiley face you should have sex within hours sperm can stay in your body anywhere from days obviously this depends on both partners' health also the reason i would suggest this digital test rather than other tests in the market is because the other aren't digital you have to kind of guess yourself by looking at pink lines if you're okay with that then you can purchase the first response ovulation kit or answer brand it's cheaper and has more tests tests but it's not digital check out the clearblue easy digital opk http www clearblueeasy com digitalovul also i've read that before you have sex it's good for the male to drink coffee about min because the sperm are more jumpy and can get to the egg faster especially the y sperm boy sperm good luck and baby dust to you Puberty In vitro fertilisation Prostate cancer Pregnancy Ovulation Infertility Condom Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Urinary incontinence Oral sex Breastfeeding Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Oral contraceptive Strap-on dildo Emergency contraception Anal sex Androgen insensitivity syndrome Niddah Menstrual cup Sexual reproduction Sperm Whale Pornographic movie Human sexual behavior Personal lubricant HIV test Orgasm Pregnancy test Jam (TV series) Obstetrics Polycystic ovary syndrome Spider Friends EastEnders Drug test Transsexuality Child sexuality Sea-Monkey Sex toy Social rule Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Intact dilation and extraction Drosophila melanogaster Sesame Street Fecal incontinence Gonorrhoea Prenatal diagnosis Egg (food) Cancer Domain Name System Floppy disk Humphrey Bogart Hypoglycemia Safe sex Sento Motorcycle Semen History of Test cricket (to 1883) Masturbation Vagina Sex assignment Jon Secada Penis Cheating in Counter-Strike RFID Gramophone record Theory of conduct Fertilisation Kurt Cobain Hard disk Gender role Herpes simplex virus Cat Intersexuality Stomach cancer Ovary Adoption Growth hormone treatment Shark Ovum Airsoft Gay slang Vaginal lubrication Thermal power station Miscarriage Domestic rabbit Endometriosis Neopets The Amazing Race Wal-Mart
