when can i get pregnant after much research i keep reading that you get pregnant when you are ovulating weeks after your last period can i get pregnant in between that time my appointment with the gyn isn't until the end of the month but i want to get pregnant like yesterday lol please inform me if you are trying to get pregnant you should have sex around the time that you think you are ovulating you can estimate about when you are ovulating by tracking your periods the best estimate of when you are ovulating is acutally before your next period so if you are expecting your period on the th for example you may estimate that you will ovulate on the th this is just an estimate so you may want to try for several days around the th maybe from the th to the th you don't have to have sex at the exact moment or even on the exact day of ovulation sperm remains alive in a woman's body for up to hours and when you ovulate the released egg stays alive for about hours so your best bet for getting pregnant is to have sex every other day or so within a window of days around you ovulation estimate they say it's actually better to have sex every other day instead of every day because the sperm quality is better if it has some time to build up good luck Menstrual cycle Pregnancy Fertility awareness Ovulation In vitro fertilisation Emergency contraception Pregnancy test Puberty Oral contraceptive Sexual reproduction Infertility Abortion debate Niddah Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Ovum EastEnders Twin Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Birth control Fertilisation Polycystic ovary syndrome Social rule Ovary Estrus cycle Miscarriage Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia AIDS Female reproductive system (human) Sexual intercourse Orgasm Drosophila melanogaster Folic acid Sperm Whale Ovarian cyst Day Pornographic movie Big Brother UK series 6 Psoriasis Spermatozoon Blackjack Oral sex Nuclear fallout 10cc Breastfeeding Androgen insensitivity syndrome Jam (TV series) Moss Stem cell Octopus Cytomegalovirus Endometriosis X chromosome Marathon (sport) Whale The 4400 Human The Cursed Videotape Marchantiophyta Prostate cancer Madonna (entertainer) Kurt Cobain Angling Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Methotrexate Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Yesterday (song) Gregory Goodwin Pincus Radio Yerevan Sharon Tate Ploidy Have I Got News For You Premenstrual stress syndrome Rosa Parks Sex and the City Humpback Whale Gamete Health issues and the effects of cannabis Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Old wives' tale Sexual abstinence Expected value Bee Gees The Beatles discography Estradiol Parthenogenesis Apollo 8 Carpel Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hipparchus (astronomer) Herpes simplex virus Shark Death Conifer cones The Children of Men Migraine Friends Whaling Frankie Goes to Hollywood Ocean's Twelve
