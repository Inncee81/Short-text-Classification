possible to conceive on cd my menstrual cycle usually lasts around days is it possible to conceive on cd last month menstrual cycle lasts days but this month we did it on cd is it possible i would highly suggest purchasing the clearblue easy digital ovulation kit which can be bought at target for instead of which is at most retail shops this digital kit has tests which you pee on every morning preferrably in the afternoon time and if you're about to ovulate hours it will show you a digital smiley face if you're not about to ovulate then it will just show you a circle the test detects lh surge which is a hormone that is at it's top peak when you're about to ovulate release the egg once you see that smiley face you should have sex within hours sperm can stay in your body anywhere from days obviously this depends on both partners' health also the reason i would suggest this digital test rather than other tests in the market is because the other aren't digital you have to kind of guess yourself by looking at pink lines if you're okay with that then you can purchase the first response ovulation kit it's cheaper and has more tests but it's not digital check out the clearblue easy digital opk http www clearblueeasy com digitalovul also i've read that before you have sex it's good for the male to drink coffee about min because the sperm are more jumpy and can get to the egg faster especially the y sperm boy sperm good luck and baby dust to you Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Puberty Pregnancy Ovulation Infertility Oral contraceptive Polycystic ovary syndrome Prostate cancer Niddah Androgen insensitivity syndrome Emergency contraception Pregnancy test Estrus cycle Sexual intercourse Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Menstrual cup Drosophila melanogaster Ovum Hard disk Sexual reproduction Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma HIV test Urinary incontinence Breast cancer Breastfeeding Hypoglycemia RFID Orgasm Airsoft IPod Gender role Sears Holdings Corporation Endometrium Sea-Monkey The Beach Boys Transsexuality Endometriosis Sexual abstinence Female reproductive system (human) Abortion debate Progesterone Target Corporation Digital photography Wal-Mart History of Test cricket (to 1883) IBM PC compatible Game show Human chorionic gonadotropin Anal sex Coffee Intersexuality German car number plates Social rule The Chemical Brothers Billboard Hot 100 Cannabis cultivation Neopets Octopus card Ovarian cyst Smiley Smile Paragliding Friends Obstetrics Fasting Sterilization (surgical procedure) STS-59 $ale of the Century Commodore 64 UK Singles Chart Oral sex Credit card Laserdisc Collision detection Cheating in Counter-Strike Illegal drug trade Pornographic movie Artificial insemination Miscarriage Sesame Street Daylight saving time Sundial The Amazing Race Cryptorchidism PlayStation Portable Marriage Biodiesel Earthworm Organic food Fertilisation Only Fools and Horses Nintendo DS Hyperinflation Human sexual behavior
