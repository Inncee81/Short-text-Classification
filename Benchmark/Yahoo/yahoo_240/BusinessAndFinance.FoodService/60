i am employed but looking for a job will a propsective employer underhandedly check w my current employer i'm concerned that my company will find out that i am looking they have a zero tolerance based upon their personal preferences of the day my hope is that any company that i am interviewing with will not try to check my employment with the receptionist i've been working in an office for more than years and i have never gotten any phone calls like this i've also been on the other side looking for a job while i still had one and found out the following on most job applications you will be asked if it is okay for them to call your current employer so it is up to you if it's not on the application they may ask you during an interview if they don't mention it and it's not on the application tell them not to contact your current employer don't worry about it and good luck Social rule Plame affair Customer relationship management Freeters Internet fraud Expert system Probation officer Sweatshop Drug test Bluetooth Employment agency Unemployment Apple Computer Mordechai Vanunu Inheritance (computer science) Annuity Steve Jobs GSM services Employment Wine (software) Nighty Night Business ethics Surveillance Background check Security guard Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Bruce Johnson John Peel Secretar__a de Inteligencia Mach kernel Life insurance Rosa Parks Ocean's Twelve The Amazing Race Interview Circuit design Taxicab Telephone exchange Skype Consensus decision-making Jeff Gannon W.
