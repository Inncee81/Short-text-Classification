combining hdmi cable to one input both my cable box and my dvd player use hdmi cables but my lcd tv only has one hdmi port i know i can buy a switchbox to accomplish hooking them both up to the one port but why wouldn't a hdmi splitter allow for them to be hooked up the same way as long as i make sure the dvd player is off when i use cable and vice versa the signal should still pass through to the tv right these are the best switchers on the market and it's cheaper than those overpriced ones you see in the stores DVD SCART Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting High-Definition Multimedia Interface Television Digital Visual Interface Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Sega Digital video recorder Dolby Laboratories 1080p High-definition television Cable television Xbox Universal Serial Bus Home cinema Digital Subscriber Line Sega Dreamcast Game Boy Advance Oscilloscope TurboGrafx 16 Pok__mon Box IPod Karaoke Laserdisc Xbox 360 Nintendo DS Commodore 64 TiVo RCA connector Solar power Blu-ray Disc Watch Sega CD IMac Loudspeaker Home Box Office Coaxial cable PlayStation 3 RS-232 Ethernet Sound Blaster Communications satellite Advanced Technology Attachment Videocassette recorder Bluetooth VHS Transformer High fidelity Video codec Regional lockout Amiga Handheld game console Vision mixer Effects pedal Atari ST S-Video Game Boy Micro Game port Media in Canada Digital rights management IBM PC compatible PlayStation 2 Digital television PlayStation Portable EMac Digital photography Nintendo GameCube DVD player USB flash drive Digital camera Walkman Light-emitting diode WWOR-TV Netfilter/iptables Audiophile Game Boy S/PDIF Anchor British Sky Broadcasting AmigaOS Liquid crystal display Computer and video games Embedded system Sharp Zaurus Pornography Animal Crossing TFT LCD High-Bandwidth Digital Content Protection Rail terminology Central processing unit Pok__mon Ruby and Sapphire Digital cable Hard disk Sega Saturn ABS-CBN Poker jargon Transmission line Diplexer Musical Instrument Digital Interface
