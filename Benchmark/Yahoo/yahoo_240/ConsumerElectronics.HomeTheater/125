why do i need video part of a v receiver for home theater i'm looking for a receiver for my home theater system i understand why i need audio receiver but i can only find a v receiver and not audio alone for video i can connect my dvd player vcr etc directly to the tv and use a universal remote control what's the benefit of having video receiver you don't your direct hookup scenario will work fine and may actually provide better video quality as the signal has gone through less cable and switches many current tvs also allow picture settings to be optimized per input so using a receiver to do the video switching also defeats this advantage the main advantages of using the receiver to do the switching are in cable management you can have one set of cables rather than or going to your tv this is especially important with a wall mounted flatscreen where a jumble of cables going up to the tv is unsightly if done right it can also result in simpler remote operation i would estimate of the moderate level a v installations i've seen less than half actually use the receiver to do video switching SCART Television DVD High-definition television VHS Laserdisc Remote control Home cinema Digital television PlayStation Portable S-VHS Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Xbox Cable television High-voltage direct current Bluetooth S__CAM Digital video recorder GSM services IP Multimedia Subsystem Light-emitting diode Atari 8-bit family Modem Dimmer Musical Instrument Digital Interface Videocassette recorder X10 (industry standard) Universal Serial Bus Super Nintendo Entertainment System IPod Mouse (computing) Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis NTSC Digital photography RS-232 Electronic amplifier Composite video Ethernet NEC Corporation Loudspeaker Broadband Internet access Camcorder High fidelity Copy protection Vision mixer S-Video MPEG-2 8 mm video format Information Services Procurement Library Sega Dreamcast Macrovision ITU-T Digital circuit Widescreen Electrical wiring Set-top box Data compression Audiophile Video codec Transistor Windows XP Transformer Amstrad CPC Teletext Jack plug X Window System Computer Radio Broadband Networks Personal rapid transit MP3 Railway signal Programmable logic controller Power line communication Atari 2600 Original Amiga chipset Voice over IP TiVo Integrated Services Digital Network Audio data compression Digital audio broadcasting Solar power CMOS Windows 2000 Movie projector RCA connector Federal Standard 1037C Electric motor Embedded system Network Switching Subsystem Windows Vista Common Unix Printing System Receiver (radio) Quality of service Digital Subscriber Line
