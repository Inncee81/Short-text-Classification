what's better an lcd flat screen or a projector i want the image as big as possible it will probably be used hours a day max or longer for the occasional party to play music videos etc i've already got a speaker set up and a blank wall in case i get a projector but i hear the bulbs have to be replaced a lot do you projector owners mind this and do you think its worth the extra money to have such a big image i have both the projector in the home theater for the occasional use the flat screen is in our family room there are trade offs the lcd screen is going to give you a great image in ambient light as well as low light but the image is fixed at or or whatever you buy the projector can give you a image but the best image is in low light not very effective for a party the lamp will need to be changed around to hours at two hours a day well you can do the math it's not that costly on average hope this helps Movie projector Projection screen Liquid crystal display LCD projector Screensaver Digital projector Light-emitting diode Widescreen Photography Lighting Incandescent light bulb Anamorphic widescreen Digital photography Slide projector IMAX Home cinema Nintendo DS IMac DLP Light gun Stereoscopy Film Headlight Computer animation Wheel of Fortune PowerBook Digital Visual Interface Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Game Boy Game Boy Advance Cathode ray tube Contrast ratio Universal Studios Persistence of vision Atari 8-bit family Mercury-vapor lamp Television Interactive whiteboard Gamut Cinerama TFT LCD Digital cinema DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Winning Streak Oscilloscope Color Panavision Laptop Dial M for Murder Supply and demand Monetary policy DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution Warner Bros.
