my panasonic sa ht cd dvd player suddenly gets stuck on read when i try to play a disk any idea how fix it as working fine before i moved i packed it carefully with lots of padding and it doesn't look like it was damaged before it would read a disk and then dislplay how many songs there were on it and it was ready to play now the read sign is on but it does not go past that it is possible the player was damaged during the move if you are handy remove the cover and see if there is any dust or foreign material on the laser lense it's located where the dvd would normally sit inside the player it's a clear dome like device you can use some isopropyl alcohol and a cotton swab to clean the lense you may also want to check if there are any connections that are loose hope this helps Floppy disk Hard disk Isopropyl alcohol Blu-ray Disc DVD Laserdisc Gramophone record DualDisc PlayStation 2 Movie projector Mouse (computing) Upholstery Disc brake USB flash drive Laser Windows XP Nintendo Entertainment System Textile manufacturing Compact disc Television Digital photography Glossary of climbing terms Karaoke Fecal incontinence Eye Soldering Mobile phone Tattoo Contact lens Stage lighting Nintendo Revolution Camcorder Image scanner Bong System/34 Computer virus MiniDisc Poker jargon IPod Digital rights management Black hole Apollo 8 Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Stereoscopy Atari 8-bit family Disk storage Enterprise content management Booting Agar plate Nuclear weapon design The Shining (film) Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Little Britain View camera System/36 CD-ROM Photography Sega Dreamcast Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Computer bus Rugby union positions Carburetor Diabetic retinopathy Team Fortress Classic Cheating in poker Brewery GunBound Intraocular lens Laser engraving Tank Lightsaber Konica Minolta Ice hockey StarCraft Secret Missions Mercury 4 Handheld game console Printed circuit board The Amber Spyglass Lighting Cotton swab L'Arc-en-Ciel Undergarment File Allocation Table Venipuncture Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Bicycle lighting Enigma machine Kasparov versus The World PDP-11 Computer hardware Pottery Sound Blaster Parallax Violin Redundant array of independent disks Blood (computer game) ZX Spectrum Knife Early IBM disk storage The Time Machine
