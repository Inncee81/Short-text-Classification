why am i so terrified of roller coasters it seems like eveyone loves them and enjoys them i wanna enjoy them like everyone else i went on one called boulder dash in lake compounce and my back stomach and neck hurt sooo much after people said it was nothing but it was sooo scary for me how do i get rid of this fear is there a way to decrease the feeling when you ride a roller coaster help not everyone loves them my husband and my sister don't like them there's nothing wrong with feeling that way i've heard that the only fear we are born with is the fear of falling when you're on a roller coaster you feel like you're falling and instinctively it triggers fear if you really want to get over this you could start with some of the less wild coasters and work your way up Amusement park Cedar Point Kennywood Roller coaster Hersheypark Paramount's Kings Island Rock 'n' Roller Coaster Knott's Berry Farm RollerCoaster Tycoon Valleyfair!
