is busch gardens tampa better than busch gardens europe cause everone says europe is better me too they have da griffon it's all a matter of personal opinion personally the thrill seeker in me prefers williamsburg but the off roading safari lover in me prefers tampa here's a short description of each with some must rides for ya williamsburg is great for families with kids in that pre teen to teen thrill seeker age group with more roller coasters of an aggressive nature and in my opinion more of a theme park feel of course you also get oktoberfest in europe which is awesome in october and anheiser also gets to show off their coveted clydesdales and beer wagon but the rides in williamsburg is where busch gardens shines here roller coasters thrill rides high tech motion simulator themed fairground type areas and some of the best food you'll ever get to sample from all over europe without a passport apollo's chariot alpengeist loch ness monster escape from pompei roman river rapids and the newest edition to the bunch griffon comprise the coasters with new high tech thrills make sure to ride curse of darkastle think the amazing adventures of spiderman at universal's islands of adventure d multi sensory motion ride tampa is one of those cool zoo meets theme park type that offers more to do for the whole family young old its differing areas and continents are more suited to the climate of their respective countries and resembles the climate of tampa year round with animals and rides that are both fun and designed to be at least a little informative montu informative yep read some of the info posted in the queue line about all the pagan gods and such in egypt of course tampa bay is home to jack hanna and his animal adventures base camp and rhino rally is an especially cool way to see some big animals up close while keeping more of a ride mentality thrills here are bigger allbeit fewer coasters and themed flat rides with an animal show here and there lots of fun to sit in the splash zone also make sure to ride akbar's adventure here it's kind of out of the way and unknown but martin short makes a great appearance in this fun little ride so basically after a short synopsis of each it all boils down to personal opinion as to which is better i really think it depends on who's all in the group you're going with as long as everybody's having a great time Busch Gardens Williamsburg Roller coaster Disney's California Adventure Universal Orlando Resort Paramount's Kings Island Disney's Animal Kingdom Hersheypark Orlando, Florida Cedar Point Bolliger and Mabillard Scooby-Doo Knoebels Tampa, Florida Disneyland Paramount's Carowinds Six Flags Great Adventure Magic Kingdom Knott's Berry Farm Epcot Disney-MGM Studios Six Flags Over Texas Cobra roll Amusement ride Six Flags Hampton Roads Paramount Canada's Wonderland Kennywood RollerCoaster Tycoon LEGOLAND Windsor Walt Disney World Resort Chessington World of Adventures Kingda Ka Wooden roller coaster Six Flags Magic Mountain Cypress Gardens Indiana Jones Adventure Lightwater Valley Japanese tea ceremony Loch Ness Monster Dogpatch USA Drachen Fire Six Flags Astroworld Dreamworld Holiday World & Splashin' Safari The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror Launched roller coaster Pacific Ocean Park Coney Island K__ppen climate classification Edinburgh Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Pok__mon (anime) Big Thunder Mountain Railroad Passport Paramount's Kings Dominion Birmingham, Alabama Yu-Gi-Oh!
