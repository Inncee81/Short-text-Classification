what rides do you not recommend at dorney park what rides do u not recommend for a year old to go on dorney park is an awesome place we're in maine but have been there on our vacations many times as for what rides not to recommend i guess it depends upon the kid let them watch the ride run before actually going on like most other parks they have height requirements but at i can't think of any rides that he she wouldn't be able to go on they have some awesome roller coasters you wouldn't catch me on them but my kids love them the water park there is fantastic love the wave pool and the river rides for the money it's such a great deal and it's one of the few parks where most of the food is actually reasonably priced it's also kept very clean which is an added bonus we usually go first thing in the morning and hit the water rides first putting our dry clothes etc in a locker when we get tired of that then it's off to the other rides have a fantastic time Dorney Park Roller coaster Hersheypark Paramount's Kings Island Cedar Point RollerCoaster Tycoon Amusement park Knoebels Kennywood Alton Towers Paramount Canada's Wonderland Holiday World & Splashin' Safari Sento Disney's Typhoon Lagoon Disney's California Adventure Wooden roller coaster Big Thunder Mountain Railroad Textile manufacturing Six Flags Magic Mountain Paramount's Kings Dominion Trailer Park Boys Disneyland SeaWorld Knott's Berry Farm Kingda Ka Aerosmith Wheel of Fortune The Price Is Right Six Flags America Magic Kingdom Six Flags Great Adventure Pacific Ocean Park Yosemite National Park Bolliger and Mabillard Jackass: The Movie Changeroom Six Flags Universal Orlando Resort Full Metal Panic?
