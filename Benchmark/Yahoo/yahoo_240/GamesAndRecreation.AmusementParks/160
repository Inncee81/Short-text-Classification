what kind of roller coasters do more people perfer wood or steel this is basicly a survey steel seems safer and the ride tends to be smoother which is good but wooden ones are really fun because i love the rickety noise they make i love gemini at cedar point that is my favorite ride in the park but steel are good the steel ones just tend to be bigger and i'm not that totally huge of a roller coaster person both have ups and downs but overall i think metal is better for pure riding enjoyment Cedar Point Roller coaster Wooden roller coaster Intamin AG Hersheypark Knoebels Amusement park Millennium Force Paramount's Kings Island Six Flags Over Texas Kennywood Valleyfair!
