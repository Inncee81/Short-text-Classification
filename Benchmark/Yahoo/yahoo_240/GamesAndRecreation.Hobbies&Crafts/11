what is the difference by a brushless rc motor and one that does not have one a brushless mortor is a much more efficeint means of propelling an rc a brushless motor and speed controll is an easy way of adding alot of speed power and torque however is is expensive you also must ensure the motor and sc will fit and work for your car a brused car is slower and will burn batts fast but an alternative to stock motors is modified they are faster but they burn up batteries just as fast Electric motor Diesel engine Radio controlled car Brushless DC electric motor TGV Electric boat Solar car Variable Frequency Drive Auto racing Drag racing Radio controlled airplane Alternator Propeller Hybrid Synergy Drive Model aircraft Electric vehicle Lawn mower Ford Mustang Locomotive Hydrogen vehicle Manual transmission CPU design Hybrid vehicle Bicycle lighting Turbocharger Automatic transmission Wind turbine Jet engine Differential (mechanics) Tank classification MIM-23 Hawk Toyota Prius Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Internal ballistics Mitsubishi 3000GT Fan (implement) Torque Honda Insight George Westinghouse RISC Motorcycle Automobile Traffic light Tank Helicopter Chevrolet Corvair Messerschmitt Bf 109 Continuously variable transmission Fast bowling Overclocking Welding Internal combustion engine Four wheel drive Stock car racing Speed limit V8 Carburetor Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program Submarine Personal rapid transit Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution Transmission (mechanics) Nissan Skyline Battery electric vehicle E85 Gliding GM 60-Degree V6 engine Energy development Dodge Charger Bicycle The Suffering (game) Vehicular cycling AIM-9 Sidewinder Dynamic random access memory Mouse (computing) Steam engine P-38 Lightning Table saw Recumbent bicycle Drifting (motorsport) Canon T90 NASCAR Total Quality Management Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Golf club (equipment) Engine displacement Ford Thunderbird Aircraft engine controls Motorized bicycle Diesel cycle Cinematography CPU cache Ford Ranger EV Airsoft Car handling Radeon Turbojet Fuel injection Wheelchair
