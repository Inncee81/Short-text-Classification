can i use nylon bead thread with crimp beads hi i am currently working on a project which calls for seed beads to be hung from a metal crown i am using beadalon bead stringing wire with crimp beads but i don't like the way it hangs because frankly it just kinda looks too stiff for my taste i am wondering if i could use some stretchy plastic or nylon type thread with crimp beads or will it slip out thanks i think the crimp beads would weaken or cut nylon or plastic same for thread try gluing the knot or glue the last bead on the string glue will wick into the center whole of the bead if you hold it up to the nozzle and squeeze out a drop of glue alternatives would be leather cord elastic or just some cording that you tie a pretty knot in the end Glossary of climbing terms Textile manufacturing terminology Screw Knitting Violin Textile manufacturing Rope Climbing equipment Knot Guitar Nunchaku Comanche Suture Leather Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Harp Rigging Abacus Wire Die (manufacturing) Wood D-subminiature Gas metal arc welding Billiards Sail-plan Rosary Lawn mower Prayer beads Cello Sari Bookbinding Hangman's knot Necktie Lathe Radio controlled airplane Knife Undergarment Seismic retrofit Barbell (piercing) Switch Tatting Fishing Nylon Electric guitar Christmas tree Grommet Aluminium Textile Internal ballistics Clothing Tassel Piano Blasting cap Tire Escapology Drill bit Clinker (boat building) Mattress Glass Shotgun Dental brace Hand grenade Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Sewing machine Protection (climbing) Shoelaces Carbon nanotube Whip Disentanglement puzzle Chopsticks Plectrum Jute Yarn Barbed wire Basic English Glossary of firefighting equipment Hilt Wrench Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Soldering Guqin Punk rock Diving suit Lane Beehive (beekeeping) Suicide methods Nishi (Tribe) Carpet Fiberglass Applique RuneScape skills Jet (lignite) Reef knot Gramophone record IPod Avalanche
