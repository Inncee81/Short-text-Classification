does everyone get nervous are you nervous when you are about to fight my nerves have been playing up as when i train i get nervous i dont know if this is exitment or what ive been in quite a few mma bouts how do u keep ur nerves when u r on bottom when a person has a domintant postition i use to do well when on the bottom eg guard half guard but now i like being the more dominnant positions i get to nervous when im in guard how do i get rid of these nerves sorry for the long winded question but when pulling off a triangle do u like to raise ur hips thank u very much everyone feels threatened by this experience to some degree our biological makeup developed to help us survive enables the fight or flight reaction under stressful or threatening situations it's the resultant adrenaline that makes us all a little twitchy before a fight or match the first thing to do to deal with it is to be sure that you know you have prepared yourself if you have prepared by training and practice and are prepared your anxiety will less the other thing to do is that you need to understand that adrenaline is the cause of your butterflies and so on just accept it as nature's way of getting you psyched up for the coming endeavor and don't let it make you worry i use deep slow breathing this helps me this has always avoided me from freezing up due to nerves i use that little natural chemical edge to help you be sharp in a match weacher on bottom or the top position i always visualize the techniques i am going to do and remember how it felt the last time that i competed and won i go through all those emotions i visualized that information almost every night and it helps me sleep really well and prepared me for my matches what is cool is if you are royce gracie or matt hughes ect you aren't the alone here people who fight and train experience the same thing it's just the way we're built humbly posted devin willis Mixed martial arts Urinary incontinence Martial art Clinical depression Royce Gracie Post-traumatic stress disorder Panic attack Professional wrestling holds Tenshinhan Brain Stuttering The Contender (television series) Psychology Dog Lucid dreaming Fibromyalgia Agoraphobia Traumatic brain injury Multiple sclerosis Insulin Chronic fatigue syndrome Aikido Pain Ultimate Fighting Championship Insomnia Hypoglycemia Nervous system Avalanche Drowning Transactional analysis Kurt Angle Bondage (BDSM) Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Jon Secada Social rule Fecal incontinence Backstroke Action potential Childbirth Equine conformation Balance disorder Shaggy dog story Water (molecule) Epinephrine Coming of Age (TNG episode) Psychoanalysis Mattress Human brain Sleep Alexander Technique A Course In Miracles Immortality Swimming Scientology beliefs and practices Transsexuality Boxing Internal ballistics Dualism (philosophy of mind) Social psychology Charles Darwin's illness Psychosis EastEnders Theory of conduct Borderline personality disorder Decompression sickness Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Prostate cancer Soul Consciousness Grief Meditation Infantilism House of M Fast bowling Anorexia nervosa Neuron Sumo Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Welding Coffee Kazushi Sakuraba Jet engine WWE Unforgiven Mudvayne Seismic retrofit Hypnosis Autism Trish Stratus Conspiracy (TNG episode) Neurology Stopping power Psychotherapy Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man
