should i take up boxing or muay thai my main martial art is gracie ju jitsu and wrestling at my gym they also offer boxing and kick boxing classes do you think i should take up boxing or kickboxing for i only have enough money for one or the other for now also i have already taken years of tkd when i was younger and i can kick very well but i know muay thai is not like tkd wich would benefit me more do you think boxing is great for hand techniques many mma people cross train in boxing to increase their power and speed however boxing is also limit to that just hands mauy thai is also a popular stand up art in the mma world it would greatly supplement your jiujitsu right now because in addition to being able to fight on the ground you can box similar to a boxer but also have the advantage of devastating knees elbow and kicks also if you learn boxing st you might get too use to bobbing weaving slipping ducking which isnt used as much in thai boxing and western boxing because you have to worry about getting kneed kicked in the face while you are going down also boxers dont worry much about defending themselves below the waist because competing they dont get hit in the legs but a vital area thai boxers like to kick is to the legs which often leaves their opponent immobilized another thing you might like being a jiujitsu person is the clinch in muay thai in boxing the clinch is often use for a break when someone is tired they'll 'hug' the other person and the ref will break em up not so in thai boxing the clinch can be a dangerous position to be in because you can use your jiujitsu grappling skills to throw your opponent around and deliver some nasty knees yea tkd is quite different from thai boxing though the flexibility you gained through tkd can be beneficial tkd kicks are typically chambered kicks in which they snap from you knee and kick the target with your foot they are usually faster kicks than thai kicks however thai kicks come straight out with the power coming from the rotation of the hips and you kick with the shin instead of the foot they are often more powerful than tkd kicks being like getting hit by a baseball bat tkd and thai boxing stance are different too tkd has many types of kicks considered to many to be flashy and not practical in a real fight thai boxers main to kicks are the push front kick and the roundhouse some other kicks are used but these are the main ones i would suggest you doing muay thai and then later on if you want to focus on improving your punches go for boxing good luck http en wikipedia org wiki muay thai http www history com minisite do content type minisite generic content type id display order mini id Professional wrestling attacks Taekwondo Wing Chun Ultimate Fighting Championship Aikido Grappling Baseball Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Punch (strike) Fast bowling Eskrima Professional wrestling aerial techniques Chinese martial arts Professional wrestling throws Kick Royce Gracie Wushu Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Karate Tai Chi Chuan Glossary of American football Skateboarding trick Volleyball Aerial (dance move) Backstroke Softball Jeet Kune Do Naruto jutsu Wanderlei Silva Dog agility Judo Tenshinhan Savate Rugby union Weight training PRIDE Shawn Michaels Professional wrestling Tank Lightsaber combat Diving Butterfly stroke Vale tudo Professional wrestling match types Football (soccer) Stunt Swingout Hapkido Batting (cricket) Shoe Swimming Fencing Horse Pole vault Marching band Neckbreaker Professional wrestling slang Capoeira Muay Boran Piccolo Junior Saga Kyokugenryu Karate Water polo Muhammad Ali Welterweight Frank Mir Cleveland Browns Bruce Lee Terry Bogard Powerbomb Archery Cricket Field hockey Strap-on dildo Piledriver (professional wrestling) Boxing training Undergarment The Contender (television series) Charleston (dance move) Fighting Spirit Fist of the North Star Akuma (Street Fighter) Guilty Gear Isan
