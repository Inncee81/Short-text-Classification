can i just buy the cheaper upgrade version of office without having previous versions on my computer i have a new computer with a trial of office small business which is asking me if i want to buy the full version as either an upgrade or the new user version if have no previous versions installed but have the disks for office pro first question does qualify me for an upgrade price should i install it first second question will the upgrade potentionally not work without a previous version installed and if not what will happen will they attempt to collect the difference to the new user version or will i somehow just wind up getting the upgrade price your earlier version of office may do it because they software is in the same office family don't take any advice here unless you like taking risks the program does check for previous versions and it's all over rover if you don't have one ring microsoft on their hotline or visit an authorized microsoft dealer and ask them alternatively you could visit the office web site and look for upgrade info my guess would be no problem but i'm not forking out the bucks another option is to find a friend with a student card the academic version is probably half the price again Screenshot Macintosh Finder Multiple document interface AmigaOS History of the graphical user interface X Window System Opera (web browser) Taskbar Macromedia Flash Object Desktop Twm Google Desktop Embedded system Stardock Windows XP IBM PC compatible Computing minimalism System 6 Double-click (computing) Mouse (computing) Commodore 64 Menu (computing) Computer wallpaper AppleScript Hello world program Mozilla Firefox Microsoft Windows Tabbed document interface Blue screen of death System 7 (Macintosh) Desktop environment Python programming language Common User Access Palm OS SAS System Linux CPU design Mac OS X v10.4 Microsoft Paint OpenGL Apple Computer IPod Xerox Star Widget (computing) Window Maker Mac OS history Windows 1.0 Virtual memory X window manager Windows 2000 Screensaver Apple typography Virtual Network Computing Java programming language Tab (GUI) Apple IIGS Expos__ (Mac OS X) Pop-up ad Unicode Konqueror Minesweeper (computer game) X Window System protocols and architecture Favicon Option key Emacs MS-DOS Common Unix Printing System Icon (computing) IBM PC keyboard Start Menu Danger Hiptop Spam (electronic) GameFAQs Windows Vista Nintendo GameCube Graphical Environment Manager Uniform Resource Locator Prank flash Context menu Guitar The Fool's Errand Desktop computer Microsoft 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines MSN Messenger Ethernet Apple Macintosh Windows 3.x Linspire Windows 95 Mac OS X CPU cache MAC address Lisp programming language Color Kernel (computer science) Scheme programming language HTTP cookie DesktopX
