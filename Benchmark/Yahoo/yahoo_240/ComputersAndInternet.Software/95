what are standalone executables can i put more than one on a usb drive when i use the program does it leave any trace on the hard drive of the computer i use it on also what are the steps for installing one of these programs on a usb drive if there are any websites that explain how to do this please list them i'm not planning on doing anything dodgy but my parents have a computer that has a ton of spyware old programs misc junk on it i don't want to leave any extra crap on their system which is why i asked if anything was left on the hard drive a standalone executable is a file that doesn't need any other files to run it runs itself you can put as many as you want onto a usb drive which will need to be executed to run its not tracable on the comp that you use it on hope this helps and u aren't using this for anything dodgy Microsoft Office Copyright infringement of software Microsoft OpenOffice.org Computer virus Windows XP IBM PC compatible Microsoft Excel Microsoft PowerPoint Microsoft .NET Apple Computer Linux Operating system Trusted computing History of Microsoft Windows Windows Mobile Component Object Model ITunes Virtual memory Macromedia Flash GNU General Public License Software cracking Server Library (computer science) Linspire Common criticisms of Microsoft Open access DOS Kazaa Digital rights management Pocket PC Spyware Timeline of computing 1990-forward Emacs Warez Mozilla Firefox Stardock DESQview Skype OpenDocument Windows Vista Copyright Windows 2000 Xbox MP3 Java programming language Patch (computing) Windows Genuine Advantage WordPerfect Copyright infringement X Window System Microsoft Word Ebook HyperCard Windows API Browser wars Game programming Opera (web browser) DR-DOS MS-DOS Mac OS X Perl Peer-to-peer Open source culture Online music store Mac OS X v10.4 Copy protection Blue screen of death Website Computer software Bulletin board system Commodore 64 Windows 95 Portable Document Format GNU Web crawler Internet Explorer Windows Update Windows registry Richard Stallman United States v.
