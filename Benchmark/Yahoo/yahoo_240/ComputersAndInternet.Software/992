how do i edit the 'recently added' playlist in windows media player okay so it automatically adds my most recent items in the playlist but its still showing all my music and i added it all about a month ago i remember in the old media player being able to edit how long it keeps the recently added music in the playlist for but i cant find how to edit it have they removed the feature in media help appreciated switch to winamp no more playlist pain and confusion the only third party player that works well with vista got so put out with wmp that i switched to winamp which makes making and maintaining playlists way easier all i had to do was create a blank or open a playlist and add the files i wanted from my music collection and then to save in my opinion the winamp player that i use came with way more and a lot better visualizations than wmp hope this helps World Wide Web HyperCard Wget HyperText Transfer Protocol Object Desktop MAME Windows Vista Macromedia Flash Java programming language Kazaa File format Microsoft Commodore 64 H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Spyware Wireless Application Protocol BASIC programming language Web server Streaming media Common Unix Printing System ITunes MSN Messenger Portable Document Format AmigaOS ASCII art Warez OpenOffice.org XHTML Netscape Navigator Mozilla Firefox BitTorrent Windows XP Web browser Image OS/2 Xanga Gmail Lotus Notes GIF Ebook Interactive fiction KDE Mac OS X v10.4 Slash (punctuation) Musical Instrument Digital Interface Linux Online music store Podcasting RSS (file format) Web page Symbian OS Website Xbox Microsoft Office OpenBSD Palm OS Windows 3.x Wiki QuickTime PlayStation Portable XML Knoppix Mac OS X ITunes Music Store Web crawler America Online Gnutella ROM image PHP Emacs Flat file database Filename extension Scalable Vector Graphics Dictionary Disk magazine MIME Mozilla Application Suite Graphics ZX Spectrum HTML AOL Instant Messenger Microsoft Windows Tux Paint IBM PC compatible Computer Teletext Sega Dreamcast MP3 Representational State Transfer Unix Patricia Ford Atari 8-bit family Logo programming language TeX PLATO Cable television Windows 2000 StarCraft Secret Missions Patch (computing) WebDAV
