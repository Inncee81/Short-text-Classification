looking for a good free linux version for kids that can run without a hard drive my niece other uncle on her father side gave her old computer it doesn't run but thats not the reason i ask i have a smaller old internet computer that i feel will be better for her as i am her mother's bother and it has a less energy drain then the old dell has my niece is only five years old and all she needs it for is playing games and doing pre school work or something the linux version should run from a cd so it must be a small installation it also should be kid friendly ubuntu i would like as it is nice and it has the look and feel of windows but its to large for a cd maybe several cds or a live dvd but not a cd the computer had a linux based cd but it got loss down the line and it was old so anything that will run on a cd that easy to install first off because i tried to use damn small but i didn't understand the installation process thank you basilb for clearifing i thought mr micro was misspelling ubuntu i like the suggestion of edubuntu but it is a big download install and livecd will slow the computer down i would suggest an install of edubuntu or puppy linux under mb maybe you could splash out on a ide compact flash card puppy linux is never truly installed it just moves files from the disk flash drive to the ram it needs mb i think or else a hdd for virtual memory edit ubuntu kubuntu edubuntu xubuntu are all availabl on a single dvd which would be alot faster than a mb download but i don't think edubuntu is available on cd Computer virus Pretty Good Privacy Public domain Domain Name System AmigaOS Gmail Object Desktop System 7 (Macintosh) E-mail Free software Common Unix Printing System Spyware Mozilla Firefox Commodore 64 OpenOffice.org Computer software Whois Open access HTML Bulletin board system Library (computer science) Shareware History of Microsoft Windows Unix Linux Birthday KDE Portable Document Format Stardock X Window System File Allocation Table IBM PC compatible Stopping e-mail abuse NTFS Macromedia Flash GNOME Apple II family WebDAV BitTorrent MS-DOS Windows XP Microsoft Office History of the graphical user interface ITunes ASCII art Btrieve Atari ST Microsoft Windows File format Copy protection Lotus Notes Freeware OS/2 FidoNet Mozilla Application Suite Opera (web browser) Operating system Anonymous remailer Computer ZIP (file format) Open-source software OpenGL Wi-Fi Copyright infringement of software Webmail Mach kernel Component Object Model Wget Commodore 1541 Free Software Foundation WordPerfect Python programming language Wireless Application Protocol USB flash drive Mac OS X Usenet Filename extension DOS Proxy server Ajax (programming) IPod Apple Macintosh E-mail spam Apache Software Foundation Public key infrastructure Floppy disk Uniform Resource Locator Commodore DOS Ebook Windows registry Google Genealogy TRS-80 Hotmail Open Directory Project Denial-of-service attack Newline Copyright Unicode
