norton is it unflushable belarc advisor reports that i have norton internet security realtime file scanning on belarc's capitals but i uninstalled nis following dissatisfaction with both the product and the pricing policy i use zone alarm security suite now which belarc correctly detects i used norton's removal tool then deleted a dozen or so directories which included norton or symantec in their name there remain a score of entries in the registry which i am loathe to tamper with can anyone point me to a site which might boost my confidence i don't want to use a registry cleaner it's a question of trust or control i suppose norton joins aol realplayer and stella artois in the list of things which ought not to be allowed in contact with a pc when you uninstall norton it makes the bad assumption that you will be reinstalling it sooner or later and thus leaves a large amount of content on your computer i wouldn't worry about the registry so much just delete the directories that are in your program files folder the registry is just one of those things that becomes more and more like a graveyard for uninstalled programs as you use your computer only way to really deal with it is backing up what you want and reformatting alot of computer experts reccommend doing this every years or so anyway Gmail HTTP cookie Opera (web browser) MSN Messenger BitTorrent Windows XP Jabber NTFS Apache HTTP Server Streaming media Windows Server 2003 Mozilla Firefox MP3 Webmail IPod Google Scalable Vector Graphics Apple Computer File format GIF Files-11 Windows 2000 Virtual memory E-mail Unix Windows Vista Proxy server Tagged Image File Format Ajax (programming) Hotmail File system ITunes Concurrent Versions System Linux Spyware JavaServer Pages XML Python programming language Portable Document Format Base64 Macromedia Flash Internet Oracle database Apple II family USB flash drive Online music store Database Google Talk Wget Electronic commerce File Transfer Protocol GNU HyperText Transfer Protocol Federal Standard 1037C Secure Shell Hard disk Microsoft Microsoft Windows Konqueror Microsoft .NET Wiki Comparison of file systems Commodore 64 Sun Microsystems Unicode Internet censorship in mainland China Emacs Computer file Digital audio player User agent PHP Server E-mail spam Web browser Session Initiation Protocol Common Unix Printing System Open source culture FairPlay File sharing Sega Dreamcast Google search Newline Computer storage Skype Delta encoding Early IBM disk storage Stardock Disk image Palm OS Flash memory Btrieve Password cracking Windows API Windows Mobile TikiWiki DVD Freenet ICalendar
