bit torrent problem i've downloaded torrents using azureus vuse but when its completed and i try to play it using windows media player the whole picture is upside down the quality is good but its just the wrong way up does anyone know how to fix this thanx for your help ive personally seen this problem before im assuming that you are trying to play either a divx or an xvid avi file movie file if you are then i would suggest that you download the divx player or xvid player because with those you also get the codecs codecs are either audio or video decompression files that will allow your video to be played properly i think this will help xvid player http www xvidmovies com players divx player http www divx com however if none of these work then probably you need to find a program like g spot with it you run your movie through the program and it will tell you if you have the necessary codecs installed on your computer to properly play the movie or not if not it will tell you which ones your missing so you can download them maybe that helps Windows XP Disk image Computer virus Windows 2000 Backup Floppy disk Linux Hard disk DVD Macromedia Flash Windows Vista Digital rights management Modchip Copy protection MP3 Digital photography ISO image Redundant array of independent disks H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Screenshot IPod File system NTFS Virtual memory Year 2000 problem Xbox Cache BitTorrent Knoppix Computer security Forth programming language Apple II family Mandriva Linux USB flash drive ITunes Partition (computing) Spyware Universal Disk Format BASIC programming language PlayStation 2 MAME AmigaOS OpenBSD Windows Server 2003 Apple Computer IBM PC ZX Spectrum Commodore 64 PNG QuickTime Rootkit DAEMON Tools WordStar Pretty Good Privacy PlayStation Portable C plus plus CPU cache Malware Apple Macintosh Windows Me Napster SUSE Linux Unicode Blue screen of death Bootable business card Disk cloning Emacs History of Microsoft Windows OpenDocument IBM PC compatible StarCraft Secret Missions ROM image PaX Debugging Podcasting Streaming media Macintosh Finder Microsoft Windows Microsoft .NET VMware Object Desktop Stardock Anti-virus software Data recovery Kazaa Digital video recorder DragonFly BSD Computer Computer forensics MS-DOS FreeDOS IA-32 Disk magazine
