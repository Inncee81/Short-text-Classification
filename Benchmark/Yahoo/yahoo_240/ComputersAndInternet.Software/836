can you activate windows xp after you've ignored the nag screens i bought my teenaged son a used laptop i bought windows xp and installed it he apparently ignored the nag screen that came up reminding him to activate his copy of xp now it has expired and he cannot sign on to the system since it won't let him into windows there is no way to connect to the internet to activate it at least that's what it looks like any way to activate now or am i going to have to reinstall i don't want to do that the internet activation has long ben disabled the only way to activate xp is via phone theres a tab for that that will give you a toll free number QuickTime Video codec Streaming media Macromedia Flash Video CD Warez MP3 Super Video CD Apple Computer H.264/MPEG-4 AVC ITunes DivX Digital rights management World Wide Web Windows XP Windows Vista Comparison of media players PlayStation Portable Media Player Classic High-definition television Web browser Internet pornography Common Unix Printing System Mac OS X v10.4 Xbox 360 IPod ATI Technologies HyperText Transfer Protocol AVI Digital video recorder HTTP cookie Digital camera System 7 (Macintosh) Theora HyperCard Mac OS X DirectShow Internet ASCII art Trillian (instant messenger) MPlayer ITunes Music Store XviD Musical Instrument Digital Interface Radeon Gmail Ogg Winamp Web crawler ILife Windows Media Video FFmpeg IBM PC compatible AmigaOS Podcasting Uniform Resource Locator Ajax (programming) Blu-ray Disc BitTorrent File format History of Microsoft Windows Creative Zen Secure Shell Microsoft Jon Lech Johansen Copy protection Wiki SAS System Ebook Windows Mobile Xbox Disk image Vaporware PlayStation 2 Windows Media Player Web server IMac Computer and video games Ripping JavaScript DVD player HTML MSN Messenger Hello world program Machinima Iriver Mozilla Firefox Graphics processing unit Enterprise content management
