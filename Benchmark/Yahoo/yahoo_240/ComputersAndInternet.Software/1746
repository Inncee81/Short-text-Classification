should i backup my mac before i run boot camp on apple's boot camp software it tells me to backup my mac now i don't know if this is mandatory or not has anyone had any problems with boot camp and installing vista on a mac if so please answer i have tried it and it worked fantastic i bet the only thing that they are worried about is that when you install and use vista and hook it up to the internet you could get viruses which would attack your data so when you install vista make sure you have a antivirus program ready to install that's probably the only reason why they want you to back it up vista has a lot of viruses ps you're never save so a backup of important files would be smart BitTorrent Macromedia Flash Mozilla Firefox Spyware Linux distribution Kazaa Azureus PHP Uploading and downloading Google Desktop Peer-to-peer CPAN Google Dictionary Wget Gmail Suprnova.org Google Video Uniform Resource Locator Anti-virus software OpenOffice.org Pretty Good Privacy Macintosh Finder Knoppix Download manager Perl Domain Name System Linspire Windows XP GIF Computer virus Web crawler Mac OS X Windows Vista Microsoft Office ITunes Halo: Combat Evolved Microsoft Windows Opera (web browser) IPod Minesweeper (computer game) Internet Relay Chat EDonkey2000 Object Desktop Portable Document Format Malware Website Filename extension Mandriva Linux Windows Mobile EMule Kademlia Linux HyperCard Typosquatting Forth programming language Windows registry StarOffice QuickTime Pop-up ad LimeWire Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Windows 2000 Option key File-sharing program Click fraud MSN Messenger Search engine optimization Microsoft .NET Dialer Internet Explorer GNOME USB flash drive Web traffic File format NPAPI Package management system Online music store P__li File sharing Mozilla Application Suite AdSense Visual Basic .NET Yahoo!
