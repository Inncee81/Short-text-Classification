firefox alpha i want to try out the firefox alpha v but ive never tried a non finished version of anything so i was wondering what should i do differently with it and what are the risks of using it more answers the better thanks sooooo much d first alpha software tends to be buggier than beta so expect a rocky ride in fact i would keep another browser even ie warmed up and ready to be pressed into service if ff really goes south and is unusable unlikely but possible people who do alpha and beta testing regularly won't install such software on any mission critical machines beyond that it can be frustrating but fun to know you took part in it the mozilla people will expect you to report bugs or anomalies to them probably via bugzilla which is an experience all its own try to have fun Adobe Photoshop IPhoto Microsoft Office GIMP GIF Game programmer Fark.com PNG Internet phenomenon Photoshop contest Tourist guy Something Awful Paint Shop Pro Uploading and downloading Finale notation program Goatse.cx Warez Avatar (virtual reality) Chess Digital image editing Trademark Photoshopping Something Awful Forums Spyware Nude celebrities on the Internet IPod photo Bulletin board system Adobe Systems ITunes Microsoft .NET Video on demand IPod Web crawler Kazaa Podcasting Playboy (magazine) Download manager Online casino Favicon JavaScript Dialer Graphics MIRC Pornography Internet fraud Product activation Good Times CNET Software art Online service provider Tux Paint QBasic PlayStation Portable The Internet Movie Database ImageMagick Microsoft Windows Adobe Illustrator Every time you masturbate___ God kills a kitten Object Desktop Google Desktop Bert is Evil Pretty Good Privacy B3ta Bryce Outlook Express Nintendo DS ReplayTV Internet pornography Dave Matthews Band Software cracking 4chan Napster Child pornography Online music store Macromedia Flash Java programming language User agent Bbc.co.uk Internet service provider Computer science Computer virus Weekly newspaper File sharing E-mail art Advanced Packaging Tool Internet Skype Internet Explorer Extreme Programming Plugin Microsoft AntiSpyware Weezer Computer and video games Abandonware Attack of the Show!
