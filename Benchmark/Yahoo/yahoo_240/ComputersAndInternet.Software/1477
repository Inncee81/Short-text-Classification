acdsee pro or photoshop i have received both software programs but haven't used acdsee pro yet i was wondering which of these two programs people prefer since i have both programs already pricing isn't really a factor in this decision it seems that pricing is the main reason people like picasa over acdsee also viewing organizing isn't really a factor either thank you if you just need a viewer with some options to corect photos get acd but if you need to do complex enhancements of photos you'll need photoshop sooner or later Object Desktop Windows XP Taskbar Multiple document interface Screenshot Mozilla Firefox Windows Mobile Internet Explorer Stardock Google Desktop IPod History of the graphical user interface The Sims 2 International Phonetic Alphabet ITunes Windows API World of Warcraft Pretty Good Privacy Windows Media Player Macromedia Flash Dance Dance Revolution Windows Me Component Object Model Halo 2 Computing minimalism Comparison of media players Opera (web browser) Pop-up ad Google Talk Computer virus Windows 95 Tabbed document interface Minesweeper (computer game) AOL Instant Messenger Web design IBM PC compatible QuickTime Gmail Spyware File system Double bass Mach kernel DVD Virtual memory Microsoft Windows Windows Media Video NPAPI Halo: Combat Evolved Digital audio player Windows 2000 X Window System Windows Vista Mouse (computing) Visual Basic Windows Media Audio MapleStory Mozilla Application Suite Java programming language Server Blue screen of death ITunes Music Store SimCity 2000 Windows CE System 7 (Macintosh) Visual Basic .NET Vorbis Library (computer science) Artificial neural network GunZ The Duel Apple Macintosh SonicStage Unicode NX bit Transmission Control Protocol Smalltalk Arianne Macintosh Finder In The Groove (game) History of Microsoft Windows The 7th Guest Microsoft Paint Quake RuneScape cheats The Sims Doom 3 RealPlayer Lisp programming language Flat file database Windows Server 2003 Kazaa Wine (software) Hello world program AmigaOS Konqueror Noam Chomsky OmniWeb FreeCell
