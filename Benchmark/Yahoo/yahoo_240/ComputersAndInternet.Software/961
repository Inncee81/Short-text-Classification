if you are asked to fill out a job application online is there anyway to actually type on the document i am applying for a job with a school district and have downloaded its job application from a pdf file i was wondering if there is anyway to actually type on the document before printing it it would look so much more professional than a handwritten application if there is no way to actually type in the information on the district's word doc is there anyway i could create one that i could type on that looks exactly like theirs hi you're thinking smart it's much better when the application is computer typed than hand written there are ways how you can do this open the pdf file click ctrl a than open a new word document and paste everything if everything is displayed correctly try typing over print the document scan it and save it as a picture than you can just simply type over it using any image editing software if you still can't do it send me an e mail and i'll gladly do it for you Mandriva Linux Ubuntu Linux Linux distribution LiveCD Knoppix File Allocation Table NTFS Partition (computing) SUSE Linux Booting Windows XP Microsoft Windows AmigaOS File system Windows Vista Dual boot Virtual memory Hard disk Blue screen of death Debian GNOME Operating system Common Unix Printing System IBM PC compatible Disk cloning Mac OS X Mozilla Firefox Slackware MS-DOS DragonFly BSD OpenBSD System 7 (Macintosh) History of Microsoft Windows Red Hat Linux Windows Server 2003 Xandros BIOS IPod Puppy Linux Computer virus Btrieve Object Desktop OS/2 Windows registry PlayStation 2 Expansion Bay X Window System Gmail DOS Opera (web browser) FreeBSD Bluetooth USB flash drive Linspire Commodore 64 PaX Screenshot Cooperative Linux Wget NTLDR Unix Linux kernel 64-bit Library (computer science) ReiserFS Symbian OS QEMU Wi-Fi Windows 3.x OpenOffice.org Ghost (software) ReactOS Perl Sharp Zaurus Boot image Buffer overflow MAME Forth programming language Spyware History of the graphical user interface Bootable business card PlayStation 2 Microprocessor MDAC Windows 95 OpenGL Files-11 Windows Me Modem MSN Messenger Xbox Architecture of Windows 2000 Pocket PC OpenVMS
