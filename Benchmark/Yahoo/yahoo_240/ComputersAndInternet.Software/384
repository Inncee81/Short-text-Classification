computer trouble well i have this toy that records audio and video and puts it on a sd card well i wanted to put it on my computer and when i put the card in the card slot the audio is not mp but a werid tvm file and i was wondering how to make that into a mp or any other music file or a program that plays them note i would like the programs to be freeware if not thats ok i'm not an expert so i did some research my best guess is the tvm file stands for television media this link is pretty much all i could find http filext com file extension tvm there's another tvm tvm exe that's used by advertisers to monitor viewer habits spyware and if found on a computer it's recommended that it be removed http www processlibrary com directory files tvm source oldpathfiles showid dir t the usual way to change one file format to another is to use a media converting software some are commercially available like blaze http www blazemp com and some are free like media convert http media convert com but in looking through a couple of programs i could not find any that offered a conversion of tvm files that's not to say there aren't any available it just might take a while to find a suitable program these sites specialize in freeware and shareware programs you might find something at one of them http www majorgeeks com http www sourceforge net http www download com http www softpedia com http www snapfiles com http www sofotex com http www tucows com wwbgd BitTorrent Azureus Peer-to-peer Gnutella Kademlia I2P Suprnova.org Linux EMule EDonkey2000 Modem Spyware Router MDAC Java programming language Streaming media Distributed hash table Python programming language File-sharing program Exeem Linux distribution Internet censorship in mainland China Cisco Systems Wiki Windows Server 2003 Eclipse (computing) Logic Gmail File Transfer Protocol Windows Vista Magnet link Voice over IP Knoppix Windows XP Netfilter/iptables Skype Denial-of-service attack Warez Milton H.
