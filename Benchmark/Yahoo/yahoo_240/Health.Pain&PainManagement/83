pain in my shins i am currently going through a days for football and whenever i run especially when we condition my shins hurt like crazy its not the front of the shins so i don't think its shin splints but i don't know the pain from the bottom of my calf to the ankle i have it on both legs and on both the pain is only on the of the legs not the front or outside once again it hurts between the ankle to the calf i was wondering if anyone knows anything about this what it is or what i can do about it the area you are describing is where muscles in your calf come together and form a common tendon gastrocnemius and soleus the tendon travels down and connects to the back of your heel you need to make sure you are stretching both of these muscles here is a link that shows good pictures of how to stretch both of these muscles http www halhigdon com ktraining stretch htm the difference between the two is that the soleus muscle does not cross the knee joint so by bending your knee you are isolating the fibers of it i would say to try these out and hold each for at least to seconds and do a couple on each side hope this helps Soleus muscle Professional wrestling holds Achilles' tendon Equine conformation Tibia Professional wrestling attacks Fibula Anterior cruciate ligament Running Professional wrestling throws Stretching Glossary of ballet terms Aerial (dance move) Massage Carpal tunnel syndrome Muscle Horse Shin splints Pain Clean and jerk Scapula Suplex Tendon Humerus Greg Valentine Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Knee Osteoarthritis Biped Hand Squat (exercise) High-heeled shoe Hogtie bondage Repetitive strain injury Fecal incontinence Iliotibial band syndrome Diving Punt (boat) Casualty lifting Swimming Elbow-joint Duchenne muscular dystrophy Backstroke Snowboard Anatomical terms of location Cramp Skateboarding trick Fast bowling Tai Chi Chuan Decompression sickness Chondromalacia patellae Sciatica Becker's muscular dystrophy Orthopedic surgery Abdomen Metacarpus Marching band Professional wrestling aerial techniques Professional wrestling slang Tonic vibration reflex Bicycle Muay Thai Supraspinatus muscle Goaltender Ulna Contortion Aikido Horizontal bar Cello Club foot Figure skating Swingout Front crawl Kurt Angle HyperText Transfer Protocol Jon Secada Charleston (dance move) Radius (bone) Spanking Eye First aid Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Stone Cold Steve Austin Neckbreaker Glossary of partner dance terms Sport rowing Powerbomb Trousers Tetrapod Exercise Arm Strap-on dildo Parade (military) Marathon (sport) Cheerleading Brian Close Chair Evolution of the Horse Diabetic neuropathy
