how do i stop being scared of needles i hate shots and blood tests since i'm kind of young i'm going to have to have them all my life is there any way to stop being scared please help i used to be the same way i'd actually go into a near passed out state happened to me many many times but then i learned that if i focused on something else like say pretending i was playing soccer or fighting someone it really helped out just remember too getting a shot or your blood drawn won't kill you also it helps if you don't look and forwarn the doctor you may puke or pass out they usually let you lay down and its much better if you do black out nothing happens they give you some smelling salts the shot is just a small prick and if youare like me you prob kept thinking about how all this blood may or may not supernaturally squirt all over the place and you could die thats what i used to think or imagine but this cannot happen so i say just suck it up and focus on something else you could bring an ipod and listen to some music Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an YuYu Hakusho Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sin City John F.
