back brace im parents paid grand for my backbrace i got it today i refuse to sleep with it on it uncomfortable i only wear it at night i have scoliosis it getting bad if i wear it it will help my back my mom says i have to wear it she checks on me every hour to make sure i have it on well im in my room and i dont have my back brace on if i dont wear it i need surgery help its not comfy im not wearing it i guess my parents wasted their money the doctor said wear it i tried sleeping with it for three hours and i cant sleep so im sneaking and taking it off i dont care about my backaches oh gosh i know it hurts and it is really uncomfortable but think about it would your parents do anything to hurt you let alone spend if you didn't absolutely need this it's kinda hard for you to see the big picture right now but all of this is for a better future for you why don't you try a compromise for a few days and work out some sort of schedule where you can wear it for awhile but after a honest try of falling asleep then you can remove it if you didn't after a few days of trying i bet it will become easier but you have to have an open mind maybe you can take a mild pain reliever for a few night to help believe me when i tell you the hardest thing for a mother to see is her child in any sort of pain or discomfort so your mom isn't just being mean or bossy don't make it harder on her than it already is she is just looking out for your future Carpal tunnel syndrome Theory of conduct The Catcher in the Rye Fecal incontinence Pitaten Kurt Cobain Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma The Shining (film) Urinary incontinence Milton H.
