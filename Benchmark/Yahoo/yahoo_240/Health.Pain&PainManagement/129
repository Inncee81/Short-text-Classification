why does my right shoulder hurt so bad my right shoulder staring hurting about weeks ago it happened at work while lifting heavy objects over my head at first my shoulder hurt and was really stiff i also have trouble sleeping on it at night i went to the doctor he said probably just a strain and ordered physical therapy and naproxen x a day physical therapy relieved stiffness but pain is still there actually it's spreading it started out just deep in my shoulder now it's radiating down my arm in between my shoulder blades and even alittle in my neck also hands have been feeling weird i also can't move my right arm across my body to my other shoulder it feels like it's stuck and can't move no farther sometimes you can force it alittle other times you can't now my other shoulder is starting same thing i've had a mri but doctor says it showed nothing he told me it may just be something that i have to learn to deal with both the shoulder and the neck can refer pain into the arm and hand if you've had an actual worsening of the symptoms i'd start looking into a problem in the neck which may still require physical therapy but directed at the neck the fact that the pain is spreading and also going into the shoulder blade may very well indicate such a problem it sounds like you've have had an mri on the shoulder which should rule out any soft tissue problems in the shoulder such as a rotator cuff tear it may be time for one on the neck Prostate cancer Equine conformation Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Traumatic brain injury Professional wrestling holds Diving Radiation therapy Rotator cuff tear Syringomyelia Casualty lifting Magnetic resonance imaging Carpal tunnel syndrome Medicine Massage Cancer Humerus Reflexology Shoulder Professional wrestling throws Aerial (dance move) The Shining (film) Fibromyalgia Urinary incontinence Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Scoliosis Osteoarthritis Psoriasis Milton H.
