stitches vs staples in abdominal surgery opinion if you've had both i am only interested in the opinion of those who have had both not to be prude which would you choose again if you could staples or stitches and why i am going in for a second c section and would like other peoples opinions on the choice thank you for your time i had two caesareans stitches the first time and staples the second time i also had a hysterectomy years later and had staples with that i would go with staples the stitches have to be pulled out and they don't come out as smoothly as the staples so they hurt a lot also it's faster to put staples in and to remove them and i had no pain whatsoever when they were removed Hysterectomy Caesarean section Gynaecology Staple (fastener) Endometrial cancer Scoliosis Childbirth Bookbinding Endometriosis Prostate cancer Adjustable gastric band Ectopic pregnancy Breech birth Stomach cancer Stitch (Lilo & Stitch) Knitting Ovarian cancer Stapler Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Theory of conduct Intersex surgery Textile manufacturing terminology Blue Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Overkill (band) Intact dilation and extraction Fecal incontinence Breastfeeding Lilo & Stitch: The Series Surgery Tefillin Lilo & Stitch Mattress Tommy Lasorda Overhead lines Obesity Computed tomography Shaggy dog story Bread Sex reassignment surgery female-to-male Chick Hearn Sewing machine Humphrey Bogart Epidural Abortion Suture Punk ideology Abortion debate Kim Possible Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Equine conformation Skin graft Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch Have I Got News For You Professional wrestling holds Obstetrics Baseball (object) Uterine fibroids R.E.M.
