lyrica does it work on an as needed basis i've recently been prescribed lyrica for fibromyalgia after taking it for weeks i experienced major swelling especially in feet in legs therefore i've stopped taking the medication as prescribed yesterday i was having sharp nerve pain in hip with nothing else to take i took one capsule before bedtime and the pain has subsided will this medication work on an as needed basis or does it need to build up in your system i take mg of lyrica times a day for sciatica pain caused by a herniated disc at l l it can be taken on an as needed basis though i know this because it makes me very drowsy sometimes and if i have something important to do i won't take it so to make a long story short it does not have to build up a level in your system to work Sciatica Sleep Chronic fatigue syndrome Diazepam Clinical depression Acupuncture Gout Pain Intervertebral disc Medical prescription Paget's disease of bone Prostate cancer Migraine Traumatic brain injury Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Osteoarthritis Back pain Doxepin Intracranial pressure Apollo 8 Psoriasis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Fecal incontinence Trimipramine Urinary incontinence Kidney Maprotiline Narcolepsy First aid COX-2 inhibitor Wisdom teeth Equine conformation Childbirth Addiction Antidepressant Paroxetine Iliotibial band syndrome Venlafaxine Carpal tunnel syndrome Epidural Chlorpromazine Multiple sclerosis Cellulitis Local anesthesia Dyspareunia Poliomyelitis Clomipramine Spina bifida Group A streptococcal infection Neurosurgery Stomach cancer Methylphenidate Orgasm Pharmaceutical company Mouth ulcer Penis Weight training Scientology beliefs and practices Growth hormone treatment Gastroesophageal reflux disease Recumbent bicycle Milton H.
