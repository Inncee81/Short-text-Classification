help back pain been having it for about yrs now at first it was light pain now its become really bad it hurts when i stand sit lie down or sleep on a different mattress i suspect the primary cause for my pain is yrs of carrying heavy books throughout highschool i tried to avoid it but in one of my schools they never even had any lockers so hear i am only yrs old my back is killing me i've told my physicians about it they've done x rays found nothing well it still hurts it gets worse worse my doctors aren't even being helpful everytime i see them cause they ignore it they assume that just because my x rays haven't shown anything that there's no problem now i' m really stuck in a rut because i was supposed to get an mri done on my back but my mom i have a real bad relationship she's my sole financial provider she's refused to spend any money on my back problems so i can't even see i doctor about it when i want to or have any further diagnosti cs because i have no money what should i do does anyone have any solution as to what could rid of my back ailments should i try seeing a chiropractor do they help if i tried to get state insurance or medicare or something would that cover my expenses i m sorry you have back problem here s some info that might be helpful from what you described it could very well be that you have a problem with you l and l discs the x ray was a waste if there is a problem and based on your pain i say there is only an mri will show the exact cause you can go to any public hospital in the states and say you don t have any insurance and that your back hurts to the point that you can hardly walk and you re afraid of becoming paralyzed the hospital will have you fill out forms lots of them and may have you wait in the waiting room for a long time hours is common in los angeles county hospital having said all that let s focus on the cure surgery should be your last resort and this decision should be made carefully in conjunction with your doctor besides surgery that doesn t always work but with the advancement in medicine in becoming more and more an acceptable alternative you can still do things that can ease your pain you need to strengthen your abdominal muscles and your back muscles through low impact exercises and very important when you are feeling well and not suffering from back pain don t take it for granted don t make moves that would suddenly make your back act up as an example always use your knees to pick things up and never bend your back to end this answer the pain you experience is mainly due to your l and l discs they can be herniated in simple terms the discs are inflamed swollen and there is a gap between them this displacement along with the fact that they re inflamed pushes the ultra sensitive nerve around your spine and that s why you feel the pain please take care of yourself and have the patience to go to a county hospital and get the mri as you grow older your back can get worse so take care of yourself while you can you will be happy you did best wishes Chiropractic Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Urinary incontinence Health insurance Prostate cancer Medicare (Canada) Chronic fatigue syndrome Theory of conduct Publicly funded medicine Babe Ruth Osteoarthritis Weight training Back pain Fecal incontinence Stomach cancer Osteopathy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Milton H.
