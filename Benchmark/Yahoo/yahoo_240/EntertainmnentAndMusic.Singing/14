singing problem ok well i love singing ad music and my goal is to create an album of all my songs the only problem is i dont like my own voice i think my music and lyrics are fine just my voice what should i do i already take singing lessons i'm a music education voice major the hartt school of music in connecticut something they teach us is that everyone can sing the problem with that is we psych ourselves into thinking we are bad singers just because you don't like the sound of your voice doesn't mean you don't sound good i can speak from experience i never like the sound of my own voice on a recording but i continue to do it so i can get used to the sound of my own voice i encourage you to bring this question to you voice teacher if you are in lessons and play something you recorded to your teacher odds are they will say it is an accurate representation of your voice and that you are being your own harshest critic with singing we are our own worst enemies the best we can do is smile and continue to let the music take us on a ride sing and be proud that you are doing it Time Out of Mind Garth Brooks Roy Orbison Carpenters The Ashlee Simpson Show The Jazz Singer Leonard Cohen Past teachings of Prem Rawat Joni Mitchell Faye Wong Tom Waits 10cc The Band Journey (band) Avenue Q Blood on the Tracks Shot of Love The Emancipation of Mimi Drama Juliana Hatfield Pet Sounds Milli Vanilli Songwriter The Beach Boys American Pie (song) Roxette Alexander Technique Slow Train Coming Mariah Carey Love and Theft Real Love (song) Ray Charles Rich Mullins Grunge music Unreleased Madonna songs Infidels Bohemian Rhapsody Peter Gabriel Aladdin (1992 film) Ella Fitzgerald Najwa Karam Street-Legal Bon Jovi Waylon Jennings Madonna (entertainer) Bee Gees Daryl Hall The Basement Tapes James Brown (musician) Throat singing The Velvet Underground Hey Jude Jim Steinman The Isley Brothers Shaggy dog story BoA Heavy metal music Blonde on Blonde Therion (band) Stuttering Hip hop music Usher (entertainer) Ministry (band) Country music Smile (album) Minnie Riperton Kylie Minogue Suzuki method Lata Mangeshkar Styx (band) Bringing It All Back Home Non-native pronunciations of English Bonnie Tyler Mixtape Petra (band) Randy Newman Hall & Oates Social rule C__line Dion Ringo Starr Jon Secada Joy Division (band) Gospel music Autobiography (Ashlee Simpson album) Whitney Houston Yoko Ono Brian Jones (musician) Merle Haggard Kraftwerk Music Sonic Youth Qawwali Mary Wells The Wall Whose Line Is It Anyway?
