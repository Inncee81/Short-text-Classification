anyone use skype for regular home phone use i was checking out the site and saw that you can get unlimited calling in the us canada for per year which works out to less than per month sounds like a good deal but i'd love to hear from people who use it what are the disadvantages can you keep your same phone number when switching or are you assigned a new one and any comments about what you like dislike about it would be great thanks is for out calling you would still need to purchace an in phone number and voicemail if you want people to call you from regular phone lines all in all it still comes out to less then a year that equals about months service for the next cheapest service i have the ata phone adapter so i can use my regular house phone connected to the skype there is a slight learning curve to use the service when you first start but for the amount of savings i think that it i worth it for residential as long as you have a cell for back up most skype phones require your pc to stay on there are some wifi phones that you can use with skype that dosent require your pc to be connected so if you need to shut down or reboot your pc your phone will not work untill the pc is powered back up hopefully you are not doing any updates to your pc or your pc dosent crash while you are on the phone skype is not yet at a point that i would recommend it for business lines but for residential it is a great service for the price skype is not compatible with fax machines or dial up networking if this is something you are intrested in or need then check vonage or some other voip provider not a softphone like skype Skype 9-1-1 Telephone numbering plan Private branch exchange Telephone Phreaking UK telephone numbering plan North American Numbering Plan Telephone number Wi-Fi Modem Caller ID GSM services Broadband Internet access Bluetooth Enhanced 911 Telephone exchange IP Multimedia Subsystem Virgin Mobile Telkom Mobile phone Windows 2000 Windows XP Digital Subscriber Line Integrated Services Digital Network Telegraphy Session Initiation Protocol WiMAX Q-Telecom 555 telephone number Television Telephone tapping Internet Dual-tone multi-frequency ITU-T Emergency telephone number Universal Serial Bus Call centre FidoNet Network Switching Subsystem Short message service Predictive dialer HomePNA Surveillance Global System for Mobile Communications Sprint Nextel Corporation Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Cellular network Eircom Vertical service code Verizon Wireless Etisalat Japanese mobile phone culture Data retention IiNet AT&T BlackBerry Podcasting Rogers Telecom Web crawler TransUnion Redundant array of independent disks General Packet Radio Service Gmail E.164 Trillian (instant messenger) Social software Toll-free telephone number Hard disk Public Switched Telephone Network Pocket PC Spam (electronic) NorthwesTel T-Mobile Musical Instrument Digital Interface MSN Messenger Rogers Communications Federal Standard 1037C 2003 North America blackout Telephone call Enterprise content management Phone fraud Instant messaging Area code 905 ZX Spectrum Cable television NSA encryption systems CompuServe Radio Filling station Universal Mobile Telecommunications System IPod Octopus card IP address Network effect Dialer Bay Area Rapid Transit Microeconomics Electronic Numbering
