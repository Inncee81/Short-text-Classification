i have a ghz digital chordless phone set from radio shack and i just moved but the phone's don't work why does it not work in the new phone jack at my new house i plug the base phone in in the phone jack in my room and i press talk to check if it has a dial tone but there's nothing the dial tone works when i plug in another non chordless phone i have in the same jack and also worked fine at my old house what's the problem and how do i fix it the handset is probably on a different channel than the base either place it on the base like you are charging for a few minutes or if you see a 'channel' button on the base or headset press that it happens a lot when moving you just have to get both units on the same channel if you still have the book check on 'synchronizing' channels by going to the base a few times mine always worked fine i assume the battery is well charged on the handset sometimes just unplugging the base unit helps too good luck Modem Telephone exchange Mobile phone GSM services Cordless telephone IPod Telephone numbering plan Xbox 360 Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Global System for Mobile Communications Mobile phone radiation and health Phreaking Vertical service code Key telephone system Clock Remote control IS-95 Voice over IP Tungsten Handheld Nordic Mobile Telephone Musical Instrument Digital Interface Television Headphones Podcasting Telephone tapping Radio clock Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Treo 650 Push to talk Radio Verizon Wireless Radiotelephone Network Switching Subsystem Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications Apple Newton Danger Hiptop Oscilloscope Sprint Nextel Corporation Federal Standard 1037C 9-1-1 24 (television) Call for help Speech recognition Federal Communications Commission Burglar alarm Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Rotary dial FM broadcasting Software-defined radio Short message service ZigBee BlackBerry Wireless Application Protocol Oh My Goddess!
