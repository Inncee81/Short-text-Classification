where do i find real poets open mics are ridiculous a bunch of people professing to be poets get up and read mulch verbal rhyming mulch that they might read fast to get an audience response if they make the audience laugh they are congratulated on their poetics i want to find a place to meet real poets who live and breathe poetry in all its beauty and ugliness i love hip hop and i am not trying to say that hip hop spoken word is bad but it is just that spoken word not poetry i couldn't agree more but unfortunately at an open mic you'll find maybe one in the whole crowd who is a real poet true poets are a rare thing indeed your best bet is to just not go to open mics anymore you could start your own group either locally or online of real poets you can pick and choose who gets to join good luck Hip hop collaborations Hip hop culture Poetry Hip hop rivalries Poetry of the United States Hip hop music Nas (rapper) Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism English literature Charles Bukowski John Berryman Performance poetry Rapping Gangsta rap Literature Alliterative verse Social rule Joke Ern Malley Novel Mu'allaqat Beastie Boys Pete Rock Walt Whitman Emily Dickinson OutKast Wu-Tang Clan affiliates Friends British Poetry Revival Imagism The Source (magazine) EastEnders Ghazal Gary Snyder Allen Ginsberg Betting (poker) Timeline of trends in music from the United States (1970-Present) Augustan poetry The Brady Bunch Leonard Cohen Swingout Pierre de Ronsard Sampling (music) Medieval French literature Beowulf Miguel de Cervantes Craps Pun Les contes d'Hoffmann English poetry Public Enemy Andy Kaufman Poker jargon Avenue Q Humour Piccolo Junior Saga Roots of hip hop music Aquemini Slam poetry Siegfried Sassoon Meter (poetry) Beat generation Rhyme Beavis and Butt-head Whose Line Is It Anyway?
