can you tell me what you think of this poem i found what do you think that it means does it speak to you i know i'm going to fly some day cast off my earthly shrouds my dreams will fly amoung the stars my heart amoung the clouds unknown nice choice i feel it as meaning death is certain cast off my earthly shrouds because the body is temporary in order for the soul or spirit to fly and in order for one's dreams to do the same the body must die but while the soul may fly alive what dreams may also thrive when the body dies i think the poet means with the death of the body his or her dreams must die too i don't necessarily agree with that but poetry is not written so much for philosophical debate as much as it written for true expression Phaedo Soul John Berryman Meaning of life The Amber Spyglass Emanuel Swedenborg Philo Yehuda Halevi Animism Christian eschatology Poetry Rosicrucian Fellowship Dionysus Nihilism A Course In Miracles Reincarnation Hell Resurrection of Jesus Reality Socrates William Shakespeare Sri Aurobindo Jewish eschatology Al-Ghazali Angel Four Quartets Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Incarnations of Immortality Percy Bysshe Shelley Vampire Pentagram Lycanthropy Roxette Zohar Solomon Ibn Gabirol Sabbath Anglo-Saxon literature Demon Church of Christ Embalming Elemental spirits (Seiken Densetsu) Cliff Richard Brahmanism Johann Gottfried Herder Neil Gaiman Franz Grillparzer Avenue Q Human nature Rei Ayanami Death Medieval Welsh literature The Lovely Bones Don't Believe the Truth Consolation of Philosophy Divine grace Paranoia Agent Clement of Alexandria Day-Age Creationism C__dmon Infant baptism Japanese poetry Philosophical skepticism Adam Mickiewicz S__ren Kierkegaard Meister Eckhart Chakra The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Euphemism Mortification of the flesh Burial Jon Secada Homosexuality and Christianity Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Rudolf Steiner Fernando Pessoa Lucid dreaming Kender Simone Weil Dead Like Me Mary, the mother of Jesus Joe Hill Jesus Miguel de Cervantes Dream Chinese character Consciousness Cupid and Psyche Jim Morrison Carlos Castaneda Mu'allaqat Abortion debate History of literature Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film) Robert Burns Afterlife Kingdom Hearts II American Pie (song) Pitaten
