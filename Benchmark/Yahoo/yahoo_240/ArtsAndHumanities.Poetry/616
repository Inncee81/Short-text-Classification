is this gothic waltz around a coffin off comes the ancient yellow linen which graced a rotted shrine thrown by the dancers onto the earth it falls decayed behind now bared be the coffin once covered but still their graceful waltz does not cease but continues round unrestrained by ballroom walls round and round a coffin aged do mortals merry dance now at this odd casket of death do humans gleeful glance twirling twirling on dying grass the women smile and laugh now by this broken frame of wood do dancers pass in hate or love the dance quickens and the rhythm rushes and all's forgotten the corpse to bury outside the graveyard the waltz in the marshes of death an utter mockery krystine a fellow batcaver neat and thanks for noting i'm not emo i self deprecatingly laugh at your overly cliched poem that self deprecatingly pokes fun at gothic cliches well done and quite well within what may be considered flowing with gothic vein you focus on a dark theme dancing around a corpse but it also has self depracting humor note especially the last line of death an utter mockery you also show much appreciation for the darker side of life however original you are making use of a lot of cliches which can be fun if you want to make fun of those cliches or just want to use them for your own reasons also because you are not going off emotionally about some minor tragedy but celebrating death of all things it's not emo in the end i also a batcaver do in my humble opinion declare this to be a decent gothic poem Gothic rock Death rock Funeral Glossary of partner dance terms Goth Burial Emo The Haunted Mansion Lindy Hop Bharatanatyam Blood (computer game) South Park Ballroom dance Joker (comics) The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Death Time Out of Mind French literature of the 17th century Dance Reincarnation Johann Strauss II Contredanse The Phantom Manor 21st Century Emo Christian Death I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Charmed Dance of the Vampires Scottish country dance Wang Chongyang Decomposition Mary, the mother of Jesus Social rule Frankie Laine Highlander: The Series Shaggy dog story Daredevil Mickey Mouse Gothic novel Immortality Joke Minstrel show Gothic metal English literature Mummy Recurring South Park characters William Butler Yeats Whodunit Macbeth Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Sin City Tom the Dancing Bug Late Night with Conan O'Brien Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In Coffin Jennifer Lopez Novel Lead and follow (dance) MAD Magazine Dancer in the Dark Wood carving The Ashlee Simpson Show John Berryman Victor Hugo Hell Round dance Italian literature Charles Dickens Death and state funeral of Ronald Reagan The Dunciad Augustan poetry AFI 100 Years series Biblical poetry Cremation Roman Catholic Church Sinfest Lili Slashdot subculture Literature of the United States Garfield Paul Is Dead Fallen angel Tamil people The Merchant of Venice Carnival Viz (comic) The Dark Knight Returns The Amber Spyglass Rent (musical) The Haunted Mansion (film) Swamp Thing Media and ethnicity Waltz D.
