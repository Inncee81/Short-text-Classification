is this poem good be honest every time you come around my cheeks turn cherry red i don t know what to say and i have no clue what you just said my stomach fills with butterflies as i stare deep into your deep blue eyes i start to shiver and my hands they shake when i think about you as i lay awake you make me feel warm and whole if only you understood the heart you just stole wow i don't believe i'm doing this but i'm actually going to disagree with todd sorry todd it was bound to happen sooner or later your poem isn't all that bad are the lines a bit cliche yes but i don't think that it matters all that much considering you're writing it to someone and that's pretty much what people do who are young and only have what they've heard to draw upon so that being said you can clean up your poem a little by doing a few simple things you need to drop some beats from the first two lines try this when you come around my cheeks turn cherry red i don't know what to say i don't know what you just said it only drops a few words but i think it keeps the meaning and tightens it up a little think about changing the line i start to shiver so you drop the they make it i start to shiver and my hands start to shake it's what you want to say so just say it the next line drop the when so the line reads i think about you as i lay awake only make it lie awake you can't really lay awake add a three to even the beats and invert the two lines so that the whole thing reads i think about you as i lie there awake i start to shiver and my hands start to shake then the last two lines you make me feel warm and whole it has too few beats and warm is a little soft but we'll keep it for now moving a few words around adding a few to even out the beats try this you make me feel warm safe happy and whole if you only understood the heart that you stole put them all together and see what you think i think your poem shows promise next time you can write about something a little less personally directed something we can all connect with a little more keep writing Theory of conduct Milton H.
