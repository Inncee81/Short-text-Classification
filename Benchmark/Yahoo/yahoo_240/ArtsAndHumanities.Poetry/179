what can a person studying english literary studies do after his or her education i want to study english literary studies as my discipline but i don't have anybody to counsel me p s help if u know you could get into teaching or maybe editing the vast majority of people work in careers that have nothing to do with their degree that is simply reality i may be in the minority on this opinion but employers mainly just want to see a degree any degree to show that you can stick it out at something unless you are going into engineering medicine etc something that needs a particular degree in most cases you take your degree not for employment but for self enrichment the market doesn't care if you enjoyed bronte or thought that joyce was interesting it simply doesn't value those skills that doesn't make them unimportant though i'm all for studying what you are interested in but realize that that may not open any particular career door talk to a counselor at the school you will be attending ask about internships in your chosen career you may love the subject but hate the work you may love english but hate having to do classroom discipline and lesson plans so teaching might not make you happy i think using an internship to try out what you want to do is almost a thousand times more important than the degree you get just my thoughts best of luck to you Juris Doctor School counselor Columbia University Education in the United States Education in Germany Church of Christ, Scientist Graduate school Education in Portugal Psychoanalysis Lawyer Medical school Cooperative education Education in Taiwan General practitioner Past teachings of Prem Rawat Psychology Law school College Tai Chi Chuan Intelligent design Chinese University of Hong Kong Teacher Novel Secondary education in Japan Theory of conduct Education in Japan Software engineering Deprogramming Master's degree Epistemology Homeschooling Victorian literature Avenue Q Education in Australia Economics Philosophy of education Electrical engineering Teach the Controversy Experiential education Equal Protection Clause Apprenticeship A Course In Miracles Rudolf Hermann Lotze Consensus decision-making Medicine Intern Brooke Foss Westcott Kodocha Psychotherapy Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Education in the People's Republic of China Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Narrator New Age Rudolf Steiner Theodicy Paralegal Nurse Jewish studies Theodore Beza Education Traumatic incident reduction Transactional analysis Second language acquisition Education in Hong Kong NUMB3RS Academia Bulgarian language Milton H.
