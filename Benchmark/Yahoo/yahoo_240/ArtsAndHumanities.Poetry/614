is this poem any good i started writing just recently as a way to calm myself down i heard there was going to be a poetry slam in a cafe by where i live so i figured i should try it this is what i've got so far when i was younger i could never embrace poetry it was never a form of art to me but then i heard artists like talib kweli changed my life and now i see i used to let my problems grow in me let my raw emotion take control of me but now i've found a way to let my soul breathe to remind myself who i am and who i want to be i only want to live this life as me 'cause the truth they say will set me free it's spoken poetry so it would sound better and it flows really nice i practiced in front of a mirror i'm not sure what to do with it though i think i'd like to make it the last stanza of something bigger any opinions comments etc you're right it does sound nicer read out loud surprisingly for poetry read on yahoo i do like this poem as long as you read it with raw emotion flooding from your soul it's going to sound great Poetry Poetry of the United States John Berryman Performance poetry Stoicism Surrealist techniques Alternative hip hop Hip hop collaborations Slam poetry Sant Mat Simone Weil Urdu Vishnu sahasranama Alliterative verse Avenue Q Alfred Edward Housman Talib Kweli Phaedo Waka Aristotle C.
