a revision death title hmmm i still need help i like this version better as a poem i think i took everybody's advice from last time for everyone offered something valuable and so specific to the poem but i've been staring at it for so long i just don't know how it reads speaks looks even if you have a second help me out you have all been crucial to this creative process by the way i can not fully express my gratitude how like voices the rain sounds tonight like the hard whisper of prophets the truth of the finite in each breaking drop how sobering to feel yourself at the center of this blossoming death how strange to be within that which grows within you and the scent is not sweet the whole reach of death the slipping of skin the cracking of bones the accumulation of creases between the burden of knowledge and things barely named we in darkness lie what words are there for the mother open arms broken circle can we embrace that which leaves them empty to hold it gently there was a bird fallen and you held it s shivering flesh in your child hand incomprehensible this but you were alive enough to feel the change when the small body stiffened you knew you had touched permanence a passing your passing into this knowledge thank you td that means a lot luckie your word were very kind and encouraging thank you for taking the time to look at my poem todd well i don't know what to say except thank you so much willow i think you are so talented you are one of the writers i look forward to reading every time you post i really do want to see this poem develop to its fullest i think you have something really nice here and it isn t there yet but it s getting closer i m spent some time looking at both revisions how like voices the rain sounds tonight like the hard whisper of prophets the truth of the finite in each breaking drop i think the shorter line lengths work better there is more tension in this this is still one of the most beautiful images in the poem the fragile quality of an exploding raindrop reflecting the impermanence of life i think it leads into your theme very well how sobering to feel yourself at the center of this blossoming death how strange to be within that which grows within you and the scent is not sweet the shorter lines here give you a sense of wondering and discovery as opposed to being statements i think that works better for your purpose i like the removal of the rose image and the word nostrils both were unnecessary for your point you still get across the flower image simply through blossoming good word economy the whole reach of death the slipping of skin the cracking of bones the accumulation of creases between the burden of knowledge and things barely named we in darkness lie the lead in from the scent is not sweet works as a transition there is a part of me that wants to move right to the child with the bird here but i m divided as this still works and that change might screw up your conclusion too much i do like that you changed the order skin bones creases creases creates a nice little resonance with the word between which i love as a single line acting as a bridge between the act of death and the knowledge it brings the line and things barely named i know what you are getting at here i think this needs to be rephrased whether it s a fear of naming or a stigma with naming there is a nuance that needs to be added here that captures the raw dread that accompanies this knowledge that explores this burden so to speak i love the dual meaning of the word lie and i like it on its own line what words are there for the mother open arms broken circle can we embrace that which leaves them empty i know the idea you are trying to get across here in the original version in this current revision it isn t coming across to me this is the most problematic section for me i m not sure what to recommend the original was clearer to me it could be the pronoun shift to we i m not sure about broken circle maybe the link between the mother image and the experience needs to be connected more i feel like i m rambling a bit so i ll move on to hold it gently there was a bird fallen and you held it s shivering flesh in your child hand incomprehensible this but you were alive enough to feel the change when the small body stiffened you knew you had touched permanence a passing your passing into this knowledge i still like the first line to me it harkens back to the raindrops and the fragility of life the image works well i like the shorter lines let s focus on incomprehensible this this phrase just seems too old for me for the moment i don t want the narrator to insert it in i want to stay in the moment and watch the innocence dissolve in the first version you used the phrase too young maybe something along those lines could work here this might be too dramatic of a line break but i wonder if you knew should have its own line the rest of it works well for me i like the ending i miss the small stone image from the first version but fully agree with the cuts you made here one structural question did you have a reason to begin capitalizing your lower section s first words but not your upper section if there was a reason i missed it just wondering i hope some of this helps i really like this poem and i appreciate you posting it thank you The Amber Spyglass Milton H.
