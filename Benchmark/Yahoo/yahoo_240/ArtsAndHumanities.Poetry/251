the second coming by w b yeats what are your opinions about this poem what exactly is the second coming all about in this poem by yeats spread smiles thanks everyone for your answers love u all my interpretation yeats wrote the second coming while europe and much of the rest of the world was trying to recover from world war i this was surely an important factor for him in writing the poem yeats saw great social troubles all around him and remarks on a world spinning out of control line hints at technology progressing beyond mankind's ability to control it the problem was evident to yeats years ago and the problem has worsened since then yeats shows his concern that technology has advanced to the point where mankind can do a great deal of harm with relative ease the world had never seen destruction of the likes of world war i and most people were shocked at the extensive loss of human life during the war in the time that yeats speaks of the rulers of the world were caught up in imperialism and expanding circles of power to the point where they would do almost anything to accomplish their goals the ruthless power mongers were outspoken and numerous and there seemed to be few who dared to speak out against them in the name of peace at one point it stated here that spiritus mundi is a medieval text for christians to inform them what they need to do to die in the grace of god it is essentially the art of dying well at this point the text that deals with the art of dying well is in fact ars moriendi spiritus mundi is literally spirit of the world nevertheless i believe spiritus mundi leads yeats to propose that perhaps the second coming of christ is near at hand judgement day the end of the world spiritus mundi brings an image of the sphinx to yeats' mind yeats sees the sphinx rising up to bring forth the end of the world the sphinx slept in a world of nightmares for years the nightmares were caused by the turmoils of the human race line the indignant desert birds line a k a humans who foresee the second coming try to stop the sphinx the end of the world but their task is impossible in the end yeats reveals no hope for the continued existence of mankind The Second Coming (poem) Christianity William Butler Yeats Eastern Orthodox Church Christian eschatology End times Original sin Magic (paranormal) A Course In Miracles The nature of God in Western theology Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Scientology beliefs and practices Salvation Urantia Book of Revelation Justification (theology) Apocalyptic literature The Pilgrim's Progress Simone Weil Roman Catholic Church Holy Spirit Immortality Supernatural Religion John Howard Yoder W.I.T.C.H.
