this poem is for my long lost old friend any comment the big smiles and the laughters blinded me from a harsh truth that i never wanted to know though i knew it by heart that this friendship is like a poison killing my soul little by little till when there's nothing left she will leave me by my grave i could not mourn for more for my heart is icy cold and my tears couldn't drop for i had lost a friend a tragedy that i never wish for ta amalina to answer you question it is for syahirah years ago if you know her i like it as for the first two comments i do not think they understand how hard it is to lose someone and that it is like a poison eating away at you i think this poem is great EastEnders Hamlet Jon Secada Shaggy dog story Mahatma Gandhi Richard Rahl One Tree Hill (TV series) YuYu Hakusho Scenes from a Memory One Piece minor characters Shawn Michaels Wolfrider Kill Bill Piccolo Junior Saga Ragnarok The Animation C.
