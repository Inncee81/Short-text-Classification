what does free verse mean i have read this in some of the comments but i do not understand what it means would you be kind enough to educate me thank you free verse or open verse means just what it says free free of forced structure rhyme or meter pattern etc many confuse this with prose but the difference is that prose simply tells free verse shows sometimes the line is fine but like art you know it when you see it for example here is a free verse that walks that fine line between prose and poetry kyrie eleison tis the year of our lord an odd number itself factored by primes and strange too the events i ve witnessed this year grand master raymond de berenger of his holiness knights hospitiler of st john captured alexandria by sea burning a muslim pirate fleet there christ s vicar on earth our holy father pope urban the fifth dominus conservet eum ordered the restoration of the vatican so he could abandon holy avignon ending years of stability and the ottoman s having already raped thrace have taken adrianople and made it their capital surely god will turn talk of a great crusade against these blasphemers to action for they threaten more than empire but what can a modest holy man who must endure these times in humble silence do to change a world gone mad perhaps the answer lies in numbers for only numbers do not lie nor is their pure beauty swayed by political or royal flattery ars longa vita brevis and i fear i have neither art nor life i am alone poor without power and by his law without a wife kyrie eleison deus misereatur nostri et benedicat nobis inlustret faciem suam super nos semper benedicat nobis deus et timeant eum omnes fines terrae amen amen amen kevin m sorbello lord have mercy greek psalm may god have mercy on us and bless us may he cause the light of his countenance to shine upon us and may he have mercy on us latin psalm may god bless us and all the ends of the earth fear him latin the reason this leans away from prose is the way the words roll off the tongue and the images that are brought to mind are more than the words themselves convey the latin words are neither here nor there although they carry a message the use in this poem is for sound legitimacy of the speaker a th century monk in love with numbers and meaning when you read the words you almost taste them this is intentional and any good free verse poem must do something similar if it is to walk that fence on the side of poetry other free verse poetry is obscure fractured impactive and at times quite short like this one the glass breaks as words stop the phone drops the hand shakes the glass slips time slows silent fall ringing ears disbelief drink spills floor nears oh my god for goodness sakes they say she s dead the glass breaks kevin sorbello you'll notice that there are a couple lines that rhyme but not most of them this too is common especially when the poem wants to draw attention to a few lines the rhymes help do that i hope this helps Requiem Mass (liturgy) Gloria in Excelsis Funeral of Pope John Paul II Poetry Vespers Pope Ten Commandments Eastern Orthodox Church Sola fide Meter (poetry) Holy Spirit Second Vatican Council Roman Catholic Church Amidah Jerusalem Book of Isaiah Sabbath Coptic Christianity Proven__al literature Simone Weil Rhyme Dispensationalism The Dunciad Nicene Creed Canonical hours Anglo-Saxon literature Qur'an Trinity King James Version of the Bible Dies Irae God and gender Mary, the mother of Jesus Christian views of Jesus Psalms Hell Biblical poetry Angel Literature Eucharist Summa Theologiae El (god) Samuel Wesley (poet) Filioque clause Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Book of Mormon Vulgate Apocrypha Vlad III Dracula Opus Dei Novel Suleiman the Magnificent Italian literature Te Deum Baptism Virgin Mary in Islam Sin Christian eschatology Bible English literature Bhagavad Gita Korban Rule of St Benedict Roman Emperor Alliterative verse Names of God in Judaism Articles of Religion (Methodist) Pope Benedict XVI God Save the Queen Good Friday Prayer Four Quartets Resurrection of Jesus Constantinople Merit Canticle of Zachary Martin Luther E.
