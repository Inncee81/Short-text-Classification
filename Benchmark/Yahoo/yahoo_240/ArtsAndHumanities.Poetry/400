poems rate them it's truly amazing how all the beauty on this green earth cannot even begin to compare to the beauty i see when i look in your eyes want me to tell you something as i walk around surrounded by the natural beauty of the world all i can think of is you and your dream of a face beautiful and perfect as only you can be i would compare you to a rose to the moon to the sun but though god made them each perfect none come close to you you must have been the masterpiece for i cannot find another being on this earth more deserving of the noun beautiful than you my love you're my first thought in the morning my last thought at night i dream of you by day and i think of you all night awake i lay just thinking about what we could be but knowing the whole while that you aren't for me and though i dream and fantasize by night by day by noon and even though i realize that you are my sun and moon and even though the sky is gray when you're around it's blue and though the grass is burnt and brown it's green when i'm with you i know that i can't have you and i lament this so because in your arms just to your arms is where i long to go i think that nd poem is better than st one i'll give nd poem st i liked nd poem because it has beautiful imagination Mercury (planet) Moon Mid-Autumn Festival Frankie Laine Hipparchus (astronomer) Time Out of Mind Earth Extraterrestrial skies Navigation Carrie Jacobs-Bond Parallax Conan the Barbarian Paradise Lost Comet Hyakutake Scenes from a Memory Simone Weil Neptune Juliet Aesthetic Realism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Walter Savage Landor Rainbow Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Qiyamah Shaggy dog story Solar system Bhagavad Gita AFI 100 Years series Salad Fingers Characters of The Sandman The Amber Spyglass Aphrodite Horus Jupiter Fritz Leiber Frank Herbert Venus Miss Saigon Astronomy on Mars The Martian Chronicles German grammar A Canticle for Leibowitz Origin belief The Lovely Bones Dream Day Beatrice Portinari Cupid and Psyche Lucifer God and gender Vishnu Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Hanshan Harry Warren Yehuda Halevi Open cluster Haven (TNG episode) Diamond W.I.T.C.H.
