what do u think of this poem i wrote it in th grade im going into th now but i found it the other day and added it to my blog today here it is let me know what you think neverland here i am sitting on my speed boat in the middle of the atlantic ocean suddenly a ship full of angry pirates blasts itself against my boat causing sparks to erupt in desperation i jump out for fear of being burnt alive as i gasp for breaths in the cold ocean blue i see the maligning marauders escaping with my precious pet ducky how will i survive my only friend is gone while i slowly lose energy and am doomed to drowning thankfully a helicopter magically appears to save me from my fated future out jumps an amazingly gorgeous man who goes by the name of ken he hoists me up and we fly off to neverland where we get married and live happily ever after however my dreams are crushed when i realize i am sitting in a bathtub married to a doll named ken living alone i've gone a bit crazy my blog http www brightideasofateenager blogspot com im not making any changes because this was a poem from th grade and i want to leave it as is by the way this was the honors class i think the poem is cute and shows a vivid imagination that said you should keep it the way it is so you can look back on it as you get older and more experienced however listen closely now every poem benefits from editing every one if you want to keep this as it is because it's part of your past that's okay but you could keep this the way it is and still change a copy of it many poets do that they keep the original to refer back to and keep editing the copy until they either have a new poem or have made the original poem into something they want to share if you choose to post poems that you do not want to change then you are posting them just for entertainment and it really doesn't matter what we think if you post them so that the usual responses of you're great a genius etc come flying your way it is nothing but vanity but you're welcome to do that as well that however will not make you a better poet it will just give you an inflated ego that is not supported by your work that too is okay as long as you realize that is what you're doing otherwise when you post we assume you want feedback so that you can make your poem better and we offer suggestions on how you can change it if you don't want that just tell us up front that you don't care what we think and just wanted to share it with us but that you don't want advice on how to improve it we'll accept that read it and unless we really want to help you boost your ego simply move on to the next poem it's your call but it would be a shame if that's your choice you have a good imagination and a good use of language you could be a good poet if you decided to improve your poems instead of sealing them up the way you first wrote them again it's your call Shaggy dog story W.I.T.C.H.
