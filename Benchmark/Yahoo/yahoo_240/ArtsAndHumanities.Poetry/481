sad poem comments i looked behind me to see you lay and off in the fog a gang runs away men with bats crobars and guns running off laughing like killing is fun i sit beside you tears running down my cheek i become cold and weary and my heart becomes weak i fall to my face begging you to stay but deep in my heart i know you've gone away your face is so lifeless with blood smeared on your forehead and as i see you i wish i were dead your cold and your wet i couldn't be more upset a father is a hard thing to lose you've been beaten and shot and i can still see your bruise w why did you leave did you have to do it the happiness that was there it's impossible to renew it i now live a life dull as clay and if i had one wish it would be that you could stay this is a true poem my daddy owned a bank and the muggers killed him and got the key star if you like omg it is so emotional it's so inspiring and i'm really sorry to what happened i like the technique you used i mean writing the fact in poetry and you know you inspired me to start writing poems i wrote my first poem like and a half weeks ago i was really upset so i got a pen and paper and started working on it it was so long but took me only like hours or less Eddie Guerrero Time Out of Mind Shaggy dog story The Amber Spyglass Miss Saigon True Crime: Streets of LA Sin City Escape from New York EastEnders Wyatt Earp Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Inside Piccolo Junior Saga Pitaten John Berryman Social rule Captain Thunderbolt Muslim ibn Aqeel Episodes of Lost (Season 1) About Schmidt Reservoir Dogs Characters of Naruto Jam (TV series) Billy Childish The Human Stain Vegeta Kodocha One Tree Hill (TV series) Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 The Dunciad YuYu Hakusho Alfred Edward Housman One Piece minor characters Mariana The Shining (film) Tenshinhan Ernest Hemingway The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Ravi Shastri Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters Blood (computer game) Norway national football team Shawn Michaels Phoebe Halliwell Into the West (miniseries) StarCraft: Uprising Billboard Hot 100 History of Test cricket (1884 to 1889) Poetry Shadow the Hedgehog The Yeomen of the Guard Le Malade imaginaire Vernon Schillinger The Contender (television series) Knots Landing The Ashlee Simpson Show Happy Tree Friends The Times They Are A-Changin' Seppuku Dead Like Me Another Side of Bob Dylan God Emperor of Dune Syphon Filter Blood on the Tracks Queen (band) Year of the Spider Limp Bizkit Ty Cobb Ultimate Muscle The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Drawn Together Drowning Meat Loaf Aesthetic Realism The Invisibles Full Metal Panic?
