so i finally got the guts to post one of my poems online feedback please i'd write my age but i don't want people to give me nicer comments just because they think i'm young i also wouldn't mind if someone thought of a name for it because i'm drawing a blank i stand alone here above crashing waves of grey on the brink of a pier my mind gone astray everything is black there's no moon tonight fear is something i lack i'm too blunt for fright my life is now spent yet i feel naught but elation at last i'm content despite my situation louder my heart pumped adrenaline coursing through my veins and so i jumped awaiting the pain but it never did come as i plummeted into the waves i was instantly numb now only death i craved my chest began to flare for how long i struggled i wonder inhaling my final breath of air the waves pulled me under my lungs flooded with water the worst feeling i've ever had an aquatic slaughter yet death was not so bad so where is the light that resides at tunnel's end i see only a black plight an abyss in which i descend i want only to be numb again but pain never harks so i do the one thing i can succumb to the dark this is one of my first poems so i understand if it s not that great i just want honest opinions and just to clear this up i am not suicidal emo gothic or anything of the sort great feedback breeze i didn't even notice gr ful one i assumed that it would be human instincts to struggle whether you wanted to or not i can see how that would be confusing though thanks for your opinion hello infernal waves for one of your first poems i think this has some pretty good potential possible title undertow don't feel the need to rhyme sometimes the rhymes will come across sing song and distract from your message personal experience here i think this might read better as free verse if you'd like i could show you a free verse edit version of your poem as an example of what it could look like just add details if you want to see that otherwise you may want to try a version yourself i think it would be stronger you have good instincts you give images and specific details they could be strengthened but i like where you're going with this so nice job if you work at it you'll continue to get better take care Theory of conduct Time Out of Mind Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Wall Yoga Sutras of Patanjali The Amber Spyglass Scientology beliefs and practices Panic attack The Dark is Rising Sequence Milton H.
