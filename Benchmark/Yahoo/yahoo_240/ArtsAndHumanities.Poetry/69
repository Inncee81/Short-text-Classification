how does this poem make you feel hopeless useless like a million bucks decembers death a winter so white and pail snow falling like heavens hail the disease within it grows the more you wallow in your sorrow blood strewn all around you on the white ground even in your own bloodshed your sanity cannot be found your arms all ugly and torn open like a newly raped little orphan but i'm seeing myself through decembers eyes watching myself in cold pain and agonize as i come upon myself i spit on me for being so pathetic and too weak to break free break free from my misery and pain but as i'm watching i became engulfed in it again i couldn't comletely forget i had to loose myself in little forgotten deaths the disease within is deep loneliness i wish i could escape this cold abyss the disease has destroied my insides now i am no longer alive well i'm only so i don't think that i can qualify as a sick the million bucks was a joke i almost put lol in the question but people wouldn't know what was so funny you know once i had a dream and long story short the grim reaper stabbed me with a knife i wrote a poem when i woke up and it became something beautiful not tragic basically what i'm saying is that poetry is a flow of words with an idea inside not necessarily always a mirror image of someones soul beauty is in the eye of the beholder so we can't judge you or your poetry so simply just keep writing and if people decide to judge you on words alone thats their prerogative and their loss you write passionately and that is always enough The Amber Spyglass Jon Secada Shaggy dog story Scenes from a Memory John Berryman Dean Koontz EastEnders Fitz Hugh Ludlow Miss Saigon YuYu Hakusho Dead Like Me The Shining (film) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Death Gate Cycle Characters of The Sandman Hell Demon Simone Weil Time Out of Mind Death (personification) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Prostate cancer Friends Death Piccolo Junior Saga Vegeta Night (book) Races in the Warcraft universe William Shakespeare Series finale Joke Phaedo The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Tenshinhan Characters of Naruto Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Lovely Bones The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Angel Sanctuary Characters in the Smurfs King James Version of the Bible Anne Rice Meaning of life Soul Novel Drizzt Do'Urden Equine conformation D.
