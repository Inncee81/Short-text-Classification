my poem where's my angel comments i know there s something that i do not see but somehow i feel it all around me it gives me warm feelings when i act really good as i get older i now act as i should it might be my age that i am starting to feel helping my soul i am trying to heal when i now sleep beside my new wife i do remember those times in my life i wasn t perfect i did all the things that being young we just called them flings my mind wasn t molded i didn t think clearly i think i hurt people that i loved real dearly i heard of angels all bright with a glow if they were here wouldn't i know i ve heard some stories more good then are bad they pray for our souls and never get mad maybe sometime someday or someplace i ll meet my angel she ll show her face something inside me answers my plea why look for an angel one sleeps beside me how beautiful if that's the way you really feel about your wife she is a blessed woman Jon Secada Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Parsifal Time Out of Mind Pitaten EastEnders Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Friends Humphrey Bogart Blonde on Blonde Scenes from a Memory The Amber Spyglass Cliff Richard The Death Gate Cycle Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Kodocha Angel Sanctuary Piccolo Junior Saga Mojave people Simone Weil Blood on the Tracks Mother Teresa Care Bears John the Baptist Paige Matthews William M.
