a poem about hate bile stuck in the back of my throat bitter nasty horrible taste people preconcieve too fast black and brown and yellow too why do we hate try to see the good in each i don't understand why someone would choose to taste the pure bile of hate your title would be better if it included the word hate as in taste of hate perhaps people preconcieve too fast preconceive is to have a notion before something happens i think you may mean in the context of your poem prejudge or even make snap judgments or make judgments but not preconcieve why do we hate try to see the good in each these two lines seem like pieces of an idea not the idea itself you need to work on them maybe why do we hate instead of seeing the good or something along those lines or if you wanted a true contrast to the bitterness of hate you could have said something that used the word sweet or good the pure bile of hate is a weak phrase because it mixes images that are already fixed in our heads i know what you were going for but it didn't work the way it should try again with different images that's my best advice and keep writing Goodness and value theory Poetry Bile Structuralism Roger Ebert's most hated films Iago Tobacco Art Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Color theory Beer Rum Moral objectivism Atomism Georges-Pierre Seurat Synaesthesia Michael Drayton Species Placebo (band) Ontological argument The Rutles Mahatma Gandhi Book of Isaiah Shit Dark Ages Hate speech David Hume Justification (theology) Head of state Drawing Philosophy of language Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Immanuel Kant Cultural relativism Merit The nature of God in Western theology Ty Cobb Supply and demand Theodicy Paradise Lost Existence Bread Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Alignment (role-playing games) Novel Fast bowling John Wycliffe Amiga Power Vodka Bollocks Chinese language Surrealist techniques Empire Burlesque John Howard Yoder Japanese poetry Atheism Bill Stevenson Blood on the Tracks Leonard Cohen The Adventures of Pete & Pete Michel Henry One Tree Hill (TV series) Glossary of American football Hypnosis The Young Ones (TV series) Dispensationalism Classical music era Jews as a chosen people Rigging Kasparov versus The World Grammatical mood Heuristic Culture Westboro Baptist Church (Topeka) Paradox God Infidels White (people) Origin belief Nine Inch Nails Anti-Defamation League Aphasia Max Stirner Theatre Critique of Judgment Rhyme Hildegard of Bingen Das Lied von der Erde French Defence Andr__ Ch__nier Ethics Harvey Award Time Out of Mind Translation Critique of Pure Reason Color I Am the Walrus
