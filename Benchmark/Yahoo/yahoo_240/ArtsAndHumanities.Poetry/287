what is your opinion on this poem feelings it leaves you with relentless mind your mind is my plaything your spine my puppet's string wire's hooked into your heart seeing to it that you play your part you are seeing the world through my eyes though i am indulged in your mind you are mine to will now you will rip tear and kill but the only kill is to be the one you love drowning her in your blood ending her with evil dispise thinking you know the dirty secret's to her lies the lies wich i had you spoon fed along with the illusion's i planted in you head pulling the string as if striking a chord in your death tormenting controlling you until i decide it's your last breath it's actually based on the idea of me cotrolling a guy just random like that thank you for all your thoughts and opinions no i'm not a crazy controll freak in relationships that's not what i ment i think that this is actually pretty nice you have the ideas all there and it's something that people can get drawn into i myself find it fairly interesting something that makes you really think about the meaning however if you're looking for areas to improve i believe you can clarify it a little more you see if i just read this i feel like i can take it two different ways if you're really trying to find a way to improve you might want to focus on the way you want us to take it that's not saying that you must change it by leaving it this way you add an effect that makes the reader wonder which can be good in many ways Theory of conduct Naruto jutsu Salad Fingers W.I.T.C.H.
