what do you all think of this poem i wrote it cuz i thought it would be easier than blabbing how i feel i need you like the night sky without the moon and stars like a good song on the radio in the car i need you to protect me from it all i need you to pick me up if i trip and fall like an empty room with no whispers of excitement like a statue without the stone made out of cement i need you when the wind wants to blow me away i need you when i want to hide in a dark hole til i start to decay like a poem with a verse or a line to rhyme with like hercules and his myths i need you more than you'll ever know i need you like blood in my veins which flows my heart beats for you my heart beats for your love i sore when i look at you like the eagles soring above i need you to love move for you like me for whom i am and who i want to be but what can't i make you see i need you the sky looks empty w out the stars and the sky and car is somethin' we both love wow that's really good especially to someone like me who can't get a poem to rhyme it definitely expresses your emotions adequately Poetry Time Out of Mind William Butler Yeats The Marshall Mathers LP Dean Koontz Aquemini Blood on the Tracks Jon Secada Opportunity rover Grand Theft Auto: Vice City soundtrack Cliff Richard The Emancipation of Mimi U2 (band) Hip hop rivalries Qiyamah Nursery rhyme E.
