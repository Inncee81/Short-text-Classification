a bit of a change tell me what you think so poem it's a bit of a change from those prior though still rather awful tell me what you think oh as an aside the last time i wrote a poem the lines kind of spilled over so an accidental lack of punctuation and capitalization occurred and i went on vacation without my computer and had no chance to select a best answer sorry to anyone who cares i voted for the answer i liked best anyway even that which is not it's just so beautiful and i can't help but sigh each time this beauty leaves my sight my hearing and my touch my senses i can't help but regret the times the times i've witnessed this beauty and failed to act upon the things i feel inside the things that i think i should naturally be doing but can't bring myself to do ah but everything is so silly and i can't help but laugh at the things i've done and look forward to the tings i might yet do with as much anticipation as trepidation i ran out of room i'm always so scared but always so calm and relaxed always so sad yet never happier i suppose thats the way things in life take form at least for me all is balanced in a chaotic sort of way balance is everything and everything is balanced this is the only universal truth that i hold to the only philosophy that i accept as fact it is the basis of all that i am at least for now everything is so beautiful this world we live in for all it's faults and horrors and ugliness is exquisitely beautiful if it was not then we would never know beauty and all of humanity would be cursed i fear that our children will live in a world bereft of all beauty it is this thought above all else that truly chills me this music is so wonderful and even though i can't understand the words i understand the meaning for that is the way of music and that is beautiful what is beauty all is beautiful even that which is not it's a bit long i do like it though there's a lot of emotions showed in this Theory of conduct Ethics Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Simone Weil Supernatural God Emperor of Dune The Death Gate Cycle Time Out of Mind Epistemology Shaggy dog story Intelligent design The Amber Spyglass Dualism (philosophy of mind) Determinism Deconstruction The nature of God in Western theology Goodness and value theory Meaning of life Bernard Williams Theodicy Philosophy of language Science Anthroposophy Francis Hutcheson (philosopher) Philosophical skepticism Aesthetic Realism Phaedo Jon Secada Objectivist philosophy Darth Vader Kain (Legacy of Kain) Cyberspace Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Discordianism Aristotle Arthur Schopenhauer K' I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Friedrich Schleiermacher Immanuel Kant Immortality Metaphysics Sigmund Freud David Hume Problem of universals Rudolf Hermann Lotze Boards of Canada Creationism Kasparov versus The World Nicomachean Ethics Social rule Art Milton H.
