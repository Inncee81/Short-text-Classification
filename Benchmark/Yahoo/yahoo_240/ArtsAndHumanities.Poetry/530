what do you think of my poem a little girl splashes in a puddle fresh from an afternoon shower her mother watches from the window and thinks about how innocent and beautiful it is if only life was like that for the world she thought if only the world could see what i see the curtain falls she opens the door honey come inside she calls and realizes such is life so innocently the little girl skips inside blissfully unaware of the world around her theres two more parts but they're not gonna fit so i'll just put them in the additional details all comments are appreciated note that this is my first serious poem kind of more like a story idk and sort of a work in progress thank you for reading and giving constructive criticism she doesn't know that the man next door is slowly painfully dying she doesn't know that the boy down the street is sick with cancer and may not get better she doesn't understand what it means to be sick to be hungry or poor how blissfully unaware she is of the terrible things in the world she also hasn't lived or loved hasn't felt exhilarating happiness she doesn't understand that with love comes pain she knows not of the sheer joy that comes with life however nor she know the pain for now she skips thru life so blissfully unaware of the ups and downs joys and sorrows the events that make up life again just let me know what you think comments like it sucks or cool are kinda worthless to be honest so please just leave a bit of constructive criticism or a positive comment like it has a good message or something thank you very much i think that this poem is pretty good i actually like it but there are some things that i think need to be changed and thinks about how innocent and beautiful it is if only life was like that for the world she thought if only the world could see what i see i don't want you to tell me what she thinks with the child you're giving me a beautiful image of innocence i want you to create an image for me of the mother also not just tell me what she thinks perhaps you could describe the conditions of her life anything to give me a feel for the contrast between the two so innocently the little girl skips inside leave out the so innocently part we're bright enough to get the image you're trying to convey don't pound it home just draw the picture we'll figure it out also leave out the she doesn't know that i would also leave out the word painfully and the may not get better when you said the man was dying we already have a picture in our minds same with the boy with cancer too much information she doesn't understand what it means to be sick to be hungry or poor how blissfully unaware she is of the terrible things in the world i don't really like these lines either again you're telling us instead of drawing us a picture perhaps mom is coughing or shooting up or getting yelled at by the landlord or cursed at by a neighbor draw me a picture of the child being blissfully unaware don't just tell me that she's blissfully unaware she also hasn't lived or loved hasn't felt exhilarating happiness she doesn't understand that with love comes pain she knows not of the sheer joy that comes with life however nor she know the pain for now she skips thru life so blissfully unaware of the ups and downs joys and sorrows the events that make up life i like what you're trying to do here i'm just not real keen on how you're doing it i would probably step away from the picture that you've drawn up to this point and just make it a commentary on life and innocence don't refer to she just refer to life with life comes growth and pain and disappointment there is something to be said for innocence but there is also something to be said for perseverence perhaps you could give us a commentary on the beauty of both childhood innocence and motherly courage i might like that even lacking innocence there is still hope from my comments you might conclude that i didn't like your poem but you would be sadly mistaken i do like it i just think that it could be better after all you did ask what we think Theory of conduct The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Humphrey Bogart Jon Secada Episodes of Lost (Season 1) EastEnders Sin City The Amber Spyglass Milton H.
