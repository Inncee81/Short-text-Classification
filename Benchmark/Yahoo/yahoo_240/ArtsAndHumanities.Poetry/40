let me know what you think of this poem i wrote mature eyes only into your love i remember laying in your bed with the sound of the clock radio in my head the sweet smell of your hair close to my cheek we were speaking to each other with nothing said touching the small of your back where i traced with my finger your tattoo and feeling your body move with your breath there was nothing in the world i would rather do kissing your skin tasting every inch i would ease my way down to your thighs feeling the heat as i blew softly on your love thrusting my tongue as you trembled into sighs the taste of you made my heart race wanting to be inside of you in every way pushing every inch of me into your wetness slow and fast we would erupt into tremors that lasted all day i then lay there in awe of the moment the sweat and lust of our bodies drench the bed my heart continued to pound out a message run my fingers through your hair serenity would fill my head those were the most passionate times in my life your scent and taste will stay with me forever the nights by your side i fell happily into your love never again will there be excitement such as ours never keep in mind this is a rough draft need to do some rewrite to it very passionate then and now i loved every minute of it detailed and graphic it gave me a sense of a love that is timeless touche Equine conformation Cat Traumatic brain injury Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Blood on the Tracks Jon Secada The Amber Spyglass Sense The Shining (film) Time Out of Mind Dog Shaggy dog story Mattress Elephant Ron and Fez The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Shakespeare's sonnets Professional wrestling holds Unreleased Madonna songs Aerial (dance move) Breaststroke Past teachings of Prem Rawat Hyperthermia Opportunity rover Characters in the Smurfs Sin City Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Strap-on dildo Backstroke Phoebe Buffay's songs Buttocks Professional wrestling attacks S__ren Kierkegaard Shen Gong Wu Blonde on Blonde Human The Midnight Sun Henri Murger Puberty Fancy Crane Social rule Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Cliff Richard Hansel und Gretel Love Salute The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Happy Tree Friends Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Physical characteristics of the Buddha One Tree Hill (TV series) The Brothers Karamazov The Jam Guinea pig Stuttering Charles Peace A Day in the Life Erogenous zone Kurt Cobain Fast bowling House music Naruto jutsu Volleyball Father Ted Ostrich Mount St. Helens Elvis Presley Wound healing phases Out-of-body experience Ten Commandments Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hall & Oates Iago Night (book) Western concert flute Thinks ...
