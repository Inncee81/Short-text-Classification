tell me what you think of my poem i'm not really into poetry that is happy go lucky so here is mine sad eyes of emptiness wither all beauty gone your bleeding heart in agony love eternal seems forever a misery let me feel all your pain we ll suffer in a sea of tears your ocean is too deep for me all wept away all swept away lay down with thorns of pity lay beside me the first two lines are lovely actually i like most of the lines individually a lot but to me the third and fourth line of the poem don't seem to flow and aren't as poetic as the rest of the poem it needs a title too but that's just my opinion i find things that i would change about some of my favorite poems that have been written by fantastic poets Adam Mickiewicz Four Quartets John Berryman Alfred Edward Housman George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron Yehuda Halevi Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Shakespeare's sonnets Jon Secada Michael Drayton Emily Dickinson Time Out of Mind The Dunciad Biblical poetry H.D.
