a slightly long poem i made tell me what you think of it rainbows of life by valeria van hoven life is like a rainbow with beginning and end lined beautiful colors like humans they depend we are those colors representing our souls with our own different shades our own different goals red is the aggressive ill tempered tinge throwing tantrums as it lives frozen in cringe stereotypically so but deep down inside lives a fiery love no other can provide and then there s yellow so warm and bright but commonly missed as it s pale and light still yellow tries hard to stand out of the crowd shining so gracefully in rainbows so proud blue is the calmest the coolest of the lot passively gleaming not a color it fought boring dull or depressing it may seem blue brightens the days with its powerful beam silver platter purple the royal tint born ignorant and rich with an arrogant glint tries hard to grasp image of what is real the heart of the purple is the most ideal next is the green whose humble sense shows the neutral the normal it sticks to the prose limited to laws the green is not daring its nature s to nurture as it s loving and caring last is the orange the ecstatic and wild playful and funny much like a little child boisterous brave and at times quite mean true orange is gentle smart and keen united we form this emblazoned wonder through the good bad achievement and blunder a single shade stands for the color of your heart which was packaged in you from the very start colors arching for a moment they last before they disappear into the past just as we live we play and love life is as quick as that rainbow above although the illusion left without adieu born are new lives a rainbow anew orange yellow purple green red and blue one of these six colors lives inside of you hi i'm valeria and i'm fifteen i submitted this poem yesterday but i want more opinions about it i slightly edited it as well tell me what you think if you don't like it don't be afraid to tell me so help me improve it hello valeria this is an interesting idea for a poem i will place some comments under each stanza life is like a rainbow with beginning and end lined beautiful colors like humans they depend we are those colors representing our souls with our own different shades our own different goals i don t understand like humans they depend i m not making the connection here i think once you get to line and it s more clear but line isn t working for me red is the aggressive ill tempered tinge throwing tantrums as it lives frozen in cringe stereotypically so but deep down inside lives a fiery love no other can provide line here is good however frozen in cringe is awkward and needs to be rethought and then there s yellow so warm and bright but commonly missed as it s pale and light still yellow tries hard to stand out of the crowd shining so gracefully in rainbows so proud i would keep your parallel structure in line one and add a so before bright blue is the calmest the coolest of the lot passively gleaming not a color it fought boring dull or depressing it may seem blue brightens the days with its powerful beam this is all right in general you may want to deepen the ideas behind each of the colors and get below the surface a bit more i think you accomplish that the most with red so far that can be a future rewrite though silver platter purple the royal tint born ignorant and rich with an arrogant glint tries hard to grasp image of what is real the heart of the purple is the most ideal i don t like the words image of in line maybe replace them with at this is a more solid stanza like your red one next is the green whose humble sense shows the neutral the normal it sticks to the prose limited to laws the green is not daring its nature s to nurture as it s loving and caring it sticks to the prose is just there for the rhyme rethink this maybe limited by laws in line it isn t really laws though it s societal constraints give it some thought line is a little clunky too many words here pare it down some for the rhythm last is the orange the ecstatic and wild playful and funny much like a little child boisterous brave and at times quite mean true orange is gentle smart and keen line you may want to remove little here it feels a bit awkward in your rhyme using mean in line makes line a bit confusing you may want to give that some thought this is also one of your stronger stanzas due to the detail united we form this emblazoned wonder through the good bad achievement and blunder a single shade stands for the color of your heart which was packaged in you from the very start not bad i like emblazoned wonder line needs a little smoothing out colors arching for a moment they last before they disappear into the past just as we live we play and love life is as quick as that rainbow above maybe fleeting is a better word here than quick in line beyond that this is probably your strongest stanza in the poem although the illusion left without adieu born are new lives a rainbow anew orange yellow purple green red and blue one of these six colors lives inside of you second half of this is good you need to think about rewording the first two lines here i hope some of these comments helped like i said cool idea with a few rewrites it could be really interesting keep writing and take care Color Care Bears Diamond Dragon Booster
