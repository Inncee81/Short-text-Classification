rate this poem on the scale of also ur comments if any amendments r to be made remember the days gone by when we were together that each moment spent with you today i try to gather i have smiling lips and and teary eyes a heavy breath i take tears roll down my cheeks with every single beat my heart does ache everywhere i go my eyes quest only if i can find you somewhere to hold you close to my heart and pour out all my warmth and care you won't return i know to strum the chords of my heart and gloominess bricks up within me when back i dart this infatuation though would lead me to nowhere still memories in mind whip through i can just pray you turn up someday because i'm always waiting for you let it out baby let it out Jon Secada Time Out of Mind Empire Burlesque Rod Stewart Humphrey Bogart Social rule Saga (band) Shen Gong Wu Gregg Alexander Single certification Cliff Richard Indianapolis 500 Miss Saigon The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie The Waterboys Van Morrison Frankie Laine Shaggy dog story Sydney Riot of 1879 Pope John Paul I Tenshinhan Shock Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Yin Shun John the Baptist C__line Dion The Amber Spyglass The Ashes The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars Wolfrider Pitaten Hall & Oates Queen (band) Whitney Houston Phoebe Buffay's songs I Want to Hold Your Hand The Supremes Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Kill Bill Whip John Frusciante Robert F.
