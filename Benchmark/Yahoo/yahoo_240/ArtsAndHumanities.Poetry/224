what do you think of this these song lyrics a lady's lament hey ho the tides rolls in i have lost my love again he has sailed across the sea what will become of me i stand here talking to the sea will she bring him back to me day by day she tells her lies night by night my spirit dies so it goes throughout the years as the end of my life nears no answer comes she does not care she acts like i'm not even there the sea she's claimed my own true love but i've had words from up above dreams come to me upon the wind last words from him that he did send my love love the sea she would not wait so i'll meet you up at heaven's gate where i'll claim you back again hey ho fiddly i o the tide rolls in again my friend hey ho fiddly i o hey ho fiddly i o i write what comes to me this is a celtic song it's hard to hear the tempo unless it is being sung you are a bit of a fool to post uncopyrighted material anyone can still them you know that being said they seem good but need work i think Cliff Richard Time Out of Mind The Amber Spyglass Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Led Zeppelin Bringing It All Back Home The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Beatles for Sale Frankie Laine Blood on the Tracks Bonnie Tyler Bryan Adams Jon Secada Aladdin (1992 film) She Loves You Rod Stewart Kurt Cobain The Beatles I Want to Hold Your Hand Highway 61 Revisited The Rutles God Save the Queen Avenue Q Donovan Elton John Louie, Louie Nashville Skyline The Jazz Singer The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars Aretha Franklin Fiddler on the Roof Hey Arnold!
