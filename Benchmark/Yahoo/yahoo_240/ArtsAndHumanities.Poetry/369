do you like this poem everyone surely has darkness hidden somewhere in their heart sometimes it prevents them from living as they wish we can't imagine other people's pain it's hard for us to share it but if i meet someone whom i really want to face i don't want to feel fear you shut the door of your heart with a violent noise and lost the key to open it a long time ago so please tell me exactly what you feel just with common words and with common expressions please let me hear it's so fearful to believe what is invisible and formless but if you can do so don't you feel it's wonderful even in the middle of such a grey city where you can hardly hold yourself together don't laugh so weakly with a resigned look as if to say such is life where is the person who could get what he wanted without making any sacrifices you see you have the thing which i long for which i had lost and will never get again however strongly i wish for it you shut the door of your heart with a violent noise and lost the key to open it a long time ago so please tell me exactly what you feel just with common words and with common expressions where is the person who could get what he wanted without making any sacrifices you see you have the thing which i long for which i had lost and will never get again however strongly i wish for it it's so dazzling to me yes i especially like the stanzas that begin with you shut the door of your heart with a violent noise i like this line too i like the beginning a little less because it is a kind of generalization and i prefer specific situations and characters in poetry Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Time Out of Mind Jon Secada Theory of conduct The Amber Spyglass Asperger syndrome Milton H.
