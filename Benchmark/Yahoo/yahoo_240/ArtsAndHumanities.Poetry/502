what do you think of this poem night when moonlight glides over the surface of the lake fireflies wander happily in their first wake lights shimmer blinking on and off a whispering breeze flutters over the silent meadow a little star cries lost and misplaced it falls down onto the grass where it slowly fades away the moon gives it's light for a silent rabbit that's finding it's way home it rushes into cuddly arms far away in a little cottage a mother quietly sings a lullaby to her baby the summer air is crisp and clear with the smells of life i think there are some good images here but if you'd like to make it better it will need some work you seem more comfortable at least more able to communicate your vision when you're writing in free verse rather than rhyme so you should probably stick to free or open verse with this one your first two stanzas have lines that seem transposed you have fireflies gliding over their wake and a breeze that flutters over a meadow you might want to try having the breeze whisper over the lake and the fireflies futter over the meadow it might look like this when moonlight glides on the surface of the lake a whispering breeze creates a wandering wake lights shimmer blinking on and off fireflies flutter happily over a silent meadow the over in the second line was changed so the over in the original th line wasn't a repeat plus moonlight would be on the lake not over you can't see it when it doesn't touch the lake the breeze and shimmering lights were moved up into the same stanza as the lake and wander moved up as well to make an alliteration with wake hopefully softening the rhyme in the first stanza since it wasn't found anywhere else in your poem in your third stanza little star is this a metaphor for the firefly if so can you hear the cry of a firefly be careful when you create your images so that you don't make them too fanciful your poem is well grounded in natural images if you create a fantasy you'll lose touch with the reality it creates in the fourth stanza you say the moon gives its light i wouldn't do that you already said the moonlight was on the lake so i'd find another way to say that maybe the pale silver light shows a stealthy rabbit the secret way home this avoids using silent and moonlight again plus it tells us that the rabbit understands there are predators and must be careful choosing a way home only it knows and is illuminated in the light of the moon finally summer air is seldom crisp and if they are by the lake it's probably sultry which also just happens to merge better with life like the summer air is sultry but clear alive with the smells of life just some suggestions your images were okay but some editing and you'll have even better ones keep writing i like what your mind sees Alliterative verse Poetry Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Discworld gods John Berryman Parsifal Meter (poetry) Song Paul Revere's Ride USS Tunny (SS-282) Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Shaggy dog story Phoebe Buffay's songs Jon Secada Infidels Beowulf Four Quartets Moon The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe W.I.T.C.H.
