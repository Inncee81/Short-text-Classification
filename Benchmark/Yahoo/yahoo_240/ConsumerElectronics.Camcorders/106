i am planning to buy a handycam hdd series either sony or jvc sony is cheaper than jvc same specs advise pls i am just wondering if why jvc gb mp is expensive than sony gb mp i want an advice before buying thanks i always choose sony simply because sony has imo the best picture quality if you use nightvision function sony have the best on the market read the small print regarding resolution also you want optical resolution quite often technical details refer to the 'software interpolated enhanced' resolution but either way this shouldnt affect your purchase if you plan on mastering dvds the resolution will be greatly reduced and current tv sets are incapable of displaying anything remotely as high as even mp whatever way go for sony its cheaper better quality and well built High-definition television DVD Digital photography Blu-ray Disc PlayStation 3 VHS Sony PlayStation Portable Videocassette recorder MSX Apple Macintosh Camcorder Nintendo Digital rights management Nintendo 64 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Copy protection Videotape Bluetooth Sega Betamax Mouse (computing) DualDisc JVC Super Nintendo Entertainment System USB flash drive Nintendo Revolution Binoculars DV Atari ST PlayStation 2 MMORPG Amiga Sound Blaster Compact disc Modchip Image scanner Sharp Zaurus NTSC Atari 8-bit family Handheld game console Enterprise content management Super Video CD Unicode X Window System Gramophone record Universal Serial Bus MAME Photography Movie projector MPEG-2 Video CD Floppy disk Sony Computer Entertainment Anamorphic widescreen Machinima Solar cell Tungsten Handheld Radeon Widescreen Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Sega 32X 8 mm video format Digital cinematography PlayStation 2 Expansion Bay Analog-to-digital converter Walkman Color Graphics Adapter MiniDisc MP3 Panavision Galileo spacecraft Final Fantasy XI Final Fantasy (video game) Automatic number plate recognition Virtual memory Console wars CPU design Geographic information system Sega Saturn Publicly funded medicine SCART Warez Final Fantasy IX Compact audio cassette Cell (microprocessor) Computer and video games IMac Television Musical Instrument Digital Interface PolyGram Sega Dreamcast Solar power Digital cinema Windows Vista Betacam Mutual fund
