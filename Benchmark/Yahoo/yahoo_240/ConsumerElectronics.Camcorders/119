how do i record from my tv to my camcorder so i want to know that i have a dv dsc camera camcorder and i have the red white and yellow jacks that connect to it but whenever i connect it to my camera nothing shows up on the camera it just goes blank but it shows up on the tv im trying to record some of my video games and tv shows and i dont want to spend money on a capture card what do i do most camera camcorder cameras don't allow the video signal to come in it most likely only goes out if it does allow for the signal to come in most of the time it's through an adapter for the camera check the camera manual for video in out and see what it says and if you need to purchase the adapter if no adapter is needed then maybe you have to set your camera to vcr mode then hit record to see if that opens up the signal Camcorder 8 mm video format DV Digital camera Professional video camera S-VHS Secure Digital card Betacam Copy protection Digital photography Videotape Videocassette recorder SCART High-definition television Digital video Television Screenshot DVD Camera Compact disc S__CAM Digital video recorder NTSC Charge-coupled device Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Bluetooth Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis IPod Composite video Oscilloscope Universal Serial Bus Digital cinema Movie camera Atari 8-bit family Digital Visual Interface Warez Technicolor RCA Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, manga or movie only characters FireWire Game Boy ITU-T The Amazing Race Hiawatha Line Resident Evil Color Graphics Adapter Back to the Future Teletext Sinclair ZX81 Railway signal Jack plug Film Nintendo GameCube Game show Federal Standard 1037C Machine vision Traffic light Digital8 Computer bus Sampling frequency Commodore 64 Super Nintendo Entertainment System Advanced Squad Leader Widescreen Composite monitor TiVo Poker jargon Panavision RGB color model SMPTE time code Light-emitting diode Motion capture Independent film Blackjack JVC DirectShow ITunes YUV Video The Wiggles Washington Metro Sound card Floppy disk Surround sound Xbox Desktop computer Betting (poker) Archos Max Payne Ethernet Surveillance XDCAM The Sims 2 Color Movie projector Frame rate Modem
