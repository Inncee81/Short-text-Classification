how can i stop video from flickering when edited from a dvd in premiere elements i'm trying to edit a home movie from a finalized dvd from a mini dvd cam everything is fine until i render the project either as a file or straight to dvd it looks really flickery and hard to watch i've tried everything like changing field dominance and interlace options but to no avail can anyone help yes both are pal fps the dvd is finalized so it's basically it's a normal mpeg dvd like you'd get a movie on it loads edits and plays fine on the screen it's only when it is burnt back on to a dvd or file that the result is a really flickery picture kind of like when you see a news article on tv and hundreds of people are flashing cameras and the picture almost has an echo to it does the project setting and the camcorder recording standard match i e both pal or both ntsc make sure they do what quality setting was used on the camcorder the mpeg system works well if it isn't over compressed if you were in lp mode then this may be the problem premiere pro can give various qualities of playback from preview to full quality a lot of this will depend on your vdieo card and other system parameters check it's not on preview quality if you are really into your video work then it isn't a bad idea to buy a cheap portable telly and monitor using this far better than using a computers vdu computers don t display video partiuclarly well different scan patterns different signals and different ways of handling colour Television DVD Digital photography NTSC S__CAM VHS Camcorder DV Digital television Laserdisc Digital cinema 8 mm video format Digital video Atari 8-bit family H.264/MPEG-4 AVC MPEG-2 PlayStation Portable Warez AmigaOS Interlace Windows Vista ATSC Floppy disk MP3 Digital cinematography Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Super Nintendo Entertainment System Telecine Movie projector Screenshot Sega Saturn Betacam Computer display Pixel Digital camera Windows 2000 Original Amiga chipset Xbox 360 IPod Xbox Commodore 64 Nintendo GameCube S-VHS Video codec Videocassette recorder Enterprise content management PlayStation 2 Oscilloscope Digital video recorder RGB color model Stereoscopy Computer and video games Anamorphic widescreen PlayStation 3 Computer Compact disc PAL Film Federal Standard 1037C Video CD PC Engine Final Fantasy Videotape Copy protection Windows XP Macromedia Flash Amstrad CPC PNG ZX Spectrum Universal Serial Bus Movie camera Non-linear editing system ATI Technologies Computer animation Nintendo Entertainment System Computer virus Personal computer Apple Computer Compact audio cassette Digital rights management MiniDisc Portable Document Format Handheld game console Dance Dance Revolution Creative Zen Super Video CD System/36 Loudspeaker Sega Dreamcast Sound Blaster Cheating in Counter-Strike Archos IBM PC compatible
