could anyone analyse this dream for me over the last month i have been seeing a great guy but because he finds himself in a difficult situation at the moment i know that he isn't able to offer me a relationship a couple of days ago i left for my holiday and was really happy because this would make it easier for me to move on and forget about this guy its's really weird cause the first night on holiday i dreamt of him coming over to me and apologising for his distance offering me a bouquet of dried flowers the dream was really vivid and light whereas normally my dreams would be dark and grey could anyone help me analysing this dream please dreams are just symbols that the sub conscious creates to help us deal with our problems that we cannot deal with during our awake state dreams can only deal with the past and the present they do not deal with the future why did you have this dream maybe because you wanted to be reassured about this guy and don't really want to break it off with him at least a part of you doesn't but part of you knows that you have to the dried flowers represent the nature of your relationship with this man the vividness of this dream shows how much you want this relationship to continue you need to get on with your life and forget about this guy you need to start living a life without him and prepare yourself to meet someone new that you can hjave a great relationship with Dream Scenes from a Memory The Ashlee Simpson Show Jon Secada Miss Saigon Philosophical skepticism Shaggy dog story Avenue Q Pok__mon Live!
