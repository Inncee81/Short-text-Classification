same dream four times i always have the same dream about my mom having another baby even though she can't have any more children the baby's name is always aaron and he always has blonde hair and blue eyes what does this mean did your mom ever have a miscarriage ask her if she did you may be dreaming about that baby she miscarried if that's so how cool is that to be connected to a family member on the other side if not if this is a happy thing it means you have a desire to have such a brother in your life it means you want to help bring love into the world but are not ready to do this yourself so you have your mom do it instead and of course it will be perfect because she produced you didn't she aaron in the bible was the brother of moses the prophet who led the israelites out of bondage from egypt and aaron was moses's chief support right hand man and well favored in the sight of god you may be seeking such a friend and support from such a family member if you do have any other brothers or sisters why not try to cultivate a friendship with one of them if you don't why not try to cultivate a friendship with a cousin it's always worth it to build relationships with your own family members first good luck to you Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Moses Prophets of Islam Aaron Joseph (Hebrew Bible) Jacob Once and Again Philo Miracle Abraham Priesthood (Mormonism) Rich Mullins Humphrey Bogart Nation of Islam Genesis Judaism Knots Landing Characters of The Sandman Frankie Laine History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Mary, the mother of Jesus Anne Boleyn Idolatry Trinity Something Positive AFI 100 Years series Yehuda Halevi John the Baptist Doug Bible Exodus Musa (prophet) Cultural and historical background of Jesus Book of Numbers Virgin Mary in Islam Sukkot Kohen Christian views of Jesus Sabbath Baby Blues Hollyoaks Angel Care Bears Neighbours Phoebe Buffay's songs W.I.T.C.H.
