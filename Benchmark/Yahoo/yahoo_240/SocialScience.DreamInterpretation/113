what does my dream mean there is a girl that was my best friend since pre school since we were like years old we were best friends she came on to my husband around thanksgiving grabbing his crotch and tell him she wanted to give him a bj well he backed away from her and told me about it she admitted it and i decided she was def someone i didn't want to be friends with well times last week i had the same dream with the exact same details the general idea of the dream was that i found out she had died in a car accident and i felt so guilty that she died and we weren't friends anymore that i killed myself commiting suicide is something i'd never do especially over this girl why did i have this dream and what does it mean i've said this a thousand times before and i'll say it again dreams are sometimes used by our brains to expose emotions or feelings that you've been denying but feelings aren't concrete and dreams are visual so you're brain has to express these denied feelings visually and sometimes they turn out weird this one is very easy though it seems to me that you don't really want to let go of this friendship i'm sure you tell yourself that you want to let go but you're denying the feeling deep down inside the feeling that you want to forgive her and move on this doesn't necissarily mean you should forgive her it's just what you subconsciously think should happen i came to this conclusion because you felt guilty when she died if you had been happy that would have meant that you do truly hate her but instead you were sad even worse you went suicide this might have been becasue you ruined this friendship and you felt that the total time you were friends with her was a waste this doesn't necissarily mean that you want to kill yourself even if she did die like i said sometmes the expression of these emotions come out strange hope this helps EastEnders Shaggy dog story Knots Landing One Tree Hill (TV series) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Scenes from a Memory Futurama (TV series - season 5) Friends Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sharon Tate Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Kodocha Marilyn Monroe Jean Grey Please Save My Earth Avenue Q Vernon Schillinger God Emperor of Dune Haibane Renmei Days of our Lives Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Sin City Paranoia Agent W.I.T.C.H.
