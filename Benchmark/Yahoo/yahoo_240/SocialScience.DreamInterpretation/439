how can i stop having bad dreams i have terrifying dreams you can actually control what you dream about if you concentrate on what you would like to dream about before you go to bed then you can make your subconscious dream about those things instead of having nightmares try to do something relaxing before going to bed read some kind of calming book that isn't scary a lot of nightmares can be caused by a lot of stress that you accumulate during the day i used to not ever remember my dreams so in order to make my syself remember them i would concentrate before i went to bed and i would tell myself that i would remember them this is all mental and you have control over what you dream about and what you remember try watching a funny movie before bed or taking a hot bath to relax this should help you to quit having nightmares good luck The Tracey Ullman Show shorts Insomnia Lucid dreaming Social rule Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Hulk (comics) Theory of conduct Philosophical skepticism Out-of-body experience The Shining (film) Hypnosis Shaggy dog story Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Slayers Unconscious mind Sleep Dean Koontz Treehouse of Horror V Nightmare Piccolo Junior Saga AFI 100 Years series Pitaten The Simpsons Apt Pupil Urinary incontinence Nightmares (Buffy episode) Spidey Super Stories Invader Zim Doug The Nightmare Before Christmas The Secret of NIMH A Nightmare on Elm Street (series) EastEnders Nightmare at 20,000 Feet (The Twilight Zone) The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Milton H.
