i am starting to get really worried about this dream i've been having can someone please help okay so in my dream is about the first day of school i am wondering around in the halls completely lost and by myself i ask someone for help but they just give me a disgusted look and walk away i finally find my counclers room and i go to talk to her but she just says mmhmm and never even looks at me and when i come home from school my mom always asks me how my day went and i always tell her that it was horrible and she just replys that's great honey i've been having this dream for weeks and i just can't shake it off can someone please tell me what it is about anxiety about being all alone unprepared and misunderstood it's perfectly understandable when getting into a new situation take steps to make sure it doesn't happen go to the new place before you have to be there to make sure you can find everything correctly talk to yourself and someone you love and set a date that if you are unhappy and uncomfortable you'll try something else but the best way is to get it over with your mind always makes it worse than it will ever be in real life Fiddler on the Roof Shaggy dog story Miss Saigon Hide and Q (TNG episode) Avenue Q Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Milton H.
