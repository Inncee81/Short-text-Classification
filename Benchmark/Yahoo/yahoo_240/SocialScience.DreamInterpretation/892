ive had dreams that i was raping a girl and it really scared me does anybody know anything about this this really scared me because i know i'm not a rapist i think i may just be really horny one reason this really scares me is because even though i know i would never do it i can't say i know that i would never do it if i was intoxicated maybe i just watch too much tv but ive seen many shows when people raped someone when they were really drunk or something i would say yes you are just really horny for that you should take matters in your own hands rape is more about control then sex maybe on some levels you feel out of control in your life especially in the dating arena i would also suggest a visit to a good therapist just to sort out your feelings before they get outta control good luck Rape Statutory rape Avenue Q Sin City Theory of conduct Abortion debate Satanic ritual abuse EastEnders The Lovely Bones Great Teacher Onizuka Human sexual behavior The Catcher in the Rye Dead Like Me Sexual addiction Nip/Tuck About a Boy Jon Secada Maison Ikkoku Birth control Red Scare Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Abduction Phenomenon Charles Ives Cybersex Comfort women Rape fantasy Traumatic incident reduction Luck Silent Night, Deadly Night Transsexuality Aquemini Very special episode Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Anarchism and society Penis removal Birthday Milton H.
