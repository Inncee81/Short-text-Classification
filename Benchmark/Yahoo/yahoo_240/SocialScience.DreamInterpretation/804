dream interpretation please help weird dream so it started out with me getting an ultrasound and they found twins i was ecstatic then i all of a sudden was in labor first i gave birth to a boy and then when i was going to give birth to the second baby my boyfriend started chasing me down and was going to hurt me i was running from him and calling for help but no one would acknowledge me i hid up in the attic of this house and was not able to give birth to the second child then all of a sudden everything went okay and i had the second baby a girl my boyfriend and i were okay and it ended with us being happy with our new born babies this all happened in one day also when i was running i left somewhere outside and these people ive never met before started asking me questions to which i didnt answer they acted like they didnt hear me when i told them i was in distress any ideas this is really weird i got this information from a dream book so far its been proven correct by me if you are pregnant in real life it means it means you'll have a good labor but if you arent you will not be happy in your marriage having twins means you'll have a happy family life seeing your bf means that youll find a partner which will give you emotional and financial estability well thats all i can really help you with good luck Kodocha EastEnders Friends Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pregnancy Childbirth Charmed Avenue Q One Tree Hill (TV series) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Leo Wyatt Neighbours Alois Hitler Divorce Shaggy dog story History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Jon Secada Fiddler on the Roof Pitaten Days of our Lives Babe Carey Boston Public The Shining (film) Nicomachean Ethics Social rule Sex and the City Care Bears Meaning of life 7th Heaven Romulus and Remus Breastfeeding Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Anne Boleyn Goodness and value theory Jacob Miss Saigon Princess Marie-Th__r__se-Charlotte The Inside Grumpy's Three Wishes Cliff Richard Paranoia Agent Melanie Wilkes Chuck Cunningham syndrome The Ashlee Simpson Show Abortion debate The Lovely Bones Prenatal diagnosis Death of a Salesman Earth Girl Arjuna Halting problem Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Theory of conduct Full House Charles Lee Ray Twin W.I.T.C.H.
