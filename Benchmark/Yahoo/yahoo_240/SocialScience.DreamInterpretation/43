does this dream mean anything last night i had a dream that i was handed a gun and i used it to commit suicide normally i wouldnt think anything of it but i have issues with depression and self harm im fourteen years old and i was wondering if this is a sign of anything i used to go to a therapist for about six months but my mom had me stop going last month any ideas would be appreciated part of my depression does come from my father he has been depressed his whole life and in october he had to be put in a hospital for his illness could that be the person behind it you probably answered your own question since you have some sort of depression in reality projecting having a hand gun to commit suicide is a way to release your depression in reality in other words there are things that you dare not to do it in real life but you wanted to try it in dream dreaming is one of the ways people use it to escape from reality it is no exception in your case however sometimes if we manifest the problem it will get worse it all depends on the problem if you get to a point that you can control your depression i think you should stop going to a therapist or you may get worse for example some people will get sicker by seeing a doctor the doctor will discover reveal more problems that is good thing but if after discovery there is no cure that will become worse therapist or doctor tends to understand your problem first fixing it is another issue that is why i said if you can understand your problem in your case depression if you can fix it yourself try to do it get someone you can rely on and talk it out of course if you get to a point that you can't stand anyone and you need some professional to help you by all means that will be your last resource and i wish you well that i could understand why your mom wanted you to stop many people have that mentality that seeing a doctor will get sicker the truth of the matter is seeing a doctor will help you understand more the problem but the doctor won't promise to heal you as far as dream goes it is a release of what you can't do in reality don't take it so seriously about it they are only symbols some people will be stupid enough to listen to their own subconscious mind or dream symbols literally you are not telling yourself to kill yourself you are just telling yourself you are seeking help gun power support commit suicide giving up you may be giving up something in life in your case depression and gun is power or support in symbol it can end your life if you translate literally but it also means support you are seeking for support in that translation good luck Suicide Theory of conduct Clinical depression Philosophy of language Simone Weil Reiki Transsexuality Reparative therapy Psychiatric hospital Contract Autism Bipolar disorder Milton H.
