dreams of dead relatives my father passed away when i was nearly ten years old my mother told me when i was much younger that whenever i would have a dream about my dad it was sort of his way of reaching out to me sometimes i still have dreams about him and they're the most casual normal situations i'm involved in but my dad's there just as i remembered him being when i last saw him is it possible what my mother said is true and what do those dreams mean also why don't i really dream of him him much these days it's not that he's on my mind constantly i guess because i was so young i've grown used to things being as they are now it's just sort of been killing me lately because it's like for that short dream i've got a piece of my life back that i never really got to have do not let anyone take away what ever comfort your dreams give you as a child i dreamed of my uncle being beaten and thrown in a trash can the next night it happened but he survived and is now dreams can be a way of the subconscious mind finding refuge during troubled times as well as a path for the unexplained as humans we use only of our brain who is to say what the other could achieve or is capable of keep a journal track your days and your dreams see if you tend to dream of your father during times that are troubled or stressed if not then maybe your mom was right if her words gave you comfort accept them and enjoy those stolen moments with your father The Amber Spyglass Infantilism Scenes from a Memory Social rule Miss Saigon Dream About a Boy Kurt Cobain Grandview, U.S.A.
