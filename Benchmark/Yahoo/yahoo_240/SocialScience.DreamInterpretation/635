weird dream okay this is really funny so you should read the whole thing okay so it started off i walked into my house that i lived in as a child and when i opened the front door the door stopped because it hit the coffee table i looked behind the door and there was my mom and my brother counting fruit loops it was the wierdest dream i had ever had not too long after that i had a dream that there was this big giant red barn and i walked into it and there was like a lot of dogs hanging by clothespins by their tails on clotheslines isnt that weird if anyone thinks they know what any of this means let me know i think it depends primarily on the emotional or contemplative state you were in prior to sleeping how was your day that day take the barn dream for example what was your reaction to seeing the dogs on the clothe lines during the dream were you shocked did you seem like you were almost required to free them from the clotheslines usually when i have strange dreams it somehow relates to a fear or anxiety i was facing earlier in the day the first dream mentioned sounds like it was relating to a sense of nostalgia or family your brother and mother were there doing a mundane activity requiring cooperation together walking into your old house might represent a sense of longing or something similar i'm no dream expert but that's my best guess Shaggy dog story Out-of-body experience Dean Koontz Dog Doug Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Egyptian language Fire fighting Garfield RuneScape quests The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe The Brady Bunch EastEnders God Emperor of Dune W.I.T.C.H.
