ok dream interpreters answer me this strange dream i was on the titanic with my grandma she had a goblet and dressing gown night dress thing she was proud of because they were heirlooms or something as the titanic started sinking we decided to get off as fast as possible i dunno where my grandma went but i'm pretty sure me and harry potter recently watched it so that's probably why i still think it's funny were trying to find a way off the boat we got on the safe side couldn't explain it to yah if i knew when they were telling us to get back on the other side so they could use us as weights to level the boat everyone knew it was ridiculous and kept running into the water away from titanic so after the struggle i was in my grandmas garage she asked me why i didn't go back and get the goblet and dressing gowns i felt so ashamed but i wanted to get off because you know it was kinda sinking so we then went to like mcdonald burger king place and we all ordered smoothies and i order like hamburgers and a happy meal so it was time to go and i put all the hamburgers in my happy meal box we drove around and my cousin wanted more food so we were trying to find a drive thru i guess and i woke up strangest thing a lot of this sounds like everyday stuff like from the movie you saw etc but you're a survivior that's for sure and you don't wnat to let grandma down but you put your priorities straight and she obviously loves and forgives you because you all were happy right after i couldn't think of a better dream family EastEnders Humphrey Bogart Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Phoebe Buffay's songs Hamburger Grandview, U.S.A.
