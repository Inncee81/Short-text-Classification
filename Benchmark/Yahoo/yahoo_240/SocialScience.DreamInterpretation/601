this is too mysterious a little intro i like anime and was obsessed with this anime groove adventure rave and i felt that the female lead's past was really mysterious ok then i had this dream i was walking through a forest i saw a very beautiful castle similiar to the one i watched in rave then i realised that i was travelling with this guy supposedly named karm he told me that by entering the castle i would uncover all secrets and mysteries of my past i walked past a lake and my reflection was that of a girl who looked like the female lead anyway i was walking to the castle when something bizzare happened an army of salamander arrived and seemed to be attacking me with arrows owww and i was struggling to get into the castle door and that was when i woke up and i think i died in the dream so what i'm trying to say is there's something preventing me from unlocking my past but what is it can someone explain this whole thing to me i think that the beautiful castle is the future that you want travel guy is the husband you expect to have one day the reflection is you today watching anime him telling you about mysteries means you want to be mysterious the arrows are hamlet's arrows of outragous fortunes the difficulties that you are going to face in achieving that beautiful future RuneScape quests Rave Master The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Father's Day (Doctor Who) Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Paranoia Agent Eggerland series Scenes from a Memory The Amber Spyglass Link (Legend of Zelda) The Pilgrim's Progress Miss Saigon Cobra Commander Shaggy dog story Predestination paradox Parsifal InuYasha media and release information Teen Girl Squad K' Seiken Densetsu 3 The Invisibles Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Episodes of Lost (Season 2) God Emperor of Dune StarCraft: Uprising Samurai Deeper Kyo Transformers: Robots in Disguise Smallville (Season 3) Otello The Legend of Zelda series characters The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Children of Dune The Shining (film) Masters of the Universe Friends The Star Wars Holiday Special Beauty and the Beast (1991 film) Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones Disgaea: Hour of Darkness G-Man (Half-Life) Sin City Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Rave party Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Subtle Knife Red Vs.
