the illusion of true love a strange dream i was in the chemistry lab studying and there was this cute guy doing experiments when we met each other's eyes he smiled at me and i smiled back and said hello we did this for a few days then one day after he finished his lab project and was about to go home he said this is my last day bye i asked him if he was walking home and he yes so since i was as well we walked together it was evening but still light when we were walking we got to know each other we were so comfortable with each other he put his arms around me he kissed me passionately he told me how beautiful i was and that i was his dream girl we were in love i could feel it then it got dark nighttime and i realized that i had walked home with him to the neighbourhood where he lived i started getting anxious then out of nowhere this man came out and he had a knife at first i wasnt scared because i was expecting my new lover to rescue me he just stood there frozen in fear i begged him and i pleaded with him to save me i woke up i felt scared and insecure just completely and utterly alone brommy wow thats pretty accurate i broke up with my bf a couple of weeks ago he just started ignoring me all of a sudden and never gave me an explanation as to why it parallels my dream now that i think about it p s thanks for the compliment but i dont think i should be a writer english is my worst subject im more of a science geek very very interesting that you perceived the time lapse of a few days that is so rare do you do that oft please consider starting a dream journal this will sent a clear message to your spirit subconscious that you are listening to what it is sending in the dreams feeling true love from a man that will then desert you in time of knife is odd i'm stubbed but may have a clue was this a flip dream slept dreampt woke briefly then back to dreamin where you left off if so how long were you awake how much thought on this dream while awake between if any significant amount i would say it was a good true dream of love even christ but you woke then altered the dream when it reopened at the knife part knifes by the way can be symbols of eternal marriage especially big 'uns if not flip dream i'm at a lost solly a pure love gone bad is poignant indeed please do not stop dreaming about love that is the sweetest of paridicial dreams is it not The Amber Spyglass Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Scenes from a Memory Milton H.
