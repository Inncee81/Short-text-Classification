i keep on having dreams about this guy who is my bf in my dream who isn't in real life confusing he has dark brown girl hair and i saw him at a water park after i had my first dream about him what bites maybe he is real and you are dreaming of him maybe there is some link between your minds maybe he is your soulmate or something yes i know this sounds scifi but the average human being is using only a small part of its brain who knows what your mind can do at full capacity it's some kind of sign maybe or maybe you just saw him on the street and he got in your mind and you only remember him in your dreams who knows Lucid dreaming Dream W.I.T.C.H.
