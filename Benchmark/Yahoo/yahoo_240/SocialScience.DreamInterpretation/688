why do we usually forget our dreams right away when we wake up i think its bizzare there is also a theory in metaphysical circles that when you dream you are often leaving your body in what is called an astral projection meaning that your conciousness leaves your physical vehicle behind for a few hours and collects experiences on another plane of being when you are in your physical body your brain interprets all of your experiences in terms of your physical senses you remember things that you saw heard felt etc if you are operating in anything other than a physical framework your brain really has no frame of reference with which to interprate your experiences therefore while you may not have forgotten it you have no way of conveniently calling it up to your concious memory Out-of-body experience Astral projection Consciousness Dream Astral plane Lucid dreaming Metaphysics Astral body Mind Quantum mechanics Memory New Age Cognitive science Mind transfer Sleep Philosophy of mind Hypnosis Immanuel Kant Infinity Human Immortality Telepathy Philosophy of mathematics Cordelia Chase Philosophy of perception Religion Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Mental plane Unconscious mind Theory The nature of God in Western theology Deconstruction Cyberspace Psychology Causality Common sense Lorentz group Albert Einstein Property (ownership right) Philosophy of language Brain Emanuel Swedenborg Psychosis Long-term memory Alchemy Rudolf Hermann Lotze Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics David Bohm Science Plane (Dungeons & Dragons) Sense Ekadasi Animism The Invisibles Edgar Cayce Frame fields in general relativity Spiritual evolution Occam's Razor Philosophy of space and time Philosophical skepticism Activity theory D__j__ vu Subtle body Reincarnation A Course In Miracles Mass Origin belief Sign (semiotics) Objectivist philosophy Determinism Thomism Neuro-linguistic programming Pi Luminiferous aether Gee Free will Aristotle Physics Manifold W.I.T.C.H.
