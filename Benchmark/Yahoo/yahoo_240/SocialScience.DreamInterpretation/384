ok i had a weird dream and was hoping someone could tell me what it meant ok i was walking into my kitchen and there was a couple snails on the counters and the floor when all the sudden there were baby birds coming into the house and eating the snails i finally got all the birds out of the house and went back in and there were snails everywhere you couldn't walk without stepping on them then my mom came in and put what looked like little marbles in the fishtank and snails grew from them i'm not sure what this could mean i did just find out that i'm not pregnant which i am desperatly wanting to be please help me if you can thanks snails to see a snail in your dream suggests that you are being overly sensitive you may feel inhibited but desire to be more outgoing and energetic alternatively it suggests that you are making steady progress toward a goal you need to go at your own pace Shaggy dog story Snail Squidward Tentacles One Tree Hill (TV series) Days of our Lives The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Knots Landing Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Out-of-body experience Dog Episodes of Lost (Season 1) SpongeBob SquarePants Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an A Day in the Life Grammatical mood Kurt Cobain 1957 World Series Breastfeeding Jon Secada Mary Poppins Jean Grey Alois Hitler Franklin (television series) Hall & Oates K' Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Freeters EastEnders Gary the Snail Pain Volleyball The Inside The Contender (television series) The Tracey Ullman Show shorts Equine conformation RuneScape quests The Amber Spyglass Humphrey Bogart Friends Weight training Hera Characters in the Smurfs Phoebe Halliwell Sharon Tate Milton H.
