hi i had a really weir dream does anyone knows what it means well is about my husband and i the dream was very cleard but all i rememberd was that we were in our old school were we met we were just visiting bu it was nothing like our old school it had a lot of steps all over we were wearing regular cloth at first and then all i rememberd was that i was running to to meet with him and all of a suden i was running on a hall way that was fence in and i saw my husband running in the other side smiling at me we were both running in different fence in hall ways and the weird thing is that at the end we were wearing costums he was wearing batmans and i was wearing cattubella i think is call batmans women help well that is a peculiar dream but the wonderful thing is you were with your husband there and he was just happy to be with you i think eventually you would have found a way to get together and it seems that you are both helpful people perhaps even before you met up with each other that's what i think the costumes mean that you help people without bragging about it or that you help them behind the scenes i think you picked up on how lucky your husband feels just to be with you that's why he is smiling all the time he did not appear to be worried that you were apart or separate from each other either and you both seemed genuinely concerned about each others welfare before your own which is neat that's my impression of your dream Characters of The Sandman Catwoman Social rule Avenue Q Marilyn Monroe Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) AFI 100 Years series Batman Beyond Doris Day Fiddler on the Roof The McGuire Sisters Pitaten Kodocha We'll Always Have Paris (TNG episode) Fictional crossover Captain Britain Penguin (comics) Jam (TV series) Batman Laguna Loire Father's Day (Doctor Who) Robin (comics) Whose Line Is It Anyway?
