dreams and remembering i am positive that i had a dream last night however today i can't remember it but when i see certain things throughout the day a flash of memory of the dream comes in my head but before i have the chance to think about it and remember it the memory leaves again this happens to me often i know it sounds odd but does this happen to anyone else and what is it when you have a dream you want to remember just as you wake out of it think about it before you get up make some sense of it put the thought into your waking mind because by the time you go to the bathroom it may be gone it doesn't take long just a bridge thought while you're in between full awake and leaving the dream Philosophical skepticism Lucid dreaming Dream Time Out of Mind Out-of-body experience Jon Secada Miss Saigon Datalore (TNG episode) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Scenes from a Memory The Lovely Bones Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Shining (film) Saga (band) Social rule The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Dream Theater Dance of the Vampires Sleep Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man House of M 50 First Dates Salad Fingers D__j__ vu Avenue Q Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Death Comes to Time Characters of The Sandman Qualia Mat Cauthon Unconscious mind Children of Dune Derren Brown (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction K' Mental image Random Harvest The Amber Spyglass The Champions Haibane Renmei Carrie Jacobs-Bond We'll Always Have Paris (TNG episode) Hey Jude Parsifal Grandview, U.S.A.
