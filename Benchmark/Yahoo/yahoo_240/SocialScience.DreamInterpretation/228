what do dreams of death mean lately its all that my dreams seem to be about its either me just about to die or someone close to me dying ive had alot of stressful issues going on with my job boyfriend and with other close friends i dont know if thats got anything to do with it either way its really freaking me out so please help your 'dreams' are just your subconscious mind trying to 'work out' what your conscious mind can't or won't work out when you are awake you are 'dreaming about death' of yourself or someone close to you because you are 'so stressed out' that you wish you were dead try 'reducing your stress' and your 'nightmares' should go away Unconscious mind Consciousness Out-of-body experience Dream Scenes from a Memory Sleep Lucid dreaming Edgar Cayce Nightmare A Nightmare on Elm Street Philosophy of mind Characters of The Sandman Infantilism W.I.T.C.H.
