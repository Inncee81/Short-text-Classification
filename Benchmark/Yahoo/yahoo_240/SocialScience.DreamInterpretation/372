liquid dreams i have these dream occasionaly can someone tell of how to get ties all the time i think there cool unless you are referring to wet dreams i think the word you are looking for is lucid these are no easy thing to do took me years to become master of my domain hardest part about a lucid dream is knowing when it is a dream if you suspect you are dreaming just ask if it sounds silly to you then most likely you are awake and the people laughing at you are real just remember people in your dream will react the way you think they will react if you ask if this is a dream it is likely they will laugh at you or deny it other way to tell if it is a dream is if you can do something you normally can't do fly survive a huge fall by the way when i fall off a cliff in a lucid dream i climb or fly back up and jump off again for fun or survive anything you wouldn't normally survive breath underwater don't fight it beat the crude out of zombies or other mythical creatures you have to make yourself aware of fall asleep the night you want a lucid dream have a routine before bed i find that on nights that i don't follow a routine are the ones that i have normal dreams but over all force yourself to become a wear of the dream other tips watch less tv sadly tv does little to inspire a lucid dream it inspires watching a dream those dreams can be fun but i much rather have full control read more this can have a strange effect the way i see it you accomplished a lucid dream if you can read what is in it not saying it will make any sense but it will sound important at the time perform in plays i did plays nothing big improved plays as well you would be surprised how much this helps biggest tip write write write short stories novels hell write your perfect idea of a dream journals anything creative creative writing will inspire creative dreaming i once wrote out my dream garden and three nights later i dreamed about it kicked some major zombie butt in it to honestly don't know why i dream of beating up zombies but it's fun video games play more just do it you know you want to but stragtic games will help you to feel more in control play them before bed in you will have more control disclaimer results may vary Lucid dreaming Dream Out-of-body experience Spidey Super Stories Super Mario 64 The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Consciousness Dream Theater Diving The Amber Spyglass Philosophical skepticism Avenue Q Theory of conduct Social rule Aerial (dance move) Tag Jon Secada Shaggy dog story One Piece minor characters Futurama (TV series - season 5) Paul W.
