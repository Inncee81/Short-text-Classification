i just started playing nlhe at a casino any advice for an internet player switching to live action i am an experienced low limit player online logging thousands of hours and showing a modest profit playing a variety of styles i find myself playing very very tight at the casino because i'm so uncomfortable bluffing ive only raise bluffed a few times and i've logged over hours although i have no trouble keeping my cool with making continuation bets i don't know how to act when i bluff but i feel like acting like im bluffing has been an important part of getting loose calls when i'm strong i find myself very uncomfortable calling straddles with anything other than ak aqs in lp i can convince myself to call with suited connect and pp i never call on the flop so i can take the pot away on a bluff on later street a play i make all the time online i have shown a really good profit much better than online but i worry that my one dimensional style will eventually dry the well as all the regulars begin to learn how tight i am how do i loosen up in real life i just think you need to get comfortable playing that's all eventually you will learn that keeping your cool and not giving away tells isn't all that important not to say that it doesn't matter at all but it is overrated and then you will be able to make some of the riskier plays you want to and you are right in that eventually your action will dry up because of how tight you play and probably also because i would expect that by playing that way you will end up winning Poker jargon Bluff (poker) Betting (poker) Texas hold 'em Poker Draw poker Craps Omaha hold 'em Blackjack Online poker Stud poker Community card poker Sandbagging (poker) Theory of conduct Poker tournament Tilt (poker) Social rule Poker strategy Cheating in poker Seven-card stud Gambling Hollywood Squares Wheel of Fortune Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Ra (board game) Friends Strap-on dildo MMORPG Upholstery Backgammon Kasparov versus The World Textile manufacturing Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act True Crime: Streets of LA Avenue Q Five-card stud Quicksort Dairy Contract bridge Keynesian economics Undergarment Milton H.
