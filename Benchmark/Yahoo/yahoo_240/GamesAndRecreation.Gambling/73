what do you think of people asking for passwords to tournies online i live in japan and am fortunate enough to have learned the language which has enabled me to join two local poker assocations both of these associations have exclusive freerolls at poker stars once a week which naturally require a password they keep a tally of the winner's points a leaderboard and the top get a fully paid trip to attend an international poker tournament in the carribean however i also know a lot of foreigners who live in my country and i've been getting pestered for passwords i've told them the same thing if you'd like to join the leagues i'd be happy to help translate the webpage for you so you can join but i'm not going to give away the password so far no one's been interested what do you think about people asking for passwords is it really unethical or not that big of a deal i would hope if that if someone that wasn't supposed to be in the tournament actually won they wouldn't give them the prize so i say no big deal if it were me i would do exactly what you are doing if they want to play they can join the club Poker jargon Online poker Poker tournament Poker World Poker Tour World Series of Poker Tournament Texas hold 'em Pyramid (game show) Game show Slot machine Password (game) Poker Superstars Invitational Tournament Gambling Blackjack Mahjong The Contender (television series) Contract bridge Draw poker Password Sport in Ireland Dave Ulliott $ale of the Century Rugby union PGA Tour Magic: The Gathering The Open Championship Ken Jennings ELO rating system Internet fraud Playoff The Price Is Right Pai gow poker Dominoes Chain Reaction (game show) Norway national football team Paul Ince Satchel Paige Electronic sports Animal Crossing Football World Cup Cheating in poker T.
