scared of sales i need to know how i can overcome my actual fear of performing sales i have been employed as a manager in a corporate environment for several years however i have worked for someone else i have no marketing skills i have some college course work completed at the same time there are several example of successful entrepreneurs that do not have college education i really want to know from serious individuals how i overcome this barrier in addition i have never had the ambition to become an entrepreneur another situation i am afraid of however it appears that if i want to enjoy the rest of my life without fear of being broke this is the way i have come to the realization that all successful entrepreneurs have had to conduct sales to some degree real advice only thank you i have been in sales now for six months and it can be scary at first the best way to get over this fear is just to do it for example when you are telemarketing you probably look at the phone and think i just don't want to call well when you break it down logically what are you scared of fear of the unknown fear of rejection being hung up on not knowing what to say all of this dosen't really matter you have to know that they are not rejecting you personally they just do not want what you are currently selling and after being in sales you will see that you will find alot of these people compared to people actually wanting your product and it might even shock you at first when they want to meet now if you are planning to cold call by going door to door realize that they probably do not want to see you most businesses have the no soliciting sign on the door walk past that bad boy and if they call you out on it say you didn't see it your goal on a cold call is to set an appointment for the future it would be pretty rare if your contact would actually want to meet face to face on a cold call this just shows respect for the client couple more things believe in what you sell if you don't how will a prospect last thing if you are scared of calls just pick up the phone and dial who cares if they get pissed move on to the next person and you will eventually find that person if none of this works sales might not be your thing good luck and always remember smile and dial Telemarketing Shaggy dog story Jon Secada Humphrey Bogart Plame affair Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Milton H.
