i am a high school student and i am interested in becoming an independent sales rep where do i go from here i am only in high school but i already know that i would like to do some thing that involves sales i like the fact that an independent sales rep can pretty much pick his own hours and time that he works this job seems like a good option for me but i do not know much about it what can i do in high school to prepare for a job in sales and for anyone who is already a sales rep any info on the job itself would be perfect thanks first this is a good thing that already a this young age you are open minded some people will past their entire life without knowing what is it they want to do been an independant rep can be hard at time if you work in a company that pays only commision on your personnal effort because eveyone try to destroy the other ones in order to get the best commission possible there is other way and these are a lot more profitable working along with people that want the best possible result for you is not common in traditionnal business this is why i hated the corporate world until i discovered the company i'm presently affiliate with the latest technologies are ours to market and we all help each other because that way everyone have success the key is we only take people whom are serious about having a great life and are willing to learn and stay on the side of integrity anyhow if you want to start learning you can communicate with me via my portal http brigittevallee acnrep com Internet fraud Unemployment Electronic commerce Microeconomics Extreme Programming United Kingdom corporation tax Supply and demand Investment bank W.
