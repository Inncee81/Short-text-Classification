how can i become a star in my work place i would like to be star in my department i can say i know everything in the department what should i do i don't like the word star myself but i think you could be an asset by knowing more about what others do i'm in a job where i have the opportunity to cross train and help others outside of my own postion this gives me more rounded knowledge of the department company as a whole offer to help out as long as you have your own work completed ask for special project hopefully they're not junk i was given a couple of projects and it let me try my own creativity they gave me the ball and i ran with it it works well if you have an employer that does't abuse your willingness to help Management Employment Asset Exploitation Plame affair Glossary of American football Mergers and acquisitions Security guard Game development Graduate school Oxford English Dictionary Electronic Arts Dubai Enron Corporation Game programmer Spam (electronic) Lawyer Amtrak Cascades Economic inequality Summa Theologiae Creative industries Human capital United States Department of Labor Paralegal Australian rules football President (game) Strategic management Super Bowl XXVI Enterprise content management AT&T Corporate finance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Advertising agency Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway University of Pretoria Military of Switzerland Milton H.
