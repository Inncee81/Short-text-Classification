will i get to be the controller please read need advice i accepted a job at a local dealership as an accountant the pay is to start i have to work monday thru friday every other saturday when i interviewed with the current controller her boss they explained that i would eventually take over the current controller's position however i have been there two weeks i have ascertained that the current controller is a total control freak she has wanted me to do deposits book deals etc basically the stuff the clerk does she refuses to show me anything she does on a daily basis now i realize i have been there only two weeks but i have worked for a dealership before doing the same thing she also set up the accounting system it must be followed exactly as she has it she lets me know daily mistakes i have made i really do not think this lady will leave if she does is she going to give me autonomy or micro manage me i think the job gives her purpose also did i mention she is the gf of the owner advice if you want to stay in the company make her feel that you don't want her job she might relax on you a little bit the way i see it though it is better to look for greener pastures it is very unlikely that she will relinquish her post peace and blessings The Apprentice 2 Sydney Riot of 1879 MTV2 The Drew Carey Show The Daily Telegraph Social rule Wheel of Fortune Dilbert ITV Ocean's Twelve Rosa Parks One Tree Hill (TV series) Laura Schlessinger Book of Mormon A Course In Miracles Big Brother (Australian TV series) Canadian House of Commons Gospel EastEnders Cincinnati Bengals George Costanza Oakland Athletics Alex Ferguson Avenue Q New York Giants Workplace democracy Internet fraud Sabbath CPU design United Kingdom corporation tax Plame affair Computer Air America Radio Knots Landing 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Billboard Hot 100 Charmed The Daily Show Saturday Night Live National Football League The Colbert Report The Ashlee Simpson Show Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Easter Hey Jude Tris Speaker James T.
