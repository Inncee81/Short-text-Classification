what does it mean when one of your eyes goes kinda fuzzy this happend months ago and it is doing it again you know when you stare at a bright light and then look away aand you can still see the light well that is gappening w out staring at any lights and it hurts really bad has any one has this before or knows anything about it its just my left eye last time is was the feft it got so bad i had to go home from school times over two weeks we went to a docter but they did not say anything help please not being a doctor i can't tell you what it means but i can tell you about something that i suffer from which may be a starting point for you about a year ago i suddenly noticed a sort of fuzziness out of one eye it started as a small spot in my visual field and then it grew and grew after about or minutes it went away but it terrified me it was fuzzy but there were also really really bright lights and strange shapes and no matter where i looked or whether i shut my eyes or not made no difference a couple of weeks later it happened again out of nowhere then maybe nothing for several months and then it happened again i went to the doctor and he confirmed that i was experiencing migraine aura my doctor recognised it immediately because he suffers from it too i have no pain with it but apparently that is rare for most people who have the condition it is accompanied by or it immediately precedes a severe migraine my doctor says he has to take painkillers and immediately go and lie down in a quiet room in the dark until it passes there is no treatment as far as i am aware thankfully i don't suffer any pain at all with it i just have to pull over if i'm driving for example until it passes i still get it every now and then and it is not always the same eye though mostly the same one months could pass with nothing and then suddenly i get it three days running anyway i am not saying that you have migraine aura but i guess it's a possibility the weird visual disturbance accompanied by bad pain certainly fits the bill there's loads of info on the net about the subject i'd look it up and see whether it sounds familiar and visit a doctor again and ask them to consider whether you might be suffering from this condition Migraine Shaggy dog story Eye Cluster headache Out-of-body experience The Parting of the Ways Solar eclipse The Shining (film) Color blindness Triage Epilepsy Social rule Hal Trosky Sin City G-Man (Half-Life) Headache Bad Wolf Chronic fatigue syndrome Floater Equine conformation Father's Day (Doctor Who) Clinical depression Miss Saigon Autism Urinary incontinence Miscarriage Opportunity rover Scenes from a Memory Breastfeeding USS Tunny (SS-282) Pain Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Hypnosis Theory of conduct New York Giants Rose (Doctor Who) Mothman Pittsburgh Steelers Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Mental Health Act 1983 Cephalic disorder Super Bowl XXVII Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Piccolo Junior Saga Jon Secada The Keeper of Traken Doctor Strange Decompression sickness Boom Town (Doctor Who) The Empty Child Doctor Who (Enemy Within) Sydney Riot of 1879 Retina Dyslexia Multiple chemical sensitivity Anorexia nervosa Sunglasses Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Autostereogram Mountaineering The X-Files (season 1) Blonde on Blonde Fitz Hugh Ludlow Seizure Open cluster TARDIS Traumatic incident reduction Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Blood on the Tracks Narcissism She Loves You Radiation therapy Stuttering The End of the World (Doctor Who) Stereoscopy Scientology beliefs and practices Transactional analysis 1957 World Series Tank Mount Pinatubo Controversies in autism Stroke Childbirth Chlorpromazine San Francisco 49ers Sant Thakar Singh Astronomy on Mars I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue The Amber Spyglass Hubble Space Telescope Apparent magnitude Ben Johnson (athlete)
