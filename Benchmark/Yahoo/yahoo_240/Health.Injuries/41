broken arm ok so i have just taken my cast off my arm i had a fractured wrist basically and i have had enough its been about a week since i did it and i took the cast off just now whats the worst that can happen will it still heal ok i am not using it mind i am keeping it as still as possible i have a wrist support thing i can wear would that help things maybe today has been the worst day ever i spilled oil paint on the floor aswell anyone know how to get that off carpet depending on the break you could be setting yourself up for trouble at best the bones will displace and heal causing a deformity crooked wrist with possible permanent loss of function the danger with a wrist fracture isn't lateral movement side to side but the direct front to back pressure in other words if you're still using your hand to push or pull you're causing more damage all the time a wrist support will only control side to side movement everytime the bone shifts even slightly the whole healing process has to start again you'll end up with bone calluses and possible nerve damage nerve damage can result in permanent disability loss of feeling or chronic pain in the area at worst you'll get muscle atrophy your muscles will shrink and you'll lose some function get the cast replaced they'll have to x ray it again to see what damage you've done and they may need to re set it Bone fracture Traumatic brain injury Professional wrestling holds Humerus Equine conformation Wrist Penis Arm Hip fracture Cephalic disorder Sailing Anatomical terms of location Elbow-joint Urinary incontinence Diving Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Paget's disease of bone Stopping power Post Polio syndrome Replacement joint Osteoarthritis Muscle Milton H.
