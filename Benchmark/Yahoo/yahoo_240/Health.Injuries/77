hamstring problems ok i was playing in a soccer game and it was fine till after the game then my hamstring started hurting i jsut thought it was sore so i just stretched but now it still hurts and its been months how am i going to get rid of it soccer season starts in one month sounds like you may have tore your hamstring you have created scar tissue in your hamstring that is why you have not been doing better actually when you tear your hamstring you should not stretch this is one thing that a lot of people do wrong put it this way if you tore something would you actually want to stretch it to make it tear more what you need to do now is get in with a physical therapist that deals with athletes and does myofascial release or an active release provider activerelease com you need someone to get in there and tear up that scar tissue and let it heal the right way you could actually pull this off before the beginning of your season if you find the right person to work on you hope this helps and good luck Massage Ken Griffey, Jr. The Contender (television series) Red Hot Chili Peppers Anterior cruciate ligament Running Andr__s Galarraga Weight training Social rule Babe Ruth Scar Roger Clemens Stretching Carpal tunnel syndrome Ben Johnson (athlete) Piccolo Junior Saga Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Detroit Tigers Cork City F.C.
