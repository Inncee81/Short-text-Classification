is a k in cross country hard what is an average finishing time in a k i ran my first xc race in over a year last year it was a km for junior girl i was times are so hard to judge in xc becuase the courses are so different the only way you can compar is running on the same course or coparing it to other people in the race you were in i ran or races last year and only races were on the same course the reason why it changes so much is the hills and the different terriane hills make it far more difficult thee for adding time and it the course if mudding wet and slippery it may add time but you should wear spike to make both the terane and hill easier to take because it gives you a lot of grip for example i passed two people right before the finish line becuase they didn't have spikes and they sliped and fell in mud trying to run a hill on averge i ran between min depending on the course and i am not a very good long distance runner i am a spriter so you'll robably do better than me every one has good day and every one has bad days so don't be too worried about your time in xc places is what matter but as a bigginer don't be too worried about that either before every race just say i want to run harder becuase if you say i want to beat that person and you don't you'll get dissapointed or if you say i want to run a certian time and you hit a hill and it was harder on you than expected you won't be dissaointed run you first race hard get used to what is going on and then strive to run harder becuase especially in cross country every course and eveyr race is totally different good luck Cross-country skiing Fell running Fast bowling Cross country running Tire Theory of conduct Social rule Olympic medalists in athletics (men) Drag racing Marathon (sport) Paula Radcliffe The Amazing Race Lake Speed Indianapolis 500 Paragliding Softball Ty Cobb 2000 Australian Grand Prix Bubble Bobble Dog agility Tour de France Equine conformation In The Groove (game) Boston Marathon Canada at the 2004 Summer Olympics Craps Anchor Golf Triathlon Norway national football team Athletics at the 1896 Summer Olympics Gliding Hal Trosky Tenshinhan 24 Hours of Le Mans New York Giants Aerial (dance move) International League Chris Amon Baseball statistics CPU cache 2005 Iditarod Mountaineering Wave Race: Blue Storm Penske Racing Laws of cricket Pump It Up Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Hurdling The Great Race (Care Bears) Time Out of Mind Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Tony Stewart Peachtree Road Race Bon Jovi Torquay United F.C.
