why do i get stomach cramps while i run i run about to miles every day my legs never cramp up it's only my stomach more specifically either the right or left areas under my ribs after maybe the first minutes of running the cramps start my old cross country coach told me it was because i was breathing incorrectly she told me to inhale only through my nose and exhale only through my mouth consecutively so far it hasn't been working unless i'm using that technique incorrectly and i never eat within at least hours before i run nor do i drink a lot of water before or during the run so can anybody tell me why this is happening and how to prevent this first it is still a big mystery to many physiologists and doctors as to what is the real cause of stomach cramps the experts have theorized that the common side stitch as they are sometimes called it's short for a long complicated medical term is caused by the exertion that running and bouncing forces inside the abdominal walls basically your stomach and other organs like the spleen and liver bump into each other as your feet jar the ground causing connective tissue to stretch on the nerves and cause pain this connective tissue is also attached to your diaphragm which helps with breathing this pain is usually on the right side and just under the ribs exercise like horseback riding running and sit ups are common causes of the side stitch here are some ways to prevent or lessen the pain of the common side stitch do not run on a full stomach you shouldn t drink large amounts of water or eat hours before exercise sip small amounts swallows before and during exercise and wait to fully re hydrate until after the workout dehydration can cause cramping as well so do not ignore water during running always sip a few swallows at regular intervals especially if running for more than minutes and in hot temperatures decrease fast pace for a few minutes and continue deep breathing techniques during running a common running sequence is a three step inhale and two step exhale pattern slowing down your pace will allow for you to keep up with that pattern as you increase to near maximum speed your breathing will become more labored however you can push through the pain and keep your pace if you concentrate on breathing deep by pushing your stomach out when you inhale and relaxing it as you exhale pre stretch before running one of the best ways to pre stretch the area is to lift your arms over your head and lean to the left and right at the waist do more lower back and abdominal exercises having a strong core will help you prevent the side stitch Professional wrestling holds Equine conformation Drowning Stomach cancer Abdomen Lung First aid Aerial (dance move) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Massage Fecal incontinence Professional wrestling throws Fast bowling Hiccup Swimming Urinary incontinence Exercise Acupuncture Backstroke Diving regulator Scuba set Pneumonia Hypoglycemia Diabetes mellitus Asthma Knitting Paget's disease of bone Dehydration Vomiting Autonomic nervous system Action potential Horse gait Volleyball Butterfly stroke Hyperthermia Carbon dioxide Mattress Front crawl Bong Childbirth Kidney 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Marathon (sport) Gastroesophageal reflux disease Jet engine Cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Chronic fatigue syndrome Enzyme Siphon Reptile Sport rowing Tobacco smoking Obesity Insulin Pain Myocardial infarction Cannabis (drug) Tightlacing Fire fighting Obstetrics Shaggy dog story Gastroparesis Boxing Glossary of American football Skateboarding trick Sleep Horse Swingout Stroke Aortic dissection Running Dialysis Diazepam Local anesthesia Aikido Babe Ruth Carpal tunnel syndrome Professional wrestling attacks Crocodilia Suplex Menstrual cup Breastfeeding Hatha yoga Professional wrestling aerial techniques Muscle Diarrhea Suicide methods Mesothelioma Marching band Oral sex
