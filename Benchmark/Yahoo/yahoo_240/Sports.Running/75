can i use my track spikes for xc my events in track were the m and the m these were the nike spikes that i had http www nike com index jhtml l nikestore grid pdp cid gid pid grid s rival md iii re us co us la en i only used these for track meets miles total are these also suitable to wear for xc since it's a k race the spikes on these aren't rubber in fact they're really hard sturdy spikes that's why i don't think it should be a problem that's actually a tough call most middle distance spikes like the ones you linked to are designed to go up to about miles so if you are racing a k they may be inappropriate i would recommend showing them to your coach and getting their opinion as for the people that say you should have different shoes for track and xc they are wrong the shoe itself can be safely used in different seasons though you will need to replace the actual metal spikes it only matters that you are using it correctly so if you sprint in track you'll need a different pair as you point out you never build up many miles on your race shoes in fact in high school i never wore out a pair of spikes though i did out grow of them so my answer maybe Nike, Inc.
