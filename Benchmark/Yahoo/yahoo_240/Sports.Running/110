why do i have to take a walk break after only minutes of running how can i get past this i have been running for years but still have to take walk breaks on my mile morning runs why is this do i just need to push through lift weights what can help me get past this i would like to run miles straight without taking walk breaks i had a similar problem five years ago i also had to stop running at about minutes when i stop running i have trouble restarting my solution my seem strange but it worked for me while i was running i was thinking about all of the negative experiences i had in life i had all of these feelings of unforgiveness grudges towards others after about minutes of this i would have to stop and take a break i believe my body was tired of the unforgiving thoughts when i realized what i was dong i started sending out thoughts of love to people who have done me wrong in the past i started forgiving them i changed my emotional feelings towards these people to that of peace and love not anger within months of doing this my running time without stopping went from minutes about a mile for me to minutes about five miles for me the results were amazing i started doing this after hearing a preacher talk about the power of forgiveness my increase in running time was just a pleasant side effect add forgiveness to your running routine you will start feeling better both emotionally and physically Shaggy dog story A Course In Miracles Jean Grey Scenes from a Memory Sin Milton H.
