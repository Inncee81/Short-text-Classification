for anyone who has run a marathon what shoes did you use you should wear a shoe that has been used for training for at least but not greater than a couple of months keep in mind that a running shoe can last about miles since the padding will wear out after that as for me i run at least marathons a year i had been using reebok shoes from day and i still rely on my reebok i know it is not the most popular brand but it works well for me i used to love the dmx technology which is the liquid gel technology they had since moved on to the foam technology which makes the shoes lighter i usually change the style of shoes since i would buy pairs and run with them for a while and then go shopping for more so by the time i get to the store they had changed to different styles i had a couple of reebok shoes that gave me trouble but after i changed there was no further problem for most part i am very happy with my reebok reebok can be harder to get in chain store so i go to the reebok outlet store which actually will give me more discount other good brands include ascic saucony and new balance not a big fan of nike had tried it and did not like them you just have to try them all in the stores and see which ones fit you better Reebok Shoe Nike, Inc.
