i'm years old ' lbs i started running again for about two months now and my heart rate is sometimes during the day at rest i run about miles a day days a week at a mile pace my resting hr before i started exercising again was about bpm i'm not at all day but probably for a good hours during the day at night it usually goes up to around what is going on should i see a doctor is this normal help well based on your bmi details in bbc link below you're a bit overweight but you can still be a bit fat and fit i have a bmi of but i'm quite spritely i'm not a doctor just a runner but i you may well have a condition called bradycardia don't panic you probably aren't going to die of it if so you are in good company as many athletes are bradycardic lance armstrong being one of many basically the more you exercise the more efficient your heart becomes using the analogy of the heart as a bucket you have a bigger bucket now the heart can pump the same amount of blood as before but in less beats for more about the bucket analogy check out the second article linked below which was the one i found when i had a similar question when i started exercise as in stopped being sedentary my resting heart rate rhr was around ergo my heart was not in good shape last month i did more than hours of cv work in the gym during the week plus a couple of races at weekends and my rhr is i'm rhr should be measured first thing in the morning whilst lying down if you do that you'll probably find it is even lower than as for the fluctuations that will may well be down to factors such as activity level what you've just watched on tv or how much coffee you've drunk caffeine is a stimulant by the way slightly off topic but i've seen another article which i can't find on this subject that says your maximum hr is genetically programmed but your rhr reduces with increased fitness the usual rule of thumb is your mhr is your age in your case but this isn't accurate for all my mhr is which is why i found out all this stuff as i was as concerned as the guy in the runners world article see the wikipedia article also linked for more on bradycardia you haven't mentioned it but if you have other symptoms i think you should see a doctor Heart rate Hypertension Obesity Marathon (sport) Urinary incontinence Anorexia nervosa Hypoglycemia Weight training Equine conformation Insomnia Breastfeeding Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Chronic fatigue syndrome Prostate cancer Myocardial infarction Propranolol Blood pressure Exercise Unemployment Cardiovascular disease Coronary heart disease Sleep apnea Sleep Dieting Bradycardia Diabetes mellitus Theory of conduct Drowning Carburetor Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Carbon dioxide Fast bowling Folic acid Fuel injection First aid Tachycardia Extreme Programming Cardiac stress test Time ELO rating system Super Size Me Stroke Thermoregulation Labour economics Insurance Milton H.
