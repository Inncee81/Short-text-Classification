double twin jogging stoller recommendation i am looking for a double jogging stroller it will be used for jogging but also for errands festivals malls etc i think i would need one with a locking swivel from wheel but beyond that i do not know any suggestions i am not a hardcore runner by any means but i would like something durable thanks also any insight on the all terrain strollers with front wheels are they better try to buy from craigslist or ebay the strollers on ebay will be more expensive but newer the strollers on craigslist will probably be older but cheaper in my opinion the swivel is just another moving part that can fail so i would avoid it i believe all three of mine are baby jogger brand a removable sun wind cover is nice if you run with it you will want to take it off because it can be hard to push the stroller in the wind on the other hand if you are taking them to sea world or something the cover is nice to keep the sun out of their eyes the drawback for my strollers is that i have to take them apart to get them in the back of the suburban and they can be a little large in the malls even then it is just cotter pins and or quick release wheels you will get used to it the triple really takes up space if you want to spend some you can get one that folds up nicely without having to do any disassembly another is that the front wheels stick out pretty far maybe that swivel wheel might be good for you after all when you are going to the malls etc bigger wheels are nicer for jogging i take them on a crushed granite trail with no problems i say you should go the craigslist route and get several for cheap so you have one for every situation Bulk vending Gramophone record Textile manufacturing Running Mouse (computing) Professional wrestling throws Heckler & Koch G3 Shopping mall Motorcycle GunBound Anchor Professional wrestling attacks Poker jargon Tire Tractor Dundas Square Chess strategy and tactics Internal ballistics Floppy disk Bicycle lighting Craigslist Professional wrestling match types Professional wrestling holds Baby transport Sport utility vehicle Kodocha Rugby union positions Digital photography Lindy Basic Combine (Half-Life 2) Extreme Programming Baseball Theory of conduct Dinghy Bicycle brake systems MMORPG Knife Rear wheel drive Redundant array of independent disks 2000 Australian Grand Prix Professional wrestling slang Contra Costa County, California Panama Canal Aerial (dance move) Plastic Bicycle Hiawatha Line Wind turbine M16 (rifle) Energy development Powerbomb Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Naval mine Mattress Connecticut Hot Wheels Suplex Ford Thunderbird Naruto jutsu Revolver Cross-country skiing W.
