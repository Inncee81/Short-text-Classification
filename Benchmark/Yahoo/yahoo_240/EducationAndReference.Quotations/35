all is fair in love war can anyone enlighten me about what this phrase means what the heck do you mean literally what does it mean stevie wonder had a song 'all in love is fair' on his 'songs in the key of life' album you could try listening to that anyway the way that people use this phrase is to excuse some kind of behavior that others might not approve of by implying that 'anything goes' in situations involving love and war because these are special circumstances which operate under different rules than the rest of life and therefore extraordinary measures are justified as an extreme example in war it's ok to kill people whereas it isn't in regular life of course sometimes people try to use it to excuse their behavior in situations that have nothing to do with love or war in which case it's just an excuse hope this helps Fair use Human sexual behavior Cultural relativism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Goodness and value theory Stevie Wonder Homophobia Rich Mullins Murder Theory of conduct Predestination Pacifism Contract Insanity defense Unlawful combatant Euphemism Value system Patriotism Evil Marvin Gaye Capital punishment Social psychology Infantilism Abortion debate Scientology beliefs and practices Just War theory Rape English grammar Happiness Poker jargon Coldplay The Pilgrim's Progress Meaning Fathers' rights Songs in the Key of Life Nicomachean Ethics Shock jock Baptism Theodicy Fleetwood Mac Royal Assent Liberalism Charles Manson Sexual addiction Faster-than-light Epistemology Estoppel David Bowie Singlish Cognitive science Supply and demand Tenchi Muyo!
