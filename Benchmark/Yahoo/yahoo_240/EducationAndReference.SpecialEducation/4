if someone is blind and deaf from birth do they know anything do they understand what they are what other people are or what existence is yes they understand what they are from feeling hunger and sleepiness they feel emotions just like everyone else i know because deafblind people feel intense feelings of frusteration from not being able to communicate or navigate in fact deafblind people even think like humans do however they cannot think visually or linguistically so they think cerebrally this is a universal way of thinking that is thought in the purest form their existence is limited to touch they can feel doorknobs and over time learn that there are rooms inside those doorknobs they learn to grasp forks like everyone else to flush a toilet to run and skip they still have the gift of movement movement is their way of expressing their thoughts and feelings while touch is their way of getting to know the world eventually they also become aware of the dangers they cannot see or hear that must be more frightening than anything imagine the shock of a dog sinking its teeth into your arm without seeing or hearing it you only feel the pain of your punctured flesh and the shock of what happened so yes this is another form of existence deafblind people might not ever be one hundred percent able to know what existence really is without having sight and hearing however they do know that there is a world with people and all kinds of things and ideas in it it just takes them longer to learn it they have a different perception but they still have a perception deafblind people eventually learn that there is a big wide world out there with color shapes sounds etc they learn about sounds from vibrations they learn communication techniques by learning braille sign language and finger spelling this enables them to communicate with others and as their vocabulary progresses they learn more and more ideas to build a better picture of what the world is really like to better understand what it is like to be deaf and blind maybe one day you should try putting on a pair of earmuffs and a blindfold Deafblindness Milton H.
