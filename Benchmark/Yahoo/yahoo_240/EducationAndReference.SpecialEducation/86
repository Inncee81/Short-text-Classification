what responsibilities are part of the high school inclusion aide position if you work in a high school where inclusion aides are employed can you share what you know about this position also do you think that taking this position would increase one's chances of getting a teaching job with the district good advice so far just to add to what's been said so far aide positions can vary greatly and when the position is posted you should know at least a little about what kind of job it will be for example our school has behavior room aides cbi aides esl aides content mastery aides etc all of these provide inclusion services in one way or another as far as what's involved with the job in addition to what's been said you may also help students keep their materials organized you may have to read assignments reading passages aloud to them you may have to haul equipment around for them like the machine to make printed materials larger for seriously visually impaired students you may work with only one student have several that you follow or simply just stay with one teacher and help everybody in the class like i said it just depends on your school and your job some advice i might give carry supplies around with you often the students you work with forget things like pencil and paper you might also carry around a notebook to take notes in for yourself don't just help the students you are supposed to help ideally no one is supposed to be able to tell which students in a classroom are special ed and which ones are not of couse some special needs are pretty obvious but most are not so if you only help one student it will be pretty obvious that that student is special ed but if you help all the students then it won't be so obvious observe as much as you can while you are in a classroom discipline methods classroom procedures posters on the wall etc this will help you once you do become a teacher another thing aides are often asked to do many other things not just inclusion the inclusion aides at my school also have to do one lunch duty per day they often sub for teachers who have to leave the room briefly for an ard they go on field trips when extra people are needed they monitor the bathrooms and hallways during standardized testing so be prepared to do more than just inclusion as for increasing your chances of getting a job yes you will some other things you may not have thought about sometimes your degree program will consider your work experience for credit some of the aides at my school have been told they will not need to complete student teaching the way that others do their experience in the school is their student teaching so they will complete their degree a little more quickly also some school districts financially contribute to employees' education my district pays back employees up to a year for education including aides oh and here's something kind of strange the district pays of health insurance premiums for our aides but only about half of teacher premiums you will also have your foot in the door have already built a relationship with coworkers and administrators and you are likely to know what jobs are really available not just what's posted on the website Graduate school GED Education in the United States Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Germany Education in Japan Education Education in Romania Beavis and Butt-head Education in Portugal Experiential education Academia Librarian Health insurance Insurance Teacher Annuity Professor Secondary education in Japan Columbine High School massacre No Child Left Behind Act Teach the Controversy Computer Japanese tea ceremony Great Teacher Onizuka College Education in Australia Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 College admissions Alexander Technique Education in Hong Kong Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Unemployment Nurse A Course In Miracles Extreme Programming Physician Expert system Law school Theory of conduct Students' union Boston Public Economics Homeschooling Juris Doctor Separation of church and state Intelligent design movement Community emergency response team Marshall McLuhan Bristol Grammar School Dyslexia Literacy Ludwig Wittgenstein Trade union Church of Christ, Scientist High school Explosive material G-Man (Half-Life) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Scholarship Education reform Consensus decision-making Teaching English as a Foreign Language Quizbowl Poker jargon Inflation Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Money Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Reiki Martial art Scientology beliefs and practices Microeconomics Adult attention-deficit disorder Social Security (United States) Emergency Medical Services Blackjack Apprenticeship Corporate governance Master's degree CPU cache Life insurance Milton H.
