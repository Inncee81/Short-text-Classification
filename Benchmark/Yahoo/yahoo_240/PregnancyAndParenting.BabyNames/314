haylie anne we are sticking with this name it's already on her stuff and i really love it but i'm curious what other people think of the middle name we seriously couldn't think of another name that went well with haylie and that we both agreed on the only reason we chose it is because that's my middle name it's the laziest way to do it if when we have a boy his middle will be andrew my husband's middle do you think this was a good idea when she gets older and asks should we tell her she inherited my middle name because we couldn't think of anything else or should we say that we really really liked it both technically true else her name wouldn't be haylie anne for the one who asked no haylie anne is just her legal name we only intend to call her haylie unless she's in trouble lol i think it's a lovely name very nice Hilary Duff Haylie Duff Theodicy Knots Landing Humphrey Bogart DisneyMania The Death Gate Cycle Good Times Shaggy dog story Le Malade imaginaire Anne Rice Theory of conduct Blood on the Tracks The Inside Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Dragon Booster Little Britain Married... with Children Good Vibrations: Thirty Years of The Beach Boys Self Portrait Justification (theology) Shot of Love C plus plus Ann Coulter Sin City The Beach Boys Street-Legal Sampling (music) Plame affair Poker jargon Anne of Great Britain I Love Lucy Socrates Douglas Adams Time Out of Mind Henry VIII of England The Golden Girls She Loves You Family name One Tree Hill (TV series) Pet Sounds EastEnders The Catcher in the Rye Polyamory Trigun 2005 trial of Michael Jackson The Apprentice 2 Napoleon Dynamite The Wotch Zhao Yun Prince Edmund (Blackadder) 2004 Republican National Convention Pepper Ann History of Test cricket (to 1883) Mary Read U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 About a Boy Charmed Paula Jones The Pet Sounds Sessions Ocean's Twelve Pok__mon Live!
