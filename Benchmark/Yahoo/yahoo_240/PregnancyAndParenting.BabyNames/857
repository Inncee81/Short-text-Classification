do these names sound crazy should the parents have their heads checked i know someone who's going to be having twin boys she's already picked out names the names are reed larue and rowdy leigh i hope it's just not me who thinks those are obsurd names for children i know every parent is going to do what they want when it comes to the name of their children should i bite my tongue hahaha reed and rowdy strange names but the more i say them they seem to flow but in saying that we have a friend whose nickname is rowdy and that is all we call him so it seems familiar to me i would bite my tongue in this situation as my brother in law said something really mean about the name i have chosen for my daughter a couple of nights ago and it really hurt my feelings especially as they are expecting a baby as well and i only said nice things about their childs boring name right before he said mean things about mine now i really don't want anything to do with him so if you want to maintain a good friendship just let them name their baby whatever they wish they are going to so anyway no matter what other people think Friends Social rule Sharon Tate EastEnders Infantilism Sleeping Murder Kender Jon Secada Humphrey Bogart Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Theory of conduct Eddie Guerrero One Tree Hill (TV series) Transactional analysis Knots Landing The Dukes of Hazzard The Beach Boys Breastfeeding AFI 100 Years series Charmed Neil Gaiman Little Britain Shaggy dog story Sami Brady Rich Mullins Given name W.I.T.C.H.
