should a year turning in two weeks still be doing this parnets still feeding him food like you putting the food on the spoon and you putting the food in his mouth crying of babyish things like taking the ball away changing the channel from cartoons drinking out of sippie cup parnets still helping him poop in the restroom parnets bathing him well those are just some of the major things my nephew does my cousin and his wife and there year old are staying with us and i was wondering if a year old turning in two weeks should still be doing these things well my son is years old and he eats himself he takes a bath or try's to clean himself as much as he can i still stay in the bathroom when he's in the tub because boys can get wild and make a huge mess yeah my son sill cry's over cartoons and that's normal each child has different temperaments my son need a little help when pooping in the restroom when it comes to wiping but they need to encourage him to start doing things himself i would suggest telling them that they need to say he's a big boy and he can do it etc it's all about the effort if they continue to baby him that's not healthy for him or the parents kids need to learn independence my son is going to be in dec so yeah some of the things they do for him still is not good each parent raises there children differently if they don't help him grow now it will come back and bite them on the butt sit back and don't do things for him if he's with you use the words like big boy you can do it etc if you start the encouragement they might follow good luck Breastfeeding Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Customs and etiquette of Japan Shaggy dog story Toilet humour The Fairly OddParents Social rule The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Ron and Fez The Shining (film) Pitaten The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Joke About a Boy Milton H.
