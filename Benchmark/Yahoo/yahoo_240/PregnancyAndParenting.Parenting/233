is a hour tantrum abnormal i have a friend whose daughter is years old she is throwing a tantrum right now and she has been screaming nearly non stop for about minutes now i'm pretty concerned about this and i think something is possibly wrong with her any ideas on what constitutes an abnormal tantrum i unfortunately have a child that has thrown a two hour tantrum too he does not do it all the time if this is a rare occurrence then you should not be too worried if this is her normal behavior then there is something wrong try playing soft music or whispering to her try counting to and doing deep breathing with her sometimes they don't know how to stop having a tantrum Static Shock Poker jargon Shaggy dog story Asperger syndrome Decompression sickness Stuttering Childbirth Autism Child abuse Epilepsy Milton H.
