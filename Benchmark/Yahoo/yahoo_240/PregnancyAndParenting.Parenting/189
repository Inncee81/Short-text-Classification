how is visitation handled when one parent moves out of state with the kids my neice made a comment to my son that her mom and stepdad were moving her and her sister out of state but not to tell me cause i would tell my brother and he might try to kidnap them well of course i told my brother immediatly and he called his ex wife to find out what was going on at first she said it was just a thought but nothing was definate however the next day she calls him back and says they are moving about states away in about a week he hasnt been able to call his lawyer yet to find out his rights or if she can even legally move out of state i know my divorce papers say i cant move out of the counties adjacent to the county where my divorce was done but he knows his doesn't say that however he isn't sure about moving out of state how does this usually work with people moving their kids out of state are they usually allowed to do this just out of the blue and how do visitations work has anyone else been in this situation and how did you work it out so basically she can move out of state and if my brother cant afford to drive that distance or pay for plane tickets every other weekend then he is basically just out of luck on his visitation that doesn't seem fair to me if your brother has shared or joint custody then no she can't move out of state try to help him get in touch with his lawyer tell him to call his ex wife back and tell her that if she leaves the state with his kids he will press charges for kidnapping a parent might take the kids and move across the country in order to make things more difficult for the other parent the laws are generally written to avoid that possibility it's best to consult with a local attorney before she moves no he shouldn't move to follow her where she goes she has no right to leave and he shouldn't have to uproot himself to please his ex wife if she wants to move then let her move but get custody of the children so that you don't have to change your life everytime she wants to hop around Divorce Marriage 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Family EastEnders Fathers' rights Theory of conduct Knots Landing The Catcher in the Rye Child custody Plame affair Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Kidnapping Ernesto Miranda Status of religious freedom in Malaysia Unlawful combatant Alberto Gonzales Appeal The Critic Sharon Tate Polyamory James Bulger Phoebe Halliwell Concurrent estate Miss Saigon Karl Rove Federal Marriage Amendment Son Goku (Dragon Ball) One Tree Hill (TV series) Shaggy dog story Fair Game (Scientology) Tom DeLay Badly Drawn Kitties Kodocha Pitaten Malcolm in the Middle Charmed Marc Dutroux The Untouchables Social rule Polygamy United Kingdom corporation tax Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dancing at Lughnasa George Galloway Blankets (graphic novel) Mumia Abu-Jamal Prolog The Human Stain Baby Blues Evan Mecham Rosa Parks Insurance Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Children of God Leo Wyatt Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23 Doug Vivian Solon Women in the Victorian era Maria Hertogh riots W.
