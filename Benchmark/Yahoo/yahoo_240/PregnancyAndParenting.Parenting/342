overprotective this is sort of based on my other question about me not being able to date until i'm it's kind of a question yet statement of why i think my parents might be a tad bit overprotective and what you think on the subject my parents won't let me date until i'm a little extreme i think so most kids that aren't able to date or even group date get themselves into a whole lot more trouble when their because they aren't at the dating maturity as everyone else since i am aware of this this probably won't happen to me but kids get overwhelmed because they have no idea what to do in situations that might come up since when your sex is an issue sometimes and other physical things that since people didn't experience a taste of what a boyfriend was when they were younger may think it is okay to do i don't think it is safe to wait until your child is to let them date life is way more cruel at that age and you can't keep tabs on your kid like you can now continue i would have no problem telling my parents who i am dating where i will be going with my boyfriend and most of the other details that they are wanting when you get older you have your own life you make most of the decisions and without experiencing just the little bit of what happens when your younger you can make some huge mistakes i know my parents love me and want to protect me but i don't think they are realistically able to see what may happen in the future since i barely ever get to go to the movies at night with my friends or some parties with guys normal parties not bad ones for all they know i can be out clubbin when i get older and pregnant before marriage and in college what do you have to say on the subject yeah it's over protective ibelive in the same thing that is the party stage and that being given that much responsibility at that stage is too much i mean if u don't know how can u be forced to learn in such a short period of time i'm allowed to date when i'm whicth is okay to me i wouldn't mind but i'm not complaining i just like how my mom believes in that also so she wants me to know before i turn my mom says that that is normally the stage when boys who go out with ask u to put out so she wants me to make good choices Humphrey Bogart About a Boy One Tree Hill (TV series) Theory of conduct Social rule Avenue Q Charmed Transactional analysis Milton H.
