daughter acting do u think it's ok to let my year old daughter act in plays that don't associate with school my daughter really loves to be in musicals she was in the play olvier and she was also in the wizard of oz and she really wanted to be in grease but was to young so she was sorta sad about that but she was also in the play of the sound of music and she said it was her favorite one to be in but my mom doesn't aggree with this she says that it could make her life horrible one day which i don't get sure if it's not interfering with her school or any other obligations then i think it's a great creative way for her to spend her time who knows she might end up being the next meryl streep or insert whatever actress is your favorite Meryl Streep Adaptation.
