are kids mcbranded or just mclazy i was reading this article on y and just had a though and wanted to see if anyone agrees why do these healthy kids activists always go after fast food companies but you never hear about them confronting tv or video game makers are kids really getting too much fast food or not enough exercise i feel it's a mixture of both i think the fast food that their mom has to pick up on her way home from work wouldn't be so harmful if kids and adults for that matter got some exercise instead of spending all day in front of the tv or game system what do you think http news yahoo com s nm hl nm kids fastfood dc i agree with you its definitely a combination of both there was just as many fast food places when i was growing up as there are now and my generation was not as obese as children nowadays the difference is i spent my childhood pretty much outdoors just playing running around playing sports etc we had longer recesses at school and more pe all this is lacking with kids these days frankly i think the activists should go after the parents its the parents that have control over this while the children are living in the house everything in moderation is fine its the parents responsibility to ensure their kids are eating healthy and getting enough exercise in my opinion Fast food Sesame Street Atkins Nutritional Approach Ben Johnson (athlete) Super Size Me Adolescence Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Obesity Hypoglycemia Nutrition Anorexia nervosa Terri Schiavo Eating Tai Chi Chuan Hamburger Child sexuality John the Baptist Diabetes mellitus Human height Motivation Low-carbohydrate diet Breastfeeding Fast bowling Exercise Sonic the Hedgehog Narcissism The Fairly OddParents Computer and video game genres Domestic rabbit Intelligence quotient Economy of the United States Fathers' rights Laura Schlessinger Homeschooling Urinary incontinence IBM PC compatible Binge eating disorder Theory of conduct School choice Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Married... with Children Insulin Fox Broadcasting Company Dieting Internet phenomenon Recess (TV series) Transsexuality YMCA Swimming Generation Y Inflation Growth hormone treatment Dog Infantilism Sega Divorce About a Boy Ekadasi Milk Plame affair Autism rights movement Abortion debate Fasting Judicial functions of the House of Lords Sports Illustrated Unreal Our Gang The Sims Separation of church and state Androgen insensitivity syndrome Motion picture rating system Mixed-breed dog Hamster Tooth Vegetarianism Fatality Nuclear power Dissociative identity disorder 2004-05 NHL lockout Spy Kids The Adventures of Pete & Pete Word of Wisdom Kodocha Sea-Monkey McDonald's Lindsay Lohan Healthy eating National Kidney Foundation Singapore Spyware Tennis Mahjong Television in the United States Cancer Cardcaptor Sakura Hearing impairment Hunting Ted Williams Organic farming Child
