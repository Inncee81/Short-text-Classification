parents who think their children are perfect ok i'm a parent of i love my kids dearly and i think they're basically great kids and very well behaved but i also realise that they're kids and all kids have their moments none of them are ever perfect and i personally wouldn't want mine to be so why do some parents consistantly turn a blind eye to their children's faults even if they just saw their child do something with their own eyes they'll deny it has anyone else noticed this yep i have a family across the street like that it is never their child's fault it is someone else's fault the children lie steal break other people's property use the hose of a family that is not home you name it still even with witnesses compaints etc the children are never at fault i don't know if it is because the mom was and dad when they started to have kids or what i see this in families who are older and have children as well if my son does something wrong he is in it deep with us deep he knows it too it doesn't often happen though because he knows the rules and the consequences are firm i don't understand i have to say though i am a teacher and last year a boy i had years ago was in trouble with the law his mom called to see if i could give a personal account of how he is etc a positive account my principal and i refused we told her this was going to happen years ago and she didn't listen now she is trying to make excuses for him as a teen in trouble with the law some people never learn Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Social rule Kyle Broflovski The Fairly OddParents Recurring South Park characters About a Boy The Adventures of Pete & Pete The Marshall Mathers LP The Catcher in the Rye Great Teacher Onizuka Milton H.
