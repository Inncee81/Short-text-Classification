i have nieces and nephews who are very sheltered no playing outside homeschooled no tv mormons ok so its not quite so bad they are allowed to watch pbs for like an hour a day but i am pretty sure their mom doesnt let them play outside much for fear of her neighbors or something she has girls and a boy this year she has started homeschooing them because she wants the girls to be learn to be homemakers i think the boy he is the oldest is really into stuff like star wars and yugio cards and transformers and stuff but he is not allowed to watch the movies i hate to say it but he is extemely geeky they arent allowed to watch anything rated higher than g and she doesnt let them watch some things like spongebob or lilo and stich because they are too sassy the kids seem to be very nice and pretty well behaved besides the fact that they are incredibly hyper my question is have you seen kids that have been raised like this how do they turn out as they get older do you think it will be a good or a bad thing to be raised in such a sheltered enviroment i also wanted to add that their father is not a nice person he is really geeky and really rude to the extended family and plays pretty rough with his kids when the kids enter the mainstream as inevitably they will they may sustain a certain amount of 'culture shock' but other than that will probably do fine in future schools we have relatives also mormon who have raised their kids homeschooled and isolated from regular kid life and they have all done brilliantly well at college are planning decent careers and within the confines of their church's social world appear to be quite normal they probably won't marry 'gentiles' due to some unfortunate experiences with their parents' mixed marriage but i wouldn't worry about your kin it will balance out keep thinking about this bill gates was a geek too Homeschooling The Fairly OddParents Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Humphrey Bogart Unemployment Poker jargon Kim Possible Polygamy Charmed KaBlam!
