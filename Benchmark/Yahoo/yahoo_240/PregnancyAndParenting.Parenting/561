men hitting women im a female and was always bought up that men should never hit a women and a women should never hit a man i dont think i ever would unless it was a life or death situation for me or my family my husband and i have the same disagreement all the time his mother chooses to stay in a physicly abbusive relationship she has admitted to me that she usually starts the fight and throws the first punch my husband then gets angry at her partner for putting his hands on her i know a man could floor me easily that is why i know i would never pravoke a man by throwing punches and i would expect that if ive hit him his gonna do the same back i know women being hit by a man is frowned apon but if my mother in law is choosing this life style am i wrong for not feeling the slightest bit of sympathy for her or her situation it just seems to me that people think its ok for a women to hit a man but its not ok for a man to hit a women please share youre thoughts with me on this matter what will you teach your children i totally agree that it is wrong for a man to hit a women unless provoked i e she hitting him first and its kinda funny cause i'm in the same situation my mother in law stays with her boyfriend who beats her and then my husband wants to kill him when he hears of the newest abuse and most of the time its her who starts it there have been times when my husband has gone over there to correct the problem with his mom's b f and she would end up getting mad at my husband for hurting her b f i have also been raised that if you are gonna hit like a man a female hitting a man first then you deserve to get hit like a man i am yrs old i am ' and weigh lbs and my husband is ' and lbs so i know he could take me out with one punch that is why i do not provoke it and he has never laid a hand on me because there is no reason to but as for his mom i feel absolutely no sympathy for her because she is the one who starts it most of the time and even when she doesn't she throws her sob story about her getting beat up to everyone and then an hour later she is on the phone with her dude telling him she loves him and goes home to him the next day so as for your mother in law and mine they love the drama and that is why they do it just to get attention when they want it and get the adrenaline rush because of the drama they have created and honestly i say they get what they deserve if they are dumb enough to stay with an abusive partner than they are dumb enough to get their ass kicked again and again harsh but true also i will teach my daughters the same thing even tho i know it will piss me off if a man puts his hands on my daughters even if they did start it but if they are gonna hit like men then they deserve to be hit back do not provoke a man to hit you because there will always be someone stronger than you and if you man at the time is that person then you do not want to provoke him to hit you also i will teach my daughters that unless provoked such as my girls throwing the first punch it is never ok for a man to put his hands on them for any reason other than what i said above and even some circumstances of the above stated reason are not acceptable and if they are getting beat up for no reason by a man they need to leave and then call the police right away so the matter can be dealt with cause i will kill the first asshole to lay his hands on either of my daughters for no reason EastEnders Domestic violence Theory of conduct True Crime: Streets of LA The Marshall Mathers LP Sin City Similarities between the
