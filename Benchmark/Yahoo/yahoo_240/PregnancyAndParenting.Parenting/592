my daughter got kicked out from a private sitter that is how bad she was i don't know what to do she is turning on sunday for the past few weeks she has been acting really bad not listening bad mouthing talking back you name it we have grounded her stuck her in the corner taken away her toys everything last night the baby sitter gave me the money back from the rest of the week said she can't come back i spanked my daughter stuck her in the corner and made her go to bed early she promised to be good and promised i told her i didn't believe her i told her she will get nothing for her birthday she continued to say she would be good grandma wanted to take her to the lake this weekend i told her if she was good for the new baby sitter which is at my house today then i might let her go she is being horrible she cursed locked herself out of her room so she didn't have to get back in it and i don't know what to do what am i doing wrong why is she like this how can i make her behave what can i do i am single but she has an active father and my live in boyfriend years i am consenstant and do reward good behavior but i don't know what else to do this sounds bad but i am looking into a boarding school also i have two kids my oldest is i raise my children the same they are in the same situation and i have never had a problem with my oldest first of all i am not criticizing or judging i am going to speak from experience and address it from an overall point of view if i say you i am actually meaning people in general i just dont want you to take it the wrong way but it seems as though her punishments have not been consistant this is where most of us go wrong you have to keep to your word of what you say you are going to do or not do do not break it for any reason what so ever or she will call your bluff she will push you as far as she can you will have to use spankings along with other forms of punishment with her until she starts getting used to the consequences of her actions tell her what she has done wrong and tell her why it is wrong then explain to her that you have to punish her so that she will learn how to behave and respect people you can even use her feelings against her if she will allow you some do not care though tell her that others do not like kids who misbehave and are bad and she will not make friends to play with if she keeps doing this she is old enough to understand it explain to her that you do not like the way she acts and you will not have much to do with her until she learns to be nice and do as you say she is likely doing it for attention for part of it and just for spite for the other also let her know that things are going to change around the house tell her when she does good then she will get rewarded for it give her simple chores to do around the house as well to help keep her busy doing something instead of getting into things try not to yell or let her see you get mad you are going to have to show her tough love for a while until she gets better and you will feel like you are being cruel at times but you are actually helping her and making her understand how to treat people and how to act in social situations do not let her get away with one thing until she starts to improve by a great deal every single time she does something wrong punish her as you see fit when talking back to you or other adults and things like those those are major things and call for a spanking and punishing together since she has not had to be done like this before it is going to make it harder on you trust me i know first hand i took it drastically and if i even had to tell them more than one time then they got a spanking or something they really liked taken away within one month of me standing my ground and not letting them by with the tiniest thing they are now the best kids you could ask for everything is yes mam no mam yes sir no sir thank you please excuse me and are the very polite and honest they get into major trouble for disrespecting adults in any way and for lieing i would cry myself to sleep bc i thought they would hate me for it and bc i thought i was being too hard on them after that month i have had to get onto them about times total and that was months ago they clean their rooms and do small chores they do as i ask when i ask and the best of all we are closer now than we have ever been mine are and they have actually thanked me for punishing them bc they did not want to be bad it is definitely worth it in the long run i promise i also got them into church and they get to do what they want when they want now i can trust them so much more and they respect me more than ever good luck and god bless also you will get discouraged and you will be ready to throw your hands up keep reminding yourself that this is for your daughters benefit as well as yours and it has to be done do not let things go bc you are so overwhelmed and so tired of it this will be a major set back and will make things worse keep your head up and suffer through it with your daughter i promise it is worth it i am sorry i wrote so much but i have been where you are and know how tough it is let me
