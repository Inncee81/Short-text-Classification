peeing in legos ok so i have this big issue with my yo that i thought we had gotten rid of about a year ago i had bought my kids a big bucket of legos tiny ones and it worked because they both like to build things then i noticed a foul smell in them turned out that my yo at that time had urinated on them i had a big talk and he got time out for that i had to dump the legos because i couldn't get rid of the smell now my dad bought more legos for my older son but they both share them this morning they were fighting over them and i decided to take them away when i picke up the bag i noticed it was wet yes it was pee i confronted my son and admited that he had done it he is not able to tell me why he does it but it bothers the heck out of me should i take him to a therapist or is this a boy thing your first mistake with him was the time out that is not a proper punishment for a boy as you now see it does nothing all it did was teach him that not much happens when he does bad stuff if he peed in them he has to wash them put hot not too hot for him though water and soap in the bathtub and make him wash the pee off and wash out the bucket act really mad and go on and on about how nasty peeing on legos is don't let it phase you if he starts wailing to get out of it show him how to wash them make sure he does it and does it right years is not to young for this if he is really struggling help him but make sure he is doing it too you have to keep acting mad though so he won't think it's a game he has to learn that actions have consequences and i don't mean having to stop playing for a few minutes the consequence to peeing on something is it has to be washed how does he learn that if you do it for him while he sits in a chair for a few minutes tell him if he pees on anything else he has to wash that too you may have to do this a couple of times boys can be stubborn or slow to catch on Sento Shaggy dog story Toilet humour The Inside Euphemism Milton H.
