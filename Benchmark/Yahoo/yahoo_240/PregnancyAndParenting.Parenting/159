how do i tell my month old daughter that mommy's pregnant again i'm months pregnant and i haven't told my month old daughter yet but i think it's time to tell her now she's only months old so i don't want her to think mommy and daddy don't love me anymore so they wanna get another baby how do i tell her without her feeling sad i don't think she would be sad if your only months maybe you and your husband should start talking about her being a big sister and how much help she will be and how much the baby will love her kids at this age are always looking to please and thrive on reward and it does so much for their emotional well being i think she will be just fine and when it gets closer the the delivery maybe take her out so she can pick out a new present to welcome the new baby this way she will feel involved and proud that she picked something for the new arrival also keep her updated on the baby's growth and developement while your pregnant bring her to some dr's appts so she can hear the baby's heartbeat and ultrasound pics maybe have fun with it and tell her the baby is waving hello to her from the image on the screen Pregnancy EastEnders Knots Landing The McGuire Sisters Friends Neighbours Kodocha Obstetrics Sharon Tate Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Shaggy dog story Cliff Richard Heartbeat (television) Miscarriage Episodes of Lost (Season 1) One Life to Live Jon Secada Days of our Lives Maggie Simpson Charmed History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Guiding Light Humphrey Bogart AFI 100 Years series Tupac Shakur Infantilism Leo Wyatt The Marshall Mathers LP Baby Blues Tom Jones (singer) Childbirth Joke Ja Rule El Chavo del Ocho Apollo Past characters (Neighbours) Breech birth Full House Everwood The Ashlee Simpson Show Game show The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll Hollyoaks Jennifer Lopez Sheryl Crow The O.C.
