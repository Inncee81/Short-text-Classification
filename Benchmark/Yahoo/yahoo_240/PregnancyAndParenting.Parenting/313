did i deserve my big big spanking and punishment i'm last week i smoked at home and mom spanked me it was so embarrassing as it was in front of my friends she stripped me naked asked my friends if they wanted to see me spanked of 'em said yes and my mom took me to livingroom and spanked me with a hairbrush it hurted a lot and my friends laughed when i bawled then she let me wear my top without bra and asked all friends to come in n look at my red bare butt with my hands on my head for mins then she asked me to kneel down and raise my hands for min naked u think i deserved it and i was to stay bare bottomed that day and go shopping with my mom crap everyone there laughed at me mom also made me wear a shirt which was printed my mom spanked me in front of my friends did i deserve it i think so 'coz smoking was strictly prohibited in my house that's a nice try but actually it is not a nice try you have added to many highly unbelieveable facts and that makes people not to believe your story i'd suggest you make it a bit shorter with only the spanking in front of your friends without the bare bottom and all the other stuff about t shirts and walking naked etc i mena this is more likely to be believed to then a cup of such facts at the same time and also next time try to say you are or because spanking an yo is let's say hysically impossible if the yo doesn't want to be spanked and it would be more believeable if you say that nothing happened in front of anybody else but add some harsh facts for example my mom tied me to the bed and spanked me of course after you say you're to sum up the story is funny but i highly doubt anyone with his all intelligence in usa i mean people who are not that intelligent usually would believe and that makes it not the way you want and you want to see comments as what call cps your mother is crazy or omg how could a mother do that to her child it is possible just try to make the story a little bit more believeable and don't forget to cut off some really strange facts good luck Spanking Erotic spanking Shaggy dog story Social rule Undergarment Buttocks Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Mojave people Recurring South Park characters Theory of conduct Ron and Fez Nudity Piccolo Junior Saga Pitaten Plame affair Bart chalkboard gags Good Morning, Vietnam Have I Got News For You Humphrey Bogart Rocko's Modern Life Downing Street memo SpongeBob SquarePants The Ashlee Simpson Show Hazing Opie and Anthony Paul Is Dead Punishment Paddle (spanking) Kim Possible Undergrads Dilbert Sento Jam (TV series) Cindy Sheehan Sharon Tate Futurama (TV series - season 2) Sin City Dogville Time Out of Mind Joke Sinfest Strap Rich Mullins Kodocha The Catcher in the Rye Friends Kenny McCormick Trailer Park Boys Avenue Q Characters in the Smurfs Doug Cigarette Smoking Man Fred Phelps The Smoking Room The Marshall Mathers LP Mnemonic Mickey Mouse Brassiere Springfield Elementary School Pok__mon Live!
