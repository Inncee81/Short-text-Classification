i had this friend and then i met her kids what to do now i love my girlfriend we hung out when our kids were in school it went well then i met her kids they are out of control and get violent i dont' want my daughter around them anymore but i dont' want to lose my friend i am in a position right now where i really need friends as i have had a big loss and dont' have alot of support right now i have decided not to have anymore day trips with them but for around town i thought we could hang out in the summer occasionally with the kids and keep it mostly to phone and email when the kids are in school i will be less 'busy' kinda decptive but i dont' want to tell her i can't be her friend because her kids are a bad influence on mine advise on how to keep a friendship with the contact with the kids minimum to nothing without confronting her and losing the friendship i know that i personally would be offended if someone didn't want their kids aroudn mine what ashame for you you really are between a rock a hard place w this situation how does she act when her children misbehave does she repromand them ignore them make excuses for them does she even try to correct them i'm just wondering if maybe they have some problems w their personalities or they are just plain brats spoiled brats i don't blame you for not wanting your daughter involved w those outbursts she is really going to have big problems when they get older are in trouble all the time because of it you did't mention ages but if they're in school act that way she's going to have her hands full w teachers principals guidence councellors unfortunately the only thing you can do is remain friends w her the best way you can as long as you don't have to be w her w o taking your daughter along other wise you'll just have to remain unavailable for whatever reason i'm sure that does put a strain on you coming up w excuses but what else are you to do what ashame but there really is no other option for you like you said you can't come rite out tell her the real reason unless you could off handedly make a remark about not wanting any of the children getting hurt when they're playing a bit rough you could say your daughter isn't use to rough housing since she's an only child just not acustom to being caught off guard you don't want anything to happen to interfere w your friendship w her because of any misunderstandings because of your children other than that i don't know what to suggest i wish you the best Kodocha Social rule The Adventures of Pete & Pete The Fairly OddParents Shaggy dog story Cliff Richard Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Rich Mullins One Tree Hill (TV series) EastEnders Poker jargon The Catcher in the Rye Something Positive The Marshall Mathers LP Beavis and Butt-head Saved by the Bell Humphrey Bogart Ed, Edd n Eddy About a Boy The O.C.
