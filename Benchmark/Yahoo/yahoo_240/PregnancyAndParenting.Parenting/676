when will having two children get easier i am a mother of a two fabulous children aged months and years whew these are tough times can anyone tell me when i am going to feel a bit above water i used to think one child was a handful now that seems like a breeze i just feel like there is never enough times and i need at least more hands i spent two weeks looking after my two infants when my wife had to take time to complete some post grad education and to this day it was years ago i remember it being the toughest thing i ever did no exception i always thought of myself a fairly kid focused person but the kids were there every day there no matter what you just want to do some little thing for yourself but the kids are always there and that selfishness just made me feel guilty which then made me feel worse this was only two weeks and i started to feel like i was never going to do anything else in my life except look after them and there was nothing to look forward to so i have a huge amount of respect for stay at home parents the good thing is that it was all in my mind it does eventually end and every minute that you spend now being a patient good mother will pay you back ten fold on the flip side you will always regret those moments when you got angry and there is no way to take them back i now have pangs of regret for those two little babies who grew so big years old is a huge progressive point where they really get independent but thats too far away to be on your horizon right now the good thing is that it is a slow but sure progression between now and then i think you should just look forward to the day when they are both out of diapers and then out of pull ups when they will both be walking gradually you will be able to stop taking so much stuff every time you go out sitting down and reading a story to them can be both relaxing for you and good for them both go places where you can take the kids and socialise with other parents joining a mum's club can keep you sane in the meantime good luck you are raising the future and the better you do it the better they will be i know this is a lot of writing but i also want to share this poem that my oldest was given after his first year in kindergarten you should print it out and tape it the fridge i believe it was written by julie o brien take time to hold me on your lap to joke with me and make me laugh take time mommy this time will go so fast take time to give me extra hugs to teach me a nursery rhyme or song take time mommy i won't be little long take time to tuck me into bed to read that story you know by heart take time mommy soon these days will part take time to exclaim over what i color to admire the things i make from clay take time mommy i'm growing up and away take time to imagine or make believe to play some childish silly game take time mommy soon it won't be the same take time to let me help you work to teach me the many things you know take time mommy enjoy me as i grow Aerial (dance move) Shaggy dog story Care Bears EastEnders Hey Jude About a Boy The Contender (television series) The McGuire Sisters 2000 Australian Grand Prix Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Milton H.
