what do you think of the dugger family with the children mrs dugger just had her th child and is looking forward to having more i personally think she is sainted woman for having all those children and if she wants to have more i think that is great all the children are home schooled all the children help out with their brothers and sister i think the father did or does something in real estate i know he did something in congress like he was a congressman at one time they all helped built the house they are living in i also think they paid cash for it too all the children have the first name that starts with a j i think this is a wonderful family and the more the better i totally agree with you something that alot of people on here are not getting is that this family is extremely religious i actually believe the same way that they do in regards to having children they believe that every child they have is a blessing from god and they don't feel that it is their place to decide how many children god wants to bless them with that is why the mom doesn't use any form of birth control i also don't believe in using birth control however god has chosen to only bless me with children perhaps he knows that she can handle that many and i couldn't it has amazed me to read all the questions and answers on here over the last few days about this family and to see how many people just want to put down and critisize them some people are more concerned with the fact that this christian family had kids and isn't on welfare food stamps wic or public housing yet you hardly ever see anyone on here complaining about the teenagers high school drop outs and women who already have kids who are already on welfare food stamps wic and in public housing who continue to keep having more and more kids some guy commented to me on here that it is his business because they are eating up the resourses on our planet that he and his kids have to live on is he serious and those women who have kids and who are on every type of public assistance available arn't whether it was this family or teenagers who get pregnant with unwanted babies children are going to continue to be born in the country i would rather see them born into a family like that than to some teenager who is going to be in the welfare line every month that is what is using up our resources not this wonderful family Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an EastEnders Kodocha Humphrey Bogart Incarnations of Immortality Mary, the mother of Jesus Friends John the Baptist Welfare Laura Schlessinger Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints John Howard Yoder Herbert W.
