why do our parents feel the need to offer advice about raising our children i hate it when i ask my family not to do something with my child and they do it anyway for example a family member of mine kept giving my month old son pickles while i was trying to get him to eat his chicken and i finally told him not too because of the sodium and he needed to eat real food then he went to give him a grape and i was instructed not to give grapes because they can choke on the skin and i told him not to give it to him and he said why i finally said because he will get choked and i asked you not too i now i sound like a but when did grandparents start to dictate what we do for their grandchildren i mean i fear some of my family in keeping an eye on him and people wonder why i don't let my child stay with anyone oh by the way he gave him a huge chunk of that pickle before i had a chance to ask him not too and my son got choked i had to pull it out of his mouth they do it b c it is them my battle was diet pepsi and grandma's cup if you feel that they do not watch him well enough then do not send him but honestly you survived it so how bad could it be i ended up laying down the law as to how my children would be raised and that she can offer her opinion but nothing else and it seemed to work they are at grandma's and grandma will spoil them that is true in most cases they mean well and i am sure they do not do it to spite you i said i told you so lots of times and after awhile she just let it go and started carrying through with certain things i definitely did not want happening talk to them like an adult and if all else fails stop taking him around them but explain why you do not they will come around but you can not expect them to stop completely i still do stuff for my nieces nail polish and chapstick specifically and my brother hates it but lets me do it cause it is only at my house and that is what aunts are for good luck Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Kodocha Social rule Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Garfield Charmed Pitaten 613 mitzvot Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sin City Family Little Britain Piccolo Junior Saga Avenue Q Grandview, U.S.A.
