did i make a parenting error with my year old my dad was over for supper i told him that my daughter had this old friend who wouldn't share her and was putting guit trips and leaving messages on our phone full of drama and how she needed my daughter to call her because she has this huge problem and doesn't my duaghter want to be her friend and she misses my daughter so much and all this very manipulative for a little year old she would ask my daughter so many questions when they talked about where she was going and for how long and on and on so my daughter called her back after many months and said i can't be your friend anymore i have a mom and a borhter and a dog and i just dont' have time and i dont' have to answer your questions ' i told my dad about this and said how proud i was of my daughter my dad looked at me like i was crazy and teaching my daughter to be rude i though i was teaching my daughter to speak her mind and not allow herself to be treated that way am i wrong to be proud of that hey my daughter is not a bitch that is uncalled for and rude from your description it sounds as if this little girl the friend has some problems and needs some support but that is not your child's or your obligation that's an uncomfortable situation for an adult let alone a little girl considering that this friend would most likely not have taken a subtle hint from your daughter i think the direct route was fine and perhaps even necessary you did the right thing supporting your daughter just make sure that she knows that she should always be kind when she is being direct and otherwise i'm not saying she wasn't i'm just saying its a great thing to teach your kids i'm a child and family therapist so for whatever its worth it was a much healthier response for your daughter to tell the little friend she couldn't be there for her this would not have been a healthy friendship she could not really have helped her friend with her extreme needs and it would have drained her and you had she tried having said that if you had any relationship at all with the mother i would encourage you to talk with her about her daughter in a helpful way the likelihood however is that the mom is just an acquaintance which in that case it would be an insult if you said something you and your daughter did the right thing Social rule Shaggy dog story Friends EastEnders Kodocha About a Boy Theory of conduct Kurt Cobain One Tree Hill (TV series) The Fairly OddParents The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy W.I.T.C.H.
