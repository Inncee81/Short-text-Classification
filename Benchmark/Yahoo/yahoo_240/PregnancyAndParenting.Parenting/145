isn't it about time that we banned dangerous dogs and had all dogs leashed and muzzled around children http news bbc co uk hi england dorset stm i don't want to hear all of these arguments that it's not the dog it's the owner i just think that we should protect our children these are animals for god's sake i know robert c but i don't care the children must come first no matter how cute their wild animals are doobiedrm yes that's disgusting and i could tell you of what i had to put up with on my boys' shoes if they forgot to take them off at the door too before the days of poopscoops and even then who regulates that they are unhygeinic too i should add that they should wear nappies too or preferably banned altogether except for working dogs in the countryside disrespectul to dogs animals rl have you completely lost all perspective my nappy suggestion was a joke although i heared that tourist horses in new york had to wear them correct me if i am wrong anyway leashes and muzzles are a must if it only saves one child from being savaged and as moonstone says the nappies aren't such a bad idea anyway i am sure that my boys got worms from picking up dirt from the park from other people's pet droppings and that can cause blindness so don't make light of it so i left the f out of disrespectful above just as well maybe i agree fully there are too many instances of dogs attacking children even family dogs when the owners can't believe it why take the chance why should my kids be at risk because someone else wants a dog and because they trust it everyones opinions are different and maybe they think their dog is great and will never attack but i dont want to take any chances with my children and any dog all dogs should be muzzled in public and dangerous dogs need to be banned i mean what exactly do people keep dangerous dogs for there are plenty non dangerous pets after all Fox hunting Dog Ferret Pit bull Dog training Theory of conduct Humphrey Bogart Animal rights Docking Gray Wolf Obedience training Shaggy dog story Garfield The Death Gate Cycle Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Zoophilia Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Azaria Chamberlain disappearance Consensus decision-making Philosophical skepticism Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Cat Plame affair Joke Whaling Working dog Trailer Park Boys Political correctness Horseshoe RuneScape quests 613 mitzvot Characters in the Smurfs Game show Friends Dog collar Punk ideology Pet skunk Domestic rabbit The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Discordianism The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Animal Farm Pun Paul Is Dead Originalism Poker jargon Diaper Abortion debate Ocean Beach, New York Pet Separation of church and state Aerial (dance move) Lisa the Vegetarian Breath of Fire III Teacher's Pet (Disney) Dog agility Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Cleveland Browns Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Biblical inerrancy Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Sin City Taboo food and drink Ontological argument Leash Kylie Minogue Socrates Fathers' rights The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Hitchhiking Animal testing Yusuf al-Qaradawi Rabies Libertarianism Little Britain Police dog The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Spyware Philosophy of language Futurama (TV series - season 5) American Eskimo Dog Doraemon Trapping Hunting Joseph (Hebrew Bible) Ranma __ characters George Orwell Tobacco smoking Landmarks of Hoboken, New Jersey Milton H.
