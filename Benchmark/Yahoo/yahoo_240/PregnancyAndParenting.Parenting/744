what are your views on breastfeeding i believe that if possble it best for both child and mother and commercial considerations and convenience should not come into it http news bbc co uk hi health stm very well put adayinjanuary and others stick to your guns for the children's sake and don't be put off by silly ignorant people it was even worse when my boys were babies in some ways but in others not so bad and like for many things we do need a campaign as you say in order to remind people what normal natural childrearing is all about certainly it shouldn't be seen simply an opportunity for commercial firms to make a profit by offering a better easier alternative to what is natural well mary doll i did say if possible even if i spelt it wrong but i don't want to argue with you what you say is correct if the mother is genuinely happy the child will be happy the other thought that came to me was that once there were wet nurses for children mainly through wealthy mothers not wanting the bother of breastfeeding but it is an idea for those mothers who want their children to have natural milk but can't provide it themselves although i am not sure how it would work in practice these days breastfeeding is natural i bottlefed my first as i was not given support and did not realise how better it was for the baby my next children were breastfed yes i have i get better sleep breastfeeding its there baby does not have to wait while bottle is made if more support from midwives was given i am sure more would do it as for showing boobs in public i have seen lots of nusing mums and have never noticed their boobs why is it cute for animals to feed their young but not humans why do we produce milk if its not right Breastfeeding Theory of conduct EastEnders Infant Fertility awareness Childbirth Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Breast Little Britain Microeconomics Midwifery Goodness and value theory Humphrey Bogart Milk Nestl__ boycott Shaggy dog story Abortion debate Pregnancy International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes Economics Utilitarianism Theodicy About a Boy Social rule Kibbutz Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Aristotle Knots Landing Breast milk Infant formula Pitaten Jam (TV series) Ayyavazhi mythology The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Sharon Tate Parenting Nipple Peter Singer Dairy Socrates Nicomachean Ethics Criticism of libertarianism Infantilism Infanticide Comanche Married... with Children Medicare (Canada) Health science Supply and demand Autism rights movement Kodocha Libertarianism Nestl__ Law of value The Amber Spyglass Margaret Sanger Recurring South Park characters Divorce Punk ideology Brassiere 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Wealth Fox hunting The nature of God in Western theology Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Current teachings of Prem Rawat Horus Stuttering Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Teenage pregnancy Milton H.
