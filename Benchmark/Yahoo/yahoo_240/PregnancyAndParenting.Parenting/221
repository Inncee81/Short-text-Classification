did your father have an interest in you growing up i was talking with a friend today and i realized that my father wasn't really interested in me or my sister when we were kids unless we'd done something bad so he could punish us or if my mom was doing something with us for example when we were kids my sister had really bad diarhea and needed medicine it was dark outside and i asked my father if he could take us to cvs to get some he said no so i asked my mother when my father heard she was going to take us he suddenly was interested in driving he may have not known how to show his interest you would be surprised of the people who were not shown a lot of love and affection themselves as children and how difficult it is to give try to find out a little about his growing up years may help you to understand what is making him tick today One Tree Hill (TV series) About a Boy Pitaten The Ashlee Simpson Show Kodocha Rocko's Modern Life Shaggy dog story Springfield Elementary School Daredevil Doug Baby Blues Theory of conduct Kimi Finster The Fairly OddParents Milton H.
