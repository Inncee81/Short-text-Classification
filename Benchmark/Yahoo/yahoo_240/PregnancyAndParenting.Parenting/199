and she wants a baby my niece ally who just turned yrs old months ago wants to have a baby to love and care for read last post more info she thinks that there are tons of single moms who make it working finishing school who get good jobs dress nicley and still get to have lives party ect she is basing this off of me and of my friends who are single moms but she is overlooking the fact that we were all yrs old or older when we became parents and also in college already she does not see how hard it was for us to finish college all the help we needed to do so or all of the tight budgeting involved that all the nice things she see's are the result of finishing college something that is difficult to do with a child to support how do i give her the reality check without beig too harsh is taking her to a parenting class for young or teen moms too harsh i have one child a daughter turning soon but i dont think i would trust them alone together there are classes at planned parenthood about teen mother's that might wake her up to the reality of it but hon sometimes the only way to learn a lesson is to make the mistake that's a harsh lesson to learn but sometimes no matter what you or anyone else could say if she is determined none of it will matter all you can do is be there for her if she doesn't listen i knew better didn't want a baby young but at made a stupid mistake and found myself pregnant i married the father always a bad idea and of course that ended in divorce i then worked jobs to support us both it sucked my child was always in daycare i didn't get to raise him the way i wanted in those early years i am one of the lucky ones i found a wonderful man that loves me my son and brought his son into my life we have children of our own too now but for every success there are more so that are still struggling my cousin thought the same thing just because i was okay she would be okay she is now living in a very crappy apartment her child is sick all the time from being born premature to a teen mother and she has no medical insurance the father is a creep of the th degree and she doesn't have much money coming into the home at all even though she works full time she has no money or time for college or higher learning because she is busy working to pay medical bills harsh yes but it's what she got herself into and she realizes that now of course she has her family there for her but she is so full of self pity that she is refusing our help she is still learning the hard way some ppl are just going to have to Avenue Q One Tree Hill (TV series) Charmed Friends EastEnders Kodocha Days of our Lives Humphrey Bogart Hollyoaks Alois Hitler Knots Landing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Characters in the Smurfs Infantilism Kim Possible Phoebe Halliwell Fancy Crane Good Times Everwood Married... with Children Laura Schlessinger Great Teacher Onizuka Abortion debate Neighbours Futurama (TV series - season 5) Shaggy dog story Jon Secada Sharon Tate Luke and Laura Spencer The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Ocean's Twelve Badly Drawn Kitties Boston Public Miss Saigon The Amber Spyglass Incarnations of Immortality Little Britain History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Sin City Recurring South Park characters Marilyn Monroe Daredevil Adoption Ranma __ characters Fathers' rights Le Malade imaginaire Poker jargon Lex Luthor Divorce Cindy Sheehan Satchel Paige Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Beavis and Butt-head Polyamory The O.C.
