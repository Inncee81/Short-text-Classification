why do the fervent 'pro spankers' keep shoving their view at everyone that spanking is the 'only' discipline in actual fact spanking is a punishment not a discipline but that's beside the point the strangest part is when someone who spanks claims that someone is lying when they say they don't spank and have well behaved kids does this then mean that we can assume if you do spank you are lying about how hard and actually do abuse them of course not why do you have to be so defensive look back over some spanking questions about if the rude and ignorant answers are coming from the die hard pro spankers nobody wants you to say it's wrong it isn't just stop making out that yours is the only punishment that works can anyone see this point let me apologise in advance if this causes offence to anybody it's not meant to i'm just trying to understand why people are like this oh for heaven's sake mimi and a couple of the others please read the question i'm not asking for yet another debate on for or against spanking i've already aknowledged that it's just some very fervent pro spankers who do this and yes some very fervent anti spankers do it also but most of the rude responses come from pro spankers i'm not against spanking i don't know how many times it takes for that to sink in frankly even i am beginning to think of these people as ignorant judging by some very misguided responses pink cowgirl all of the above applies to you lol i'm not shoving my views down anyone's throat i'm asking why other people do that i don't know how much clearer i can make my questions i thought they were pretty easy to understand if you can't read them don't bother responding as for why i keep asking about certain topics not that it's anyone's business it's because i'm interested want to know something and have as much right to post non offensive material on this forum as anyone else does again if you don't like them don't answer them easy not everyone is this way Spanking Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Socrates Plame affair Punishment Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Capital punishment James Dobson Erotic spanking Atheism Presuppositional apologetics Originalism Goodness and value theory Serial killer Philosophical skepticism Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Abortion debate Corporal punishment Resurrection of Jesus Human sexual behavior Kasparov versus The World Economics Buttocks Biblical inerrancy Theodicy The nature of God in Western theology Internet troll GED Landmark Education Intelligent design Philosophy of language Religion Determinism Satanism Parapsychology Singlish Scientology beliefs and practices Apology (Plato) Evil Creationism Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Lie Rigging Cultural relativism A Course In Miracles David Hume Have I Got News For You Free will BDSM Paddle (spanking) Western philosophy Time Out of Mind Appeal Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Cult Teach the Controversy God Emperor of Dune Leviathan (book) Parliament of the United Kingdom Anger management Milton H.
