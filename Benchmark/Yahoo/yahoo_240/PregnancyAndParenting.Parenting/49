goals and dreams but no available help what are some soloutions i am working on graduating with my bachlors two more semseters attending grad school right after i graduate w bachlors paying down debt only owe thousand and becoming a home owner which shouldn't be hard after meeting the above goals however my biggest problem leading up to competing all of these is lack of safe affordable and reliable child care my kids are and the more i work help food stamps childcare payments is taken away or unaffordable b c they are income based making my goal less of a reality childcare is a major barrier and i have no help of any kind from anyone my family lives hrs aways and everyone else i know knows that i could use the help but since i look ok on the outside they do not offer and if they do it is because i beg i just want to be happy and self suffient why can't i just get the help i need why are people so mean when it comes to helping out if someone volunteered to help it would make so much of a difference in my life if childcare is not within your budget as a single parent there should be some kind of state help available there the government usually wants to encourage people into work not make it financially impossible the only way to achieve your dream is to pay for childcare you could wait until your youngest is in school so that then all you are paying for is pre and after school care rather than full time daycare for your youngest you can't just rely on other people to volunteer to help it doesn't work like that no one ever volunteered to help me i have just had to tough it out and find a way Childcare Day care Philosophical skepticism Unemployment Division of labour Graduate school Microeconomics Education in the People's Republic of China Credit card Alcoholics Anonymous Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Freeters Tax Economy of the United States Education in Japan Economy of Russia Divorce Life insurance Child support Israeli Arab Economic inequality Anarchism and society Fathers' rights Psychoanalysis Insurance Pitaten Education in the United States Bretton Woods system Avenue Q Abortion in the United States Hillary Rodham Clinton Rudolf Steiner Weimar Republic Adoption American Red Cross Annuity Great Depression Gold standard Canadian and American economies compared Teenage pregnancy Taxation in the United States Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Kibbutz Capitalism Salary cap Keynesian economics Food Stamp Program Miss Saigon Sento Health insurance FairTax May 2005 in Canada AIDS in Africa Personal finance Mortgage Altruism Transactional analysis Poverty Fiat money Anthroposophy W.I.T.C.H.
