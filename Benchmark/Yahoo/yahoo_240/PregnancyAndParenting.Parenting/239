what are parents views on having a cellphone for their kids what ages do you believe are complelty inappropriate for kids to have their own cellphones my neice who is years old was approached by a girl in school who asked to have her cell phone number my sister was astonished then the girls mother actually asked my sister if my neice had a cell phone and explained that her year old daughter has one for emergancies and joked that she had already had it taken away for texting too much hello does anyone else think that this is absurd i am all for using technology to keep our young ones safe i myself will allow my children to have cellphones on their person when they are old enough to keep communication readily available i think in todays world we need that safety they have programs for kids such as emergancy installed prepaid phones blocked numbers aside from emergancy contacts and maybe one or other personal but i think this should begin once the child enters high school possible junior high if you believe it is acceptable what reasons can you give because in my eyes there should be no year old un accompainied by an adult an year old has no business being without supervision long enough to need a cell phone for emergancies they are either i school where there is access to land line phones at home again landlines or at a friends house land lines i'll give the bennefit of the doubt and say that the child i possibly walking home from school and in order to ensure safety the parents give her a cell phone to walk to and form school but it should end there block all outgoing and incoming calls except that of emergancy contacts and what year old has such anetwork of friends that a cell phone is needed for personal enjoyment its crazy i think they dont need a cell phone until they are responsible enough to leave the house without me or their dad with them whether that is or either way they have to prove themselves Mobile phone Short message service North American Numbering Plan Global System for Mobile Communications The Fairly OddParents Contemporary culture of South Korea Kodocha Telephone tapping Sharon Tate The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Mobile phone radiation and health About a Boy Ocean's Twelve Social rule Call for help Morse Code 9-1-1 Telkom Fathers' rights GSM services Verizon Wireless Surveillance School bus Domestic violence One Tree Hill (TV series) Generation Y Skype Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Communication during the September 11, 2001 attacks The Shining (film) Telephone Cornelia Rau War of the Worlds (2005 film) Bluetooth Drowning Modem Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Springfield Elementary School High school Air traffic control Final Fantasy: Unlimited Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Beaumont children disappearance Ben Johnson (athlete) Hearing impairment StarCraft Secret Missions Gmail Virgin Mobile Emergency telephone number Transsexuality Pitaten Motion picture rating system Code division multiple access Burglar alarm Humphrey Bogart John Kerr UK telephone numbering plan Columbine High School massacre Mitosis Saved by the Bell Solar cell Over-the-air programming The Catcher in the Rye Salad Fingers Mystique (comics) Code: Lyoko Autism Silent Night, Deadly Night Child Human sexual behavior Baby Blues Customer relationship management Codename: Kids Next Door Order of succession Meiosis Shaggy dog story Plame affair Network Switching Subsystem The End of the World (Doctor Who) Elevator Private branch exchange Emergency service Hiking Argentine telephone numbering plan Adolescence Jennifer Lopez Camera phone G-Man (Half-Life) The Emancipation of Mimi AT&T Database management system Extreme Programming Shawn Michaels Hikikomori Digital Subscriber Line Kill Bill
