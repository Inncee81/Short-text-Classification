what would happen if my year old son kill some body nonono he didnt do anything im watching a show bout murders and they are all old and going to jail so i was just wondering what would happen if a little kid did that sry if i worried you chances are the defense would be that he is too young to fully understand right and wrong a murder at this age would be at most considered manslaughter he would probably have to undergo therapy i don't see him being locked up there would probably be more penalties for his caretaker for neglect Murder The Shining (film) Treehouse of Horror V Manslaughter Capital punishment Syphon Filter Inspector Gadget Milton H.
