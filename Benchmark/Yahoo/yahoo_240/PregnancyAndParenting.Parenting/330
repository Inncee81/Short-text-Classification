are parents to blameif their child gets sexually abused if a child is sexually abused by a family member ie a grandparent or an uncle is this the parents fault that they never suspected abuse was happening baring in mind abusers manipulate the family and the dynamics of a family opinions please it may seems like a strange question but i recently discovered my little angels were being abused by someone who was my idol not only my father but my best friend i thought his interest in my children was as a loving grandfather if had of known or suspected never in a million yers would i have left them but within the community the fingers are being pointed at me i should have known but i honestly had no idea i have firmly believed that the abuser is the only one to blame but the community feel i should have known btw the community are supporting my father apparently he would never do such a thing and no physical signs or emotional signs were shown by my oldest daughter and luckily for me i walked in as he was up to no good with my then year old have asked myself many times what signs were there must have been something and honestly i did not see any and i was abused myself not by him so i have always been fully aware of the signs but none ok someone just said that children should know about good touches and bad touches and be aware of sexual abuse well because of my own abuse i have been great in making them aware but this still happened as a response to sweet i am not acting like poor me at all and i do not feel sorry for myself my kids are in therapy and receiving all the help they can get and as for me not being strong you are totally wrong strenght is reporting your father for child abuse and preventing it from happening to others which i know there is at least others strenght is making sure that my kids live as normal a life as possible strenght is moving on dispite your grief as the mother of a child that was abused i understand where you are coming from in this question my daughter was abused by an ex partner of mine when she was very small more than years ago i have always felt that i was in some way responsible that i should have spotted something seen the signs but i never did these animals are usually very emotionally manipulative and can worm their way into family affections often becoming a valued family friend its often not until the child speaks up about the abuse that anyone has any idea what is going on the only time the parent is responsible is if they are part of the abusers circle and are party to the heinous crime the best advice i can give you is to take each day as it comes be there for your children and believe them ignore the gossip and stand firm Knots Landing 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Domestic violence Scientology beliefs and practices Child sexuality EastEnders Autism Theory of conduct Milton H.
