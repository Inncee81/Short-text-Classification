don't you hate it when people compare babies to animals there are actually people who think the life of a child is somehow lower or equal to an animal how insane is that i like my pets more than most people i meet and my dogs are like my kids but comparing the worth of a baby to an animal how could they i agree with you nobody should compare the life of an animal no matter how wonderful and loving that animal is to a child person no animal no matter how intelligent and capable can compare to a child an animal operates strictly on instinct and what it has learned been taught but a child has the ability to choose and gains more and more independence the older they get and can make a choice to accept or ignore what they have been taught in a way completely different than an animal so i totally agree how can you compare Polyamory Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Abortion debate Speciesism Peter Singer Intelligence quotient Force (Star Wars) Dog Comparative psychology Predestination KaBlam!
