problems with my dvd recorder i have a pye dvd recorder but my problem isn't with the dvd player part it's with the vcr part whenever i try to turn the dvd player on the dvd recorder tries to eject a tape which isn't even in there before this happened a tape got stuck in there and the tape was all tangled in i put the cassette back in and it was able to rewind the tape part of the cassette back into the cassette so that's my problem oh i also can use the dvd part of the recorder either because it turns off right away and i tried unpluging and replugging the dvd recorder but i have the same delema and it even kept the time which doesn't normally happen well that's my problem i appreciate the time anyone takes to answer this question in my experience anything that has the combo written on it is gonna give you problems i have had plenty of the same tech probs as you and my advice is to ditch the vcr and just buy a dvd recorder with hdd capacity you can still attach a vcr to the recorder via a scart an tape all your videos to dvd and you will have less hassle i have been through several dvd recorders in my time and the one i have now is the best its a pioneer dvr h it has hrs of hdd space and will copy any recordings on your hdd to dvd in bulk in minutes i know this is not what you wanted to hear you want to fix the one you have but in the long run most electrical shops will tell you the same that when you combine machines there is always something lost hope i've helped sorry if i haven't Videocassette recorder DVD Laserdisc Compact audio cassette Compact disc Betamax TiVo 8 mm video format Digital video recorder Camcorder SCART Copy protection Videotape PolyGram Audio tape length and thickness Sound recording Floppy disk S-VHS Escape from New York Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Gramophone record Macrovision Mixtape High-definition television Live Aid Time Out of Mind Hard disk DVD recorder Halting problem S__CAM DV Videotape format war Windows XP Blood on the Tracks ZX Spectrum The Star Wars Holiday Special Wheel of Fortune Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Multitrack recording Virtual memory IPod MiniDisc Vision of Love IBM PC compatible Doctor Who missing episodes Magnetic tape Oasis (band) Girls Aloud Television Ren and Stimpy Sony Corp. of America v.
