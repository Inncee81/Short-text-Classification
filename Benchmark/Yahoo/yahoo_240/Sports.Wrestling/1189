an adult grizzly bear vs the great khali who will win this battle assumptions grizzly bear ft tall lbs adult male in its peak of testosterone and sexual urge the great khali ft in lbs adult male in his peak of testosterone and sexual urge batte ground forest in canada in the wild weapons bear nothing his massive claws the great khali anything he can grab and use as a weapon in the wild of the forest let the battle begin and place your bets ok motto you killed the fun of this question but your answer is the best one because is the most correct one until now but again it was a fun question that you killed with your seriousness yeah i can see that willie d your answer was very informative and creative wow lol the bear will kick his ass in about seconds the bear only has a slight height advantage but is nearly twice as heavy over of the bear's weight will be over khali when the bear stands up and raises it's paws over khali the average grizzly bear claw is about inches long he has of these although he will only use unless khali manages to get in close enough to the bear so mr grizzly cannot take swings at him here is where khali will buy some time once in close khali will have to punch the lower jaw of the bear if he is lucky enough to have grabbed a rock prior to this he may have a shot at wounding the bear otherwise it will just get pissed off even more chances are at this point the bear will flop on khali that will hurt if khali gets knocked unconscious then his chances for survival are actually pretty good once he is out cold the bear will most likely leave as he will no longer view khali as a threat however if still in a fighting mood khali will soon be a goner the bear will most likley now pounce several times on the once great khali thus enabling it to use all claws and it's massive weight not to mention the bear also has teeth you might try to restrict the bear to claws only but c'mon it's a bear khali will have at least of the following injuries by this point broken ribs broken scapula if not both broken sternum multiple concussions broken collerbone punctured lung spine damage most likely thorasic but lumbar and cervical damage is likely as well massive trauma to internal organs not limited to but most likely ruptured slpeen kidney damage intestinal damage internal bleeding additionally lacerations contusions abrasions and insicions if bitten by the bear puncture wounds as well it's a good chance by this time if not dead the bear will leave khali alone he might eat him but that's a chance bear may just feel like hitting a cold stream for some salmon however khali is in the middle of the canadian forest most likely unable to move and bleeding from external wounds and internal injuries chances are he will expire in an hour or so unless there is lung damage then he will go a bit quicker Equine conformation American Black Bear Mixed martial arts Professional wrestling holds Stopping power Unreal Traumatic brain injury Brown Bear Puberty Gray Wolf Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Tenshinhan Poker jargon First aid Professional wrestling throws Terminal ballistics Cancer Leon White Professional wrestling attacks Wound Snake Boxing Professional wrestling match types Head injury Columbine High School massacre Team Fortress Classic Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Piccolo Junior Saga Kurt Angle Cat Pok__mon Abilities 2000 Australian Grand Prix Diving Vertebral column Tyrannosaurus rex Trapping GunBound GunZ The Duel Drowning Aerial (dance move) Pok__mon types Androgen insensitivity syndrome Space disaster Counter-Strike Spider Anal sex Professional wrestling slang Happy Tree Friends Drill bit Natural Selection (computer game) Professional wrestling aerial techniques Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Swimming The Cure Battlebots Swingout Trench warfare Limit Break Day of Defeat Akuma (Street Fighter) Toronto Raptors Childbirth Tank English longbow Quake III Arena EastEnders Abortion debate World Championship Wrestling Mark Calaway Donald Neilson Battle of Jutland StarCraft Episode IV Social rule Warrior (World of Warcraft) Penis Dog agility Great White Shark Single bullet theory Characters of Naruto Autonomic nervous system Spinal cord Rape Mountain Gorilla Airsoft Worms weapons and tools Sternum Ron and Fez Premature birth Guilty Gear Abortion Sling (weapon)
