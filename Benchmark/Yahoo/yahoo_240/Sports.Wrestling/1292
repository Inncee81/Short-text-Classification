do you think chris benoit was clinically depressed during the killings this is my theory with the benoit murder suicide case i feel that he might have been clinically depressed during the killings of his wife and son and he felt he was doing was what he had to do yes clinically depressed also undiagnosed and untreated but unfortunately still able to plan and carry out the murders people in a depression start to suffer from intrusive thoughts of violence against themselves or others it's these uncontrollable thoughts that sometimes drive people to seek help but if they go without treatment long enough those same horrible thoughts start to sound like good ideas eventually those ideas become irresistible that's when they start to make their plans to actually do it and yeah before someone can do something like this they pretty much have to convince themselves that they're doing their families a favor by killing them when you're no longer rational that's easy i think it's possible daniel may not have had fragile x i think that may be one of the things chris invented in his depression as a part of the rationalizations he had to make in order to finally be able to kill himself and take the family with him i mean he tells his coworkers that his son is retarded but the kid's own grandparents don't know his teachers don't know there's no medical record of testing the child for fragile x at least not so far so yes i think chris had to work up to mercy killing his family so that he could then kill himself which is probably what he had wanted to do all along it probably took years to get to that point depressed people can be very good at hiding their secrets i wish he'd been going to see a real doctor who might have been able to figure out what was going on instead of a prescription happy quack Clinical depression Bipolar disorder Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Suicide Knots Landing Sigmund Freud Autism rights movement Theory of conduct Adult attention-deficit disorder Post-traumatic stress disorder Transsexuality Obsessive-compulsive disorder Medical views of suicide Murder Antidepressant Chris Benoit About a Boy Eddie Guerrero Homeopathy EastEnders Pitaten Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Kurt Angle Abortion debate Charles Darwin's illness Mental retardation The Catcher in the Rye Psychoanalysis Columbine High School massacre Medicine The Venture Bros.
