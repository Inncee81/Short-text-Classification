will the wwe finally let cm punk win at summerslam you think i'm sure him and john morisson will have a match at summerslam anyway i'm hoping he finally wins since hes the only face in the title picture on ecw then he could people let elijah burke or marcus cor von even have a chance for the belt who agrees oops meant let people like elijah burke yep defaintly cm punk has been a face in ecw for a while and he hasn't held the title yet for some reason i think morrison may retain at summerslam but he will defianlty lost the title at unforgiven no matter how long morrison holds the title for cm punk will still be the one to take it off him there are others like boogeyman but he's already feuding with big daddy v and there is also dreamer but he hasn't been in the title picture for awhile and i don't think wwe are just going to give him a title shot from out of nowhere so cm punk is the exact face to win the title so the cor von and elijah can go for it elijah and cor von are the two underrated wrestlers in ecw and i hope they get title shots soon especially elijah he would make a great champion wwe should just go ahead and make it a fatal four way match for the title at summerslam morrison c vs cm punk vs cor von vs burke extreme rules i'd like to see that so cm punk should be able to win the title by unforgiven and then by the end of the year either cor von or elijah will be champ great question starred summerslam is randy orton's destiny Chris Benoit Mark Calaway John Layfield Kurt Angle Paul Levesque Randy Orton John Cena Peter Senerca Glen Jacobs Shawn Michaels The Rock (entertainer) Bret Hart Professional wrestling match types David Bautista Adam Copeland WWE Intercontinental Championship SummerSlam Stone Cold Steve Austin Ric Flair Greg Valentine WWE Unforgiven Paul Wight Lance Storm Extreme Championship Wrestling Tom Laughlin (wrestler) Mick Foley Amy Dumas Mike Alfonso Championship unification Leon White Perry Satullo Brock Lesnar World Heavyweight Championship Professional wrestling slang Music in professional wrestling King of the Ring World Wrestling Entertainment WWE RAW Yoshihiro Tajiri Rodney Anoai Warrior (wrestler) Vince McMahon Hulk Hogan Chris Jericho The Invasion Oscar Gutierrez WWE No Mercy Terry Gerin Paul Heyman WrestleMania XX Ricky Steamboat Evolution (professional wrestling) NWo WWE Armageddon Taboo Tuesday Matt Hardy Stephanie McMahon-Levesque Masato Tanaka World Tag-Team Championship Gene Snitsky Darren Matthews Richard Rood Randy Savage Shane Douglas Tag team Jamar Shipman The Great American Bash World Championship Wrestling Terry Funk Trish Stratus Dean Simon Roddy Piper Mikey Whipwreck Danny Doring WWE Championship Nigel McGuinness Dudley Boyz Shelton Benjamin WWE Draft WWE Vengeance Bob Orton, Jr. Booker Huffman Chris Candito Jimmy Snuka ECW World Heavyweight Championship WWE Tag Team Championship Nelson Erazo NWA World Heavyweight Championship In Your House Virgil Runnels, Jr. WrestleMania
