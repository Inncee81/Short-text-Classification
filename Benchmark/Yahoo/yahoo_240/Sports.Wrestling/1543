brock lesnar what did you guys and girls think of brock's mma debut and will yall be supporting him he his opponent wasn't to game but his next fight should be better personally i've always liked brock lesnar he's a beast first off it takes a lot of balls to tell vince you are leaving to follow your dream secondly he has some potential in mma he's not up to par for ufc but where he is at right now is a good start he has size and grapple ability not to mention raw power i support him even if everyone else calls him a quitter and tears him down in youth you chase your dream and what you want to accomplish he's in that phase the flack brock gets is entertaining you don't see people ripping apart dwayne johnson for leaving wrestling to persue acting and a movie career now do you also he was a silver medalist in judo or something i hardly call that mike tyson vs brother runt Kurt Angle Brock Lesnar Bill Goldberg Mixed martial arts The Rock (entertainer) Ultimate Fighting Championship Paul Wight Hulk Hogan Professional wrestling holds Royal Rumble Martial art Paul Levesque WWE Championship Royce Gracie Chris Benoit Mike Tyson Mark Calaway Professional wrestling slang Stephanie McMahon-Levesque Matt Hardy Vince McMahon King of the Ring Shawn Michaels Ric Flair Professional wrestling match types Don Frye WWE Friday Night SmackDown!
