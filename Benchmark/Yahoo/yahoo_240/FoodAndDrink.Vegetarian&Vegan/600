cruelty free toothpaste that doesn't taste like blah okay so i've spent about on various cruelty free toothpastes and all of them taste like either nothing or like some sort of putrid hand lotion or something i don't even care if it's vegan i just want to find one that hasn't been tested on animals and doesn't contain non vegetarian animal ingredients i thought that at least one of the national brands would not test on animals but so far i haven't found it peta's compassionate shopper list says that oral b currently has a moratorium on testing they aren't doing it on a temporary basis hopefully to become permanent but i've not been able to find adult toothpaste from them just kids stuff that's like berry flavored or bubblegum flavored i just want a normal mint type toothpaste that actually makes my mouth feel like i just brushed it am i on a wild goosechase thanks everyone for your suggestions so far i've tried tom's flavors and don't care for them but i'll try some others as well tried jason and didn't like it but might try it again now that i'm not used to colgate etc anymore where would i find the nature's gate one i'll check again at the co op but don't remember seeing it there dailest's answer is inaccurate all toothpastes are not cruelty free far from it i like tom's of maine toothpaste in peppermint i also tried the spearmint flavor but didn't like it but i really like the peppermint if you've already tried tom's in a flavor other than peppermint and didn't like it i'd recommend trying the peppermint you might find it less objectionable tom's is cruelty free although the company was recently purchased by colgate which is not cruelty free however colgate has agreed to maintain the cruelty free policy when it comes to all tom's branded products so they are safe some people believe and i respect this opinion that even if tom's brand products are cruelty free you still shouldn't buy them since its parent company colgate does test its other products on animals my personal feeling is that it is ok to buy tom's and other cruelty free products that are produced by parent companies that are not cruelty free such as body shop which is now owned by loreal because you're still not supporting testing and you're sending a message to the parent company with every purchase that you will only buy cruelty free but that's an issue you'll have to consider for yourself Toothpaste People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Veganism Animal rights Kashrut Halitosis Tooth Theory of conduct Ethical consumerism Vegetarianism Little Britain Procter & Gamble Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Animal Liberation Front Colgate-Palmolive The Apprentice 2 Stomach cancer Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Motion picture rating system Egg (food) Prostate cancer Sugar substitute Plame affair Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Animal testing Wall Street Foie gras 2004 Republican National Convention Dog Mint Neopets Menthol Past teachings of Prem Rawat Divorce Infantilism American Red Cross Advertising Microeconomics Economics Essential oil Organic food Tobacco Peter Singer The Death Gate Cycle Tofu Fecal incontinence Cruelty to animals Altoids Aspartame LiveJournal Listerine Contract Sears Holdings Corporation Tattoo Food Upholstery Theodicy Flavouring Surveillance OK Soda Ramen Libertarianism Inca Kola Hypoglycemia Fathers' rights Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Philosophical skepticism The Amber Spyglass Shaggy dog story One Tree Hill (TV series) Fluoride therapy Pet skunk Avenue Q Rum Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Honey Coca-Cola Cigarette 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Cat McDonald's Coffee Capital punishment Annuity Chewing gum Brewery Cigar Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film) Animal welfare Cancer Gross domestic product Software engineering Kurt Cobain Futurama (TV series - season 5) Jumpstart 3rd Grade Prolog Episodes of Lost (Season 1)
