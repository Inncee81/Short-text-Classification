gelatine made from something besides feet i'm vegetarian and don't eat gelatine made of hooves skin bones and ligaments of animals and i am currently in germany and i wanted to bring back candy for my vegan friend i found some ultra dark chocolate and i wanted something else too so i asked a sales clerk they brought me to an expensive pack of gummie bears i know they usually have gelatine in them and i told the clerk but they insisted that they were vegan ilooked in the ingrediant list and sure enough it said that it contained gelatine but the sales clerk assured me that it was made of something else besides animals limbs and he pointed to something written on the container i can usually understand german but i couldn't decipher the label my question is can gelatine be made from something vegan if so what and why don't they always do it gelatine is made from bones ligaments and tendons of slaughtered animals as you said occaisitonally it is made from fish bones but would be clearly marked as such agar agar is a seaweed based gelatine like substance which is vegan but it would be very clearly marked as such and labeled suitable for vegetarians as would be products made from carageenan it may have been marked suitable for vegetarians but would not be vegan so many countries believe that vegetarians still eat animal by products so the mislabeling wouldnt surprise me i feel you would be better off with something not so questionable such as a hard candy can you bring me some goodies too thanks you are a gem i was raised in germany and miss their lovely sweets Gelatin Vegetarianism Veganism Marshmallow Kosher foods Kashrut Food Vegetarian cuisine Chocolate Gelatin dessert Gummy bear Equine conformation Unclean animals Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Tofu Confectionery Sausage Japanese cuisine Cantonese cuisine Cuisine of Singapore Food preservation E number Leather Ice cream People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Animal rights The Apprentice 2 Cuisine of Brazil Livestock Cheese Vegetarian nutrition Environmental vegetarianism Bone Halaal Buddhist cuisine Taboo food and drink Cyanocobalamin Egg (food) Fancy rat Radius (bone) Bulk vending Straight edge Soy milk Pesco/pollo vegetarianism Oreo Hamburger Raw food diet Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Cake Horseshoe Meat analogue Terminal ballistics Wine Agar plate YuYu Hakusho 613 mitzvot Magical objects in Harry Potter Elbow-joint RuneScape quests Atari 8-bit family Cuisine of Denmark Therion (band) Traditional Chinese medicine Korean cuisine Tetrapod Protein Hard-line Shaggy dog story Cuisine of the Philippines Sperm Whale Octopus Kit Kat Lisa the Vegetarian Pancake Biomechanics Tuatara Soybean Ulna Tooth enamel The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Blood on the Tracks Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Candy Punk ideology Humerus Anterior cruciate ligament Frog French cuisine Pork Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Mojave people Appeasement Ulcer Food guide pyramid Crocodilia Margarine German cuisine Christian anarchism
