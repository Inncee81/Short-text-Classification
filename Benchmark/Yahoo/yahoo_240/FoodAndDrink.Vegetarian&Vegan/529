vegetarian protein on friday i decided that i was going to become a vegetarian i havent had any meat since friday but what i need to know is how i can get protein if im not eating meat i know there like yogurt beans peanut butter granola fish well fruit cheese etc i became a vegetarian because of peta well what kind of vegetarian will you be some people are ovo lactic vegetarians they eat eggs and milk assuming that these products are not killing a live animal so there's no inherent cruelty tho' what goes on in many poultry and dairy farms is rather cruel so if you're committed to peta you'll at least want to know your source in this case you're getting plenty of protein if you eat a couple of eggs and a good bit of dairy daily and it's got a full range of nutrients if you're going to be a full fledged vegan no animal products whatsoever then you will need to learn about how different plant products provide different nutrients you will need to consume a mix of beans legumes nuts and seeds daily because each one provides a different set of essential amino acids the old vegetarian cookbook diet for a small planet explains it in detail tho' the book's assertion that you must consume these proteins in combination has been found incorrect many vegans satisfy their protein needs by getting meat analogs tofurkey and soy sausages and fauxbaloney for my money if i am going to be a vegetarian i am not going to pretend i'm still eating flesh but that's your call if you go that way then the processed tvp will have a full range of amino acids in most cases if vegan you also should pay close attention to folic acid you might want supplements if you can't stand eating enough leafy greens and other sources i recommend that you study these things in some detail before you commit to vegetarianism Tofu Meat analogue Cheese Vegetarian cuisine Protein Egg (food) Kashrut Omega-3 fatty acid Breakfast People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Raw food diet Dairy Healthy eating Cuisine of Brazil Peanut Animal rights Kosher foods Nutrition Sausage Food guide pyramid Livestock Nutrient French cuisine Peruvian cuisine Compost Taboo food and drink Environmental vegetarianism Meat Factory farming Pizza Soy milk Cuisine of Denmark Fruitarianism Chili con carne Bengali cuisine Cyanocobalamin Yoghurt Atkins Nutritional Approach Japanese cuisine Butter Jewish cuisine Korean cuisine Crohn's disease Cuisine of the Philippines Coronary heart disease Chocolate Agriculture Paleolithic diet Carnivorous plant Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Hot dog Cuisine of Africa Zinc Dairy product Cuisine of Malaysia German cuisine Chicken Roman eating and drinking Hamburger Buddhist cuisine Ice cream Dietary fiber Guinea pig Whaling Agriculture in Australia Chinese cuisine Blood Vitamin C Prostate cancer Rice Vitamin Flax Natt__ Cajun cuisine Cochineal Vitasoy Carnivore Unclean animals Amino acid
