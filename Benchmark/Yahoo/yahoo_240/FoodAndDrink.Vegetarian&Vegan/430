cup of tuna i'm starting the day super diet but it says to have a cup of tuna at lunch and oz of any lean meat at supper can somebody replace both of these things with acceptionable vegetarian mock meats or whatever else sure you can easily replace the tuna and lean meat with cup or oz of beans lentils legumes pulses or the veggie mock meats you would be getting your protein without compromising your veggie diet i dont know the particulars of the super diet but i assume its low fat any of the above substitutes are low in fat as well and should work fine on that diet plan beans are great my favorite is cranberry beans which i cook in a crock pot with celery carrots parsley portabello mushrooms and onions i grind all the veggies up in a blender add to the crock pot add beans and cover the whole mess with enough water to bring it about an inch above the beans so when the beans swell it doesnt dry out good luck with your diet Chili con carne Tofu MRE Vegetarianism Hamburger Vegetarian cuisine Russian cuisine Ramen Coffee Peruvian cuisine Cajun cuisine Chicken soup Cuisine of Denmark Salad Food Hot dog Bengali cuisine German cuisine Cuisine of Brazil Soy milk Bean Potassium Cuisine of the Southern United States French cuisine Common bean Breakfast Dieting Barbecue Japanese cuisine Risotto In-N-Out Burger Cuisine of Africa Cantonese cuisine Atkins Nutritional Approach Ham Gumbo Recipe Domesticated turkey Chocolate Burger Soup Roman eating and drinking Protein Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Meat analogue Pulse (legume) Food preservation Soul food Guinea pig Italian cuisine Sprouting Soybean Hamster Stock (food) Espresso Lentil Egg (food) Milk Legume Ketchup Gelatin Dietary fiber Hakka cuisine Pizza Hummus Slow cooker Bacon Soy protein Passover Dim sum Cuisine of Vietnam Kosher foods Fish and chips Cuisine of Singapore Cheese Cholent Cajun Haggis Marmite Kebab Dumpling French fries Vegetarian nutrition Paleolithic diet Nabemono Catalan cuisine Hot pot Crohn's disease Fried rice Vegetarianism and religion Raw food diet Seitan Sauerkraut Cassoulet Idli Taiwanese cuisine Irish stew
