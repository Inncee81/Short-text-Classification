vegetarianism and ibs i was veg for two years a long time ago but i've recently been diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome as a result of my anxiety disorder and the antidepressants i'm on stopping those is not an option nor will it help my stomach much lactose and i are not friends i can handle probiotic yoghurts and small amounts of cheese as well as milk in small amounts if my stomach has not been acting up and if i take several lactaid pills soy and i are not friends at all i don't know for sure but i believe i am allergic to it i get incredible gas and cramps from even the smallest amount of soy milk or tofu other legumes are mostly ok as are most beans i still have to watch it though i am interested in cutting back on the amount of meat i eat unfortunately because of my condition it seems i have very few options help me please is this feasible is there a healthy way to do this i already said the ibs was caused by my anxiety and the meds i take i'm on pantoloc to help with excess acid in my stomach and i went off of the effexor which was so harsh on my stomach i refused to eat anything except breads because anything else hurt too much i have talked to my doctor about this and unfortunately there's not much she can do except help to control my anxiety which triggers the ibs tofu soy so no tofu is not really an option for me either the wheat based diet sounds more do able for me i have no problems with breads and glutens thank goodness i'd hate to say this but it sounds like your doctor isn't a very good one if he is letting these problems occure and not considering changing your doseage or your prescription you may want to consider a new one i have heard so many stories from doctors about what causes ibs and most are generic answers to cover up the fact that they do not know as for a vegetarian diet that can help i'm sure a well planned out diet can help but keep in mind that vegetarian diets are higher in antioxidants and your body will go through a detox process meat can stick to the inside lining of the digestive tract and prevent the linning from absorbing all the nutrients it can an needs once you pass the detox process you can start on a high fiber diet which is normally recommended by your doctor if you are diagnosed with ibs a good meat alternative that i recently tried for the first time is seitan it is not made of soy or milk but wheat gluten almond and rice milk are good alternatives and so are beans however you have to find out what kind of beans you like Irritable bowel syndrome Soy milk Food Milk Vegetarian nutrition Nutrition Breastfeeding Folic acid Dietary fiber Chronic fatigue syndrome Meat analogue Lactose intolerance Omega-3 fatty acid Food allergy Vegetarian cuisine Cheese Bread Diarrhea Stomach cancer Prostate cancer Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Fecal incontinence Cancer Hamburger Urinary incontinence Gluten Tocopherol Antidepressant Atkins Nutritional Approach Coffee Protein Obesity Guinea pig Flatulence Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor Multiple chemical sensitivity Cat Flour Autism Rice Adjustable gastric band Raw food diet Egg (food) Dairy Buddhist cuisine Gastroparesis Tooth Breakfast Tobacco smoking Anemia Bipolar disorder Post-traumatic stress disorder Autism epidemic Colorectal cancer Domestic rabbit Vitamin C Jewish cuisine Migraine Multiple sclerosis Kashrut Healthy eating Addiction Vitamin D Vomiting Foodborne illness Seitan Alzheimer's disease Food guide pyramid Gluten-free, casein-free diet Hamster Coronary heart disease Carpal tunnel syndrome Dog Psoriasis Raw milk South Beach diet Lactobacillus acidophilus Ramen Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Anorexia nervosa Menstrual cycle Obsessive-compulsive disorder Bengali cuisine Cuisine of Brazil
