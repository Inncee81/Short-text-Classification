is this a good diet i only eat when i am really hungry stomache growls and i fast all day monday also i am a lacto ovo vegetarian is that a good diet or unhealthy i eat the first time my stomach growls i don't wait until it growl times lol that sounds like a crash diet you will lose weight temporarily but it will come right back at you with vengeance once you switch to your regular diet you have to adjust your diet so it becomes not something you could do months but throughout your entire life because you're a vegetarian you're getting much less fat than meat eaters so you can relax about your diet eat whenver you feel like eating just don't stuff yourself the only thing you should watch for is cheese and eggs so perhaps egg slices of chese a day is enough oh yeah last point fasting is definitely a bad idea nutritionally speaking the only good thing about fasting is the spiritual quality it brings to one's life Vegetarianism Dieting Atkins Nutritional Approach Fasting Cheese Veganism Hamburger McDonald's Binge eating disorder Egg (food) Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Super Size Me Cuisine of Denmark Vegetarianism and religion Tofu The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Food guide pyramid Lisa the Vegetarian Vegetarian cuisine Milk Food Omega-3 fatty acid Breakfast Obesity Breastfeeding Low-carbohydrate diet South Beach diet Coronary heart disease Hot dog Adjustable gastric band Raw food diet In-N-Out Burger Stomach cancer Garfield Kosher foods Natural Hygiene Bread Healthy eating Tocopherol Little Britain Bodybuilding Fecal incontinence Chocolate Weight training Chinese food therapy Ramen Famine Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Guinea pig Vegetarian nutrition Nutrition Weight loss Jewish cuisine MRE Cuisine of the Southern United States Shit Christian Vegetarian Association Hamster Tlingit Tae eul ju Chili con carne Dick Gregory Meat analogue Trans fat British cuisine Peruvian cuisine People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Hedgehog Fancy rat Environmental vegetarianism Buddhist cuisine Organic food Pizza Cuisine of the Philippines 613 mitzvot Buddhism Chicken Protein The Amazing Race Homer Simpson Didache Abstinence Christian vegetarianism Goodness and value theory Hindu Sandwich The Ashlee Simpson Show Prostate cancer Theory of conduct Pok__mon Abilities Junk food Mahatma Gandhi Furious Angels Fish and chips Fruitarianism Cuisine of Brazil Ekadasi Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest
