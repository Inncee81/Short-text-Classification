and reasons keep metabolism steady eating one small meal such as a potato a salad etc every three hours that you are awake will not speed up your metabolism rather it will keep it going your metabolism goes and slows with your food intake and eating something small every three hours will keep that metabolism burning calories and will help you lose weight so you should of therefore had something at about pm in between lunch and your sort of small dinner snack at pm eat smaller dinners cut down on the size of your dinner if you're hungry snack on fruits or other healthy low calorie snacks large dinners tend to hurt a fat loss process because most people aren't very active after dinner this is the basis for advice along the lines of don't eat anything within x hours before going to bed the claim that your entire dinner is stored as fat isn't entirely true the process is more complicated than that but the fact you don't move after dinner is enough to hurt your cause you can offset this by eating a larger lunch or snacking healthily before dinner you hade a small dinner so grats you did that well fresh fruits or vegetables are excellent choices for curbing appetite not to mention other health benefits you had a pear and a banna and a mango which is good but try have a few more fruit remember plus a day d a handful of nuts might do the same drink a large glass of water before sitting at the table eat more fiber most people don't get enough fiber the recommended amount is actually not that much if you eat a healthy diet fiber foods include whole grains fruits and vegetables and nuts and seeds other options are fiber supplements the harm of skipping breakfast from a weight loss perspective is it makes you eat a huge lunch since your body hasn't had anything in the past or more hours so that said you should have had more for lulnch that just a banana when you eat a huge lunch you get that after meal drowsiness so now you're both unproductive and inactive cereals don't take much time to prepare and consume and most of them are very healthy nowadays if you are extremely pressed for time consider grabbing a box of breakfast bars or a smoothie and throwing one in your bag when you leave for work or school some breakfast bars out there are also excellent sources of fiber eat smaller meals more frequently this helps raise your metabolism too it's not easy to do though since it's a relatively big change to most people's routines but it doesn't have to be a full blown meal simply eat often but less a jar of nuts in the office will do just fine grab a handful when you feel like it most fruits can last for a couple days without refrigeration and if you have a refrigerator at the office make use of it drink more water everyday many places suggest cups l of water a day it sounds like an absurd amount of water but actually you can drink tea without sugar to make up some of the quota in fact tea especially green tea rev up your metabolism actually cause a temporary increase in calories burned for fat loss purposes it is important to remind yourself that thirst is a much weaker stimuli than hunger if you consistantly feel hungry after meals don't immediately think that you need to eat more you may simply be thirsty needless to say there are many benefits of water of your body is made of it we can exist without food for months but without water we can only survive for a few days your body is made up mostly of water which is essential for digestion nutrient absorption and elimination aids circulation helps control the body's temperature lubricates and cushions joints keeps the skin healthy helps remove toxins from your body every day you lose water from the body through urine and sweat and this fluid needs to be
