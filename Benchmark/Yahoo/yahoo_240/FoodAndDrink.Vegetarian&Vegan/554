okay i am confused what type of 'fats' do vegetarians and vegans have to stay away from and can i consume can i consume products that say partially hydrogenated vegetable oil i've been a veggie for a month now and i try to eat vegan food too though i dont want to become one no offense however i'm having problems trying to figure out what type of fat is acceptable in food stuff and what is not please help me thanks very much vegetarians would not eat animal fats such as lard and vegans would not eat fat that comes from dairy or eggs whether it's hydrogenated or not has nothing to do with whether it is vegan or vegetarian only whether its source is from animals vegetable oil soybean oil coconut oil etc any oils that come from nuts and vegetables are both vegan and vegetarian regardless of how heavily processed they are hydrogenation and methods of processing can affect the nutritional value of the food but that's a different story Veganism Vegetarianism Soybean Vegetarian cuisine Dieting Trans fat Vegetarian nutrition Food guide pyramid Kashrut Biodiesel Egg (food) Raw food diet Kosher foods Ice cream People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Cyanocobalamin Cooking oil Margarine Healthy eating Paleolithic diet Buddhist cuisine Cheese Vegetable oil Atkins Nutritional Approach MyPyramid Meat analogue Saturated fat Soy milk Taboo food and drink Cuisine of Malaysia Tocopherol Food preservation Environmental vegetarianism Vegetarianism and religion Dairy French cuisine Organic food Korean cuisine Protein Sausage Agriculture Fruitarianism Milk Peanut Flavouring Bengali cuisine French fries Animal rights Breakfast Gelatin Hydrogenation Energy development Genetically modified food Butter Fasting Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Bread Hamburger Cake Pesco/pollo vegetarianism Oily fish Alcohol fuel Hamster Peanut butter Chocolate Eating Pizza Lecithin Famine Low-carbohydrate diet Common bean Organic farming Economy of Romania Oil palm Acorn Quorn Thermal depolymerization Mayonnaise Nut (fruit) Polychlorinated biphenyl Guinea pig Brain Water Coconut Peruvian cuisine Livestock Potassium Prostate cancer Snack food Pancake
