what's the difference between scotch or whiskey just wondering if there's a difference i know i've had whiskey before but is there just a scotch drink out there i can try or is it just scotch whiskey mixed up just please tell me thanx scotch and whiskey are the same its just that scotch got its name from being made in scotland it's a common misconception that the term whiskey refers to one certain taste or brand and that bourbon and scotch are a liquor all their own not so whiskey is a common type of liquor it is produced and bottled all over the world each country in its own way bourbon is america's version of whiskey scotch is scotland's and candadian is well you get the idea but make no mistake they are all whiskies there are five major categories of whiskey for sale bourbon american blended scotch irish and canadian there are taste differences between the major whiskies of course the main distinction in the taste of scotch is its smoky peat flavor it can easily be called an acquired taste but those that acquire it crave it irish similarly has a barley malt whiskey taste without the smokiness scotch and irish are mostly lighter whiskies than the american bourbons and blends they are usually aged in old previously used barrels and require a bit more time to reach maturation single malt scotches typically range from to years aging bourbon on the other hand owes much of its taste to the rye and corn grains used bourbon is also considered a fuller bodied whiskey than scotch or irish and some say it does have a bit more of a sweet taste on the palate and by that i do not mean sugary in the production of bourbon only new charred oak barrels are used in the aging process which enables bourbon to reach maturity quicker than scotch regardless when dealing with whiskies age is a fair gauge on how smooth the whiskey will be the longer in the barrel the more complete that whiskey will be Mezcal Pulque Agave Coffee Wine Cider Day of the Dead Beer Champagne (beverage) Tequila agave Soft drink Yerba mate Pisco Rum Coca-Cola Tea Cochineal Bong Snake Sake Cocaine French cuisine Aztec Chocolate Food preservation Illegal drug trade Mexican cuisine Cacha__a Ayahuasca Vanilla Port wine Sage Roman eating and drinking Peruvian cuisine Martini cocktail Polyethylene terephthalate Chile pepper Cannabis (drug) Water Prohibition Hemp Century plant Olive oil Moonshine Mountain Dew Aloe Fugu Mexican beer Vermicompost Alcoholics Anonymous Vodka Philip J.
