why does mixing your drinks get you drunker i once heard it explained via this little ditty beer on wine and i feel fine wine on beer and i feel queer you drink the lower percentage alcohol and get used to drinking at a certain rate you then move to a higher percentage and keep drinking at the same rate in other words effectively drinking more alcohol over the same time period so in the first hours you have beers then in the next hours you have large wines spirits which is about the same as or more beers can be even worse if you free pour and then gulp the wine spirit the same way as a gulp of beer rather than just sipping at them makes sort of sense when you think of it that way Champagne (beverage) Wine Alcoholic beverage Pisco Brandy Port wine Cider Rum Homebrewing Shiraz grape Cabernet Sauvignon Tokaji Kosher foods Moonshine Beer German wine Brewery Craps Mead Pinot Noir Tea Tofu Madeira wine Sake Grape Scotch whisky Wines of Portugal Coffee Wine degustation Sherry Single malt Scotch Terroir Bong Varietal Chocolate Zinfandel Phylloxera Laserdisc Ice wine Vodka N__gociant Carbon dioxide Cognac (drink) Vinegar Japanese tea ceremony Roman eating and drinking Sewage treatment Honey Kosher wine Dice White Zinfandel Advanced Squad Leader Photographic film Country wine Wine bottle Cellular respiration Trademark Chinese wine Ethanol Balsamic vinegar Korean cuisine Sea-Monkey Hardware random number generator Tannin Kashrut Drill bit Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Expert system Philippe de Rothschild Acetic acid Tartaric acid Barolo Fermentation Riesling Biodiesel Chardonnay Dialysis Ch__teau d'Yquem Soy sauce Organic food Black Books Merlot Mass (liturgy) Kit Kat Potato E85 Squad Leader Chile pepper Eucharist Apple Fanta RuneScape locations Cigar S__millon Bourbon whiskey Tokaj (region in Slovakia) Burgundy wine Neopets Marsala wine
