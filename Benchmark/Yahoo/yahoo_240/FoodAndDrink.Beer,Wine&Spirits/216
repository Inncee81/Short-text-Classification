questions about manhattans i've gotten a few weird looks from both friends and bartenders when i order a manhattan with canadian style whisky i dont understand why though is it just because the canadian whisky instead of bourbon or kentucky style whisky i just like the canadian better the oak cask aging makes it smoother with a nice hint of vanilla or is there some stigma about manhattans i dont know about i always thought of them as a pretty masculine and mob kinda drink its not like i'm ordering frozen cosmos also at a bar or restaurant would you expect a manhattan to be served up or over i usually prefer it up all things being equal but again i've gotten weird looks lastly i got one at one place where the bartender strained some of the maraschino juice into the drink quite a bit actually considering the small pour of whisky he gave me was he just making that part up himself or do a lot of bartenders do that i kinda thought it was a guy ordering a girly drink look at the time but i cant imagine that it is considering its all liquor and you can definitely taste it girly drinks are usually the ones where all you taste is the fruit or mix is it just because of the cherry god bless you a manhattan is truly a great drink so superior to the colorful sugary nonsense would be drinkers desecrate their palates with traditionally i believe rye whiskey is used in a manhattan since most of us do not buy rye for anything these days i think canadian whiskey is completely appropriate there is nothing girly about a manhattan grizzled old alcoholics with red blotchy faces and ruptured blood vessels drink these the manhattan is the ultimate badass drink Whisky Rum Beer Alcoholic beverage Scotch whisky Single malt Scotch Bourbon whiskey Martini cocktail Wine Manhattan cocktail Vodka Cuisine of Denmark Canadian whisky Brandy Distilled beverage Guinness Coffee Grog Irish whiskey Cocktail Public house Cider Moonshine Moe Szyslak Maker's Mark Drinking culture Tequila Bartender German cuisine Russian cuisine Pisco Aging barrel Daiquiri French cuisine Breakfast Korean cuisine Cacha__a Yoghurt Milkshake Barbecue Whose Line Is It Anyway?
