how do bartenders keep drunks from killing each other if you run a bar but use glass ash trays heavy beer mugs ketchup bottles salt and sugar shakers or billiard balls all can be used as blunt weapons then how on earth can you make patrons behave and not tear up the place or each other any hints i bartended for many years in roadhouses lounges restaurants clubs and some of the finer discoteques with and without bouncers availlable so i pretty much know what does and does not work scars to prove it your ears are constantly open for your waitresses' drink calls from two to three points of your bar as well as the swarms of loud mouths yelling for hooch drinking and thinking they are much more important than anyone else in the club and they don't tip ever you serve them with a smile being extremely alert and conscious at all times is essential yes i had myself some drinks as i worked but never got drunk to a point of not hearing that glass break on the dance floor the wall or at the tables you get to where you're tuned in to the sound of glass and the unmistakable voices of what has already or will become a bad situation calling the cops it's waaaay too late for that at that point keeping your eyes peeled and aware of everyone in the place and especially on those who could become volatile is really the most important thing because you can get your bar backs to cover for you as you meander casually over to the drunk sit near him her and introduce yourself be kool be funny be their 'friend' they already know who you are because you're the bartender hey man you smile and make them like you even more i'm gonna buy you a beer dude how's everything going then you point out a few of the gorgeous girls and divert their attention away from whomever or whatever seems to be bugging their stupid brains you pal the guy girl and tactfully clue them to the fact that you are indeed the coolest bartender that ever lived and you really have a concern for your people introduce them to some of the employees call them over to meet the guy girl they love that stuff make them feel important and liked the next thing you know they're all happy and cool as you walk slowly with them to the front door and a pre called taxi cab that you gladly provide at the club's expense or your own it isn't much and a whole lot cheaper than finding out the next day that you contributed to killing some people on the highway of the drunks respond positively to this type of treatment and they tend to remember bits of how well you took care of them and a thanks is normal when they come back in as well as reimbursement lesson learned usually and bookoo respect i hate to ramble on but there is the one percent of redneck moronic primate scum that you have to seriously subdue i have fortunately been involved in martial arts most of my life and it has helped but i've had my butt messed up a few times booze and idiots don't mix but they do it anyway if two or more butt smears are going at it before you've been able to thwart it your responsibility to your people is to get them clear of the danger zone crowd control get your best guys involved in that including your good customers let the jerks break all the furniture they want but get your people away first that means your clientelle and employees you go smashing into the middle of a brawl and you're almost inevitably going to be really cut up and sore for a couple of weeks trust me on this a waitress is already calling so that's a done deal your job is to protect the decent people and if you ever see a gun or a knife you are the cop for that moment serve and protect just part of the job these types of incidents are so few and almost never actually but they do occur best to be prepared and have a plan the cops will be there in an hour and a half or so especially if you're in l a not to worry The Shining (film) Friends Moe Szyslak Garfield RuneScape quests Little Britain Taxi Driver Knots Landing Humphrey Bogart Jennifer Lopez Milton H.
