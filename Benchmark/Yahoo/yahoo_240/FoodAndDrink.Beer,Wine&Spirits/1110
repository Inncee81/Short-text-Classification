can you put champagne in the freezer for a little bit i just found out my girlfriend got the big promotion so i ran out to get the bubbly i'll probably head over there in an hour or so my question is can i chill it quickly in the freezer for an hour or so without messing it up or should i stick to the fridge thanks you can do that but it is even faster if you put it in a bucket and cover it with ice add a handful of salt and fill with enough water to cover the bottle bert Marlboro (cigarette) Tobacco advertising Cigarette Camel (cigarette) Milk Laramie Cigarettes Spliff Altria Group Tobacco Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man Joe Camel Barbecue Smoking ban Tobacco smoking Cigar Prosopis cineraria Scuderia Ferrari Hookah Camel (band) The Smoking Room Cigarette Smoking Man Health insurance USS Heermann (DD-532) Cocaine Camel Rum Bloody Stupid Johnson Horse meat Cuisine of Denmark Guelph Storm Taste Snus Exploding sheep Billboard (advertising) Deep Purple Mickey Rourke Gumbo Mojave people Smoking cessation USS Johnston (DD-557) Marlboro College Banana Smoke detector Beer CamelCase Firefighter USS The Sullivans (DD-537) Gerund Wall Street Marlboro Township, New Jersey Coca-Cola Final Lap Daz Dillinger Cockney Halitosis Bong Cannabis cultivation Airplane!
