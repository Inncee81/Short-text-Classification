what other beers brewers use the carbonation device in a can its canned draught guinness launched in contains a capsule of a nitrogen and stout blend this is filled on the canning line and the contents of the capsule are released automatically when the package is broached the opening of the can releases the pressure and this causes the capsule to blow the stout inside the capsule helps to diffuse the nitrogen this device which won them a queen's award last month is being employed in a canned ale guinness draught bitter being test marketed in the anglia central and granada television regions not only does the nitrogen make the beer more creamy and produce a better head it also protects against oxidation the brewer can therefore permit the beer to be less carbonated the canned draught products have levels of carbonation similar to those in cask conditioned ales and less than half those in some bottled beers guinness's rival murphy's will soon be entering the market with its own canned draught dry stout but using a slightly different system this method also employed by whitbread for its newly launched canned ale boddington's draught uses only nitrogen in the capsule it is also unusual in that the capsule is filled before the beer is put into the can the third irish stout beamish receives its dose of nitrogen on the canning line so does courage's canned ale draught directors' one or two regional brewers are also using this technique two nationally famous ales both from burton on trent are getting a dose of nitrogen in a tank before they are canned these are draught burton ale from ind coope and traditional draught ale from bass when i tasted these products alongside one another it was clear that the technique used by murphy's and boddington's creates the creamiest result i felt this enhanced the overall character of the toasty tasting murphy's stout though i am not sure that creaminess is appropriate in a dry austere ale such as boddington's draught guinness is meant to be creamy and was so was that company s new ale very malty but with a powerful hop balance i liked its intensity of flavors but found it somewhat cloying it might benefit from a spicier variety of hop beamish was not especially creamy but had a good roasty stout character courage directors' seemed carbonic with a muddy sweetish palate but some mitigating dryness in the finish because of the effects of pasteurisation i did not feel that any of the ales remotely matched their draught counterparts while stouts are sufficiently powerful in flavour to endure pasteurisation without too much damage ales are less robust because of the effects of pasteurisation i did not feel that any of the ales remotely matched their draught counterparts the splendidly hoppy aromatic burton ale came closest followed by the fruity bass Beer Brewery India Pale ale Hop (plant) Stout beer Brewing Bitter (beer) Pale ale Bock Bury St Edmunds Guinness Wheat beer Public house Fuller, Smith and Turner Gin Miller Brewing Lager English beer Draught beer Lambic Vinegar Root beer Homebrewing Burton-upon-Trent Trappist beer Malt liquor Keg Samuel Adams (beer) Oktoberfest Mead Alcoholic beverage Redhook Ale Brewery Near beer St Austell Isinglass Smoked beer K__lsch (beer) Mild ale Porter (beer) Moosehead Real ale Bass (beer) Yuengling Barrel (storage) Coopers Brewery Pilsener International Phonetic Alphabet Tea Sake Ginger ale Yarrow Beck's Hip hop culture Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Herbal tea Rum Canada Dry P__cs Brewery Disc jockey Molson American lager Charles Wells Cascade Brewery Codename: Kids Next Door Alternative hip hop Star of David Canadian beer Prohibition Mexican beer Music genre Tooheys Root beer float Stella Artois Microbrew Ballantine Thai language German cuisine Coffee Bruges Widget Australian beer Reinheitsgebot Oolong XXXX Lion Nathan Herbie Hancock Labatt Brewing Company Henry Thrale Hip hop music Belgian beer Small beer Koopa Kid Nitrogen Reading, Berkshire Rolling Rock Diamond
