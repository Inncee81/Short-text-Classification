wow organic wine is much stronger than regualar wine so i have just tried organic wine and i am telling you that glasses have me feeling all sorts of buzzed do you know if there will be a hangover since it has no chemicals or sulfites in it i am amazed at how strong it is and i drink wine regularly so this is so weird how potent it is a lot of it could do with other factors such as how much you've eaten recently and such wines vary in alcohol content but it all depends on factors that don't have anything to dow ith it being organic wine as well as other fermented beverages can only get to about alcohol non fortified of course this is because the yeast dies off at about that level so no yeast no more alcohol kinda ironic that yeast produces alcohol and alcohol kills yeast anyways wines tend to have alcohol content the amount of alcohol is a result of how much sugar is in the wine and how long the wine ferments yeast turns sugar into alcohol and carbon dioxide the longer it goes the more sugar it will convert so these are the reasons that determine wine's strength also just about any wine contains sulfites its part of the natural reactions that occur with the grape skins now this wine may be relatively low in sulfites because lots of wine makers add sulfites because it often makes a more stable wine also hangovers dont occur from added chemicals they occur partially because of chemicals that are a natural by product of alcoholis fermentation they also occur because alcohol is a diuretic which increases urination which causes dehydration dehydration is another culprit in hangovers Rum Blood alcohol content Hypoglycemia Alcoholism Vomiting Moonshine Beer Pneumonia Cider Drunk driving (United States) Bong Malt liquor Caffeine Suicide methods Narcotic Chocolate Doxepin Legal drinking age Food Hangover Breastfeeding Coffee Systembolaget Stomach cancer Wine Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Scotch whisky Cannabis (drug) Brewing Homebrewing Tide Addiction Brewery Species Korean cuisine Marathon (sport) Alcoholics Anonymous Paracetamol Mental retardation Ethanol Haloperidol Sauna LSD Atkins Nutritional Approach Cholera Capital punishment Foodborne illness Diarrhea Cancer Human sexual behavior Aspartame Jackass: The Movie Fanta Puberty Single malt Scotch Microeconomics Temperance movement Black Death Clinical depression Rape Episodes of Lost (Season 1) First aid Opioid Pregnancy Person Professional wrestling match types India Pale ale Folic acid Vitamin C Hepatitis Yasser Arafat Ethylene glycol Coffeehouse The Coca-Cola Company Pisco Sleep Sake Rice University Mothers Against Drunk Driving Internal ballistics Drug overdose Carburetor Alcohol E85 Medical cannabis Drug abuse Distilled beverage Trigonometric function Drug addiction Soft drink Fire fighting Adjustable gastric band Dehydration Trainspotting (novel) Urinary incontinence Recreational drug use Driver's license Hormone replacement therapy (trans)
