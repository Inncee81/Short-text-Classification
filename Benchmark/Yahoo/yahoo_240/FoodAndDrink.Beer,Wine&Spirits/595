cherry juice in a manhattan is was taught that a manhattan should be made with sweet vermouth whisk e y and a cherry usually on the rocks i always make them this way i am now living in a college town where all of the bartenders add cherry juice to the above recipe is this normal or are they just making a sweeter drink for the underage crowd they cater to i feel that if you don't like the taste of whisky you shouldn't be drinking a manhattan if you want it to be a little sweeter use bourbon instead of tenessee or canadian whisky i think you are exactly right about your guess of catering to younger folks and masking the whiskey bartenders add some of the syrup from maraschino cherries into manhattans to make it sweeter for some people they teach it that way now at bartender school i drink my manhattans vermouth rye with bitters and a cherry up i used to be able to call that a sweet manhattan but nowadays if i order it like that i might get syrup in it i think it came in on the heels of the cocktail revolution from a few years ago where martinis and cosmopolitans became en vogue again people wanted to drink manhattans but couldn't bear the whiskey taste i say let them have their cosmos and leave my manhattans alone Mashed potato Tofu Brewing Food preservation Potato Single malt Scotch E number Dumpling Dim sum French cuisine Common bean Beer Domesticated turkey Little Britain Moonshine German cuisine Food additive Dosa Peruvian cuisine Culture of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Black pepper Sake Pie Curry Scotch whisky British cuisine Hot dog Brewery Quark model Fish and chips Sauce Tea Color Vivian Stanshall Snooker Flavouring Soy sauce Sausage British rock Culture of Korea Visit of King George IV to Scotland Bock My Little Pony Cuisine of Argentina Vinegar Colonel Potter Care Bears Sandwich QCD matter Yoghurt Coercion Standard model (basic details) Cuisine of Denmark Australian words Haggis Fast food Pot Noodle Rincewind Cuisine of the Southern United States Quark Honey Patent medicine Cocoa Bengali cuisine CPU cache The Chemical Brothers Pizza Japanese New Year Japanese cuisine Lemonade Japanese tea ceremony 10cc Instant mashed potato Cake Mango Pure Pwnage Onion Homebrewing Food coloring Nabemono Hamburger The Shining (film) Peanut butter Vegetarianism Peter Sellers Korean cuisine Swedish cuisine Banana Pink Floyd Flavour (particle physics) Wine degustation Ice cream Hangi Potato chips Order of the Garter Chocolate Jewish cuisine Color blindness Nutmeg Vodka
