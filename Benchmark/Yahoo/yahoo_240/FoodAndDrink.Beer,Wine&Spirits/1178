does beer become stale if it is cold becomes warm and then you chill it again generally most people cannot detect the subtle changes that occur in beers treated this way unless the flavor is obvious this is from the beer advocate page listed above with my comments here are some tips when buying beer at your local package store and how to avoid dead beers buy brew from the cooler it keeps the beer fresh beer sitting out at room temperature even for a few months may start to degrade and become stale plus chances are that same beer was transported cold and allowed to warm not good cold storage also slows oxidation in beer even the tightest bottling system will allow minute amounts of air into the bottle which over the months will start to destroy the beer and give it a wet paper cardboard flavor me a few months even the large nation brands recommend the beer is drank within months do not buy old beer these temperatures are extreme or a very long time frame to cause chemical decomposition oxidation will occur only vary rarly from modern brewery packaging systems it is more likely a concern for craft brewers which have less sophisticated packaging systems it is the craft beers we really need to watch for as they do not move off the shelf fast in addtion i would never buy a craft brewed beer that was not kept cold always look for a freshness date some will have a packaged on date and some will have a best before date some breweries will ink print the bottled on date right above the label as well as on each case box some notch the side of their label noting which month to consume the beer by while others will employ the freshness date in different places on the bottle and or packaging if they don't use a freshness date consumer beware me i agree dust it's a sure sign the beer has been sitting dead for a long time put it down and walk away from the beer calmly me i agree avoid buying beer that is kept in direct light which allows damaging uv rays in both excessive direct sunlight and heat can give the brew a skunky stale flavor which is a by product of the delicate hop oils spoiling me note both excessive direct sunlight and or heat this is the cause of skunkyness is beer uv light and this almost always observed in green or clear bottles it will not occur in miller because the brewering scientists have developed the rho hop by borohydride reduction of isomerized iso alpha acids which prevents the chemicsl change what occurs in uv effected beers is a chemical ring compound derived from hops photolysis of alpha acid's isohexenoyl side chain is charged by the uv enegry the ring breaks open and a sulfer compound hydrongen sulfide or a thiol attaches to it the resultant compound isopentenyl mercaptan methylbut enyl thiol is reponsible for the charcteristic sunstruck or lightstruck skunky aroma and flavor heineken there is no such thing as beer on sale it's a package store not a wal mart there's probably a good reason that pack is only don't take any chances by being a cheapskate me know your source and know your brewers of course there are always exceptions to these rules generally speaking the higher the alcohol the longer the shelf life so higher octane beers like barley wines many belgian ale styles german bocks hefty porters and stouts etc do not go bad for the most part these brews tend to gain character with aging for many months even years highly hopped brews also tend to benefit from a longer shelf life due to the preserving quality in the hop oils so think before you grab any old beer buy only fresh beer consume before expiration and make a point to notify package store owners or even the brewer when you come across bad beers respect beer me again i say know your source and know your brewers do not allow beer or buy beer stored in conditions of heat Alcoholic beverage Champagne (beverage) Wine Public house Soft drink Drunkenness Bar (establishment) Beer Ship naming and
