help me solve a wine opening question years ago i was taught to score a bottle of wine especially if you are doing table service below the second lip when bartending i usually just make the bottles naked in any case i've run across a great many people that open a bottle of wine by scoring above the top lip of the bottle in the past i was strictly forbidden from doing such because the wine is more likely to contact the tin metal and help oxydize the wine there are possibly impurities molds other dried wine etc caught underneath the metal and that will affect the wine i am unsure which if any are true my logic has always been that if that wasn't what was supposed to be done the entire wine industry wouldn't have manufactured the bottle with the second lip i am not exactly sure what you mean by top lip and second lip on most bottles there is a wider band of glass about a quarter inch below the top of the bottle and i would cut just above that band using it to guide the blade on a corkscrew but under it is just as good i would agree that cutting the top of the capsule off along the surface of the top of the bottle is not correct practise and i do see inexperienced waiters doing so problem is it is difficult to make a clean cut here and you end up with jagged edges which affect the flow of the wine when poured whichever you do there are a number of issues tho' first is that care in foil removal was more important fifty years ago and nowadays with wines of those vintages because the foil was made of lead and lead is poisonous however lead foils have been banned now for fifty years most wineries use plastic or thin tin which are harmless wine which has been aged often gets a mold growing on the top of the cork under the foil when this is observed the top of the cork and bottle should be wiped with a damp cloth before opening the wine wine touching the capsule will not be the cause of oxidation i think the warning yoiu were given related to the necessity of keeping it from a lead capsule but even if safe today today it is not professional service to get pieces of the capsule interfering with the wine flow increasingly these days the entire capsule can easily be removed which a quick twist and pull and i do so at home in a quality restuarant you may want to make a show of wine service cutting the capsule etc so i would continue doing what you were taught i'll bet the other waiters didn't have the professional training you received they were probably pushed out into the room with a corkscrew and the first time they ever opened a wine was in the restaurant i'd prefer to be seated at the table you serve thanks New Coke Vanilla Coke Diet Coke The Coca-Cola Company Sucralose Trailer Park Boys Sin City Extreme Championship Wrestling Coca-Cola Harvey Award Soft drink Pepsi-Cola Bad Wolf Diet soda Dallas (TV series) The Invisibles Kevin and Kell Modoc War Matt Hardy Supporting characters on Will & Grace References to Star Trek Hiberno-English Father Ted Dumb & Dumber Sprite (soft drink) The Doors Mike Alfonso Frankie Laine Andy Warhol The Royle Family Eric Clapton Poker jargon Son Gohan Philipp Melanchthon Futurama (TV series - season 5) Jack McFarland Tab (soft drink) Knots Landing Mountain Dew Days of our Lives Opie and Anthony Liza of Lambeth Diet of Japan Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Jack Ruby Ham Garfield Time Out of Mind The Jazz Singer Jack Bauer The Shining (film) The Dark Tower (series) Alan Moore Harry Nilsson Humphrey Bogart Past characters (Neighbours) Bret Hart SeaChange 21st Century Fox Hong Kong-style milk tea Boogie Nights Mick Foley Boxing Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Jim Morrison Jack Kerouac Sugar 7 Up Jack Benny Minako Aino Shinn Asuka Xiaolin Showdown StarrCade Hollyoaks Patrick Hillery Meat Loaf Academy Award for Best Art Direction Clash of Champions Columbia Pictures Thunderball Drink Jack O'Neill (Stargate) Irn-Bru Friends Fanta Neighbours Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan Beam (structure) Frankie Vaughan Silverchair Jefferson Airplane Port wine James T.
