where did calling a drink a cocktail come from there are several plausible theories as to the origin of the term cocktail among them are colonial taverns kept their spirits rum brandy whiskey gin applejack in casks and as the liquid in the casks lowered the spirits would tend to lose both flavor and potency so the tavern keeper would have an additional cask into which the tailings from the low casks could be combined and sold at a reduced price the patrons requesting the cock tailings or the tailings from the stop cock of the cask this was h l mencken's belief cocktails were originally a morning beverage and the cocktail was the name given as metaphor for the rooster cocktail heralding morning light of day this was first posited in by ted haigh in vintage spirits forgotten cocktails and can be distinguished from the theory take two snips of the hair of the dog that bit you which refers to consuming a small bit of alcohol the morning after a binge drinking night to curb the effects of the symptoms of the hangover in the belief that these symptoms are the result of a form of withdrawal a cock's tail has many varied feathers in exciting colours as a cocktail has varied exciting alcoholic drinks mixed together further the cloaca in the tail of cock is the exit hole for many impure substances alcohol can be harmful and mixing drinks can be dangerous some say that it was customary to put a feather presumably from a cock's tail in the drink to serve both as decoration and to signal to teetotalers that the drink contained alcohol another etymology is that the term is derived from coquetier a french egg cup which was used to serve the beverage in new orleans in the early th century the beverage was named for a mixed breed horse known as a cock tail as the beverage like the horse was neither strictly spirit nor wine it was a mixed breed the word could also be a distortion of latin aqua decocta meaning distilled water Brush Bong Water Champagne (beverage) Wine Fiddler on the Roof Hustler Magazine v.
