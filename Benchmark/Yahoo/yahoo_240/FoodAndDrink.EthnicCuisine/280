if i can't go to a sushi bar at the moment is sushi packs in supermarkets are good alternatives it depends on which markets you go to depending on where you live but theres a dominicks near me that sells this brand called sushi with gusto and they actually have a chef that preparesit in the back they also do this at my local woodmans look up this brand and see where else they may have them preparing them near you i love sushi but i have a eight month old and its hard to go to a resteraunt so when i get my groceries i always pick up a case the chef even made me a special order to pick up when i was done shopping its pretty good and i know they just made it its worth your while to look into it good luck Ice cream Supermarket Conveyor belt sushi Tofu Tesco French cuisine Safeway Inc.
