whats a new fad diet that works i want a new diet to follow thats not unrealistic ive tried the south beach and would like to try something new i read about this diet called the tnt diet its pretty straight forward and sounds logical let me give you a snap short of it and you can google the rest yourself there are tons of information about it on the net understand that there are good and bad carbs bad carbs are basically those that raise and crash your blood sugar levels real fast also understand that some carbs are low in calories and full of fibers and some full of sugars for this diet the main stay of carbs will be crucifiable vegetables like brocolli bell peppers cauliflowers carrots and the whole lots of other such vegetables fruits like apples and oranges are ok but should be taken in moderation take more protein in place of carbs choose lean choices like chicken breasts tuna and salmon and many others the idea about this diet is two fold one is to educate thte body to burn fat and two is eat at right times and in right quantities to educate the body to burn fat the diet plan recommends the low carb version of the diet for the first weeks this means eating more protein and low calorie vegetables i recommended above eat times a day with protein and carb at each meal eat until you are satisfied but not stuffed this diet does not involve counting calories but listening to your body the stomach in particular eating min before a workout and within min after is recommmended eat protein or protein with carb after the workout within min finally let me explain y i think this diet sounds logical the reason y the body does not burn fat is because there is enuff of carbs for it to burn the best time to burn fat is when the muscles are free or low on gluocse therefore the diet recommends that the first weeks will be a wake up call for the body to burn fat since you will be low on carbs also eating before and after exercise takes advantage of the fact the the body would have burnt the glucose during the excercise leaving it in a sate to burn fat if i were to comtinue to explain the rest of this week plan it will take forever pls do go and google it up and see if this diet works for you no harm getting more information South Beach diet Weight training Bodybuilding Dietary fiber Veganism Food Vegetarianism Omega-3 fatty acid Hypoglycemia Nutrition Obesity Vitamin C Prostate cancer Calorie Insulin Healthy eating Calorie restriction Milk Fasting Carburetor Jewish cuisine Folic acid Tocopherol Cuisine of the Southern United States Crohn's disease Exercise Diabetes mellitus Colorectal cancer Carbohydrate Ramen Guinea pig Domesticated turkey Super Size Me Raw food diet Cuisine of Denmark Hypertension Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Kit Kat Protein Insulin resistance Hamster MRE Tofu Hyperglycemia Coronary heart disease Glycogen storage disease type I Zone diet Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Glucose Ferret Tooth Cheese Garfield Glycemic index Microeconomics Fancy rat Chinese New Year Egg (food) Cancer Chocolate Cell (biology) Aspartame Hamburger Trans fat Salmon Protein-energy malnutrition Sleep Swimming Sugar substitute Peruvian cuisine Cannabis (drug) Fecal incontinence Cat Gastroparesis Dog Economics Vegeta Adjustable gastric band Chicken Tomato Domestic rabbit Glucokinase Bong Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Senescence
