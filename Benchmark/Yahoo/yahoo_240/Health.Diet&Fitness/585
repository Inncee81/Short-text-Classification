advice wanted right track to losing weight hey everyone i would like to start off by saying i am yrs old my height is ' and weigh lbs i am a medium build i have a semi gut and some love handles and up until now haven't been doing any exercises to get back into shape so i have decided to eat right and exercise i just started yesterday but i am very determined not to give up so i am taking action i have been doing a variety of push ups and sit ups for two days now and it seems to be working in the right areas i am taking vitamins to have more energy and boost my metabolism because ever since i stopped wrestling i've gone down hill i have been eating fruits and vegetables high in fiber for a snack i also walked twice yesterday for min total and twice today for min total i plan on swimming laps in my pool as well so buy drinking a lot of water portion controlled eating eating the right foods and exercise am i off to a good start if i keep this up will i lose weight thanks jeff it sounds good so far you don't sound too big to begin with i would recommend hitting weights too they will help you lose fat the best range to lose weight in is to lbs a week this will allow your body to accustom itself to the loss and the skin to regain its prestretched stage losing weight too quickly will cause the skin of abdomen chest and inner thighs to sag possibly dramatically i don t personally believe in any of the fad diets that keep showing up i think that they put your body into an unhealthy famine mode which will cause you to gain the fat right back if you start to eat normally again the best idea is to eliminate all junk food you can do a cheat day if you need to but don t go overboard eat balanced meals of reasonable size overeating will cause your stomach to be too large and you will still feel hungry when you re not also have lots of healthy snacks during the day ideally you ll want to eat or small meals throughout the day carry food with you so you aren t tempted to eat unhealthily when you re out of the house and don t buy unhealthy foods get foods that are low in bad fats we do need fat to survive but not saturated fat minimize the processed flours and sugars no white bread no sugar choose leaner meats and protein sources don t expect to eat pizza and burritos all the time and lose weight and eat tons of vegetables eat salads steamed vegetables and raw vegetables too you can t eat so much celery that you ll get fat don t eat too much fruit or things containing high fructose corn syrup the reason is that fructose is hard on the liver because it can only be metabolized there you can eat fruit during or after a workout don t eat late at night because your body will turn it into fat eat a smaller amount of calories than needed to maintain your weight you have burn more than you intake always exercise cardio especially but weights are good too don t give up you ll be glad you chose to lose the weight here s what i do and it has been working for me obviously a workout needs to be tailored to the individual but these exercises may help arms lying dumbbell triceps extensions standing barbell curl behind head reverse hammers one arm

front raises shrugs military presses front raises rotator cuffs superlight lateral raises on incline bench with lbs dumbbells st facing forward bring dumbbells up from sides to parallel to ground palms inward slow repeat for ten reps nd facing bench bring dumbbells up from sides backwards as far as you can palms inward slow repeat for ten reps rd stand up with dumbbells and do lateral raises th back in position raise arms so they are forward palms inward arms bent in a semi bear hug position and parallel to ground bring to sides and back to center for reps i usually do lbs here because this exercise is hard do this set three times with out rest the third set i change to all lb movements all of this is slow pace like second up and one second down legs squats leg extentions leg curls adductors abductors calf lifts glute machine leg lifts i also do crunches per night my idea is to hit a variety of ranges and movements in order to work the muscle to the maximum i tend to use a weight i can do for reps and for reps on the last two movements apart from this i do minutes or cardio every day and stretch before and after the workout as well as frequently during stretching is very important to muscular growth because not only does it help prevent injury and alleviate recovery pain but it also stretches out the fascia tissue that surrounds the muscle and inhibits its growth when you are pumped and you stretch is when you get the best stretch of the fascia lastly rest and nutrition are every bit as important as the workout itself eating enough protein for the muscle to recover and grow as well as enough carbohydrates to replenish diminished glycogen stores in the muscles and liver is vital for repair and being ready for the next time you tax those muscles Cuisine of
