do you think i am fat i am ' to ' and weigh lbs does anyone think this is fat also does anyone else have this body type does anyone know easy ways to loose weight it doesn't sound fat to me but it's also a matter of how the weight is distributed not just the straight bmi type number the best range to lose weight in is to lbs a week this will allow your body to accustom itself to the loss and the skin to regain its prestretched stage losing weight too quickly will cause the skin of abdomen chest and inner thighs to sag possibly dramatically i don t personally believe in any of the fad diets that keep showing up i think that they put your body into an unhealthy famine mode which will cause you to gain the fat right back if you start to eat normally again the best idea is to eliminate all junk food you can do a cheat day if you need to but don t go overboard eat balanced meals of reasonable size overeating will cause your stomach to be too large and you will still feel hungry when you re not also have lots of healthy snacks during the day ideally you ll want to eat or small meals throughout the day carry food with you so you aren t tempted to eat unhealthily when you re out of the house and don t buy unhealthy foods get foods that are low in bad fats we do need fat to survive but not saturated fat minimize the processed flours and sugars no white bread no sugar choose leaner meats and protein sources don t expect to eat pizza and burritos all the time and lose weight and eat tons of vegetables eat salads steamed vegetables and raw vegetables too you can t eat so much celery that you ll get fat don t eat too much fruit or things containing high fructose corn syrup the reason is that fructose is hard on the liver because it can only be metabolized there you can eat fruit during or after a workout don t eat late at night because your body will turn it into fat eat a smaller amount of calories than needed to maintain your weight you have burn more than you intake always exercise cardio especially but weights are good too don t give up you ll be glad you chose to lose the weight Low-carbohydrate diet Food Weight training Bodybuilding Nutrition Veganism Anorexia nervosa Hamster Super Size Me Milk Vegetarianism Binge eating disorder Hypoglycemia Tofu South Beach diet Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Equine conformation Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Fecal incontinence Healthy eating Stomach cancer Tocopherol Guinea pig Breastfeeding Cuisine of Denmark Bread Adjustable gastric band Folic acid Vitamin C Jewish cuisine Insulin Sugar Omega-3 fatty acid Food preservation Cheese Egg (food) Hamburger Cuisine of the Southern United States 613 mitzvot Cuisine of the Philippines Chocolate Japanese cuisine Coronary heart disease Acorn Glycogen storage disease type I Domestic rabbit Trans fat Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Tooth Dietary fiber Fancy rat Fat Domesticated turkey Diabetes mellitus Fugu Glucokinase Food guide pyramid Colorectal cancer Chinese cuisine Korean cuisine Junk food Ramen Protein Weight loss Protein-energy malnutrition Cuisine of Malaysia Aspartame Foodborne illness Soul food Sugar substitute Cuisine of Brazil Cat Vegetarian cuisine Tomato Alcoholic beverage Famine Fructose Chicken Organic food Soy protein Meal Dim sum Chinese food therapy Comanche Watermelon Ice cream
