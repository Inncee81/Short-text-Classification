overtraining how can you tell you've overtrained i'm not sure if i did i do a day split i've been working out for about a year now mon chest wed back friday shoulders legs traps sunday biceps triceps my chest day is the day where i can never tell if i overtrained it i did about sets for my chest each set was in the rep range for muscle gain i lift as heavy as i can with proper form most of those sets were focused on my upper pecs because they are kind of lagging about sets to be exact the day after i worked out that bodypart my chest is really sore i could move it but was really sore the day after that the soreness is dramatically decreased almost completely gone but not quite and on this day i will be working my back i follow a strict bulking diet and make sure i get all my vitamins and minerals do you think i overtrained my chest with sets sets seems like way to much when playing football when doing one specific excercise it was only sets of fairly heavy sets around which seemed fine if you are doing sets you can probably go much heavier for only sets also make sure you are working your other upper body muscles you said you where working out for a year but have not seen results maybe you have plataeu'd with your current workout just as advice try to give your entire body equal amount of training and keep in mind you have to give your body and muscles some time to repair and rebuild after working out so my advice lower your sets go heavier work all your other muscles and try to keep your heartbeat up and dont be afraid to mix up your routine and you will probably see a difference Tocopherol Equine conformation Dieting Professional wrestling holds Humerus Puberty Arm Breaststroke Aerial (dance move) Folic acid Wing Chun Scapula Professional wrestling throws Fecal incontinence Urinary incontinence Elbow-joint Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Professional wrestling attacks Bench press Massage Breastfeeding Nutrition Suplex Diving Deadlift Breech birth Tide Muscle Scar Babe Ruth Atherosclerosis Norway national football team Pubic hair Marching band Tetrapod Carpal tunnel syndrome Protoss Chest First aid Domestic rabbit Swimming Stretching Internal ballistics Dietary fiber Cardiac arrhythmia Mattress Bruce Lee Parade (military) Vitamin C Multiple sclerosis Space elevator Rickets Pok__mon Abilities Body type (exercise) Archery Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Repetitive strain injury Heart rate Hip fracture Action potential Gray Wolf Cancer Atkins Nutritional Approach Vegeta Artificial limb Lung cancer Heart Radius (bone) Westminster School Spinal cord injury Prostate cancer Cat Kimono Swingout Powerlifting Traumatic brain injury Professional wrestling aerial techniques Internal oblique Terminal ballistics Local anesthesia Brassiere Aortic dissection Clinical depression Rugby union Andr__s Galarraga United States House of Representatives Pneumonia Androgen insensitivity syndrome Tyrannosaurus rex Tai Chi Chuan Drowning Milk
