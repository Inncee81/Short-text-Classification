if i been exercising and my muscles are sore should i stretch and wait for the soreness to go away before i continue i think i heard somewhere that you have to rest ur muscles to give them a chance to develop does resting mean until the soreness goes away or is one day of waiting ok pain is a warning sign from your muscles that they have been over taxed rest them from serious exercise for a day but gently stretch them in slow movements otherwise they will go back to their old stiff state make sure you take in lots of water to keep them hydrated too because dehydration will contribute to the soreness Weight training Fecal incontinence Equine conformation Dehydration First aid Urinary incontinence Carpal tunnel syndrome Exercise Cramp Bodybuilding Running Traumatic brain injury Marathon (sport) Muscle Repetitive strain injury Menstrual cup Mouth ulcer Group A streptococcal infection Hyperthermia Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stretching Paget's disease of bone Backstroke Waterbed Andr__s Galarraga Bruise Pharyngitis Swimming Duchenne muscular dystrophy Spasticity Iditarod Prostate cancer Mattress Sciatica Aortic valve stenosis Diabetes mellitus Lactic acid Poliomyelitis Back pain Chronic fatigue syndrome Trumpet Pain Diabetic ketoacidosis Chiropractic Bedsore Hiking John the Baptist Myopia Proprioception Certified Nursing Assistant Osteoarthritis Stroke Decompression sickness Diazepam Magnesium sulfate Domestic rabbit Diving Head Front crawl Sulfuric acid Rotator cuff tear Iliotibial band syndrome Electrolyte Horizontal bar Bates Method Parkinson's disease Menthol Gout Skeletal muscle Thoracic outlet syndrome Tai Chi Chuan Rehydration Parade (military) Badaling Expressway Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Bicycle Mitral regurgitation Infectious mononucleosis Myasthenia gravis Balance disorder Alcohol Physical strength Breastfeeding Myocardial infarction Fatty acid metabolism Breaststroke Radiation therapy Overtraining Chinese martial arts Abdomen Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Childbirth Replacement joint Anus Dieting Stress fracture Hemorrhoid
