can someone tell me a website that teaches me what to do and eat so that i can live longer i need a website that tells me what to do and eat because im going to die when im if ill stay at this life i have read a lot about diets and experienced some of them hereafter the best advices to loose weight that i have put together myself and that i experience mostly every day it s more than a diet it s a manner to live and to appreciate tasty healthy meals preferring quality to quantity this diet is long lasting not annoying not too difficult and without negative effects it helps you to loose weight and to stabilize your weight which is i assure you more difficult first your normal weight not the ideal weight following to the bmi body mass index weight height x height the body mass index increases with the age years y y years y years and more an example you are m tall and you weight kg lbs ft cm inch cm pound g kg bmi x x it s ok when you are years old and more it s not ok from to years ideal weight cm kg it is tolerable if you have more or less more than more or less is considered as problematical but this scale is very rough and ignores important points as sexual characteristics little stature eat what is at your taste have excellent meals with several dishes choose what is healthy for you i give here only advices that are healthy for normally healthy people try to find out by what dishes you loose weight and by what dishes you put on people are different in all what makes put on weight the one doesn t necessarily put on flesh to the other one don t eat more than to kcal per day it depends on your objective if you want to loose about kg lbs in a week eat only calories an adult woman needs about kcal a day an adult man needs about kcal a day the best is to eat small meals during well dispersed all over the day but many people lack of opportunities to do so and many others fail because they are hungry as they eat less so they haven t often enough willpower to stay to their calories limit people who are good fat burners high metabolism can eat more calories without putting weight on but with growing age the metabolism weakens and people put on weight faster the metabolism weakens also by wrong diets when you loose weight too quickly after that the metabolism changes because you eat less food and when you begin afterwards to eat normally a maximum is extracted out of the food and you put on weight more quickly than you have lost it so the best is to avoid an unfavorable change of the metabolism by eating aliments with little fibers and many calories sweets meat sausages hamburgers fish cream french fried however if you eat aliments which have many fibers and little calories vegetables fruits but no bananas whole bread whole rice you will not change your metabolism negatively but you will loose weight less quickly try to get a table of food calories by downloading it out of the internet for instance fix a maximum of weight you will absolutely not pass beyond weigh you every day the best in the morning so you can easily find out what makes you gain weight or loose weight it s much easier than counting calories every day and the result is the same if you weigh you every day eat slowly and without stress let smelt tasty dishes on the tongue remember that you eat too much and without control under stress do prefer good tasting dishes with few calories to dishes with many calories fruit vegetables meager meats meager fish sweets with less sugar or sweetening or sugar mixed with sweetening for myself i prefer good savory meats and fish and then i eat less or i eat several dishes before breakfast start with a cup of lukewarm water then eat what you like at least an hour before the main meal start with fruits of the season or eat a salad an hour before the real meal so you will be less hungry before the meal it is much healthier than taking powders diluted in water to fill the stomach up by the way fruits taste better if you put half a strawberry on a slice of a nectarine on a slice of an apple half a berry of a grape on a slice of a pear on a slice of a peach or make a salad of fresh fruit an example of several dishes prepared very quickly fruit smoked salmon with salad main dish dessert prefer fresh fruit and fresh vegetables or frozen vegetables to fruits and vegetables in cans and glasses drink at least liters of beverage without calories water water with lemon juice and sweetening water with fresh fruit juice and sweetening water with a spoonful of apple vinegar or apple cider vinegar after getting up drink a glass of warm water drink sometimes water with a spoon of apple vinegar if you discover in the morning that you have put on weight stop eating the same day five hours before going to bed don t eat much at the evening or dishes with few calories salads soup of vegetables without butter or cream prefer milk prefer fat and oil made out of vegetables olive oil and colza oil do not heat over then it is not healthy anymore so it is not good for roasting grilling sunflower oil is good for everything because healthy and neutral of taste restrict fat made out of cream and extracted out of animal protein attention at evening before tv when the gustatory papilla s are excited by some food even of very few calories it becomes difficult to retain the desire to eat something else the best is to drink water or tea peppermint chamomile etc without sugar or sweetening if you can control your envy anymore than do any activity the best outside or wherever there is no food washing and cleaning your teeth could stop your envy too mental preparation is important too be proud that you eat now very controlled that you prefer quality to quantity that you make a healthy and a tasty choice of dishes that you eat like people who know much about good food that you are self controlled and have got a strong will to do right that you have made new experiences and that you know more than many others about good food that you can share your experiences with others and give them good advices try autosuggestion just say and repeat i am not hungry i am not hungry i have enough will and will not eat sweets the principle is that you active your subconscience which acts on your behavior your body your feelings your thoughts by saying and believing in these sentences the stronger you believe in your subconscient powers the more you will succeed to realize your aims everywhere and not only in your diet it is a sort of placebo effect as i said it functions only when you believe in it mostly all diets have negative and only short effects make sports i mean physical exercises which make you transpire fact is that if you are able to make sports during three hours a day you loose mostly water you build up muscles and you loose more or less gr one hour of exercises is a loss of gr be aware that the higher you re overweight the more you are able to loose weight at the beginning of the diet don t get disappointed when you find out that there are days you haven t lost weight despise of your efforts it s quite normal because men don t make progress continuously but by steps after some days of stagnation you will go on loosing weight at the condition that you won t have lost your courage and your will tips for dishes buy vanilla ice cream mix fruit strawberries or

easy to prepare mix fresh fruit add low fat yogurt and sweetening mix all eat whole grain bread and rice if you ask me on this side i will give you an excellent recipe for whole grain bread easily to bake eat only chocolate of more than cacao last and efficient advice try this fix your objective and limit the amount of calories per day according to it don t forget to take in consideration the points described above eat what you want in the morning and at noon but in the evening eat fruits or vegetables or vegetable soup or salad or meat or fish don t eat at your last meal milk products or sweets or food made out of flour or potatoes or rice or nuts and i guess you will loose weight rapidly this is similar to the so called food separation diet this diet has the advantage that you feel light after the meal but here as well as anywhere else you must avoid to take more calories that you are able to burn otherwise you will surely put on weight don t ever forget that people are different no diet and no advices are necessarily adapted to you so every diet has to be adapted to the patient and not the patient to the diet that s what i would like to write on the door of every school the pedagogical principals must be adapted to the different pupils and not the pupils to the pedagogical principles p s it exists a variation eat as described above the first day but stop eating at hours the second day eat only vegetable soup and go on like this as long as you want this is also a perfectly healthy and efficient diet a recipe for an excellent soup put in a pan olive oil and half an onion cut in slices let it blanch add a small potato cut in small pieces and vegetables the best are all sorts of cabbage kale cauliflower and others with few calories salad spinach celery tomatoes use eventually deep frozen vegetables it s less preparation and they have at least as many vitamins by blanching the vegetables get more taste boil water add soup tablets i prefer vegetable powder and salt add the vegetables let cook mix all up add cream more calories or milk less calories or water no calories a last idea if you eat this or a similar soup during several days and nothing else and drink pints of water you will loose more or less two pounds every day it s a healthy diet i give only healthy advices but it is dull with my best wishes
