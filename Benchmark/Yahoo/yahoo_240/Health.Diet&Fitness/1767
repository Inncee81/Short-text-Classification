what has been your experience with liquid diets they are great for short term system cleansing i don't do the whole coffee enema thing or anything ew and don't bother with any green tea smoothies or any of that nonsense but once in a while i'll just have a light breakfast with lots of oj a relatively liquid soup for lunch anything that's not overly chunky and more soup or similar for dinner and lots and lots of water during the day and it really makes a big difference you lose some weight you feel better and you give your body a chance to breathe but then a few days later i smell a good steak crackling on our grill and i'm right back to the pleasures of toxifying lol but that's what balance is all about seriously when i see vegans they all look horrible like skeletons with withered flesh zombies really that's an extreme diet and it cannot be healthy human beings have canine teeth and the ability to digest meats for a reason i think balance and moderation with plenty of liquids as a regular part of your everyday diet is the best solution you can live that way forever it's not a daily struggle and you'll find you actually end up healthier all around just cut out the snack chips and fast foods and you're already eating healthier than the average person Dieting Breakfast Cuisine of Denmark Meal Cat Fecal incontinence Cuisine of the Philippines Tofu Veganism Food Hamburger Vegetarianism Milk Korean cuisine Vitamin C Healthy eating Cuisine of the Southern United States Serbian cuisine Egg (food) Fugu Equine conformation Chocolate Peter Singer Hypoglycemia Cheese Cha chaan teng Soup Nutrition McDonald's Shark Chinese food therapy German cuisine Water Jewish cuisine British cuisine Alcoholic beverage Coffee Tea Low-carbohydrate diet Breastfeeding Insulin Kashrut Adjustable gastric band Tlingit Coconut crab Cuisine of Brazil Snack food Human height Ekadasi Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Watermelon Goodness and value theory Japanese tea ceremony Super Size Me Potato The nature of God in Western theology Hamster Tea (meal) Ramen Theory of conduct Coeliac disease Delicatessen Folic acid Pork rind Shen Gong Wu Hyperthermia Animal rights Dim sum French cuisine South Beach diet Russian cuisine Human Sandwich Social rule Characters of Naruto Bacon Oral sex Happy Tree Friends Street food Garfield Domesticated turkey Fast-food restaurant Cuisine of Laos Word of Wisdom Pizza Vegetarian nutrition Cocaine Chinese cuisine Irish breakfast
