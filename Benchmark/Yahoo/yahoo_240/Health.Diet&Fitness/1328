exercising dieting and losing fat weight ok so i am not really concerned about my weight that doesnt really bother me i weight pounds ' and i'm dont tell me i dont need to lose weight or anything i dont want to lose weight i want to lose the fat around my hips and stomache is there any quick exercises that i can do while sitting down at the computer or at home any exercises that burn calories and fat quick please help hi i'm a teenager too and i had exactly the same problem as a teenager i really did not feel like going to a gym besides most gym don't allow teenagers so i had to do some quick exercises at home as you probably already know the only way to burn off fat anywhere is doing cardio exercises this means any type of exercises which makes you sweat the more sweat and the more tired you are the better so that basically rules out the exercises whilst sitting at the computer sorry what exercises you do and how when you do it should be completely up to you you have to choose your own exercises which work for you and a time when you are most motivated to exercise and have the most energy for me being a teenager means that i don't have a lot of time to exercise i would much rather go spend time with my friends etc and any free time would be spent doing homework so the thing that worked for me is doing short exercises about min for a few times every day the best times to do exercises to burn fat is in the morning before you eat because you have an empty stomach so the energy you are burning is from the fat and not the food which you have eaten throughout the day for the exercises there are many different types and lots of different ideas on the internet you should look at some ideas and try them see which ones you like the best and suit you and then put them together to make your workout just a short one for you to quickly do here are some links http exercise about com od cardioworkouts l aaburncalories htm this gives you an idea on a quick but intense workout http www parents com parents story jsp storyid templatedata parents story data xml a jump rope workout try jump roping for a bit it's a lot more tiring than it looks if you have a friend or a sibling try to get them to do it with you it makes it really fun remember you don't have to do exercises at home to burn off calories you could also join a sports team or something to make it fun Atkins Nutritional Approach Dieting Bodybuilding Obesity Anorexia nervosa Super Size Me Little Britain Low-carbohydrate diet Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Equine conformation Weight loss Breastfeeding Glossary of climbing terms Calorie Garfield Exercise Adjustable gastric band Swimming Stomach cancer Theory of conduct 2000 Australian Grand Prix Hyperglycemia Professional wrestling throws Weight Watchers Milk Piccolo Junior Saga Social rule World Wide Web Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Aspartame Obedience training The Amazing Race Fecal incontinence HyperText Transfer Protocol Nutrition Boxing training Aerobic exercise Aerial (dance move) Mountain bike Vegetarianism Veganism Hamburger Egg (food) Swingout Avenue Q Marathon (sport) JavaServer Pages Gastric bypass surgery Hypoglycemia Wireless Application Protocol About a Boy Andrew Dice Clay Elvis Presley Internal ballistics Calorie restriction Triathlon Sauna Fat Singlish Debugging Babe Ruth Tocopherol 613 mitzvot Cat South Beach diet Fancy rat FoxTrot Vegeta Ajax (programming) Spidey Super Stories Gastroparesis Hamster The Ashlee Simpson Show Brown Bear Motivation American Pie (song) Bread Dialysis Saved by the Bell Transmission Control Protocol Pok__mon Live!
