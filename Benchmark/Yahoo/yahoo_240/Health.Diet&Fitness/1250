i want to get a tummy tuck but scared is the tummy tuck really worth the risk depends on what you're doing it for most commonly tummy tucks are just to cut off the excess skin from losing a large amount of weight not to actually remove the weight if there is enough excess skin that it is either in your way and you just can't handle it or if it's getting painful like where you move it to keeps pinching or pulling it then it may be worth it ultimately it's going to be a personal decision based on weighing the risks against the benefits and asking if that excess skin is really worth the risks and weeks of pain during recovery if you are considering the tummy tuck that also removes a lot of fat just remember that working hard to work it off yourself is much more fulfilling less painful and generally safer also if you suck fat out of the stomach you will look disproportionate you'll have less fat around your mid section but the same higher amount of fat in your legs arms neck and similar areas good luck in whatever you decide Breastfeeding Equine conformation Weight training Professional wrestling holds Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Swimming Diving Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Aerial (dance move) Prostate cancer Obesity Plastic surgery Professional wrestling throws Diving suit Traumatic brain injury Tocopherol Intravenous therapy Stopping power Cancer Diabetes mellitus Knife Decompression sickness Childbirth Trapping Internal ballistics Ra (board game) Guinea pig Dialysis Milk Atkins Nutritional Approach Weight loss Fast bowling Nuclear power Cocaine Puberty Insulin File Allocation Table Professional wrestling attacks Glucocorticoid Stroke Esophageal cancer Beef Fishing Gastroesophageal reflux disease Hypoglycemia Arguments for and against drug prohibition Space Shuttle program Circumcision Biodiesel Androgen insensitivity syndrome Nuclear weapon design Intersex surgery Baseball Suicide methods Tax Myocardial infarction Local anesthesia Domestic rabbit Tofu Breast cancer Malignant melanoma Radiation therapy Urinary incontinence Rear wheel drive Skin graft Wood Anorexia nervosa Adipose tissue Comanche Goodness and value theory Paragliding Autopsy Cephalic disorder Poker jargon Abortion Epidural Weight Pubic hair Suplex Recovery position Microeconomics Exercise Monetary policy Sunburn Inflation Money Stress fracture Tooth Cheese Single Transferable Vote Anarchism and capitalism Aspartame Anchor Hair Sin City Casualty lifting Pneumonia
