how long does it take a ft frame to notice a diference in their bodyy working out a ton a day have been doing it for a week so far how long until people say wow you've lost weight or i can notice it i am five feet it depends on a few things how much you currently weigh if under pounds it may be quite some time before folks notice if over the change will become much more obvious by how your clothes fit the types of exercises which you are doing just cardio just strength training or both the types of cardio and the types of strength training define a ton one person's ton may be miniscule to another individual and the real and true reality is of where it becomes really noticeable is when you lose at least lbs again depending upon your current size a very good time frame is actually weeks after the first few weeks your body is still in the process of going into shock from the change you have just initiated also i must add that those who see you daily won't notice that you are losing weight because you see them so often that the change in front of their eyes is so graduall that it doesn't become noticeable to them to get that expression from people it would have to be from those whom you don't see too often depending upon the individual they may make a statement they may not but just because they don't say it doesn't mean they don't notice i hope this is about making a healthier more fit you and not to get a reaction from others Mass Explosive material Weight training Bodybuilding Equine conformation Dieting Ton Mountain bike Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Force Muscle Ontological argument Bicycle frame Scientology beliefs and practices Pound Tai Chi Chuan Mixed martial arts Theory of conduct Reality Social rule Tonnage Stress fracture M60 machine gun TGV Piccolo Junior Saga Weight Karen Horney Microeconomics Cultural Revolution Swimming Shell (projectile) Decibel Friedrich Schleiermacher Breastfeeding Goodness and value theory Human height Psoriasis Largest organism Justification (theology) Mattress Psychosis Welding Brassiere Greek language ALGOL 68 Atomism Jet engine Frame problem Bicycle lighting English unit Modern geocentrism Diving Epistemology Fashion The Ashlee Simpson Show Extreme Programming Art Contredanse C syntax U.S. customary units Exercise Paper size Mark I (tank) Nuclear weapon design Puberty Mitsubishi 3000GT Steel Bicycle God Strap-on dildo Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Trench warfare Piano Property (ownership right) Second Battle of El Alamein Car handling Imperial unit Glossary of partner dance terms Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Laws of cricket Power (sociology) Casting Specific impulse Roman currency Triathlon Philosophy of language Strategic planning Great White Shark Jennifer Lopez Physical attractiveness Super Size Me Infinity Personal rapid transit Lance Armstrong Military history of the Roman Empire XML Hypoglycemia Objectivist philosophy
