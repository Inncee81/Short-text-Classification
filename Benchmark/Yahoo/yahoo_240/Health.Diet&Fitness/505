what has a better absorption rate is it true that you get better absorption through mouth dissolving a lozenge vs gastrointestinal a pill depends on the compound just because it dissolves in your mouth doesn't mean you've successfully taken up the compound there's always a limiting factor the thing that most slows absorption and it's specific to every chemical so there's no hard and fast rule some things dissolve better and faster through the mouth such as chemicals that are made up of physically smaller molecules larger more complex molecules such as fatty acids are absorbed through the gi where they can sit a bit and be modified by the local environment ph enzymatic action etc some compounds such as many proteins require gi uptake to be converted to a usable form by the body hope that helps Enzyme Insulin Protein Cell (biology) Biochemistry Explosive material Nuclear magnetic resonance Photosynthesis Brewery Nutrition Caffeine Ammonia Ozone depletion Chemical reaction Ozone hole Spectroscopy Nutrient Mass spectrometry Sewage treatment Carbon Ozone layer Carbon dioxide Water (molecule) Breastfeeding Retinol Tocopherol Water Systematic name Tobacco smoking Hypoglycemia Chemistry Alkane Pharmaceutical company Biodiesel Zinc Fatty acid Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Cancer Protein kinase Cannabis (drug) Metabolism Cellular respiration Sulfur Infrared spectroscopy Alcohol fuel Cannabinoids DNA repair Action potential Virus Atherosclerosis Acid Uranium Internal ballistics Vitamin Alternative biochemistry Cocaine Vitamin C Whole proteome analysis Analytical chemistry Veganism Folic acid Mitochondrion Tooth enamel Clinical depression Molecule Vegetarian nutrition Red blood cell Biomolecule Mitochondrial genetics Sugar substitute Hydrogen chloride Origin of life Rebreather Fatty acid metabolism Francis Crick Dietary fiber Sulfuric acid Nuclear fission Computational chemistry Amino acid Asthma Antiretroviral drug Aspartame Hydrogen peroxide Lac operon Baldness treatments Cyclodextrin Vacuum Glucocorticoid
