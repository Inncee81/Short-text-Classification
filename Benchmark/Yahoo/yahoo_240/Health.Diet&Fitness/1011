is putting salt on tostito chips bad for your health my bf does it all the time hes a biology major too i would assume that he knows how horrible that is for your health his response is meh im young my body can handle it how un healthly is it should i keep nagging at him to stop let's be reasonable about this just how much salt is he putting on the chips and just how many chips is he really consuming anyway just a handful with a dash of salt on each or a whole family pack covered with a whole carton of salt all in one sitting as long as it's not a daily habit of large portions of extra salted tortilla chips i think it is not going to kill him also if he doesn't have unusually high blood pressure or other health issues that might be worsened by that extra salt it shouldn't hurt if he's otherwise on a healthy and balanced diet just a little indulgence in salt and chips is fine some people do worse things like binge on alcohol overeat portions and consume too few vegetables and fruits the amount of salt he dashes on is probably less than the amount some people consume in one pack of popcorn at the movies or even in one meal i know that you are concerned about his health i think that is a positive thing however be holistic about it if he's not already on a diet that is balanced and wholesome in general then nagging him about just the chips would be pointless you will need to help him compensate for the chips offer him refreshing salads with lowfat dressing or fruit sorbets made with fresh fruits or how about helping him control portions on everything he eats and inviting him for workouts with you believe me this will help him more than just nagging about salt on chips good luck Vegetarianism Healthy eating Dieting Nutrition Food Foodborne illness French fries Binge eating disorder Veganism French cuisine Breakfast Coffee Folic acid Egg (food) Fish and chips Cuisine of Denmark Edible salt Omega-3 fatty acid Jewish cuisine Kashrut Milk Low-carbohydrate diet Guinea pig Fecal incontinence Ice cream Fast food Betting (poker) Vitamin C Ramen Obesity Hypoglycemia Luck Cuisine of the Philippines Hypertension Meal Super Size Me Dietary fiber Breastfeeding Weight training Peruvian cuisine Snack food Alcoholics Anonymous Shark Organic farming Knife Alcoholism Fugu Prostate cancer Tofu Trans fat Potato Mojave people Water (molecule) Vegetarianism and religion Domestic rabbit Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Raw food diet German cuisine Sauna Tobacco smoking Shaggy dog story Microeconomics Floppy disk Adjustable gastric band Peanut Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Cheese Salad Potassium Tooth RISC Cuisine of Malaysia Cuisine of Brazil Sodium chloride Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Maize Tomato Health insurance Sauerkraut Wine Sandwich First aid Electrophysiology Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Mango CPU cache Alcoholic beverage Dog training Little Britain Organic food Rum Hormone replacement therapy (trans)
