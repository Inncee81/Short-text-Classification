i im feet tall and play football how much should i weigh question ok well i have a big build the tallest in the class and i weigh like is this ok and i'm also pretty quick i can out run friends that a smaller than me i played backup lb and a lg on plays to the outside and a pretty quick le oh and since i'm not in high school yet i played on a little league team oh and if im over weight whats a good way to loose weight to a very high degree you should weigh as much as you feel happy with weighing as far as a healthy weight that's what most of the other posts are about calculating your bmi diet plans etc but most people will say what the average is according to different opinions there's also a big difference depending on your muscle mass and percent of fat on your body as long as you are at a weight where you are healthy the most important part is that you are happy with your weight not that you should be x pounds but that no matter what you weigh you are happy with that instead of striving to be a size or something like that that being said if you want to lose weight exercise is a really good and safe way to lose weight in addition to that i would recommend meeting with a nutritionist or dietitian to see if there is something else that may benefit you more Dieting Atkins Nutritional Approach Obesity Weight training Weight Body mass index Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Human height Breastfeeding Bodybuilding Adjustable gastric band Stomach cancer Super Size Me Diabetes mellitus Exercise Anorexia nervosa Prostate cancer Protein Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Milk Tocopherol Binge eating disorder Mass American football Nutrition Physical attractiveness Clinical depression Weight loss Brown Bear Folic acid Raw food diet Puberty Largest organism Low-carbohydrate diet Guinea pig United States Postal Service South Beach diet Theory of conduct Trans fat Coronary heart disease Utilitarianism Muscle Baseball Cat Pound Tai Chi Chuan Skin Vitamin C Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Explosive material Egg (food) Aikido Sport rowing English unit Hamster Domestic rabbit Glossary of American football Dietitian Terri Schiavo M16 (rifle) Grade (education) Anchor Vegetarianism U.S. customary units McDonald's Healthy eating Shell (projectile) Andr__s Galarraga Football (soccer) Species Sexual attraction Aspartame M60 machine gun Hamburger Peter Singer TGV Economic inequality Redundant array of independent disks Coeliac disease Hypertension Tyrannosaurus rex Swimming Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Body type (exercise) Pittsburgh Steelers Atomism Great White Shark Calorie Insulin Sport Sperm Whale Osteoporosis Sport utility vehicle Weight Watchers Marathon (sport) Hypoglycemia
