i need to loose weight fast i am yrs old im ' '' lbs with broad shoulders and athletic build im starting to notice a gut what is healthy eating ive got the gym membership yesterday honestly i need you to answere this question with a routine and eating regiment if possible if not then any helpful hint will work thx to a very high degree you should weigh as much as you feel happy with weighing as far as a healthy weight that's what most of the other posts are about calculating your bmi diet plans etc but most people will say what the average is according to different opinions as long as you are at a weight where you are healthy the most important part is that you are happy with your weight not that you should be x pounds but that no matter what you weigh you are happy with that instead of striving to be a size or something like that that being said if you want to lose weight exercise is a really good and safe way to lose weight in addition to that i would recommend meeting with a nutritionist or dietitian to see if there is something else that may benefit you more from the sound of it you've already got a lot of weight in muscle so you sound like you're pretty healthy Atkins Nutritional Approach Weight training Dieting Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stomach cancer Obesity Super Size Me Binge eating disorder Anorexia nervosa Raw food diet Adjustable gastric band Breastfeeding Pound Equine conformation Prostate cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Veganism Guinea pig Folic acid Nutrition Human height Weight loss Tocopherol Exercise Coeliac disease Dietitian Diabetes mellitus Low-carbohydrate diet Chronic fatigue syndrome Terri Schiavo Hamburger Omega-3 fatty acid Cat Physical attractiveness Healthy eating South Beach diet United States Postal Service Clinical depression Utilitarianism Domestic rabbit Weight Watchers Hamster Tai Chi Chuan Muscle Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Great White Shark Cardiovascular disease Protein The Ashlee Simpson Show Fancy rat Fast food Garlic Goodness and value theory Gastroparesis Vegetarianism Vitamin C Peter Singer Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Coronary heart disease Egg (food) Diarrhea Sport rowing Swimming Natural Hygiene Food guide pyramid Brown Bear McDonald's Urinary incontinence Koala Microeconomics Health insurance Trans fat Rationalization (sociology) Bundestag (Germany) The Wack Pack Decibel Repetitive strain injury Hypoglycemia M16 (rifle) Hypertension Clean animals Gray Wolf Vegetarianism and religion Mixed martial arts Tightlacing Ben Johnson (athlete) Handloading Vegetarian nutrition Cystic fibrosis Blue Whale Fecal incontinence Colorectal cancer 2000 Australian Grand Prix Good Morning, Vietnam
