how fast can i get a six pack ok i'm years old and i wanna get a six pack before school starts or atleast half way through the school year i'm ' and i weigh lbs i lift weights and play basketball and soccer any suggestions how to get a six pack fast ah all men dream of a six pack we may not admit it but we do whether we find it aesthetically pleasing or not it is indisputable that a six pack symbolises something far more important ultimate body sculpting and all that goes with it hard work ambition drive skill however knowing how to get a six pack fast is one thing actually getting one is something else the six pack is comprised of the abdominal muscles notice the word muscles in that sentence if you want a great looking pair of biceps what do you do you lift weights doing bicep curls in order to make them more prominent if you want a firm strong chest what do you do you do bench presses to increase the muscle getting a six pack is no different if you want your abs to be prominent and well defined then you need to work them however you can work your abdominals to death but they will never present themselves if they have a layer of fat covering them you see muscles only become visible and defines as long as they are not buried in fat this is an amazingly simple principle yet an astonishing number of people completely overlook it for some just doing endless sit ups and crunches should be enough to get a six pack and then they are left bemused when none show knowing how to get a six pack fast needn't be a secret the six pack is probably the most prized aesthetic look precisely because it is the hardest to achieve our arms don't appear to be our body's favourite storage space for fat so consequently we can build the visibility of our bicep and forearm muscles very quickly even a morbidly obese individual could display them after a bit of work our legs are slightly more prone to fat but again you can see muscle definition fairly quickly the stomach area is where we put out fat and unfortunately represents the hardest task to accomplish here's the thing you can work your abs for months doing countless reverse curls crunches and sit ups it's highly likely that in that time you will have built a fine looking six pack but unless you have removed the fat on top of the six pack it will never be visible now losing weight isn't enough to get the stomach fat off again look for the keyword in the sentence fat weight is made of two forms fat and muscle if you wish to know how to get a six pack fast then you need to understand the importance of treating each sub category of weight properly you will want to build muscle and burn fat muscle is dense and requires an awful lot of calories to keep it going so if you build a pound of muscle you will pay for that by burning fat like it or not you will have to hit the weights and hit them hard you will also have to eat clean and ensure your body fat percentage goes down steadily this can be accomplished in a fast period of time assuming you aren't in terrible physical condition to begin with it helps if you have less than lbs to lose it is no good going from lbs to lbs if you are losing fat and muscle because a significant percentage of the fat will continue to cover your abs you need to ensure that the vast majority of weight lost is fat if you can nail that combination of building muscle working the abs and dieting to lose fat then you could see a six pack in very fast time of course it goes without saying that the harder you hit the weights and the more disciplined you are with your diet the faster you will accomplish your goal suck it up and get it done and you too can rip off your shirt and beam with pride Equine conformation Professional wrestling holds Atkins Nutritional Approach Puberty Anorexia nervosa Aerial (dance move) Bodybuilding Fast bowling Professional wrestling throws Mixed martial arts Muscle Tai Chi Chuan Adjustable gastric band Volleyball Breastfeeding Insulin Explosive material Pound Swimming Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Internal ballistics Physical attractiveness Diabetes mellitus Combine (Half-Life 2) Tenshinhan Gray Wolf Hypoglycemia Arm Weight loss Babe Ruth Humerus Theory of conduct Mr. Olympia Swingout Paragliding Rugby union positions Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Sport Aortic dissection Infantilism Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Wing Chun Homer Simpson Comanche Abdomen Recumbent bicycle Milton H.
