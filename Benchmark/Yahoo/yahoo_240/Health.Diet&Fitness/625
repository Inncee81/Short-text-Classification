working out hey i don't want to lift too much at because i'm already short i lift light weights and i am pretty sure that won't stunt my growth i was wondering if i could lift heavy weights as i get stronger for example hypothetically if i could bench press pounds no problem for about repetitions would that stunt my growth or am i so used to the weight that it would not effect it or would i have to limit my weightlifting to some point and never increase after that until i get older i've never seen any evidence that any form of exercise will stunt your growth if you're worried about your height look into proper diet natural ways to enhance hgh production such as insulin glycemic management and meal timing do a little googling you'll find lots of vitamins and hype plus a few real nuggets of knowledge Weight training Bodybuilding Human height Growth hormone Atkins Nutritional Approach Growth hormone treatment Weightlifting Diabetes mellitus Nutrition Glycemic index Tocopherol Obesity Insulin Growth hormone deficiency Genetically modified food Dieting Insulin resistance Clinical depression Folic acid Glucokinase Milk Low-carbohydrate diet Hydrogen economy Equine conformation Hypoglycemia Omega-3 fatty acid Black hole Cancer South Beach diet Anorexia nervosa Wood Binge eating disorder Bench press Vitamin C Powerlifting Carpal tunnel syndrome Prostate cancer Coeliac disease Alzheimer's disease P-38 Lightning Polycystic ovary syndrome Hormone Coronary heart disease Veganism Acromegaly Crohn's disease Anabolic steroid Calorie restriction Raw food diet Osteoarthritis Nuclear weapon design Space elevator Escape velocity Hyperglycemia Normal distribution Super Size Me Anxiety Cystic fibrosis Diabetes mellitus type 2 Hypertension Intensive insulinotherapy Clean and jerk Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Chair GunZ The Duel Terri Schiavo Rickets Chlorpromazine Car handling Glycogen storage disease type I Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Retinol Exercise Bretton Woods system Repetition Anchor Acne Agriculture The Contender (television series) M4 Sherman Muscle Louis Cyr Case-control Specific impulse Bicycle frame Breastfeeding Insulin-like growth factor Balassa-Samuelson effect Denver Nuggets Asian financial crisis Atherosclerosis Long-term potentiation Nuclear fission Senescence Panic attack Cloud Malnutrition M16 (rifle) Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Stomach cancer
