any tips on doing weights hello i was hoping to get some tips on on doing weights especially on bench press i am very small only pounds i usually do reps of pounds but they tire me out i don't see how a person bench press for minutes to a hour should i bench less weight or do pounds then do less so i can do more reps they don t just bench press for min they lift in other ways as well try this use a weight that you can only bench press times that s your first set then add more pounds do reps then add more pounds and do reps then take off pounds and do reps now move on to a different station and do the same do this times per week and you will notice significant results in weeks Weight training Dialysis Aerial (dance move) Powerlifting Cleveland Browns Bench press Mercury Atlas 6 Weightlifting STS-105 Skateboarding trick Chevrolet Corvair Handloading Beltway sniper attacks Internal ballistics Boeing X-43 Concorde Boxing Anchor Battlebots Space Shuttle program Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Roller coaster Roy Jones Jr. Equation of time Dieting Mountain bike Imagism Year Agar plate Dodge Charger Tip Mixed martial arts Horsepower Elevator The Contender (television series) Cooking weights and measures United States House of Representatives Blue Whale M60 machine gun Rosa Parks Gas metal arc welding Car handling M16 (rifle) Terri Schiavo Tide U.S. Senate election, 2004 M240 Force B-47 Stratojet Tire C-5 Galaxy Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?
