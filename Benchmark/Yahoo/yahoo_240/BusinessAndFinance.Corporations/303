how does one go about starting a trading standards case how does one go about starting a trading standards case or claim or file or what have you the uk rental server company reg advertise their dedicated servers as having instant activation but the thing is it's almost never instant for anyone and can actually take up to three days nowhere in the small print does it say sometimes 'instant' activation isn't actually instant or whatever and so i wondered how to sort this out once and for all basically a case like this would fall under the control of misleading advertising regulations basically speaking these state that advertising must be accurate and must not mislead companies must adhear to these regulations you can complain to the advertising standards authority but they will only usually look into matters if there is evidence of a large amount of consumer detriment i e many complaints showing evidence of big companies doing wrong and then will only aim to correct the advertising or punish the company they have no powers to help you personally trading standards services tss have the same powers as the asa but on a local level ie they can work towards correcting the advertising of or punishing smaller local companies however they can also help consumers obtain redress your best bet would be to find contact details of your local tss via the trading standards website http www tradingstandards gov uk and simply give your local branch a call they will advise and help you on what to do to obtain redress refund or whatever you're after however most likely the number given on the website i just gave will put you through to consumer direct cd instead of your local tss this is a new government help line which should be able to advise you on your rights and tell you what you need to do to obtain redress and the goverment would rather you call them first so have made some trading standards phone numbers connect to that instead cd can be pretty helpful so try it out first but if you find cd unsatisfactory contact your local tss direct by finding the 'real' phone number from or from the website of the tss the link above provides you Appeal Internet fraud MSN Messenger Phishing Trademark Theory of conduct Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act ISO 9000 Public domain Spyware SCO-Linux controversies Tesco Telephone tapping World Wide Web Data retention Instant messaging First Amendment to the United States Constitution Apple Computer Voice over IP AOL Instant Messenger Killian documents Public policy Legal research Mach kernel United States Bill of Rights America Online Web crawler Server Gmail Neopets E-mail spam Gross domestic product United Kingdom corporation tax Internet Credit repair Whois Microeconomics Poker jargon United States Postal Service IP Multimedia Subsystem RISC Warez Trade union Pretty Good Privacy Windows 2000 Proxy server Quake III Arena Juris Doctor Inflation Uniform Resource Locator Law of the People's Republic of China Transmission Control Protocol Broadband Internet access Telephone exchange Federal government of the United States Capitalism Best Buy Alcoholics Anonymous Cable television HyperText Transfer Protocol Skype Intellectual property Stopping e-mail abuse Freedom of speech CPU design Constitution Domain name Embedded system Slander and libel Corporation X Window System Administrative law of the United States Password Government of India Privacy Copy protection Vivian Solon Private branch exchange Eircom Windows Server 2003 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines London Congestion Charge Royal Assent Redundant array of independent disks Wikipedia Wi-Fi Spam (electronic) Common criticisms of Microsoft ELO rating system Intelligent design movement
