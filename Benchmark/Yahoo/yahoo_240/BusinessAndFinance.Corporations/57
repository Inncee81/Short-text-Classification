if a corporation goes bankrupt does this effect the board members or owners will this effect the board members or owner if only one owner of the corporation as far as being liable for the debt i've been lucky enough to actually be a part owner of a s corp that we put into bankruptcy you need to know a few things a did you personally guarentee any lines of credit made to your company this is obvious if you personally guarenteed a loan line of credit lease or other debt you are liable someone will probably come after you b did you keep clear and distinct boundries between your person and your company some of the legal challenges that can be made involve if you wrote personal checks to cover business expenses directly paid home depot for the sander your company needed or if your business only exists to create a legal shield ie there was never really a business you have no business cards no office no legitimate records etc c how much does anyone really care that you are filing bankruptcy how big are your debts are they worth legally fighting over when we filed we owed roughly k to the sba k to the landlord and atleast a dozen vendors over k not one of them showed up to our bankruptcy hearing however we signed the sba note personally made a personal guarantee for the debt so we all had to file personal bankruptcy too what fun a corporation creates a legal shield between the corporate entity and the owners board members however that legal shield can be and has been broken depending on the three things above i'm not a lawyer those were the things we all discussed in our little bankruptcy there may be other things to look out for if your a small business and didn't sign personal guarentees on debt then more than likely no one is even going to attempt to come after you we flat left some people high and dry i don't like it i didn't want to do it but there was nothing i could have done more than what i did in the end though legally no one challenged our corporate bankruptcy nor our personal bankruptcies Bankruptcy Small business Corporation Debt Enron Corporation Insurance Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Incorporation (business) Bank Liability Insolvency SCO-Linux controversies Sears Holdings Corporation United Kingdom corporation tax Bank fraud Donald Trump Bankruptcy in the United States Contract Government debt Interest Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code Mortgage Lloyd's of London Legal fiction Student loan Life insurance Limited liability company Pretty Good Privacy FairTax Economy of Nigeria Mergers and acquisitions United States Postal Service Financial services Vince McMahon Software patent debate Poker jargon Law firm Appeal Public domain Money Allodial title Trademark Corporate personhood Tom DeLay Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Corporate governance Capitalism Tort reform Credit score Taxation in the United States Conflict of interest Barrister Tax Capital accumulation Commodore International Debt bondage Timeline of the Enron scandal Microsoft Bulk vending Leasing Intellectual property Wal-Mart Northwest Airlines MCI Microeconomics Stakeholder Digital rights management Natural monopoly Finance Greyhound Lines U.S. public debt Surveillance Unlawful combatant Dot-com Copyleft Construction Union Pacific Railroad New York Central Railroad Canadian National Railway Treaty Personal finance Surplus value Housing cooperative Lionel, LLC Gold standard Plame affair Lawyer History of the United States (1865-1918) Fractional-reserve banking Deflation (economics)
