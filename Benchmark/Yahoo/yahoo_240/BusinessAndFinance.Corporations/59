amazon com who knows where to get free amazon com gift cards certificates those free amazon gift card are really just a big pyramid scam i got this from scambusters let's get going with today's article can you really get free designer handbags and other valuable prizes let's begin with a story we recently spoke to a friend we'll call emily who complained about how many times she'd received an email promising a free designer handbag worth hundreds of dollars but she had always passed up the offer emily said she thought it sounded too good to be true after all she asked who wouldn't want a handbag from designers like fendi gucci marc jacobs and coach free we advised emily not to do what she wound up doing but against our strong advice and her better judgment emily decided to see what would happen if she followed through emily said she'd report her results so that if it was a scam like we predicted at least our subscribers could benefit from her mistake please don't try this at home you'll see why as we share her story just because they say it's free doesn't mean it is here's what happened emily visited the link in the email and was brought to a website where she was offered the choice of a fendi bag a marc jacobs bag a gucci bag or a coach bag the values of these bags ranged from seven hundred dollars to seventeen hundred dollars the website asked emily to select the bag she wanted and to provide them with her email address she thought doesn't sound like too much to ask for considering the reward being offered right she thought that if her email address really was the only thing they wanted from her it may have indeed been a good deal however emily dug a bit further and found out what that bag would really cost her get ready for spam just for the fun of it emily thought she'd check out the website's privacy policy before actually giving them her email address or any other information it's a good thing she did it seems that the companies that offer these types of promotions don't keep your information confidential in fact the privacy policy states outright they'll share your information with third parties to translate this into layman's terms it means your information will be available for sale to almost any party wishing to purchase it if you do provide your email address to one of these websites get ready for a boatload of spaham in your inbox and if you think opting out of the mailing list will save you frustration you're wrong the privacy policy of this site also stated that while opting out will discontinue emails from the actual website it won't discontinue emails from the companies who bought your information from the site fortunately emily followed our advice from previous issues of scambusters here she used a throw away email address and that is exactly what she had to do with that email address but there's more if you think a designer bag is worth selling your information to strangers especially using a throw away email address there's a lot more you need to know about these offers to actually get the prize you're being promised you have to complete a survey the survey asks for your name address and phone number and then bombards you with dozens of online offers and asks you to check a box indicating whether or not you're interested in each offer displayed emily said that getting through the twenty minute bombardment of offers was bad enough then she found out that she had to complete a total of ten separate offers to qualify for the bag accepting these offers would involve getting phone calls or paying money it was becoming clear that this bag was not going to be free at all take it a step further let's assume you didn't mind your inbox being spahammed or your information being sold and there were actually ten offers you wanted to accept you'd get your bag right wrong not only do you have to complete ten offers you have to refer five people from separate households to the site and all five of those people also have to accept ten offers now let's say each of the five people you refer actually complete ten offers then you get your bag right no not yet those five people each have to refer five more people then you qualify for the bag what are the chances of that happening probably almost none so who's getting the prize these not so free offer sites don't always offer free designer handbags some offer gift certificates to stores others offer gift certificates to restaurants some offer laptop computers and others offer video game systems the prizes change but the end result remains the same when most people visit one of these sites they enter their information accept a few offers and then realize there is no possible way they are going to actually get the prize at that point they exit the site the companies that run these websites count on people leaving the site in the middle of the process that way they don't have to give you the prize the company now has your personal information and will sell it to third parties for a profit the company has also profited from the few offers you did complete a waste of time at best here's emily's conclusion the website owner now has a bundle of cash at your expense and you have absolutely nothing in fact you've just wasted a bunch of your time the average person spends at least twenty minutes at one of these sites before they realize the direction in which things are going and that they will never get the prize one more thing some of these sites are even worse than we just described even if you miraculously managed to jump over all the hurdles to get your prize you still wouldn't receive it since some of these sites are outright scams and there is no way to know beforehand so do yourself a favor avoid spaham and websites that offer free designer handbags or other valuable prizes and no emily never got her free designer handbag hope this help Microeconomics Surveillance RuneScape cheats Make money fast Credit
