how can i reduce the number of meetings for my group at work at work there are meetings all the time i am looking for your good ideas on how i can reduce the number of meetings and their length the stand up is a good idea but i know there must be others that have been effective require an agenda for each meeting in advance establish and communicate clear objectives for each meeting in this way any meeting must have a justification and an agenda so that superfluous ones do not get commissioned as they will not pass the screening process assign followup items tasks responsibilities at the end and require that a subsequent related meeting cannot begin until all action items from the previous meeting are resolved start the meeting on time no matter what companies tend to never start on time which takes it toll in the long run if someone is presenting let them present but make sure they finish too many times people schedule follow on meetings because they have too much extraneous information to present usually presentations from marketing set a limit of an acceptable number of meetings per day anything more than your threshold will need to take place another day Consensus decision-making Extreme Programming Supply and demand Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Intellectual property ITV CPU design United Kingdom corporation tax RISC Canadian Senate Surveillance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Royal Assent Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe Single Transferable Vote Causality United States House of Representatives Probation officer Compiler optimization Microeconomics Rational Unified Process Quicksort Customer relationship management Kyoto Protocol Corporate governance Intelligent design Test plan Plame affair Expert system Mouse (computing) Requirements analysis Product Lifecycle Management Philosophy of mathematics Anarchism and society Speed of light Parliament of the United Kingdom Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game Peer review Enlargement of the European Union National Football League Simon Commission Politics of Russia Appeal Hash table International law and the Arab-Israeli conflict Cyprus dispute Contract bridge Action potential Graduate school British House of Commons Domain Name System Mach kernel Contract Information Technology Infrastructure Library CPU cache Cultural Revolution European Commission Industrial engineering Salary cap Council of the European Union Resident Evil 4 Instant-runoff voting Scientology beliefs and practices Computer Dynamic Systems Development Method Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Food and Drug Administration The Amazing Race Data clustering Black hole Quantum mechanics James K.
