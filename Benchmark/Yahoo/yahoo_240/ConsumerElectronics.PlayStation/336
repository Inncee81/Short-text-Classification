damnit i cant decide weather to get resistance fall of man or rainbow six vegas the problem is theyre very different types of games and i want them both but dont say get both cause i dont have enough money cause im buying the ps and i need to decide between rainbow six vegas and resistance its hard cause resistance is insane action s blowin up in awsome and rainbow six is almost just as intense but its all realistic and squad based which is also awsome and rainbow six has like campaign online and ist hunt which is great and resistance only has campaign and online but resistance can be played with a friend i cant decide help rainbow six vegas can also be played with a friend and both games have campaign and in fact both games are similar in every way except for a few small things in both games you can customize a character only for online play of course but vegas has more customization options like armor weapons and scopes resistance is slightly easier since it doesnt require as much teamwork and tactical strategies as vegas resistance online has ranks you can unlock for your character and vegas has but it takes much longer to rank up in vegas than in resistance all in all they are both great games but your choice depends on what type of game you want more at the moment Counter-Strike Star Wars: Galaxies Computer role-playing game Blackjack Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Lockdown First-person shooter Poker jargon Advance Wars: Dual Strike Diablo II: Lord of Destruction SOCOM II: U.S. Navy SEALs Battlefield 2 Fuzion Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Tri-Stat dX Guild Wars Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Star Trek Customizable Card Game Advanced Squad Leader MS-06 Zaku II Single Transferable Vote Diablo II Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Mario Kart: Double Dash!!
