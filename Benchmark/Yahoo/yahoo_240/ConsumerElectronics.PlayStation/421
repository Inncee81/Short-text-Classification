guiter hero ii issues on old ps i have an initial release ps it was repaired once for lens allignment but is still pretty much all old parts and firmware it's a little slow to recognize the game discs but it works fine otherwise so i finally got guitar hero ii and tried to play it but the game wouldn't load it started up the disc the generic playstation logo appears on the screen and then the screen goes to black like it's about to start to load the menu but then stays black i let it sit for several minutes and it never loaded i tried the game on a friend's ps and it works just fine is this an issue of my ps being broken in some way or do other people have issues with getting the game to work on old systems the old system has a small hardwar different then those released as a third fourth shipment this causes certain newer games to not work happened to me with a few games so i took it to the store i bought it from and they said its not broken just wont play the discs had to trade it in for a new one so hopefully you have a easily fixable problem on yours but if not then that means it just wont play because its missing something PlayStation 2 PlayStation Portable IBM PC compatible DVD Sega Dreamcast Sega Saturn Super Nintendo Entertainment System IPod Modchip Nintendo 64 Regional lockout Atari 8-bit family Final Fantasy Pump It Up Nintendo DS ZX Spectrum Final Fantasy VIII Chrono Trigger Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Nintendo GameCube Windows XP Nintendo Pok__mon Ruby and Sapphire Console game RISC PlayStation 3 Gradius Final Fantasy IX Game Boy Final Fantasy VI Xbox 360 Resident Evil (video game) Windows 2000 Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 2 Laserdisc Computer and video games CPU cache In The Groove (game) SOCOM II: U.S. Navy SEALs System/34 Commodore 64 Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Copy protection Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Sony Computer Entertainment Gramophone record Booting Nine Inch Nails System 7 (Macintosh) PlayStation 2 Expansion Bay Embedded system BIOS Nintendo Revolution Floppy disk Computer role-playing game Final Fantasy (video game) Steam (content delivery) DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Handheld game console Super Audio CD Apple IIGS Amstrad CPC Debugging X Window System Sega Game Gear Konami Code Mouse (computing) DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution 6thMIX NeXT DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution Dance Dance Revolution 5thMIX The Legend of Zelda series Fischer Random Chess Universal Media Disc Tower of Hanoi AmigaOS Dance Dance Revolution 3rdMIX Console wars Beatmania IIDX Sega CD Final V.U. 1971-1973 PlayStation (original) File Allocation Table Apple Macintosh System/36 Nintendo Entertainment System Black Sabbath Microprogram Pok__mon Chronicles DualDisc Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles Extreme Programming Homebrew (video games) Dance Dance Revolution (1stMIX) Digital photography Poker jargon Oscilloscope Blu-ray Disc
