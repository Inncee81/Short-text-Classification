i want to buy a big tv for my husband he wants to watch movies and play ps please help plasmas do not burn in sorry i had to put that in capitals but that was a problem several years ago and is a non issue now many store employees say this and people believe them a little research will prove that false the only real questions that you have are lcd v plasma and the size for gaming i would reccomend plasma as it has better contrast and has faster refresh rates than lcds however plasmas do require more care than lcds lcds also deal with ambient lighting better so they will appear better in brightly lit areas while plasmas will look better than lcds when there is little or no ambient lighting if you and or your husband are willing to put the time into avoiding burn in and you tv is not in a place where is is likely ot be harmed then go with a plasma if you will have kids abusing the tv or would set up the tv where there would be alot of ambient lighting and don't mind the picture being less clear while moving then go with an lcd overall i would reccomend plasma but it will really depend on your situation as for the size it sounds like you will be going a minimun of inches so it would be best to have p support as it starts making a real difference as you go above in but you can't really tell the difference if you go less than in if you decide to go with a plasma it will be harder to find p sets but they exist even if you don't find them in your local store also use an hdmi cable if possible vga works but if you are going to go big hdmi is worth it good luck and enjoy the world of high definition Liquid crystal display Plasma display Television Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting DVD Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Plasma (physics) Digital photography Items in the Metroid series Cathode ray tube Spacecraft propulsion Divorce CPU cache High-definition television IBM PC compatible Nuclear fusion Hypoglycemia Theory of conduct The nature of God in Western theology Criticism of libertarianism TFT LCD C programming language 1080p RISC Langmuir probe Pixel Jet engine Surveillance Gameking Game Boy Advance Windows XP Fusion power Movie projector Password Alcoholics Anonymous Scientology beliefs and practices Estoppel Game Boy Cable television 3dfx Betting (poker) Quark-gluon plasma American individualist anarchism Quake III Arena Sega Dreamcast Poker jargon Domestic violence Directed-energy weapon Infantilism Laptop Redundant array of independent disks Sun Stereoscopy Doom 3 Plasma cosmology IMac Wood Science Light pollution Oscilloscope Sea-Monkey Color MAME Loudspeaker Fusor Explosive material Microeconomics Commodore International Aspartame Cheating in Counter-Strike Psychology Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism M16 (rifle) Decompression sickness Hash table Solar power Big Bang Philosophy of space and time Project Orion Money Vacuum Halting problem Black hole Labor theory of value Wealth Social rule Laser MP3 Causality Lebesgue integration Cheating in poker Compiler optimization Child pornography Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004
