resistance fall of man online tips i get killed alot on resistance and i want to be able to dodge bullets like other i do it but i still cant dodge it like them how do they move so fast and i know the hitting me with headshots because i die so fast is there anyway i can get headsots like them easily i do pretty well online for myself what i like to do while still being fair is as soon as i'm hit i duck or jump and scurry behind something if possible then you may be down some health but atleast then you have a chance and if you have good aim and go for the head you may kill them the other thing is when you are a human tapping r twice sometimes will allow you to run depending the weapon your using the only problem is that you lose the crosshairs and your first few shots when you shoot will not be very accurate what i find is the most helpful when playing online is aim if you have good aim you will be able to take the guy down before he can get you most of the time nothing screams aim like shooting someone in the head i hope it helps and if you want to play me give me a shout on the ps network my psn id is ironmantrunx good luck Quake III Arena GunZ The Duel Fast bowling Unreal Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Unreal Tournament 2004 GunBound Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Stopping power Sniper Blood (computer game) Volleyball Jean Charles de Menezes Tribes 2 SOCOM II: U.S. Navy SEALs Hitman (computer game) Halo 2 Escape from New York Perfect Dark Doom enemies Terminal ballistics Natural Selection (computer game) Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Internal ballistics Lightsaber combat Aerial (dance move) Star Wars: Battlefront John F.
