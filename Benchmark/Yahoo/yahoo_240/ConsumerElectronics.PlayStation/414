i just got a jabra bluetooth headset for my ps the device has been paired and the system finds the device however when i go into an online game the headset isn't working and the icons don't even show that i have the headset what am i missing well like most headsets it should have the talk or call button somewhere on the surface when you put in a game in the ps it will unsynch so usually when i enter a lobby i'll press the call button so it synchs back up again in a game like resistance fall of man the headset will be active even when not in a game but on something like motorstorm every time you exit a game it'll turn off depends on the game Bluetooth Mouse (computing) Xbox 360 Headphones Xbox Ecco the Dolphin Conker's Bad Fur Day Danger Hiptop Phantasy Star Online Poker jargon Nintendo DS PlayStation 2 Pump It Up Windows XP Nintendo GameCube Nintendo Revolution Handheld game console Gizmondo Computer and video games Aerial (dance move) BlackBerry Videoconferencing AmigaOS Hello world program Killer application Game Boy Nintendo Entertainment System Missingno.
