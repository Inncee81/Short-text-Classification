how is ghost recon on ps i had read bad reviews for the game is it that bad how wld u rate it i thoroughly disliked it for one thing they don't show your weapon or hand when you play it's just a crosshair at the center of the screen i was really bothered by that i don't see why they dropped it it takes a lot of the realism out of the game i also didn't really like the gameplay they give away enemy positions so you don't need to proceed slowly or carefully it kind of ruins it Cheating in Counter-Strike Quake III Arena Counter-Strike Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon 2 Bubble Bobble Sniper First-person shooter America's Army Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Punisher Advance Wars: Dual Strike Resident Evil 4 Halo: Combat Evolved Terran (StarCraft) Fable (video game) Starsiege: Tribes Theory of conduct Guilty Gear Star Wars: Battlefront II Terra Nova: Strike Force Centauri Gameplay of StarCraft Super Mario 64 Paul W.
