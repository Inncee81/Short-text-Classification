what's better x box or ps this is a great debate question to ask and depends on any persons interest or fanboyism you'll get alot of bias and great answers you won't go wrong with either choice the is a great system with alot of great games and excellent online service the ps is a monster hardware system with great pontential and great comming titles let me give say the cons and pros for each system so it can be easy for you to decide cons reliability issue it's hard to buy a system knowing that if it will die on you any day online servise the only con about this is that you pay for it the drive and disk compacity even though there have been great games so far on fitting in a dvd there will be a issue for space in the future the entire cost to enjoy hidef the is a great console for its price but if it can call it self next gen you can't pay for add ons like hd drive wifi and rechargable batteries in a controller ps the cost the ps is great console but to expect the mass market to pay around to dollars for a system is kind of arrogant even though you get more for what you expect from a in terms of hi def but again for a family who walks into a store and see two systems in a prices of and the choice is made clear the games for charging around you want games and the games that are out now doesnt justify that cost the development for being that powerful i heard from many game sites that's hard to develop for online ability for having online ability compare to there is no choice there pros online servise even though you pay for it the online service is great the games there are alot of great games for it and comming soon with halo and assasin creed the choice of hi def you can only pay to just enjoy the games without the cost of adding more reliability to be said the reliablity goes to question but to hear that the warranty is made to years can give comfort many of those ps blue ray to pay only for a game system with the future of blue ray is a good price capacity even though dvds are being used to make great next gen titles sooner or later the space will be needed and blue ray will be there choice the games the pontential of games comming out for the ps is awsome killzone and haze is just a couple of games i'm waiting for and more and more are comming as with game programmers are handling the ps more better online service free even thought the service isn't as great as is free and with updated constanly it someday can compare with there competition so for now the is better for my choice but with the ps and it's great games comming i can probably change my mind i'm no fanboy and i do have all three systems but i prefer the a little more than my ps Xbox 360 Xbox PlayStation 3 Computer and video games IBM PC compatible Redundant array of independent disks Microeconomics Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Sega Saturn IPod Bicycle lighting Nintendo GameCube Nintendo PlayStation Portable MAME Embedded system CPU cache Nintendo 64 Inflation Energy development Console wars MMORPG Mainframe computer Atari ST Floppy disk MP3 CPU design Halo: Combat Evolved Windows XP Sega Atari 2600 Poker jargon Commodore International Capitalism Halo (video game series) Virtual memory TiVo Hard disk Atari 8-bit family Mach kernel Video game music Microsoft RISC Intellivision Computer Economics ATI Technologies Sega Dreamcast ZX Spectrum Software engineering Linux Nintendo Revolution Computer virus Video game crash of 1983 Expert system Copy protection Game programmer ITunes Music Store Battery electric vehicle Electronic commerce Apple Computer Voice over IP Halo 2 Blu-ray Disc PC Engine Abortion debate Commodore 64 System/36 Enterprise content management Supply and demand Dot-com Counter-Strike Amstrad CPC FairTax Labor theory of value Apple II family The Sims Laptop Laserdisc Cable television Extreme Programming Machinima Electronic Arts Tax Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Central processing unit GamePark Vacuum tube USB flash drive Law of value
