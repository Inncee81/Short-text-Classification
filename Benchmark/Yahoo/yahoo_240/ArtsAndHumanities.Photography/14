glass photo what a difference a day makes i shot a quick example of how someone could take a suitable photo for ebay last night i didn't want to move stuff around and so i got a fair result i decided that i couldn't let it stand and say just take my word for it so i moved some stuff out of my way to gain the lighting angle that i prefer and recommended to our asker lit from behind http www flickr com photos samfeinstein lit from the front http www flickr com photos samfeinstein in fact once you are on the first photo just click on the other cream pitcher in my photostream and you can swap quickly as i said under the photo it's not quite catalog material yet but it's an improvement it's just a point and shoot camera too like anyone might already own the only special equipment needed is a tripod since you would be using the self timer and a light weight point and shoot camera you don't even need to spend and up on a tripod just a tripod would be fine antoni you should see my rolled horizon it's just a jacket turned inside out so the lining shows and it's hanging on top of a box thanks though ebay photography has taught me a lot of quick and dirty tricks thanks teef here i'm thinking that anyone could set up and take this shot and you say something nice terisu check me out http www flickr com photos samfeinstein if you ever need to shot a ring again goes to show the old adage it's not the camera so much as the photographer that is a really really nice effect i suspect that a magazine on a budget would be quire prepared to use that shot personally i prefer the realism of some sort of shadowing rather than a complete white box approach i also suspect that some of the nice highlights in your shot could not have been achieved with a white box solution well done thanks for sharing Photography View camera War of the Worlds (2005 film) Butterfly Volleyball Stereoscopy Macro photography Mouse (computing) Parallax Street photography Wrigley Field Photographic film Futurama (TV series - season 5) Skateboarding trick Henri Cartier-Bresson Black hole Konica Minolta Diablo II: Lord of Destruction M16 (rifle) Roxette Drawing London Fast bowling Dragon Booster Canon T90 Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February GunBound Cliff Richard Second Battle of the Atlantic The Contender (television series) Screw Surveillance B-47 Stratojet Amateur astronomy Cascading Style Sheets Kasparov versus The World STS-61 Coffee Sundial Warez Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Live 8 Snooker Mojave people Flickr Leica Characters in the Smurfs Shen Gong Wu Care Bears Machine gun StarCraft: Uprising IMAX Camera Combat Mission (computer game series) Shadow the Hedgehog (video game) Blood on the Tracks The Inside GunZ The Duel The Apprentice 2 Beatles for Sale Topps Armored Core Professional wrestling throws Tripod (photography) Ty Cobb November (film) Softball Film Apollo moon landing hoax accusations Mozilla Firefox Depth of field Whose Line Is It Anyway?
