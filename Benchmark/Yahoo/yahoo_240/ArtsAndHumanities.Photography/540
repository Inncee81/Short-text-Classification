how much should i charge an old friend for the digital file of a photograph i'm starting a photography business an old friend wants some photos of her band and for me to design the album cover i thought about giving her the digital files so she can have them for whatever else how much should i charge for everything or give me a price for the digital files of the photos yes will be high resolution your photographs have worth if your friend wants to use them for her cd cover the idea posed by others to do it for free is in my opinion bad business and bad for the friendship is your friend giving the cd away for free i doubt it so why should you give your work away for free with that said you should charge an hourly rate for designing her cd cover and a usage fee based on how many cd's she is going to produce for the actual image personally i wouldn't give her the high resolution shots for other uses unless she paid for that as well what you charge though should be based on the uniqueness of the image and what the market is willing to pay for bands that don't earn a lot of money i don't go overboard on my fees i do though take into account how much they are going to sell the cd for and base my usage fee on a percentage of the first run using cd's as a starting point if they do a first run of less then cd's i still use the run point and will give them the license to cover that amount if they do future runs over then the band will owe additional usage but it is still based on the initial percentage keep in mind that due to anti trust laws i nor should anyone else give you actual rates in such a public forum it gives the idea of price fixing which is against the law charge what you feel comfortable charging and by all means don't give your work away if you are serious about photography and want to be a professional then be one and charge for your work if you charge pennies then you are telling others that your work is worth pennies you should go to the asmp website for help on writing your terms and conditions http asmp org commerce legal terms conditions back php they also have info on model releases here http asmp org commerce legal releases and a copyright tutorial here http asmp org commerce legal copyright you might want to also consider joining asmp's pro advice forum on yahoo it is open to members and non members and dedicated to helping emerging professional photographers you can join by going here http tech groups yahoo com group asmpproadvice keep in mind that they too won't give you actual pricing info but you can respond or call someone directly if you have a specific question hope that helps and by all means do not give your work away Copyright Digital photography Copyleft SCO-Linux controversies Intellectual property Taxation in the United States GNU General Public License Apple Computer Photography Microeconomics BitTorrent Tax Public domain Mutual fund Mortgage Credit card Bond Open access Microsoft Inflation Fair use SCO v.
