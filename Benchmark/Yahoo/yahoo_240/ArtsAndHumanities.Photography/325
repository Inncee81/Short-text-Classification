for all photogs at the bequest of antoni everyone has a favorite shot not just because it turned out great but because it took an inordinate amount of work to get or maybe it was just plain luck irregardless it sticks out in your mind how did you get your favorite shot luck skill tenacity you know i'm not sure i have a favorite shot looking back over my adult life i've been shooting seriously for almost years my volume can't match yours but there are thousands of shots to consider also i virtually always took pictures because i wanted to and not because i was sent on an assignment even at family functions if i wasn't in the mood i just left my camera home i am sure that for most of you it will be different when you do this all day every day for a living your whole approach is different from mine trust me i can relate this to my practice of dentistry more than you know all three factors come into play there in ways that would be too boring to discuss you win some you lose some well if i lose one i get the chance to improve it by doing it over haha asking what my favorite shot is would be about the same as asking what my favorite song is ask me today and i'll readily give you an answer but in the same breath i will name or close contenders ask me tomorrow and you'll get or different songs there are some that come to mind though and land on the short list of my personal favorites you know what i'd say that all three factors were important in each one first you have to have some degree of luck to happen upon a scene that is worth photographing one of my favorites that has been catagorized as a topten shot is a brilliant sunset i forget the year right off but it was about i was driving out to my girlfriend's house which was about miles from home i don't remember what we had planned but i told her that i had to go back home to get my camera so i could take a picture of the sunset if i had left home minutes earlier i would not have seen the sunset developing the way it was if i had left home minutes later i would have missed the whole show secondly having some degree of skill really increases the odds that the shot of a lifetime will translate the way you wanted it to i thought of that sunset shot first so i'll act as if it's my favorite as always i was loaded with transparency film probably consumer grade ektachrome i had not discovered epr yet still a stop or two will make or break an image i never used filters other than occasionally using a polarizer so this is the scene as it presented i admit that this one is pretty easy to meter but let's say there was at least some skill involved most of my other favorite shots can be described similarly i had to be lucky to arrive on the scene when i did and i had to have my photographer's eye since this is for antoni with me or i would not have had the skill to convert what i saw into a picture in the first place knowing what can be accomplished makes you view a scene or subject through skilled eyes in a way that a lack of skill would not allow tenacity is rarely a factor for me as i don't do this for a living if i don't get what i want i move on this was especially true in my pre digital days if i was shooting penny a shot plus x i could go out the next day and try again but there was usually a week or so lag between the time i took a picture and the time i saw the result on film there just wasn't opportunity to go back and fix it in the studio or on assignment you guys might be forced to stick to it until you get it right it's a far far cry from that but my recent series on the crystal pitcher makes me appreciate that i have at least one more in the series waiting for a time when i can set things up differently so i can do it again it has now gone somewhat beyond the original intent of making a picture that was okay for ebay i've got to get ready for the real world work so i will end for now maybe that will be it for my discourse and maybe not since i spoke about one shot let me show you a small scan of the print that was made from the slide well over years ago it has held up pretty well i did not go over the scan at all for dust etc so i will down rez to dpi when i get the time i will replace this with a larger version if you are curious about the unadulterated sunset go to http www flickr com photos samfeinstein and check it out part of the luck in this shot is the small light on the horizon it is just a regular street light i could clone this catch light out but i kind of like it better with the light there Digital photography Photography Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Time Out of Mind Milton H.
