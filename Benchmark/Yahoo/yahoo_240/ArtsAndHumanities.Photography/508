what to do iam confused i have a digital camera the confusion is whether to keep it on or switch it off when you have gaps between each shot say for example iam in a museum i find something interesting i shoot a picture but iam not really sure how soon i will take the next picture i switch it off to save power but have to keep switching it on is this the right way or i just leave it on you can adjust your settings so that if you don't take a picture for a minute or so it goes into power saver mode Mouse (computing) The Cure Digital photography PlayStation Portable Television Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Oscilloscope Secure Digital card Depth of field Kirby's Adventure Transistor Digital cinema Stereoscopy Digital circuit Movie projector Digital cinematography Widescreen Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Digital camera Digital Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Pixel Electronic amplifier Panavision Bluetooth 8 mm video format Canon T90 STS-61 Super Mario Bros.
