photography techniques how to capture a shot of the sun i am new to photography and i would like to know how to shot a picture of say the setting sun my manual says do not shot a picture of the sun or look at the sun through the lens but i see photos of the rising or setting sun how to do this without photo shop can i use filters or what thanks p s i use a sony cyber shot dsc h you need a filter like a neutral density graduate to properly expose both the sky as well as the ground the camera can only expose for one or the other unaided the nd graduate filter has a grey coating that graduates from dark to light and serves to stop down the brightness of the sun and sky in order for everything else to be properly exposed the dark end of the filter would be used for the sky the clear end for the ground without a filter of this nature when you expose for the sky the ground will be under exposed and without detail when you expose for the ground the sun and sky will be over exposed and blown out despite the fact that the model of your camera will not accept a standard threaded style filter there are alternatives you'll have either research any accessories that may be available for use in this situation or improvise just get a nd graduate slot type square from wolfcamera cost around and simply hold it in front of the lens of your camera while it is attached to a tripod a must for this type of shot due to the slower shutter speed either way filters are the way to go also as the user manual suggests never point the camera directly at the sun without a filter as it will damage the live preview ccd image sensor Photography Digital photography Digital camera View camera Stereoscopy Charge-coupled device Leica Camera Sun Panoramic photography Photographic film Floppy disk Camcorder Shutter speed Solar eclipse Digital single-lens reflex cameras Canon T90 Time-lapse Technicolor Amateur astronomy Macro photography Anamorphic widescreen Polarization Panavision Cinematography Konica Minolta Single-lens reflex camera Filter (optics) Parallax Canon EOS Manual transmission Exposure (photography) Filter (photography) Film speed Cassini-Huygens PlayStation Portable Depth of field Observational astronomy Stage lighting Combine (Half-Life 2) Eye Galileo spacecraft Mouse (computing) Automatic number plate recognition Eyepiece Photographic lens Hubble Space Telescope Gamma ray burst Sunglasses Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Modem Shutter (photography) Television Hard disk Apollo moon landing hoax accusations Pixel Point and shoot camera Binoculars Black hole Digital camera back Aurora (astronomy) Color Color temperature Digital cinema Oscilloscope Huygens probe Drill bit Tank Street photography Professional video camera Film Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Pinhole camera Photograph Gravity Dundas Square Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure Infrared Motor oil Rangefinder camera Neutrino Traffic light Nintendo Revolution Medium format Starfleet ranks and insignia Gamut Screw Aperture E85 NTSC Motion capture Pornography
