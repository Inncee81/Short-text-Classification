why do photographers wear black well not all of them but most of them my professor wears black almost every meeting if not black then white what's with the colour anyway to go to the last question first black is the absence of a colour as much as white is the presence of every colour there are several reasons for wearing black black clothing flatters older men by disguising some more obvious degradation of their once wonderful physique why younger men follow this trend rather than wear wonderful coloured clothing is beyond me but they do black disguises dirt and grime better than other colours so if you are working in dirty conditions it is easier to still look cool in black than it would be if you were wearing dirty white clothing roadies photographers etc find this a useful characteristic black is a better colour for blending in than other colours or white it is low contrast in many urban situations and allows the photographer to blend into the background this is particularly useful where the photographer wants to faithfully record other's actions and not be engaged as a protagonist in the events for the same reason wearing black can reduce the intrusion of the photographer into the recorded image such as those where highly reflective surfaces might reveal the photographer's presence a photographer wearing black on a black background can hide in the image black gloves balaclava and full length sleeves and trouser legs complete the ensemble at this stage one might want to be careful about being mistaken for someone with more sinister intent than mere photography Photograph Gramophone record Japanese tea ceremony Digital photography Surveillance Color Black tie Leggings Fencing Nudity Cross-dressing Photography Camouflage Policing in the United Kingdom Skirt and dress Mess dress Social aspects of clothing Snooker Sin City Grace Cossington Smith Brave New World Morning dress Academic dress of Oxford University Puppet Clothing Military uniform Color theory Aikido Doctor (Doctor Who) The Amazing Race Dragon Booster Isaac Newton's early life and achievements Traditional animation Handloading Motorcycle Infantilism Lighting Rainbow Mourning Hakama Fast bowling Kimono Paul Is Dead Skinhead The Adventures of Tintin Comanche Swimming pool Ozone depletion Photographic developer Blackadder Men in Black Trousers Grunge music White (people) Suit (clothes) G-Man (Half-Life) Colours, standards and guidons Welding The Beatles (album) The Dalek Invasion of Earth Swimming Cinematography Heavy metal fashion Stereoscopy Albedo Planet of the Apes Hazing Harrow School Human skin color Social rule Saruman Child pornography Aberration in optical systems Order of the Garter Protective clothing Photographic paper Gamut Undergarment Color blindness Holography St. John Ambulance Black Kilt GIF Beachwear K' Diamond Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Bicycle lighting Diamond enhancement Urban heat island Final Fantasy IX Igneous rock Apollo moon landing hoax accusations Sunglasses Strap-on dildo Plastic Sea Scouts (BSA) Fire fighting
