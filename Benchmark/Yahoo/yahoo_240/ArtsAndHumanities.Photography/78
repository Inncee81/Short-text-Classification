what is your opinion of my photos please check out my photos and let me know if you have any suggestions on making them better i am wanting to eventually wanting to become a photographer thank you www capturedmomentsbylinda shutterfly com www capturedmomentsbylinda shutterfly com capturedmomentsbylinda shutterfly com they have a very snapshotlike look to them to be honest you make a very common mistake but one that can be fixed easily and with some practice don't put someone's head dead center in the photo leaving a few feet of blank space above them and cutting off their feet focus on the face then recompose putting their head about up for full body shots then you will get their feet in too and not have all that wasted space okay second thing you will need to do is move your subject farther away from the fence so it will not be as obtrusive in the photos using a wide enough aperture and a slight telephoto lens that should throw the background out of focus and isolate your subject better then when you compose a shot don't put any main subject straight up and down the center line put them off center a bit for more interest think of the rule of thirds just imagine your photo divided in a tic tac toe grid and put anything important along a line in the grid or better still at an intersection of lines in the grid again focus on the face and recompose okay people there's an easy way to get to the site scroll over where she posted the url and your mouse will reveal the entire url just copy and paste what you can see and you should be able to figure out what letters are missing from the end easy peasy after the dot it's just shutterfly com http www capturedmomentsbylinda shutterfly com action View camera Tic-tac-toe Photography Eye Community card poker Digital photography Poker jargon HyperText Transfer Protocol Movie projector Equine conformation Marching band Canon EOS Tic-Tac-Dough Macro photography Photographic lens Konica Minolta Snooker Theory of conduct Aerial (dance move) Glossary of partner dance terms Apollo 8 Slashdot subculture On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Solar cell Milton H.
