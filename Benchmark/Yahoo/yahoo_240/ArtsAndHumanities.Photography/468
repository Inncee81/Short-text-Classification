income for photographers i'm thinking more of a geographical photographer and wildlife photographer depending how good you are at shooting and marketing your images will depend on your income you can starve one year and be feasting the next you can submit to a stock agency for sales but those can sometimes only dribble in as income so you can not count on that until you really make it in this area have a look at this site and check their submission guide lines and if you can match theirs you could match others http www alamy com contributors default asp every magazine on a monthly basis needs to put pictures into their journal and there are the regulars that write the articles and most of the time not always use their photos so to get yourself noticed by the editor you need to have technicaly perfect images captions need to be correct and it also helps if you add the camera information example nikon d xs mm lens th etc now if you really want to make a sale you should write an article ms manuscript of what you are submitting example how to shoot wild moose you could give the best times to go out and shoot where to find them the technical ways on how you shot these images etc etc doing the writting means the editor does not have to worry about doing anything but proofing and sending it to the press and you getting paid for it but you need to do your home work you need to know about that magazine if you can buy it at the newstands do it if not contact them for a copy see if there was a recent article about wild moose or something like it if the article is older than years you stand a good chance of making a sale this is because newer readers have not read the article and older readers need to be re freshed make sure when contacting the editor you get the right person new editor would not like this you can find out about a magazine by looking at the masthead either towards the front or back of the magazine a magazine has about a month lead time so try and get your articles to them in time for christmas summer vacation etc a good source for a lot more information is the photographers market handbook which you can find at amazon com here you will find book publishers poster companies ad agencies stock and many more p s you don't have to go to formal school to learn photography as long as you are good and you have the determination to succed hope this helps kevin Digital photography Photography Publishing Surveillance Independent Media Center Yearbook Editor Amiga Power Plame affair MAD Magazine Screenplay Annuity Panoramic photography Ajax (programming) Stock photography Photojournalism Peer review Single-lens reflex camera C plus plus Fair use View camera Nikon Corporation Apollo 8 Stereoscopy Academic publishing Domain Name System Playboy (magazine) Style guide Nintendo Power Short selling Kylie Minogue Cinematography Gray Wolf Blog Internet fraud The Standard On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Goatse.cx Leica Slashdot trolling phenomena Virginian Railway Publication of Darwin's theory Film H2G2 Mixed martial arts Newspaper Everything2 Photographic film Crossword Konica Minolta Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina HyperText Transfer Protocol Photographic lens The Guardian Media in the People's Republic of China Microeconomics FairTax Canon EOS Private Eye United Kingdom corporation tax Marvel Comics Lens (optics) Surplus value Oasis (band) Depth of field Slashdot subculture Technicolor NME Digital camera Copyright Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Apple Computer Extreme Programming Weekly newspaper Digital single-lens reflex cameras Logic Houston Chronicle Legal research Movie projector Comics Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus The New York Times Warren Buffett Topps Douglas Adams PNG The Economist DeviantART PHP Patricia Ford Rangefinder camera Bond Supply and demand Open access
