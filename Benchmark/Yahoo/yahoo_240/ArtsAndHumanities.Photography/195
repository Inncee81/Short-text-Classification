photography question please help d i'm going to start a photography club at my school and i need ideas to keep people interested but nothing that's going to cost a lot of money does anyone know how to set up a dark room easily or does anyone know of a place that might donate a camera to a school please tell me as much as you know thanks so much cameras can be really cheap old rangefinder mm cameras on ebay are only like and you can take great pictures with them and they are relatively rugged adn can take a lot of abuse which is important also they are not totally automatic so you learn to focus and to set f stop and shutter speed something every photographer should know about you can go on field trips that's relatively cheap go to an interesting old neighborhood or a park with trees and flowers afterwards have a 'show' where everyone shows or photos and perhaps everyone can sit in a circle and pass the photos around and talk about them you can go on trips to museums to look at photography exhibitions also and then hold discussions afterwards we used to do that when i was in school a dark room is pretty easy to set up especially if you have a room without windows you need a lot of stuff trays safelights chemicals developing tanks its mostly not expensive but it adds up the biggest expense will be the enlarger but i'm guessing you could find that too on ebay or craisglist since there are a lot of photographers who have 'gone digital' in the last few years and have an old enlarger in the closet gathering dust actually i really think old fashioned film based photography is on its way out i used to love printing pics in the darkroom but with digital photography it's just sooo much easier also much cheaper so instead of a darkroom you might have a couple of computers set up with gimp like photoshop but free and a photo printer it's not only faster and easier but cheaper plus the members will all have a computer at home so they can work on their photo editing skills there you might pool your money to invest in a film scanner so people can take mm pics just get the film developed then edit and print them on the computer well i could go on and on but this should be enough for a start Photography Digital photography Konica Minolta Camera Enlarger Digital single-lens reflex cameras View camera Digital camera Darkroom Stereoscopy Macro photography Computer Photograph Single-lens reflex camera Rangefinder camera Canon T90 Photographic film Street photography Image scanner Floppy disk IPhoto Adobe Photoshop Medium format Charge-coupled device Panoramic photography Exposure (photography) Pornography Henri Cartier-Bresson Bluetooth Traditional animation Screenshot Linked list Digital cinematography Movie projector Plastic Technicolor Apple Macintosh Hash table Photo manipulation Cinematography Depth of field Computer printer Photojournalism Wind turbine Shutter speed F-number Film Digital art Windows XP Color temperature Widescreen IPod Atari ST Embedded system Universal Studios Photography and photographers of the American Civil War Atari 8-bit family CPU design F-16 Fighting Falcon BASIC programming language Gamut Topps Mach kernel Cinerama Theory of conduct Time-lapse Dot matrix printer Film speed Common Unix Printing System Oscilloscope GIMP Wheel of Fortune Project Gutenberg Geographic information system Eastman Kodak Holography Panavision Contax Compact audio cassette George Lucas Hydrogen economy Instant camera Nikon Corporation Advanced Photo System Canon EOS Pixel RISC
