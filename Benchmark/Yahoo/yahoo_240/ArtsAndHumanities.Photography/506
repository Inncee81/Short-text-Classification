i have a kodak z with a telephoto lens need help i just got the x lens for the camera along with the adapter tube and without the lens it takes great pictures even at full zoom but with the lens on at full or even half zoom there seems to be a purpleish haze around things and a little bit out of focus does anyone know what is causing this uv filters are used to reduce haziness created by ultraviolet light a uv filter is mostly transparent to visible light and can be left on the lens for nearly all shots uv filters are often used for lens protection much like clear filters a strong uv filter such as a haze a or uv cuts off some visible light in the violet part of the spectrum and so has a pale yellow color these strong filters are more effective at cutting haze and can reduce purple fringing in digital cameras strong uv filters are also sometimes used for warming color photos taken in shade with daylight type film http en wikipedia org wiki photographic filter also here is a step by step link for using a kodak close up lens http www kodak com eknec pagequerier jhtml pq path pq locale en us Digital photography Cinematography Photography Ultraviolet View camera Macro photography Color Technicolor Contax Digital camera Photographic lens Panoramic photography Zoom lens Single-lens reflex camera Leica Light-emitting diode Polarization Digital camera back Anamorphic widescreen Canon EOS Color temperature Movie projector Digital single-lens reflex cameras Traffic light Color blindness Eastman Kodak Cassini-Huygens Camera Lens (optics) Lighting Film Depth of field Glass Schneider Kreuznach Rangefinder camera Fluorescent lamp Enlarger Pinhole camera Light Traditional animation Konica Minolta Filter (optics) Stage lighting Observational astronomy Sunglasses Rainbow Film speed Gamut Charge-coupled device IMAX Apollo 8 Clementine mission 35 mm film Nuclear explosion Chromatic aberration Lightsaber RGB color model Point and shoot camera Laser Shutter speed Ray tracing Uniform Resource Locator Nintendo 64 Reflecting telescope Television F-number Tank Incandescent light bulb Super 8 mm film Diamond enhancement Autostereogram Camcorder Optical coating Telescope Federal Standard 1037C Nikon Corporation Advanced Photo System Movie camera Low-pass filter Photograph Color theory Gamma ray burst Rayleigh scattering Aperture Widescreen Titan (moon) Cinerama Eyepiece Grayscale Anaglyph image Four Thirds System
