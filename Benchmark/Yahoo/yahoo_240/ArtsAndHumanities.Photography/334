photographer wages i am years old and very interested in photography i just want to know how much a photographer makes hourly or yearly also what are the different professions of photography and which is the best basically could someone let me in on being a photographer thanks if you work for a sucessful photographer as an assistant or a retoucher then you will get a wage as far as i know salary wage positions for potogs are very rear maybe a newspaper might contract you or put you on wages as someone who feeds a family out of the trade my advise is start off where most people dont want to work property is profitable but not very glamourous i see people here say do weddings or portraits seen more people go broke trying to do it than actually make money why everyone with a camera thinks of those methods and so from amateur to pros they all chase they same work and goto the same people to ask for it over and over again if you want security of wages photography is one of the last professions i would choose sorry its not a nice fluffy answer how would that help you if you want it in every pore in your body then start planning to study one of the few professions where people think its about expensive equipment and having an eye seen them go broke to so combine passion and study and you will have a good chance of sucess no passion and no knowledge of light exposure lighting then that equals going broke edit sorry missed the how much bit depends on so many factors yearly income is a combination of income less expences some years good some years not replacing equipment and insurance tax vechicles all cost money people think say an hour is good money its not for a photographer may only spend hours a week in the field charging that rate so thats a week then take out tax petrol vechicles equipment i hire stuff alot do charge to the client on top travel time best to add on the top of bill then maybe some photoshop try to make images perfect on location in the camera photoshop is down time for me theres office expenses time doing paperwork visitings accountants and the like in sales may only mean in the pocket depends where you are but an hour would be cheap where i am us i started around that level now i cam charge alot more proberly not that helpful for you for me the key was study passion and learning to make not take images marketing is really important at the start depends on the niche's developing networks of key people is the secret to a growing a name and a business thats how its been for me a Photography Microeconomics Digital photography Tax Insurance Life insurance Gross domestic product Inflation Wal-Mart Economy of India Free trade Progressive tax Capital accumulation Publicly funded medicine Economic inequality FairTax Taxation in the United States Education in the People's Republic of China Leica Adobe Photoshop United Kingdom corporation tax Parachuting Stereoscopy Supply and demand Education in the United States Social Security (United States) Credit card Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus MMORPG View camera Economy of Russia Mutual fund 401(k) Amateur astronomy Konica Minolta Labor theory of value Deflation (economics) Anarchism and capitalism Keynesian economics Paintball Tariff Capitalism Unemployment Income statement Welding Value added tax Compensation of employees Investment bank Camcorder Model (economics) Social Security debate (United States) Flat tax Graduate school Supply-side economics Economy of the United States Price discrimination National Football League Law of value Labor-power Medicare (Canada) High-definition television Income trust Telescope Economic history of Japan Citigroup Photographic film Principal-agent problem Profit Trade union Single-lens reflex camera Unemployment benefit Student loan New Deal Divorce Corporation Property tax Gas metal arc welding Extreme Programming Bank Economics Guild Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Offshoring Surveillance Nuclear power Pornography Monetary policy Panoramic photography Snooker Primerica Financial Services
