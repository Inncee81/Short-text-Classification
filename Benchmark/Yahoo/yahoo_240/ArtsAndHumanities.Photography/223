can you manually focalise with a dslr canon whilst the af mode is on since i shoot on nikons and not with canons but if this lens is like most other dslr cameras you are forcing the motor to move and you could damage the drive motor in the lens or in the camera body so i would suggest not doing this hope this helps kevin Digital single-lens reflex cameras Nikon Corporation Digital photography Canon EOS Canon EF lens mount Digital camera Camera Canon T90 Secure Digital card Canon FD Konica Minolta Nikon FE Nikon FA Single-lens reflex camera Nikon FM2 Olympus (company) Nikon FM Nikon FE2 Canon EOS-300D Canon Inc.
