what is the best way of taking pictures of really dark tunnels bunkers etc i read a few forums on the net where there are pictures taken within pitch black environments yet the photo is clear as day is this kind of photography possible with a standard digital camera or does it require an expensive slr the only way i know is to use a camera that has the facility to keep the shutter open for long periods you will also need some kind of light as it's impossible to photograph anything without light the whole point of a camera is to collect light you would also need a tripod and be taking a picture of a completely stationary object anything that moves in front of the camera while the shutter is open will appear as a blur think of those shots that show cars travelling at night and the long trails of the lights some digital cameras have this facility but they are often as expensive as slr models Single-lens reflex camera Digital photography View camera Photography Leica Konica Minolta Shutter speed Digital camera Canon T90 Digital single-lens reflex cameras Macro photography Camera Automatic number plate recognition Canon EOS Photographic film Twin-lens reflex camera Panoramic photography Stereoscopy Street photography Movie projector Rangefinder camera Photograph Photographic lens Medium format Traditional animation Shutter (photography) Exposure (photography) Time-lapse Contax Film Camcorder Frame rate Nikon Corporation F-number Pinhole camera Road-rule enforcement camera Pentax Nikon FA Point and shoot camera Color temperature STS-62 Lighting Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Technicolor Computer High-definition television Surveillance Charge-coupled device Digital camera back Nikon FE2 Photojournalism Amateur astronomy Combine (Half-Life 2) Computer animation Film speed Digital Spirit rover timeline for 2005 March Cinematography Apollo 8 Floppy disk Traffic light Full frame digital SLR Zone system Golf A Geographic information system Bullet time Gamut Black hole Large format Speed of light Canon FD Apollo moon landing hoax accusations Parallax Color Closed-circuit television Enlarger Eye Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory S TGV Secure Digital card Advanced Photo System Digital art Filmmaking Pixel Bluetooth Cinerama Red-eye effect Computer vision Pornography Machine vision Digital cinematography Lens (optics) Anamorphic widescreen Rendering (computer graphics) Nikon FE
