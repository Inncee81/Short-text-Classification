i'm going to be photographing a farmers market and the pictures will be published on a website magazine and cookbook the amount of hours will be not including time for editing what would be a reasonable rate to charge for this hi everyone sorry i should have clarified this the total amount of hours will be over the span of different days i have photographed this farmer's market before for their newsletter and they liked my pictures sorry i didn't include this is the question and thanks so much to the sarcastic remarks everyone has to make a start doing something and i'm slowly making mine and trying to get additional info i know that i'm an amateur photographer i also know that i'm not over my head every photographer has been in amateur at some point and have been over their head in something i thought i was going to agree with joe l but i'd say a couple hundred dollars per hour is more like it you could easily spend an equal amount of time in post production if i was the one paying you though i'd say to get as many shots as you need inside of two hours if i were you i'd think along the same lines man hours is a long time unless you're spending it the way they did in the movie by the same name maybe you can stop by a few times throughout the day and catch different activities from the buyer's point of view i'd ask how many shots they will get as a result of hours of your time it would have to be dozens to make it worth having you there that long who set the hours anyway Microeconomics The Amazing Race Labor theory of value Supply and demand Labour economics Inflation High-definition television Poker jargon Photography John F.
