how do i get the white balance right i recently went on a trip to london england as part of the st world scout jamboree i took with me my or my dad's as the case may be canon eos d i have gotten into photography over the last two years but this summer have just started concentrating on it as a hobby this summer i have adobe photoshop lightroom and while on the trip i took many photos in the canon raw format however once i have all my raw photos loaded into lightroom and i've messed around with giving them a warmer look or a blueish tint i've realize on many of them they both look good so my question is how do you determine which one is best for certain pictures i really don't want to end up with two duplicates of every pictures i have thanks as far as i can tell there is no dropper tool in lightroom and while i am not more than photoshop cs literate when i open photoshop from lightroom it doesn't open up into camera raw due to the fact that lightroom converts the pictures to tiff and not totally sure how to change white balance from there ok so i've checked up on my camera's manual but just wondering will any piece of white paper work or do i need to go to a photography store and by some special white paper and what do you use a grey card for since you setting the white balance and do you set your white balance every time you start a new series of shots dangit ok there is a dropper in lightroom but i've just been using printer paper in the last five minutes for a manual white balance and i'll tell you wow i know my room is a difficult photo spot due to the mixture of lights halogen flourescent and incadescent natural but man wow that gives me a good shot i too have a canon d and use it daily in my business i shoot raw its beats the hell out of jpg i know when you test a photo there is a range that it looks good in but in photoshop cs which im sure is pretty much the same as lightroom in the raw conversion there is a white dropper looks like a little pipette use this and click on a white portion of your image you can also jack the saturation up to and adjust the white balance and hue until it looks somewhat normal and then bring the sat back down to or ive used that trick when there isnt any white its a nice little trick ideally you should have a white grey black card with you when you shoot and then adjust for that image and the rest should be perfect all this said it wont make any difference unless you monitor is calibrated you can do this by hand or with a item called a spyder there are others on the market but i use the spyder from colorvision good luck Digital photography Adobe Photoshop Photography Konica Minolta Screenshot Color Digital camera PNG Color theory Photograph Film IPod PlayStation Portable Technicolor Gamut Photographic film Pixel Windows XP NTSC Canon EOS Lighting Transformer Oscilloscope Extreme Programming Carburetor Goatse.cx Macro photography Gramophone record GIMP View camera Opportunity rover Shaggy dog story CPU cache E85 Screenplay Digital image editing Trademark Color temperature Textile manufacturing Explosive material Color blindness IPhoto JPEG ImageMagick RGB color model Canon PowerShot G Embedded system Drill bit HSL color space Single-lens reflex camera Common Unix Printing System Compiler optimization Amateur astronomy Poker jargon Traditional animation Street photography Cinematography Handloading Contract bridge Jumpstart 3rd Grade Apollo 8 Camcorder Snooker Panoramic photography Bob and George Timpani B-47 Stratojet Fischer Random Chess The Price Is Right Color management Digital single-lens reflex cameras Floppy disk Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Diamond Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Supply and demand GunBound Professional wrestling attacks Camera Kasparov versus The World Ethernet Glass Japanese tea ceremony Internet fraud Leica Mouse (computing) Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Ozone depletion
