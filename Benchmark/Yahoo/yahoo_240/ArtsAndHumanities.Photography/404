red eye question connected with red hair my boyfriend always gets red eye in photos even when others next to him don't would it have anything to do with his red hair and he has pale pink skin i'm curious because i never get red eye but he always looks like satan at one point he had it that many times i could have sworn that he'd tampered with them fair skin and red hair go along with lighter color eyes which are more prone to red eye than dark eyes for some reason although any eye color can show the red eye effect red eye is caused by the proximity of the flash to the camera lens that is why wedding photographers often have their flash mounted on brackets higher above the lens Digital photography Light-emitting diode Red-eye effect Human skin color Digital camera Red hair Stereoscopy Color Hair color View camera Melanin Eye Dragon Booster Photography Cheetah Leica Canon EOS Albinism Red Sunglasses Traffic light Light DLP Iris (anatomy) Skin Black (people) Black Single-lens reflex camera Anaglyph image Physical attractiveness Macro photography Transformer Hair Rainbow Konica Minolta Dimension Bonus Stage Blond Cinematography Eyepiece Digital single-lens reflex cameras Color temperature Meriones unguiculatus Aberration in optical systems Rei Ayanami Charge-coupled device The Red Green Show Nuclear weapon design Radiation therapy Diamond enhancement Keeshond Pubic hair Contax Magical objects in Harry Potter Parallax Stage lighting Color blindness Photojournalism Camcorder Ultraviolet Photographic film Binoculars Panoramic photography Lens (optics) My Little Pony Telescope Cat coat genetics Marathon (computer game) Sun Autostereogram Barbie Conjunctivitis White (people) Canon EF lens mount The Ashlee Simpson Show Road-rule enforcement camera Drawing Dog Flash (photography) Laser hair removal Shampoo Totally Spies!
