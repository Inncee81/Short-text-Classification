talentless okay well basically i don't think i have any talents i'm intelligent and good at school but that is it i don't have any real talent i know life is indeed what you make it but how can i find my talent that is if i have one i just see so many celebrities who can act sing and dance and i'm just wondering what's wrong with me lol help would be appreciated ten points for the best answer thank you to those that answer x i was just thinking the same thing the other day like you i'm an academic person intelligent and gets good grades but that's it i hate sports because i'm crap at them i failed to master the guitar and the piano and my artistic ability leaves something to be desired but i know that i have some hidden talent nestled away inside me and that someday i will find it maybe you could experiment try a variety of things things you think there's no way you could be good at you might even surprise yourself don't forget intelligence is one of the greatest talents of all think of all the things that have been achieved through intelligence and compare those to achievements got through talents such as singing dancing or acting celebrities aren't that talented really you'd be surprised the amount of singers who can't actually sing a lot of their talent is down to the producers in the recording studios e g rihanna and jessica simpson there are so many talentless celebs don't compare yourself to them i hate to say this cliche but we are all different and unique comparing yourself to others only leaves us bitter spend time improving yourself instead Jon Secada The Ashlee Simpson Show 10cc Theory of conduct Time Out of Mind Blonde on Blonde One Tree Hill (TV series) Jessica Simpson Meaning of life Slow Train Coming Kylie Minogue John Lennon Prince (artist) Shot of Love Pet Sounds W.
