ear stretching hi i'm planning on getting my ears stretched and i was just wondering what's the size gauge that people already have with normal piercings like with guns i know guns are bad but i was little and how do they stretch the hole with the long tapers through your piercing and then put the tunnel on the end and you're done around what would the price be all i want are small tunnels as in the next size up from the normal ear piering sized hole and what about my old earrings if i dont stretch my ears too much will i still be able to wear them gah i'm so excited thanks to all the people who actually contributed and atually answered instead of telling me not to do it or it looks gross oh and btw i am a girl and i do like stretched ears deal with it standard piercing gauge is g stretching is done using a sterilized taper that goes from one gauge to the next www safepiercing org price will vary depending on the quality of the jewelry used and the shop you go to the shop i used to work at would stretch you for free with a jewelry purchase to get a good idea of what good quality jewelry is going to cost check out www bmeshop com remember you want to use either surgical steel lvm or autoclavable acrylic even though it's a fresh piercing any other porous materials wood bone stone certain acrylic clay etc can actually cause infections and trust me i've seen people with it and it's disgusting however i have to burst your bubble tunnels aren't usually found in anything smaller then a or guage most people can skip sizes when they're going from a to say an but it might still take you a few different stretches to get the look that you want at those in between stages use the most inexpensive jewelry you can or you just waste your money because you really can't wear old jewelry again unless your down sizing which is possible and depends on each person's skin i always used to suggest using acrylic retainers because they're only about bucks a pop and you can keep them around in case you loose a piece of jewelry later so you don't loose size Earring Body piercing Ear piercing instrument Tattoo Drill bit Violin Diamond Bong Shotgun Prince Albert piercing Gramophone record Wood Mattress Strap-on dildo Upholstery Clothing Knife Floppy disk Plastic Brewery Table saw Barbell (piercing) Handloading Microeconomics Seismic retrofit Shen Gong Wu Firearm Poker jargon Dialysis Screw Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Menstrual cup Piercing migration Spark plug Domestic rabbit Stomach cancer Hearing aid Gaia Online Menstrual cycle Urinary incontinence Welding M16 (rifle) Shell (projectile) Tongue piercing Airsoft Intraocular lens Diving suit Katana Rolling-element bearing Lighting Knitting Terminal ballistics Textile manufacturing Comanche Textile manufacturing terminology Penis Pottery Navel piercing Technology in the Stargate universe Tutankhamun O scale Rail tracks Hand grenade Body modification Temporal bone Diamond cut Paintball Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Malignant melanoma Traumatic brain injury Puberty The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Cat Solar cell Capitalism Wood carving Guitar Ear Empire Burlesque Explosive material Vampire Items in the Metroid series Labor theory of value View camera The Inside Commodity markets Jennifer Lopez Illegal drug trade Ammolite Cremation
