am i doing the right aftercare of my tatoo i just got my first tattoo on the top of my back right below my neck my tattoo artist told me to keep the bandage on for two hours which i did and then wash it with antibacterial soup which i also did he told me to get a fragrance free lotion and apply to it i got aveeno daily moisturizing lotion fragrance free and i've been applying that two times daily even though it's kind of hard for me to reach it has been itching a little bit and it's also a little sore but i haven't bled at all and it's not infected am i applying lotion enough daily and are there any secrets to making it heal faster and stay looking good i got it done on friday the rd and i was told not to put neosporin on it because i might have an allergic reaction which will cause red bumps and when the red bumps go away i will have a spotted tattoo another thing haha how do i know when it's healed twice a day seems about right depending on your skin type what kind of air exposure it gets local humidity temperature etc a good rule of thumb is if the tattoo feels more or less like the uninked skin you're doing fine what you use is semi irrelevant and as long as you're sticking to what the artist recommends use the above as a general guideline you are correct in that neosporin other tribiotics should not be used for reasons you mention vaseline also not as it can pull out the color although i think this may only be a concern earlier within the first week or so everything else seems good don't worry about healing fast worry about healing right as far as staying looking good mostly it's a matter of taking care of your skin stay out of the sun use moisturizer if the skin is getting dry take general care of yourself that kind of thing i read a cnn article recently talking about how smoking ages the skin much like sun damage so if you smoke you may wish to rethink that side note antibacterial soup i know it's a typo but i needed the chuckle and thank you for inadvertently providing one addendum forgot to answer the last bit you know it's healed when the skin over the tattoo looks feels like the surrounding skin this can take up to three months but tends to be pretty close by weeks Tattoo Body piercing Psoriasis Eczema Skin Urinary incontinence Social rule Diving suit Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Theory of conduct Scabies Stomach cancer Manicure Breastfeeding Radiation therapy Acne Shaving Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Milton H.
