advice on getting a tattoo for a first timer i am going to get a tattoo either tomorrow or within the next few days i'm young only but i know for sure i will not regret this tattoo the tattoo will be of kanji characters that mean okinawa which is where i have spent the last four years of my life the tattoo will be on my upper left arm and will be fairly decent sized to small my dad said it would probably take about minutes or less to complete the main thing i'm concerned about is the pain and the price the artist said the price will be roughly and that seams kind of cheap considering he charged my friend about to get ashley on his chest but he does look younger than me even though we're both the same age i know this guy is reputable he has like binders full of photos that i looked through so can anyone give me any tips while i'm in the chair or explain to me why the price is quite low this guy did my friend's tattoo and the quality of the work looks pretty good my friend's tattoo was in intricate cursive and mine is going to be pretty simple just normal kanji and the guy is japanese too so i guess maybe thats why he's charging less for me i have no idea why the price is so low i was scammed on my st one for a silver dollar sized tatt it depends on the size and the ink honestly having my ears pierced hurt a lot worse than a tattoo i describe it as a cat scratch you know how it swells after and burns some but it's very relaxing at the same time just sit and close your eyes if you need to and feel the vibration of the needle just when you think it hurts he she will spray some cool water on it to wipe of the extra ink and it feels so good the artist is usually listening to some pretty cool tunes too they are addictive and one reason is because it does feel good in a strange sort of way believe me getting a shot in the ass from a dr hurts a hell of a lot worse Tattoo Theory of conduct Nine Inch Nails Body modification Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Irezumi Humphrey Bogart Sento Professional wrestling attacks Wood carving Blood on the Tracks Social rule Inflation Fast bowling Unreal Pitaten Scarification Electrophysiology Earring Aerial (dance move) Violin Garfield The Rolling Stones Diving Shogi Kyle Broflovski Professional wrestling holds Great Teacher Onizuka Jackass: The Movie Ranma __ characters Extreme Programming Friends Loudspeaker Blood (computer game) Shaggy dog story EastEnders Earth Girl Arjuna Recurring South Park characters Kanji Characters of Naruto Mattress Kurt Cobain 2000 Australian Grand Prix Universal Century Technology Piccolo Junior Saga Double bass Kodocha The Fairly OddParents Gramophone record Arguments for and against drug prohibition Double Dragon Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Avenue Q Upholstery The Adventures of Pete & Pete Norway national football team Menstrual cup Hip hop rivalries Acupuncture Sampling (music) Ecco the Dolphin Daredevil Live At Leeds Bat Lash Aikido Sub-Zero Time Out of Mind Japanese name Angelina Jolie Turbocharger Knife United States dollar Treehouse of Horror V Sin City Electric guitar Body piercing The nature of God in Western theology Solar cell Rich Mullins Episodes of Lost (Season 1) One Tree Hill (TV series) Hellsing Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Shen Gong Wu Kill Bill Vanilla Ninja Tokusatsu Galaxy Angel Alan Moore Cliff Richard Vowel Ninja Sentai Kaku Ranger
