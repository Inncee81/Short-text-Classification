a friend of mine is going to die what do i do i posted a while back about my friend who has one leg and was a cancer survivor well about four months ago he was re diagnosed with lung cancer doctors tell us he has six months to live with an up coming surgery and a new form of experimental chemotherapy i have about six months to prepare for his death though i don't trust doctor's time tables simply because my grandfather died of lung cancer and lasted years longer than expected right now he's fine and fit and we hang out almost every day but what should i do each day gets harder for me to look at him last night he spent the night and i threw up i blamed it on something i ate but i knew it was because of him dying what do i do i thank all of you for your suggestions i think i will see my pastor about this i will keep praying and i will live everyday to the fullest with him i didn't make my self clear earlier but both of us are only so hospice isn't need but i do have a previous knowledge of hospice due to my grandfather i will read those stories and take this one step at a time thank you all i'm sorry your friend has to go through this and i'm sorry you are having such a difficult time your reactions are understandable first your friend is fighting this disease and seems to be focusing on living right now that's great however even though he may not be talking a lot about his illness it probably weighs very heavily on his mind as it does on yours if you'd like to talk about it with him it may help both of you to do so ask him if he'd like to talk about it take your cues from him at the very least it would probably be safe to let him know that you care even if you can't get beyond that sentence second check into some resources for yourself and for how to help your friend your friend is fighting his cancer so you might want to check out some inspirational stories they may give both of you hope start with the lung cancer stories at the care pages website link below care pages allows family and friends of sick people to build a web log about their progress and there are a lot of resources there finally if treatment is not successful or you'd like to learn more about how to interact with a friend who's dying check out the hospice link below hospice is a nationwide network of organizations that help people die at home among family with dignity there is lots of helpful information at the link on simple ways to be a part of your friend's life during this time and on how to get through this experience yourself my thoughts are with you and your friend Prostate cancer Palliative care Stomach cancer Cancer Medicine Theory of conduct Lung cancer Religious Society of Friends Psychology Metastasis Church of Christ, Scientist Breast cancer Plame affair Terri Schiavo Causality Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Autism rights movement Pitaten Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Fight Club Stroke Hearing impairment Radiation therapy American Red Cross Social rule Time Out of Mind Folic acid Oncology Andy Kaufman Multiple sclerosis Milton H.
