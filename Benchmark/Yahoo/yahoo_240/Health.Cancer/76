mother has liver cancer recently my mother was told that she has liver cancer she has jaundice very badly and it has caused her skin to appear orange and the whites of her eyes are yellow she also has hep c and i am not clear on if they can operate on her if she has this condition i guess what i would like to know is what the common causes of liver cancer are thank you for your time also she had an mri in may and it didn't show any masses and then she just had surgery weeks ago for her gall bladder and a liver biopsy after the mri results came in they seen the mass and scheduled her for another biopsy on monday and found out it was cancerous will she be around for a while still or is she fading fast considering the mass has grown so large in months and she has severe jaundice i have never been through this before and don't know what to expect liver cancer can be caused by a very wide variety of things you need to find out of it is primary liver cancer or secondary liver cancer sometimes if there is cancer somewhere else in the body it can end up in the liver the liver's job is to filter the blood so if there is cancer in the body it could eventually end up in the liver hep c jaundice and cirrhosis of the liver are all possible causes of primary liver cancer have they checked for cancer in other parts of the body sounds like it's primary but just to be safe Cancer Cirrhosis Liver Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Prostate cancer Jaundice Bilirubin Metastasis Malignant melanoma Lung cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Schistosomiasis Radiation therapy Breast cancer Medicine Primary biliary cirrhosis Gallstone Hepatitis C Urinary incontinence Coeliac disease Esophageal cancer Multiple sclerosis Glycogen storage disease type I Colorectal cancer Cephalic disorder Mesothelioma Cryptorchidism Brain tumor Needle aspiration biopsy Leptospirosis Endometriosis Autoimmune diseases Stroke Soft tissue sarcoma Chlorpromazine Gallbladder Leukemia Anemia Vitamin D Psoriasis Protein-energy malnutrition Hepatitis B Syphilis Vitamin C EastEnders Turmeric Pneumonia Gastrointestinal stromal tumor Endometrial cancer Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Tobacco smoking Cervical cancer Traumatic brain injury Poison Acupuncture Tocopherol Haemochromatosis Acute lymphoblastic leukemia Androgen insensitivity syndrome Primary sclerosing cholangitis Cancer of the larynx Spina bifida Insulin AIDS Eczema Acne Stem cell Hypoglycemia Polychlorinated biphenyl Alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency Neighbours Hypertension Alkaline phosphatase Dialysis Shark Bone marrow transplant IgA nephropathy Ulcerative colitis Melanin Natural Hygiene Diazepam Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis Human brain CPU cache Medical analysis of circumcision Infectious mononucleosis Cytomegalovirus Cardiac stress test Dieting Wilson's disease Diabetes mellitus Puberty Psychosis Growth hormone treatment
