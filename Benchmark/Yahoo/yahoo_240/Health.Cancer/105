i don't know how to help my partner any suggestions my boyfriends dad has just been told he has up to months left to live with oesophagus cancer it has devastated him as he has already lost his mum and i cannot cope with seeing him so upset his dad means alot to me as well as we have been together for yrs but as soon as i start to speak about it i cry and i want so much to be strong for them both how can i take control of my feelings without avoiding the subject it's hard to lose someone you love the reason you are crying so much is that you are grieving most people think that grieving begins after a person dies but that's not true it can begin as early as getting the diagnosis of the illness so what you are going through is perfectly normal however since your boyfriend's dad has about a year or so left to live it won't be healthy for you to continue in the state you're in now so it would be a good idea for you to have someone to talk to we have hospices here where i live and you can go to support groups with other people who are losing someone they love it doesn't cost anything here so if they have hospices where you live and i think they do try to find a support group where you can talk about your feelings are you able to talk to his dad about other topics without crying if you can then be there for him people who are dying don't always want to talk about dying they also want to continue living as normal a life as possible trust me when i say i know this to be true what kinds of things does he like you have known him for a long time i'm sure he would love visits and you can bring him things you know he likes even if it's something as simple as the daily papers i'm sure he'd love to simply have your company that's worth so much as far as helping your boyfriend again just be there for him if he's feeling sad just hold him if you cannot speak if he talks to you about his dad listen to him and it's ok if you cry when you talk maybe he needs to cry so your crying makes it easier for him to cry i'll say again that i think you need someone to talk to also you want to be strong for them and that's wonderful but who's going to be strong for you you are grieving too when your boyfriend's dad has months left he can belong to a hospice that doesn't mean he has to move anywhere he can stay at home but he will have care both physically emotionally hospices send a nurse about times a week to check in on the patient more often if they need it they will send aides if the patient needs care with bathing dressing making up the bed etc the hospice will also have counseling available to him your boyfriend you so maybe you could be the one to start looking into this that would be one way to help them and yourself and as i said you can go to hospice support groups now because you need help for yourself you are important too and you'll be able to help them better if you have help for yourself i'm sorry you have to go through such a painful time just try to make it through one day at a time it's sad when someone we love dies but there is one positive thing to hold on to he didn't die suddenly which can be even harder because there is no time to say goodbye you your boyfriend have a year to be with him and you can share your love during this time be together while preparing to say goodbye best of luck to you and take care of yourself Social rule Palliative care Pitaten Prostate cancer EastEnders Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Grief Terri Schiavo About a Boy Kodocha Theory of conduct Stomach cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma One Tree Hill (TV series) The Amber Spyglass Jon Secada Friends Grandview, U.S.A.
