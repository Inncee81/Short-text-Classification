the worlds best health care is here in the u s is statement propaganda a friend of mine was diagnosed with liver cancer early this year and given less than a year to live by his doctors without alot of hope of recovery he had cancer in his liver and it was in his blood stream and in some of his bones the doctors wanted to do some surgerys and kimo and were telling him it was gona be a long road without any kind of gaurantee some where my friend heard of a hospital in india where they specialized in liver treatments because of the high rate of hepatitus in that part of the world so he speant all of his savings and flew to india where they did several procedures with a lazor i just talked to him for the first time yesterday and can't remember alot of the details he came home to the states and went to his doctor when they ran tests the found his body cancer free when he told him what had happened the didn't believe him and said that no such procedure existed they also wanted to still do kemo is it all the legal red tape if you are referring to radiofrequency ablation cyber knife or proton therapy all these treatments exist in the us for cancer patients the problem is that many cancer patients because of the size and location of their specific disease may not qualify for the treatment what this means is that an oncologist will determine after a conference with the radiologist or medical technician if the tumors can safely be eliminated using the above methods if they determine that you would not benefit from this treatment they couldn't get all the tumor out safely than they will in general refuse the treatment radio frequency ablation of liver tumors http www radiologyinfo org en info cfm pg rfa bhcp proton therapy http www radiologyinfo org en info cfm pg protonthera cyberknife liver treatment http www accuray com clinicalinfo applications liver index aspx laser surgery is used routinely on the liver here in the states too my son had this done when they removed a few tumors from the dome of his liver i have no idea what happened to your friend and why he would go to india when treatment is available here perhaps he just did not know who to contact and was more familiar with india if your friend used interstitial laser photocoagulation it is often bypassed for treatment options in the us because rfa and cryotherapy can kill more tumors than this process so it may be less of a matter of 'red tape' and more a matter that newer treatments have replaced this technique and his doctors here were correct there is no guarantee just because a test comes back with 'no evidence' of the disease does not mean that it is gone at best it means that he is in remission and the ct can no longer detect microscopic cancer hopefully he will stay in remission but there is no guarantee that it is gone the reason his doctors recommended chemotherapy was to kill off those lingering microscopic cells remaining in the body malignant microscopic cells can stay hidden and dormant for an undetermined amount of years so he will need to be vigilant i'm glad that your friend is better and that he found the treatment that has helped him sometimes it is more a matter of where someone feels the most comfortable and i do believe that cancer patients in the us are receiving some of the newest and more progressive cancer treatments than any place else in the world i've done alot of reseach and have talked to people and patients from all over the world and i'm satisfied with my son's health care there are some exceptions depending on the specific types of cancer but overall cancer research and access to new treatments here is topnotch Malaria Stem cell Stroke Folic acid Mesothelioma Bone marrow transplant Hepatocellular carcinoma Hypoglycemia Multiple sclerosis Transsexuality Esophageal cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Ovarian cancer Testicular cancer AIDS Traditional Chinese medicine Pneumonia Homeopathy Urinary incontinence Acute lymphoblastic leukemia Tuberculosis Multiple myeloma Traumatic brain injury Cirrhosis Psoriasis Endometriosis Magnetic resonance imaging Clinical depression Chiropractic Leukemia Cytomegalovirus Coeliac disease Brain tumor Radiology Prolactinoma Growth hormone treatment Rheumatoid arthritis Cervical cancer Alternative medicine Rabies Experimental cancer treatment Atrial fibrillation DNA repair Chronic fatigue syndrome Acne Crohn's disease Gastrointestinal stromal tumor Androgen insensitivity syndrome Autism Medical analysis of circumcision History of cancer chemotherapy Physical therapy Antiretroviral drug Tocopherol AIDS reappraisal Liver Publicly funded medicine Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Cryptorchidism Positron emission tomography Bipolar disorder Cancer of the larynx X-ray Technetium Medical cannabis Dialysis American Red Cross Photorefractive keratectomy Physician Alcoholism Insulin Osteosarcoma Hepatitis C HIV test Involuntary commitment Church of Christ, Scientist Penile cancer
