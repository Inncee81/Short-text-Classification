what is known about a rod and steroids i've been listening with disgust about barry bonds breaking the very hard earned record of henry aaron while cheating on steroids yes i understand that bonds has had clean tests for steroids but his back against the wall with a possible indictment for the use of them i have mentioned before that when someone is facing an indictment in the us distict court they are in big trouble yes we are all innocent until proven guilty but verdicts and pleas are extremely high when issued by the us courts here's my dilemma i want bonds to get the record and go away not only does he have the indictment problem he is also obnoxious to other players including his own team mates and has a hatred of the media and cares little for the fans i want to turn toward alex rodriguez and hope he can break bonds record so we can put bonds to bed i don't want to root for a cheater though what do you all know about a rod than being an extremely high paid baseball player well that i know of he has not taken steroids which is why im rooting for him as well its funny cuz i asked the same exact question and i stated almost the same thing as you i agree that hank fought through sweat and tears for those hr and i think its unfair for someone to cheat their way through the record when you play a certain game with someone are you happy when they cheat to win no imagine how hank aaron feels knowing the classy hank aaron i doubt hes mad hes waiting for another clean player to break the record again that being a rod youngest ever to hr we need you a rod left to go Barry Bonds Hank Aaron 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Major League Baseball Alex Rodriguez EastEnders 1957 World Series Babe Ruth History of baseball in the United States Home run Prisoner's dilemma Social rule St. Louis Cardinals Lou Gehrig Cheating in poker Reggie Jackson Rafael Palmeiro 1919 World Series Ben Johnson (athlete) Jon Secada RuneScape cheats Nolan Ryan Plame affair Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Ty Cobb Pittsburgh Steelers Gary Sheffield Schapelle Corby Topps Cliff Richard Atlanta Braves Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Katelyn Faber 2004 World Series Cheating in Counter-Strike Knots Landing Professional wrestling slang Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Satchel Paige Vernon Schillinger Seattle Mariners Alex Ferguson Ken Griffey, Jr. Poker jargon Bj__rn Borg Humphrey Bogart Toronto Blue Jays Fathers' rights Karl Rove Oakland Athletics Miguel Tejada American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Mark McGwire History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Diablo II: Lord of Destruction New York Giants October 22 in baseball W.I.T.C.H.
