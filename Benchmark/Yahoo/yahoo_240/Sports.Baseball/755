bad bat i bought the easton stealth it is inch ounce bat and i weigh and am about five foot four maybe i use this bat and it barely makes the ball go far at all it just makes it pop up shallow or ground out i know it isnt me because i used a different bat a demarini i think and it goes way far what is wrong with my bat and can i fix it its the blue regular stealth if that helps not composite i dont play softball and it is the bat popping it up because i tried a different bat and was ripping i cannot go to an old bat it's my first year with a big barrel and dont have it could be cracked how old is it bats have a life expectancy so they do wear out but if the bat is less then a year old i would try getting in touch with easton and telling them that there is something wrong and there is a good chance they will give you a new one but you don't know if you don't try if it is older then you will need to buy a new one Softball Laws of cricket Fast bowling Baseball 1957 World Series Baseball Stars Baseball statistics Tris Speaker 2005 ICC Trophy Batting average RuneScape quests Batting (cricket) Poker jargon Table tennis Cricket Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Fielding (cricket) W.
