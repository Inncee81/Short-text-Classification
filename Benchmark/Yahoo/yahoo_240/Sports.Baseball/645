who else thinks that roger clemens and david wells need to hang up their gloves both these guys were once great but now they are extremely overpaid middle of the road pitchers who are hurting their respective teams i am a padres fan and every time i see that wells is pitching i cringe the dude just gave up hits and runs in innings and clemens had a similiar outing last week or two weeks ago when he was booed by his own people the money for these guys could go a long way towards some real help yeah i agree completely but it must be hard to make that decision to finally hang up your spikes i mean they've been playing the game for so long and to finally just stop would be hard they love the game and they both want to keep playing forever but i just wish they would both retire i almost feel embarrassed to watch them get shelled 1957 World Series Roger Clemens Toronto Blue Jays 2003 World Series Houston Astros Softball Boston Red Sox Detroit Tigers San Diego Padres Babe Ruth Chicago White Sox David Wells Nolan Ryan Satchel Paige 2004 World Series Pitcher No-hitter Baseball October 22 in baseball New York Yankees Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry Robin Ventura Tris Speaker October 14 in baseball 2004 American League Championship Series Seattle Mariners World Series Sandy Koufax 1986 National League Championship Series 2001 World Series Pedro Mart__nez 1986 American League Championship Series New York Mets 2005 National League Championship Series Montr__al Expos International League Hank Aaron Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Cincinnati Bengals Red Sox Nation Cricket Major League Baseball television contracts Strikeout Baseball Stars Win (baseball) Starting pitcher History of baseball in the United States Dave Winfield Alex Rodriguez October 10 in baseball Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Troy Glaus October 4 in baseball Jerry Coleman Pete Rose Don Drysdale Reggie Jackson Grover Cleveland Alexander 1991 World Series Batting average Complete game John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Andre Agassi The Ashlee Simpson Show Philadelphia Phillies Ty Cobb Don Mattingly St. Louis Cardinals Cincinnati Reds Los Angeles Dodgers Oakland Athletics November 2004 in sports October 13 in baseball Chicago Cubs Manny Ram__rez Greg Maddux Curse of the Billy Goat Pittsburgh Pirates Fernando Valenzuela Bruce Hurst Florida Marlins Willie Mays Atlanta Braves October 2004 in sports Andr__s Galarraga Earned run average Barry Bonds 1919 World Series Ted Williams Byung-Hyun Kim October 27 in baseball
