what's your opinion about barry bonds is it his record regular or not barry bonds is the new home run king i think its just easy for people to write off someones accomplishments by focusing blame on performance enhancers or in barry's case steroids unfortunately we now live in an era where every accomplishment will be subject to such scrutiny pa brought up a good point in mentioning how players from the 's were given amphetamines which are now illegal hank aaron used amphetamines for a season to get out of a slump dock ellis threw a no hitter while on lsd if barry bonds and baseball for that matter was so into steroids then why are there only active players in the top for home runs the next active player on the list is almost home runs behind bonds rafael palmeiro a confirmed steroid user who started one year after bonds has less home runs most anti bonds fans point out that when his alleged steroid use was over in his stats all went down what most people dont point out is that he was sidelined for of the season due to knee surgery and would have retired in ' had he not been chasing the home run record unfortunately for barry when you do anything good or bad now days you become the center of attention for all of pop culture when you factor that in to how much negativity comes out of the media allegations somehow become truth in any case i think barry rightfully deserves the crown he is a very trained hitter with a very intimidating plate presence when a rod breaks the record hopefully as an sf giant years from now he will undergo the exact same ridicule that bonds did it'll just be a different catalyst anytime a major record gets broken there will be a period of hate that turns into love only to cycle back to hate when a new contender approaches the record Major League Baseball Hank Aaron Rafael Palmeiro Home run Babe Ruth St. Louis Cardinals New York Yankees Baseball Jos__ Canseco Toronto Blue Jays Sammy Sosa Pittsburgh Steelers 1957 World Series Andr__s Galarraga Miguel Tejada Baltimore Orioles Reggie Jackson Chicago White Sox Ty Cobb Troy Glaus World Series Lou Gehrig Batting average San Francisco Giants Nolan Ryan Mark McGwire Top 500 home run hitters of all time Ted Williams June 12 in baseball Tris Speaker Atlanta Braves Baseball scorekeeping Major League Baseball All-Star Game Ellis Burks Oakland Athletics Los Angeles Kings San Diego Padres Robin Ventura Sandy Koufax Willie Mays Cincinnati Bengals Los Angeles Dodgers Rickey Henderson 2004 World Series Texas Rangers (baseball) New York Giants Baseball statistics Alex Rodriguez Manny Ram__rez Detroit Tigers Gary Sheffield Chicago Bulls David Ortiz Rugby union Pittsburgh Pirates Volleyball Boston Red Sox International League Hulk Hogan 1981 baseball strike New York Mets Pete Rose October 4 in baseball October 20 in baseball Torii Hunter Florida Marlins Baseball Stars St. Louis Rams 2005 World Series Brady Anderson Cleveland Indians Roger Clemens Yao Ming Intentional base on balls Designated hitter Mike Schmidt November 1 in baseball Jennifer Lopez Hal Trosky Frank Thomas (AL baseball player) Randy Johnson Albert Pujols The Jim Rome Show Grunge music Jason Giambi Houston Astros Jeff Kent August 2005 in sports Jackie Robinson
