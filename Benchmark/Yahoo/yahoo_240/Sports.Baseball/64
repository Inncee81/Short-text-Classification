why do people like kris post an non answer like he just did with the rbi question look it up then edit it is it so important that he get in first to answer does he get the feeling people are going to think he knew it off the top of his head while he probably looks it up that's lame kris doug my question is why do people if you or someone else answered i use it as a place holder that way i can go and look up the correct answer so it looks like i completely answered first so i can get best answer then that would be a possible answer if you are asking why i care then i will bounce it back and ask why do you care why i asked do you question every ya question for their motives re edit why do people constantly ask the same question about bonds who knows do you think it will change opinions i posted my question just so that people anyone would say oh people really notice this perhaps i will do something differently do i expect on that question that i would get extra points no because i didn't answer it first but the guy that posted nd actually answered the question first so yes it's to suggest that kris in this case shouldn't receive any credit for answering first when really boston did again if it was a one off i wouldn't have noticed but the same person did the same thing with the mvp cy young question and now i question why does that satisfy your question doug lots of people do this i tend to give them a thumbs down before they get a chance to edit their questions Theory of conduct Social rule Plame affair Wheel of Fortune Toronto Blue Jays Family Feud The Joker's Wild Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma The nature of God in Western theology Swami Vivekananda Species Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Twenty One (game show) Opinion poll Big Brother (USA TV series) Lou Gehrig Boston Red Sox 2004 American League Championship Series Intelligent design Stomach cancer Whose Line Is It Anyway?
