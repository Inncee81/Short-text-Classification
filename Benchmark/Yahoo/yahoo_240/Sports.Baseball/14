red sox fans come here to vent about eric gagne i know the guy was a good pitcher a few years back but ever since coming to boston only once has he not allowed a run and he has now blown the lead in like the past games he came into he just gave up a lead by giving up a homer with a man on to miggy tejada gagne needs to get his act together and tito needs to use okeydokey exclusively until gagne learns to not suck again if you need to vent about gagne too then go ahead also venting about lugo and nancy drew is ok too also all you yankee fans who will undoubtably spam up this question with hate filled comments just do it already i have a feeling the red sox picked up gagne only to prevent him from going to the yankees who desperately needed bullpen help what was wrong with timlin delcarmen snyder okajima papelbon that's a solid bullpen actually if you wanna talk stats it's the best in the majors hands down what they need is another bat to help out the ailing papi and struggling drew and maybe another utility infielder to come in when lugo makes his error every other game you gotta hope gagne will pull things together but nows not the time to test him put him in aaa pawtuckett if he's still not over that arm injury that kept him out most of this season boston sure does have the bullpen to allow francona to send him down without blinking 2004 American League Championship Series 1957 World Series Tris Speaker Chicago White Sox Babe Ruth World Series New York Yankees Alex Rodriguez Cleveland Indians Red Sox Nation Oakland Athletics Detroit Tigers October 10 in baseball St. Louis Cardinals Reggie Jackson Roger Clemens Pedro Mart__nez Manny Ram__rez Florida Marlins 1986 World Series October 19 in baseball Baseball Fenway Park October 5 in baseball Chicago Cubs October 12 in baseball Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry Robin Ventura October 7 in baseball Major League Baseball television contracts October 9 in baseball Home run Terry Francona Satchel Paige October 16 in baseball Curse of the Bambino Who's your daddy?
