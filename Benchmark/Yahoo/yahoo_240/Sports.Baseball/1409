how worried are the red sox now i m impartial to both the sox yanks but interested in opinions not a fan of either team but can only image the red sox have to be a bit worried how fast the yankees are catching up i mean they lead by games thoughts if you asked me this question this time last month i would have laughed and said no way will the yankees make it up i admit it i was wrong big time but i would have to guess that there are a good deal of others like me but wont admit it i went to the last two games in anaheim and as always with the visiting teams coming here you get a good mix of the visiting team's fans since just about everyone that lives in so cal is from somewhere else originally the sox fans came in cocky but they lost that cockiness as they started to get beat and noticed the score of the yankees games still talked alot of smack though but had that deer in the headlights look on them so yeah i'd have to say from what i've seen over the last two days that they're hearing footsteps coming up behind them and imagine they're hearing the music from the empire strikes back just about now Boston Red Sox World Series 1957 World Series 2004 World Series Red Sox Nation New York Giants Toronto Blue Jays 2005 World Series Major League Baseball television contracts 2004 American League Championship Series Cleveland Indians Reggie Jackson St. Louis Cardinals Chicago White Sox Ty Cobb Seattle Mariners October 4 in baseball San Francisco Giants Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 New York Yankees Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry Cincinnati Reds 1919 World Series Babe Ruth Tris Speaker Dick Williams 1986 World Series October 14 in baseball 2005 American League Division Series International League October 22 in baseball Alex Rodriguez No-hitter October 5 in baseball October 2004 in sports New York Mets Pedro Mart__nez Houston Astros Pete Rose October 19 in baseball October 17 in baseball Lou Gehrig Robin Ventura Troy Glaus October 15 in baseball MLB on NBC October 12 in baseball Damn Yankees Luis Tiant 1986 American League Championship Series History of baseball in the United States Gary Sheffield 2003 World Series 1994 baseball strike October 13 in baseball October 1 in baseball Los Angeles Kings 2003 American League Championship Series Tim McCarver Detroit Red Wings Rickey Henderson Baltimore Orioles October 7 in baseball I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue October 25 in baseball WEEI September 6 in baseball Al Michaels 1986 National League Championship Series October 10 in baseball October 16 in baseball MLB on FOX October 21 in baseball The Ashlee Simpson Show Curt Schilling Detroit Tigers Texas Rangers (baseball) 1960 World Series October 27 in baseball David Ortiz Newcastle United F.C.
