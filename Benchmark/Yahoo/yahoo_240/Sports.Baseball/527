does manny ramirez ever speak i know he was born in the united states and all so he must know english but i have never ever heard him speak is he a mute or something whoops what i meant to say was that he graduated high school from the u s so he must know english i have heard ortiz schilling and every other red sox player do interview or something but i yet to see one from manny i am sure he wasn't born in the u s because he just became a u s citizen a few years ago yes manny does know english very well and he talks alot the problem is that he isn't the smartest person so when he does say things he often makes himself look bad so i think the red sox try to keep his talking to the public to a minimum if you watch the red sox regularly like me you would know that he does talk alot in the clubhouse and he is very much the clown that every club house needs manny hits the ball and that is what he is paid to do so i don't mind if i don't see him on espn besides the only people on espn these days either have steroids controversies or they just got banned from the nfl he is just manny being manny baby Manny Ram__rez 2004 World Series David Ortiz 2004 American League Championship Series Curt Schilling Red Sox Nation Major League Baseball television contracts World Series Babe Ruth Curse of the Bambino History of baseball in the United States October 2004 in sports Home run Ty Cobb Pawtucket Red Sox New York Yankees The Jim Rome Show Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry Pete Rose Chicago White Sox Barry Bonds National Football League October 27 in baseball 1919 World Series Bill Lee (MLB pitcher) 1986 World Series Jason Varitek Chicago Cubs Gary Sheffield NFL Draft Bud Selig July 2004 in sports Pedro Mart__nez Carolina Panthers Tris Speaker American football Cleveland Indians Shaggy dog story Satchel Paige Social rule Negro league baseball MVP Baseball 2005 Bodyline MLB on FOX October 22 in baseball October 16 in baseball English plural Los Angeles Dodgers October 26 in baseball Kevin Millar Sammy Sosa Al Michaels Alex Rodriguez Jack Buck Who's your daddy?
