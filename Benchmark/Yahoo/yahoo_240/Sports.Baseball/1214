why do some of you think that steroids won't help you hit the ball basically if you are able to increase upper body muscle mass this will in turn make the bat lighter in your hands therefore you will be able to swing this bat quicker that is why they did it so anyone that says steroids has nothing to do with barry's achievement is sadly mistaken barry butt kisser comments please you guys are dumb yes he was a great hitter already and always had the eye hand coordination but the increased upper body strength will allow you to get to balls you might have missed before and allow you to play better on back to back games since steroids are syntihtic horse testosterone again yes he was a great player already we are talking about a competitive edge he gave himself yes steroids did not make him great alone he already was it is the edge the perfromance enhacing advadtage what is it about performance enhancign do uyou not understand theres a bit of a problem here in these answers most of you claiming steroids do not help you hit the ball cite hand eye coordination and anticipation skills which bonds already had its true however in the mlb everyone is required to use wooden bats and generally the weight range on those is between and ounces depending on whether you use a maple or an ash bat so let me explain say you are a relatively skinny guy and have to use a smaller say ounce bat to get around on the ball and still have the strength to change your trajectory mid swing you only have the momentum of a ounce bat probably not a heavy hitter so you go take some steroids now you have the strength to get around on the ball using a ounce bat it is your option as a hitter there to choose either the added power of the ounce bat or use your strength to more effectively move the bat mid swing to catch up slow down with the pitches using your old ounce bat bonds is huge he only uses a ounce bat do the math Baseball Volleyball Barry Bonds Fast bowling Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Batting (cricket) Laws of cricket Baseball Stars Table tennis Babe Ruth Softball Weight training Cricket Baseball bat Gary Sheffield Baseball statistics History of baseball in the United States 1957 World Series Puberty Billiards Reggie Jackson Mark McGwire Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Videocon Tri-Series 2005-06 Snooker Tennis Tris Speaker Golf club (equipment) Sammy Sosa Double bass World Series Equine conformation Anabolic steroid St. Louis Cardinals Andr__s Galarraga Golf Batsman Hank Aaron Wood Rugby union Indian Oil Cup 2005 Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Ravi Shastri Badminton Fielding (cricket) Designated hitter Mass Squash (sport) Leg before wicket History of Test cricket (1884 to 1889) Rugby union positions Bodybuilding Mois__s Alou Home run Brian Close Androgen insensitivity syndrome Aerial (dance move) Boston Red Sox History of Test cricket (1890 to 1900) Ted Williams 2004 World Series Testosterone Blackjack Broomball New York Mets Blood (computer game) Kevin Millar Mike Schmidt Ichiro Suzuki Professional wrestling throws Dualism (philosophy of mind) Swimming Piccolo Junior Saga Pitcher 2005 English cricket season Swing bowling Doom enemies General relativity Ty Cobb Stolen base Indian cricket team in Zimbabwe in 2005-06 Rounders Shawn Green Major League Baseball 2005 World Series Troy Glaus Lou Gehrig
