baseball fielding question if a catcher catches strike from a pitcher does the catcher get a putout yes the catcher certainly gets a putout it is the catchers responsibility to hold on to the third strike and if the catcher drops the ball and the batter reaches first then the strikeout is recorded for stats but no out is recorded because the catcher failed to make the putout to get the batter out if the catcher was to drop the third strike then the first baseman gets the putout because he catches the ball and puts the already struck out batter officially out Baseball Baseball statistics Softball Baseball scorekeeping Strikeout Catcher Stolen base Pitcher Sandy Koufax First baseman Rich Gedman 2004 World Series Baseball positions 1957 World Series Interference (baseball) Baserunning Out (baseball) Babe Ruth Box score (baseball) Pedro Mart__nez Strike zone Randy Johnson Perfect game Origins of baseball Baseball Stars Knuckleball Roger Clemens 2004 American League Championship Series October 14 in baseball Ty Cobb World Series Baseball glove Pete Rose Satchel Paige Tim Wakefield Bunt September 22 in baseball Andr__s Galarraga Squeeze play (baseball) Ted Kluszewski Hank Aaron November 3 in baseball Kickball St. Louis Cardinals 1919 World Series Robin Ventura Reggie Jackson Greg Maddux Steve Yeager Barry Bonds June 2 in baseball Appeal play Batting average 2003 World Series Ken Harrelson Second baseman Toronto Blue Jays June 14 in baseball Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Balk Wes Ferrell Alexander Cartwright Moe Berg Baseball slang Carlton Fisk Boston Red Sox Knickerbocker Rules Babe Ruth's Called Shot Detroit Tigers New York Mets Home run No-hitter Craig Biggio October 12 in baseball Johnny Roseboro Infield fly Chicago Cubs October 4 in baseball Willie Mays Wilbert Robinson October 27 in baseball Bo Diaz November 2 in baseball San Diego Padres History of baseball in the United States Gabby Hartnett Curveball Tag 2005 World Series Dodgeball New York Yankees Bob Feller Oakland Athletics October 13 in baseball October 2 in baseball November 4 in baseball
