why are my pirates why are my pirates the worst team in baseball next to the tampa bay devil rays i thought this would be the year i would at least have the pleasure of seeing in them as a team where do i begin ownership chooses to pocket revenue sharing money instead of reinvesting it into the team seems like minnesota milwaukee oakland and a few others do not have a problem doing the reinvesting thing the last impact player the pirates have drafted was a fellow by the name of barry bonds and that was years ago during the last years the pirates have yet to draft anyone who can help the team at the major league level picking pitchers most of the time remember bobby bradley in clint johnston in kris benson in bryan bullington in etc or hitters who never seem to hit j j davis in mark farris in chad hermansen in etc sure as hell doesn't help either the best trades in the last years have involved the same player brian giles giles was picked up in for ricardo rincon and in was shipped to san diego for oliver perez cory stewart and jason bay that's it not utilizing free agency has killed the pirates when was the last time they signed a free agent that has actually worked out we have to go back to when they picked up ed sprague who was their all star game rep that season every year pirates management tries to sell the fan base on improving only to bring in guys like pat meares derek bell mike fetters matt morris victor santos brant brown jose hernandez raul mondesi and the list goes on and on trading away useful players hasn't helped much as well losing aramis ramirez kenny lofton oliver perez chris young among others has just been too painful to watch fleecing local government to pay for a new stadium current ownership promised the fanbase that they would put a better product on the field if the city would fund a new ballpark city caved knowing quite well that a franchise over years old simply cannot be forced to move away ownership has not lived up to their end of the bargain annually cheating the fans out of decent baseball the endless promises to get better fall upon deaf ears this team is horribly mismanaged from the top on down there needs to be a complete overhaul starting in the front office where david littlefield clearly doesn't know what the heck he's doing jim tracy deserves better but he has to go as well new front office new manager new core of talent new scouts hell maybe even a new logo clean this mess up Florida Marlins Oakland Raiders National Football League New England Patriots New York Giants Chicago White Sox Cleveland Browns Texas Rangers (baseball) Cincinnati Reds Houston Astros Major League Baseball television contracts Carolina Panthers Atlanta Braves Tampa Bay Devil Rays St. Louis Cardinals Baltimore Orioles History of baseball in the United States Milwaukee Brewers Los Angeles Clippers Orlando Magic American Football League Cincinnati Bengals Hank Aaron International League Babe Ruth Major League Baseball Los Angeles Kings Reggie Jackson Dallas Cowboys Barry Bonds Kansas City Chiefs St. Louis Rams Montr__al Expos Buffalo Bills November 4 in baseball October 4 in baseball November 3 in baseball San Francisco 49ers Sammy Sosa Minor league baseball New York Jets Kansas City Royals October 2005 in sports Satchel Paige Chicago Cubs Manny Ram__rez Washington Redskins Home run Minnesota Twins Boston Bruins 1981 baseball strike September 20 in baseball New Jersey Nets 2005 World Series Washington Nationals 2004 World Series 1994 baseball strike Cleveland Indians AFL-NFL Merger New York Knicks October 20 in baseball Baseball Pete Rose Tampa Bay Lightning Minnesota Vikings Green Bay Packers Ty Cobb Montreal Canadiens Jacksonville Jaguars The Sporting News Rookie of the Year Award Houston Rockets Sandy Koufax June 2004 in sports Miami Dolphins Pittsburgh Penguins Minnesota North Stars Chicago Bulls Robin Ventura 2004 American League Championship Series Arizona Diamondbacks
