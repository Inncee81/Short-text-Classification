in mlb what does a pitcher's change up mean please define it with examples a change up is a type of pitch the changeup is thrown with the same arm action as a fastball but at a lower velocity due to the pitcher holding the ball in a special grip there are several types of changeup which are generated by using different grips on the ball during the pitch the most common type is the straight change the ball is held with three fingers instead of the usual two and closer to the palm to kill some of the speed generated by the wrist and fingers this pitch generally breaks downward slightly though its motion does not differ greatly from a two seam fastball another common grip is the circle changeup the pitcher forms a circle with his index finger and thumb using these two fingers to grip the seams of the baseball by pronating the wrist upon release this pitch tends to break slightly in the same direction as a screwball more or less break will come about from the pitcher's arm slot the more three quarters or side arm angle the more break generally pedro mart nez has used this pitch throughout his career to great effect and many consider it to be his best pitch citation needed before shoulder injuries made him lose velocity martinez countered his mile per hour fastball with this devastating mile per hour screwball like changeup tom glavine's changeup grip is a circle change grip but because he does not pronate his wrist he doesn't have the screwball movement but rather more sink on the pitch than the straight change citation needed time cy young award winner johan santana has arguably the best circle change in baseball and many cite it as his most effective pitch boston red sox set up man eric gagn also has a highly effective changeup pitch which he throws at around miles per hour however the effectiveness of gagn 's change was greater as a member of the los angeles dodgers because his fastball reached velocities approaching m p h and his change as low as m p h Sandy Koufax Baseball Los Angeles Dodgers Softball Starting pitcher Boston Red Sox Curveball Randy Johnson World Series No-hitter Knuckleball Volleyball Professional wrestling holds New York Mets St. Louis Cardinals Aerial (dance move) 2004 World Series Greg Maddux October 10 in baseball Atlanta Braves October 22 in baseball October 16 in baseball Gary Sheffield Babe Ruth Tris Speaker John Smoltz Bill Lee (MLB pitcher) San Francisco Giants Anatomical terms of location Types of bowlers in cricket David Cone Professional wrestling throws Eric Gagne Mouse (computing) Perfect game Johan Santana Wes Ferrell Nolan Ryan Dennis Eckersley Beer Pong Diving Double bass Ben Sheets Reggie Jackson New York Yankees Baseball statistics Satchel Paige October 4 in baseball Luis Tiant Swingout Weight training Cincinnati Reds Stolen base Montr__al Expos November 4 in baseball November 3 in baseball Smokey Joe Wood Pete Rose Mariano Rivera San Diego Padres 1919 World Series Chicago White Sox 2005 World Series Andr__s Galarraga Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Curt Schilling October 15 in baseball Al Leiter Tim Wakefield 1957 World Series Humerus Billy Wagner Mike Cuellar Major League Baseball television contracts Gesture 1981 World Series Chicago Cubs Carpal tunnel syndrome Salute Casey Fossum Coriolis effect Equine conformation Byung-Hyun Kim Vin Scully Violin Sammy Sosa Ty Cobb Keith Foulke
