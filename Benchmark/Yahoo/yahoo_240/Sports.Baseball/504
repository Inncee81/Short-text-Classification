will the cardinals sign chris duncan does anybody know the the cardinals might sign duncan or will he be leaving st louis it is debatable whether this is a good idea he is a good hitter and a great power hitter and is just ketting better however his glove is suspect he has gotten better but he still is a liability in the field the best comparison would be pat burrell that being said it is likely he will be resigned for several reasons first he is young and improving the cardinals struggle greatly from being too old and duncan can be a healthy fixture in lf for a long time to come second he is the son of the cardinals pitching coach dave duncan that does play a role in the willingness of the organization to resign him third he is a good character guy this cardinal squad suffers a bit in this area as well from the hancock tragedy to the recent spezio rehab duncan is a good guy and a very hard worker with a good head on his shoulders he is willing to improve his game and has done so over the last few years he is light years ahead of where he was when he came up and will likely only get better with ankiel's rising star the cards could have very productive corner outfielders for years to come St. Louis Cardinals Baseball Houston Astros San Diego Padres Toronto Blue Jays World Series Detroit Tigers Baltimore Orioles Babe Ruth Andr__s Galarraga Pittsburgh Steelers Cincinnati Reds 2004 World Series Tony La Russa Hank Aaron Cincinnati Bengals New York Yankees October 20 in baseball Cleveland Browns San Antonio Spurs History of baseball in the United States Sandy Koufax Pittsburgh Pirates Robin Ventura Edgar Renter__a Major League Baseball television contracts Orlando Magic Home run Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Oakland Athletics New York Knicks New York Mets Chicago White Sox Alex Rodriguez Pete Rose November 2 in baseball Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Dixie Walker Tottenham Hotspur F.C.
