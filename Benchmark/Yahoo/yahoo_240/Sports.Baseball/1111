why is everyone throwing pete rose into the steroid controversy i've seen a lot of people on this board say something like if bonds gets into the hof then pete rose should be allowed in as well i'm not sure if some of you actually realize what the difference is between what bonds is accused of doing and what rose admitted to doing what bonds is accused of doing at the most would land him a game suspension from baseball and that's if and only if he tests positive for steroids otherwise mlb has no grounds so suspend him and at this point there is no just reason to deny him a bid into the hall of fame rose certainly has the numbers to get in but what he did was so bad he didn't get a slap on the wrist and a game suspension he got banned for life not suspended banned gambling on the game is the worst thing you can do as a player coach owner umpire etc it's worse than taking steroids far worse so why is everyone lumping these two together it's two completely separate issues because people here know nothing about what they are talking about you won't hear that on an educated program you are right they are completely irrelevant but people just think they sound smart when they bring up pete rose Major League Baseball Pete Rose History of baseball in the United States Bud Selig Barry Bonds Chicago White Sox Babe Ruth Ty Cobb San Francisco Giants Rafael Palmeiro Baseball Ben Johnson (athlete) Olympic Games 1919 World Series October 20 in baseball Satchel Paige World Series Sammy Sosa ESPN25 Mike Schmidt Baltimore Orioles The Jim Rome Show Lou Gehrig New York Yankees New York Mets November 3 in baseball Jim Rice August 2005 in sports New York Jets New England Patriots 1957 World Series Bobby Knight 2001 World Series Japanese baseball Bowl Championship Series Boston Red Sox Match fixing New York Knicks November 4 in baseball Jos__ Canseco Reggie Jackson Chicago Cubs Montreal Canadiens The Malice at The Palace Volleyball History of cricket October 29 in baseball Cincinnati Bengals Negro league baseball Arizona State University Los Angeles Clippers National Football League Bob Feller Detroit Tigers Major League Baseball television contracts Mark McGwire Baseball statistics Texas Rangers (baseball) San Francisco 49ers Cincinnati Reds Indiana Pacers November 1 in baseball St. Louis Cardinals Carolina Panthers Major League Baseball All-Star Game Chicago Bulls Mahjong Tennis Oakland Athletics Super Bowl XXVII 1994 baseball strike June 2004 in sports Jim Thorpe The Football League December 2004 in sports John McEnroe Umpire (cricket) Stanley Cup October 22 in baseball Ted Williams Salary cap Softball Sydney Riot of 1879 Australian rules football American football Theory of conduct Essendon Football Club 2005 World Series October 5 in baseball One Tree Hill (TV series) Boston Bruins Philadelphia Eagles Washington Nationals Major League Baseball Players Association Backgammon 2004 World Series
