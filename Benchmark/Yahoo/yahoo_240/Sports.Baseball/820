how to play baseball by myself please answer its really hot here in kentucky right now so both of my parents wont play baseball with me and i need to practice everyday if i want to get good enough i play nd base i throw the ball up and swing and hit it but then i have to go chasing after it which is stupid and draining if you do that a lot so does anyone have any effective ideas on how to play baseball by yourself without buying anything cause i'm broke thanks my mom wont for sure my dad used to play ball almost pro but he said its too hot a heat advisory and all my friends hate baseball so much feilding find a wall somewhere and use either a tennis ball or a softie baseball i guess a real one could work it just doesn't bounce as well off a wall throw the ball against the wall repeatably and field the ball and throw it back this will help a lot if you play nd base i play shortstop in fastpitch softball and i do this all the time since my parents and siblings also never want to play catch this drill has helped me to go from someone the coach always put in right field to the starting shortstop on my all star team batting this drill dose not actually involve hitting the ball but i promise you this will help get a plate or something that can stand as a plate a bat and batting gloves if you wear them in games stand in the batters box and locate the spots on the plate low inside low low ouside middle inside right down the middle middle oustide high inside high high ouside make sure that all the spots are strikes then swing at all the spots go then then then and so on concentrating on taking a great cut and getting the sweet spot on where the ball would be once you get good at it you can swing with your eyes closed at each spot this is good for muscle memory you can also use a tee and move the ball around so that it is at every number and practice your swing also recongnize the good pitches to swing at when the count is in your favor i like and i used this drill to really work on the mechanics of my swing and to learn how to switch it it really helped me a lot i hope that it can help you as well Baseball statistics Batting (cricket) Batting average Babe Ruth Fast bowling 1957 World Series Pitcher Volleyball Baseball Stars Hank Aaron 2004 World Series San Diego Padres Bunt Fielding (cricket) Tag First baseman Laws of cricket Derek Jeter Table tennis 2005 World Series Sandy Koufax Tris Speaker Detroit Tigers St. Louis Cardinals Alex Rodriguez Stolen base Cricket Baseball positions Rounders Ichiro Suzuki Chicago White Sox New York Yankees Wrigley Field Hit by pitch Glossary of American football 2004 American League Championship Series Pedro Mart__nez Satchel Paige World Series Seattle Mariners American football Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Home run Boxing Boston Red Sox Pete Rose Knickerbocker Rules Luis Aparicio New York Giants 1919 World Series Aerial (dance move) Babe Ruth's Called Shot Andr__s Galarraga Cleveland Browns Four square Vin Scully Fenway Park English cricket team Snooker Ken Griffey, Jr. Piccolo Junior Saga Cincinnati Reds Negro league baseball Baseball slang Baseball bat Dodgeball Gary Sheffield Don Hoak Moe Berg Batsman Shot Heard 'Round the World (baseball) Toronto Blue Jays Racquetball Golf History of Test cricket (1890 to 1900) History of baseball in the United States Lou Gehrig Br__nnboll Barry Bonds Rugby union positions Brian Close Manny Ram__rez Super Bowl XXV Basketball
