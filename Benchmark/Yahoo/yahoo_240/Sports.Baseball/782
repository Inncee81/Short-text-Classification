how many hall of famers do you think the boston red sox team from ' until today will produce let's dispense with the two locks pedro and schilling right off the bat pun intended so i'm thinking manny maybe ortiz papelbon has potential as does matsuzaka agree or disagree all this talk of schilling and ortiz being locks is the reason why players aren't elligible for the hof until years after they retire once the excitement settles down i think the only locks are pedro and manny oh and don't be surprised if pedro wears a mets hat ortiz has a shot if he can keep things going remember he spent years as an average hitter for the twins and his best years are similar to jim rice who is no lock but should be in the hall imho same goes for schilling who shone on the national stage in and but otherwise was as good as burt blyleven another good pitcher who isn't hof worthy i'd say the best shot beyond pedro and manny until jp and dice show they can string together a career is theo some day i expect him to get voted in along with his peers brian cashman and billy beane Boston Red Sox 2004 World Series Manny Ram__rez New York Yankees 2004 American League Championship Series New York Mets World Series Toronto Blue Jays Curt Schilling David Ortiz Hank Aaron Jim Rice Oakland Athletics October 22 in baseball October 26 in baseball Reggie Jackson Pedro Mart__nez St. Louis Cardinals October 27 in baseball Designated hitter Philadelphia Phillies Home run Rickey Henderson Houston Astros Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Chicago White Sox October 2004 in sports November 4 in baseball Detroit Tigers October 4 in baseball October 16 in baseball Baseball Pete Rose Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1946 October 21 in baseball San Francisco Giants October 12 in baseball Tris Speaker Theo Epstein No-hitter October 24 in baseball Carl Yastrzemski Ty Cobb Luis Tiant Chicago Cubs San Diego Padres Los Angeles Dodgers Sandy Koufax Batting average Roger Clemens Minnesota Twins Nolan Ryan November 3 in baseball Babe Ruth October 19 in baseball October 31 in baseball Texas Rangers (baseball) 1975 World Series Who's your daddy? 1986 World Series Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1945 1986 National League Championship Series Ted Williams Sammy Sosa Casey Stengel Satchel Paige Arizona Diamondbacks November 2 in baseball October 14 in baseball November 1 in baseball Alex Rodriguez Pittsburgh Pirates Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame Dick Williams Randy Johnson MLB designated hitter statistics Cleveland Indians Johan Santana Bill James Jimmy Piersall Washington Nationals Lou Gehrig Durham Bulls October 28 in baseball Mo Vaughn October 25 in baseball Atlanta Braves Interleague play October 3 in baseball Sabermetrics
