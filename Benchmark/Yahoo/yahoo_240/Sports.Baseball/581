who else got a good laugh from the red sox mariners game i know i did when i saw it on the news the scene with the mascot sorry don't know the name crashing into coco crisp gave me a good laugh and i only say that because he wasn't hurt i got another good one when the coach started yelling at an official about it when did that happen was it before the game or between innings also what did the coach yell about did he think that the mariners were trying to sabotage the red sox well maybe it's one of those things that you'll look back on one day and laugh it reminds me of when randall simon hit the italian sausage on the head during the sausage race at a brewers game no one was hurt in that incident though simon was arrested and had to pay a small fine i think it was an honest mistake fortunately coco crisp wasn't hurt and the people involved were actually very genteel about the whole thing apparently coco was really cool about it and played it off with humor i think the funniest thing about this story is that red sox manager terry francona missed the entire incident because he was in the bathroom d'oh don't you wonder if he came running out of the restroom with his fly unzipped all worried this the mariners mascot tried to kill his center fielder and coach if the moose really did try to take out crisp you just send in big papi in a one on one between the moose and big papi i know which one i'd be betting on and it's not the one with the antlers and the fixed unblinking stare in the mariner's uniform Boston Red Sox 1919 World Series Seattle Mariners 2004 World Series Tris Speaker Cleveland Indians Milwaukee Brewers Chicago White Sox Reggie Jackson New York Yankees Ty Cobb World Series Babe Ruth Piccolo Junior Saga November 1 in baseball Baseball Satchel Paige 2005 World Series Fenway Park Toronto Blue Jays 2004 American League Championship Series Red Sox Nation Home run Ted Williams Shoeless Joe Jackson St. Louis Cardinals Moe Berg Terry Francona Oakland Athletics October 4 in baseball Sandy Koufax Detroit Tigers EastEnders David Ortiz October 9 in baseball 1986 National League Championship Series Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 San Francisco 49ers Pete Rose October 15 in baseball 1986 World Series Randy Johnson Shaggy dog story Crystal Palace F.C.
