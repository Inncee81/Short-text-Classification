good or bad to be a baseball fan for the past days bonds breaks the home run record with the steroid allegations over him including the possiblity of being indicted glavine and his wins could be a loooooooooooooooooong time before someone joins the win clube a rod being the youngest to get to home runs and gettin plunked in toronto lol poor guy i have mixed feelings about these issues very hard to believe any of them dunno whats the truth dunno what the story behind the off field issues etc etc thoughts comments how do you think baseball is going along in general this year especially the past days lol iak ny i don't hate the yankees i just don't think they play team ball thats all i've been hard on them only on that part of the game i mean i don't like a rod but i don't hate him i think he's top players in the game right now im not a bandwagon fan in either sport but i do acknowledge talent when i see them i just don't know what stand to take on baseball for bonds dude took steroids but he wasn't the only one cheating is cheating no matter what the cirumstance is but i think its kinda unfair that he's been the poster child for all this crap but then again he should've been careful lol this thing goes round and round its much more complicated than basketball to be quite honest it's been a bad time to be a baseball fan i'll admit that the records are interesting to see however all of this has taken attention away from the team sport we've seen several individuals recognized but in the end their accomplishments don't mean a lot we watch baseball every year to see which team is the best not which player is the best if you want to watch an individual competition the best place to watch would probably be the olympics where plenty of individuals perform however baseball is a team sport i'm glad that these record chases are over now bonds and the giants can slip back into obscurity where they belong this season and the real sports can continue right now i'm watching the playoff race not a bunch of individuals earning records or milestones Barry Bonds Major League Baseball Hank Aaron World Series San Francisco Giants Playoff New York Yankees Los Angeles Dodgers Baseball St. Louis Cardinals Ty Cobb History of baseball in the United States Satchel Paige Atlanta Braves Babe Ruth Home run Major League Baseball television contracts Pete Rose International League New York Mets New York Giants Sports timeline Playoff format Toronto Blue Jays Oakland Athletics Reggie Jackson Chicago Cubs Seattle Mariners Troy Glaus National Football League Boston Red Sox National Basketball Association Toronto Maple Leafs John Smoltz Rickey Henderson Carolina Panthers New York Knicks Houston Astros Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Norway national football team Mois__s Alou Pittsburgh Pirates Texas Rangers (baseball) Baseball Stars Ben Johnson (athlete) Baltimore Orioles Cincinnati Reds Sandy Koufax Detroit Tigers Minor league baseball Cleveland Indians Chicago White Sox 1957 World Series Alex Rodriguez San Diego Padres Yankee Stadium Pittsburgh Steelers Shot Heard 'Round the World (baseball) Cincinnati Bengals Negro league baseball Philadelphia Phillies Darryl Strawberry New York Jets Tris Speaker Topps Willie Mays Wayne Gretzky Miami Dolphins Jim Thorpe Nolan Ryan October 27 in baseball Toronto Raptors Miguel Tejada Cleveland Browns Andre Agassi Gary Sheffield 1981 baseball strike Baseball statistics Al Michaels Olympic Games Derek Jeter Volleyball Boston Bruins Robin Ventura September 2005 in sports Hal Trosky Professional wrestling slang Mike Schmidt 2005 World Series
