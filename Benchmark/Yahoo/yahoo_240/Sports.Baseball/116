ruth aaron or bonds of these three who do you feel achieved the most in baseball and why i think ruth definitely had more of an impact on the game i always liked hank aaron and while i don't like him i can at least somewhat appreciate barry bonds however ruth has been retired from baseball for years and dead for will people still recall aaron and bonds as fondly as they do the babe when they have been gone for so long ruth's home runs probably saved baseball after the world series was thrown by the white sox if not for him baseball might not even exist today and if it did it most likely be a different game then we know today the livening up of the ball the abolishment of the spitball and other changes in the game were put into place simply to let people see more home runs without someone like ruth these changes very likely would have not taken place and baseball might now be a mere footnote in sports history as for his achievements he definitely ranks up there in the greatest of all time but i think what will really live on is that he was exactly the type of player baseball needed at that time while i can appreciate a lot of the later players and probably would say that there are at least a handful of players that were probably better all around ballplayers then ruth his legend and his legacy will live forever bonds and aaron will certainly be remembered but probably not with the same fondness that ruth continues to enjoy today Babe Ruth Hank Aaron Home run Barry Bonds Baseball World Series Ty Cobb New York Yankees Boston Red Sox Reggie Jackson Major League Baseball Ted Williams Tris Speaker Lou Gehrig Atlanta Braves September 20 in baseball History of baseball in the United States Nolan Ryan October 16 in baseball Chicago White Sox Curse of the Bambino October 22 in baseball No-hitter Shoeless Joe Jackson St. Louis Cardinals Rickey Henderson September 6 in baseball Ted Radcliffe San Francisco Giants Alex Rodriguez June 12 in baseball Babe Ruth's Called Shot Red Sox Nation 2005 World Series Baseball Stars Sports timeline Negro league baseball October 4 in baseball October 7 in baseball Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry Cincinnati Reds David Ortiz Bowie Kuhn October 20 in baseball Chicago Cubs San Diego Padres Old Time Baseball Albert Pujols Mark McGwire Top 500 home run hitters of all time Dead-ball era October 15 in baseball 1957 World Series Jimmie Foxx October 27 in baseball Joe DiMaggio Philadelphia Phillies Johnny Bench Minor league baseball Polo Grounds Gary Sheffield New York Mets October 8 in baseball October 5 in baseball ESPN25 October 21 in baseball Roger Clemens Baseball statistics Hal Trosky Detroit Tigers Roger Maris Eddie Mathews Baltimore Orioles Yankee Stadium Sammy Sosa Los Angeles Dodgers Stolen base Jim Rice Sandy Koufax Satchel Paige Milwaukee Brewers Mickey Mantle Toronto Blue Jays Carlton Fisk Baseball Hall of Fame 2004 American League Championship Series 1986 World Series Troy Glaus
