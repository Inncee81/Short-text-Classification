does anyone else think that bud selig looks very unprofessional for the way that he's treated barry bonds the guy holds some amazing records only guy in the homer stolen bases club and only guy in the club mvp awards when none of his peers have ever had more than i just think that since barry has never been proven guilty of anything selig should awknowledge the importance of the feat the fact that he isn't in san francisco for this week's giant home games makes me lose all respect for the man i know he's a good friend of hank aaron i know that everybody thinks that barry did steroids and i know that barry is a jerk sometimes the fans can judge the man but under the circumstances that everyone is innocent until proven guilty i think selig should be more professional right now he just looks like a spoiled little kid throwing a temper tantrum michaele i never said that i just now lost all respect for selig i said that the way he's treated barry has made me lose all respect for selig i had lost most of my respect for the guy a long time ago but this whole thing completely put the guy on douche bag status anyway there are way too many good answers here we'll have to put this one up to a vote thanks for the input people i think that he has been unproffessional he's just mad because the steroid era happened under his watch and since barry was the best player of the steroid era he is taking his anger out on him also if hes so upset about this why doesn't he gather the courage to just come out and say that he doesn't like barry Barry Bonds Major League Baseball Hank Aaron World Series Bud Selig History of baseball in the United States Willie Mays San Francisco Giants 2005 World Series Babe Ruth 1957 World Series Theory of conduct New York Giants Pete Rose St. Louis Cardinals Tris Speaker Major League Baseball All-Star Game Troy Glaus Home run Hulk Hogan Pittsburgh Steelers Cincinnati Bengals October 4 in baseball Oakland Athletics 1994 baseball strike Montr__al Expos Major League Baseball television contracts Andr__s Galarraga Futurama (TV series - season 4) Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels Friends San Francisco 49ers Babe Ruth's Called Shot Rickey Henderson Humphrey Bogart Los Angeles Clippers NBA Finals Jos__ Canseco ESPN25 EastEnders Milwaukee Brewers Barry Goldwater Time Out of Mind New York Jets Washington Nationals 2004 World Series Detroit Tigers 2005 trial of Michael Jackson St. Louis Rams Canon (fiction) Ted Williams Texas Rangers (baseball) December 2004 in sports Big Brother (USA TV series) Jeff Kent Chicago Bulls Ty Cobb Atlanta Braves Ben Johnson (athlete) October 20 in baseball September 2005 in sports Vin Scully Mark McGwire October 22 in baseball Pittsburgh Pirates Toronto Blue Jays Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Rick Barry October 5 in baseball I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Rafael Palmeiro September 2004 in sports Manny Ram__rez Pedro Mart__nez Cincinnati Reds The Catcher in the Rye Extreme Programming Sport Super Bowl Nicomachean Ethics Kimi Finster Eisner Award Philadelphia Eagles Florida Marlins Roger Clemens The Smoking Room New England Patriots Cleveland Browns Albert Pujols Miami Dolphins Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an San Antonio Spurs National Football League Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Bee Gees
