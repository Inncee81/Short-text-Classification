if it's possible is it a good deal for yankees to trade wang to boston for dice k not at all wang is established as an elite pitcher in the al this is his second full year in the league and he is in the top in era again he also has wins already in less than years he has errors and is first in putouts at his position in his last starts hes only lost once and has gone over innings in all those games and he is a hell of alot cheaper than dice k brettj to answer that question he has a hard sinker and gets a ton of double plays and the majority of his outs are ground balls so there arent that many sac flies ive seen almost every yankee game this year and the way wang lets up runs is pretty much back to back to back singles Baseball statistics 1957 World Series 2004 American League Championship Series Boston Red Sox 2005 World Series Baseball 2004 World Series World Series 2003 World Series No-hitter Reggie Jackson Pedro Mart__nez Tris Speaker October 4 in baseball Pete Rose New York Yankees Home run Perfect game Softball San Francisco Giants Oakland Athletics Toronto Blue Jays October 7 in baseball 1986 World Series Baseball scorekeeping Robin Ventura St. Louis Cardinals Satchel Paige Manny Ram__rez Randy Johnson 2001 World Series October 5 in baseball Earned run average Baseball Stars Babe Ruth Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry October 25 in baseball New York Mets October 14 in baseball Roger Clemens Chicago White Sox Red Sox Nation Luis Aparicio Alex Rodriguez Pittsburgh Pirates Seattle Mariners October 22 in baseball October 15 in baseball Curse of the Bambino October 1 in baseball Houston Astros David Wells Cleveland Indians Cincinnati Reds Byung-Hyun Kim Sandy Koufax New York Giants 1919 World Series Box score (baseball) Grover Cleveland Alexander Chien-Ming Wang Jamie Moyer 1986 American League Championship Series October 19 in baseball Interference (baseball) Chicago Cubs Table tennis San Diego Padres Rocky Colavito September 20 in baseball Bill Buckner International League Marius Russo Hank Aaron Atlanta Braves Yankee Stadium Andr__s Galarraga November 3 in baseball Luis Tiant Luke Appling John Smoltz Volleyball Fenway Park Pitcher David Cone Bob Friend Major League Baseball television contracts Rich Gedman 1986 National League Championship Series October 26 in baseball October 13 in baseball Los Angeles Dodgers Tim Wakefield Troy Glaus Milt Pappas
