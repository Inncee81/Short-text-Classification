red sox question who here is tired of everyone saying the red sox are done just cause the yanks are games behind and they have won out of and the sox have lost out of and are now going home to face the worst team in baseball the rays and the yankees are playing the orioles who swept them at home last time they played them i don't like all the red sox should be worried questions because the last time i checked the red sox were still the ones in the lead the yankees are the ones that should be worried they are still not a lock for the playoffs and they have been playing way better than they should be if i were the yankees i would be disappointed that i am not in the lead of the east at this point since when is it ok for the yankees to win the wild card i thought the wild card was a bad idea oh that is only when the red sox get it and end up beating the yankees to go on to win the world series oh i understand i would be alot more worried if i was the team on the outside looking in then i would being the red sox who just have to play ball the rest of the season don't worry the yankees will lose it will happen and when they do it will be the second worst defeat in all of sports imagine losing a series when you are up then three years later being down games then coming all the way back only to miss out on the playoffs after the red sox beat you at the end of the year sucks doesn't it too bad yankee fans Boston Red Sox World Series 2005 World Series Curse of the Bambino Cleveland Indians Baltimore Orioles New York Yankees Chicago White Sox St. Louis Cardinals Cincinnati Reds Red Sox Nation San Francisco Giants Reggie Jackson Seattle Mariners October 4 in baseball Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Toronto Blue Jays Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry International League New York Giants October 1 in baseball Houston Astros 1957 World Series New York Mets 2004 American League Championship Series Chicago Cubs Los Angeles Dodgers Major League Baseball television contracts Oakland Athletics Atlanta Braves Curt Schilling Dick Williams 2004 World Series October 9 in baseball Babe Ruth October 3 in baseball Satchel Paige Detroit Tigers October 15 in baseball Philadelphia Phillies Playoff Florida Marlins Interleague play October 16 in baseball New York Knicks October 5 in baseball Pete Rose Tim McCarver October 12 in baseball NBA Finals October 10 in baseball Miami Dolphins Tris Speaker Alex Rodriguez 1986 World Series 1919 World Series Derek Jeter 2003 World Series Manny Ram__rez Pittsburgh Steelers October 19 in baseball Wild card San Diego Padres October 2004 in sports Luis Aparicio Texas Rangers (baseball) National Hockey League rivalries Milwaukee Brewers September 2005 in sports June 2 in baseball October 7 in baseball Los Angeles Kings National Football League Lore Sandy Koufax Cleveland Browns 2002-03 NHL season Cincinnati Bengals October 14 in baseball October 21 in baseball Pedro Mart__nez Michael Jordan New England Patriots Pennant playoff ESPN25 San Francisco 49ers White Sox-Cubs rivalry October 27 in baseball Pawtucket Red Sox Sammy Sosa No-hitter Indianapolis Colts October 2005 in sports October 17 in baseball New York Islanders Curse of the Billy Goat Gary Sheffield
