is alex gordon going to be a good mlb player next year the royals shouldn't have started him and batted him fifth yes ryan braun was handed the three spot pretty quickly but he also spent time in aaa gordon much like greinke had the hopes of an entire city upon his shoulders he was supposed to be the savior however playing on the royals can be well trying on players i wish he'd be sent back to aaa so he can regain his confidence instead the royals are tossing him out there with the hopes that he learns along the way i don't know why they bother each ab he takes in the majors now is another ab closer to the day he'll out perform his salary there and i don't say that to be mean spirited i know plenty of kc fans they despise the royals ownership because players like johnny damon and carlos beltran are too costly to keep taking all this into account i believe that gordon will be a much better player next year but he's got to have confidence or even just plain arrogance to make things work in kc Boston Red Sox Toronto Blue Jays Detroit Tigers International League Texas Rangers (baseball) New York Yankees Houston Astros New York Giants 1957 World Series Pittsburgh Pirates World Series Alex Rodriguez Major League Baseball Baseball Nolan Ryan Alex Ferguson Dave Kingman Los Angeles Dodgers Sammy Sosa Satchel Paige Andr__s Galarraga Indianapolis 500 Major League Baseball television contracts Batting average Cleveland Browns New York Mets Johnny Damon 2004 American League Championship Series San Diego Padres 2004 World Series Seattle Mariners Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Orlando Magic Oasis (band) Oakland Athletics Scott Podsednik Noel Gallagher Milton H.
