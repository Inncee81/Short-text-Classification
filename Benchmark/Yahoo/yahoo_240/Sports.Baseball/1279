do you think it's fair for barry bond's record to be compared to a legend like hank aaron i don't think it's right to compare to the records of a legend like hank aaron to a modern player like barry bonds today more and more baseball players take performance enhancing drugs things that didn't exist during the hey day of babe ruth and hank aaron these legendary players got those impressive records through nothing but sheer talent it's not fair to me to compare barry bonds when it's obvious he's taken some kind of performance enhancing drug um you don't go from weighing pounds to now looking like arnold swarzenagger i think it's sad that today's players can only reach the legendary player's records by using drugs and i think it's shameful that the baseball league is so lax about saying someone broke the record of so and so well no they would never have broken that record if he weren't a druggie it's not an apples to apples comparison opinions i don't think it's ever fair to compare records from different era's steroids or not Barry Bonds Hank Aaron Home run History of baseball in the United States Major League Baseball Babe Ruth Ty Cobb Baseball September 20 in baseball Rafael Palmeiro Nolan Ryan World Series St. Louis Cardinals Rickey Henderson Hank Greenberg Lou Gehrig September 6 in baseball 1957 World Series Oakland Athletics Top 500 home run hitters of all time Babe Ruth's Called Shot Bowie Kuhn Mark McGwire Atlanta Braves June 12 in baseball Jimmie Foxx Minor league baseball Albert Pujols Major League Baseball titles streaks Dallas Cowboys June 8 in baseball Los Angeles Dodgers Sandy Koufax Alex Rodriguez San Francisco Giants 2004 World Series Sports timeline Major League Baseball television contracts Baseball Stars Sammy Sosa The Basement Tapes Eddie Mathews November 2 in baseball Donovan Joe DiMaggio October 20 in baseball October 7 in baseball Detroit Tigers Baseball bat Stolen base Negro league baseball Manny Ram__rez Tris Speaker Ted Williams Jim Rice Gary Sheffield Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2005 All-Star Baseball David Ortiz Polo Grounds 1919 World Series Major League Baseball Players Association No-hitter Major League Baseball titles leaders October 4 in baseball Ted Radcliffe Cincinnati Reds The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll Todd Helton Blonde on Blonde Perfect game Modernism (music) Rush Limbaugh Ben Johnson (athlete) Troy Glaus October 5 in baseball Batting order (baseball) Clinical depression Baltimore Orioles Hey Jude Chicago White Sox Milwaukee Brewers Dale Murphy Leeds United F.C.
