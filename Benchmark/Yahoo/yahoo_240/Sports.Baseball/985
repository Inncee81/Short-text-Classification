baseball tryouts please answer i know im a girl and blah blah but im trying out for rec baseball and then varsity so tryouts aren't until early march but what should i do to prepar in the off season i live in kentucky so going outside in the off season winter is out of the question i play nd base thanks and what do you think ill have to do at tryouts so what should i do to get better at everything hitting ndbaseman etc what do we do at tryouts thanks peace here are some exercises that really helped me back in high school and college and sorry this will be kind of long fielding you will need to have someone to help you a racquetball and a blank wall you stand with your glove ready to take a ground ball your helper stands behind you and throws the racquetball at the wall and you field it as it comes back after the ricochet i chose a racquetball because they are bouncier and can be faster start off at a decent distance like feet away from the wall or where ever it starts to become challenging for you and repeat until it becomes easy then move up a foot once you can get to about or feet without missing any you will be an all star infielder batting you will need a pack of wiffle golf balls some high test fishing line and a broom stick tie one end of the string to a high place and the other to the golf ball what you want is to have the golf ball hanging at about your waste and then just hit it over and over with the broom stick this will increase your hand eye coordination better than anything else i have found i would recommend not hitting a regular baseball with a regular bat for like a week while you re doing this that way when you do it will be like hitting a beach ball with a x running to increase speed you will need a skateboard a blank wall and a backpack hold the skateboard long ways in both hands and stand feet from a wall lean forward until your body is at an angle and the skateboard wheels are on the wall then just do squats this builds the muscles that help you take off from a dead stop to increase difficulty as you adjust increase the angle and put on a back pack with books or weights as far as what to expect from tryouts all schools are different but ill share with you what my tryouts were like my tryouts were spaced over several days with each day devoted to a specific area like hitting running and fielding with hitting they first had us bat against a pitching machine then later on against a live person and had us run it out like it was live fielding they had us take every defensive position and hit to us over and over with only a second or two between they judged us on the amount of balls we fielded and the accuracy and speed of our throws to the target running they had us run from home to first first to second second to third and third to home in spurts and timed each they then made us round the bases at full speed and timed it they made us steal second from first on a live pitcher and catcher they also made us run the perimeter of the entire field so be prepared to do a lot of work during the tryouts Skateboarding trick Fast bowling Volleyball Cricket Sandy Koufax Laws of cricket Pitcher 1957 World Series 2004 World Series Tris Speaker Andr__s Galarraga Babe Ruth Ty Cobb Fenway Park Fielding (cricket) First baseman Batting (cricket) Glossary of American football World Series Pete Rose Billiards Racquetball New York Giants 2005 English cricket season Internal ballistics Marching band Weight training Equine conformation Canadian football Golf Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Four square Baseball scorekeeping Wrigley Field Archery Squash (sport) Rugby union Aerial (dance move) Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory International League 2004 American League Championship Series Swingout GunZ The Duel Baseball positions Barry Bonds 2005 World Series Poker jargon Breaststroke Interference (baseball) Stolen base The Joker's Wild Golf club (equipment) English cricket team Curling Batting average Gary Sheffield Reggie Jackson Polo Grounds Boxing New York Mets Hank Aaron National Football League Willie Mays Rugby union positions Textile manufacturing Dodgeball Baserunning Guilty Gear Professional wrestling throws Motorcycle Chicago White Sox October 4 in baseball Yankee Stadium Professional wrestling holds M16 (rifle) Jeopardy!
