how big of an impact will loosing alfonso soriano for two weeks to a month have on the chicago cubs soriano last night left the game with a sprained quad he will be out weeks he also leads the team in homeruns will it have a negative impact on the push for the playoffs positive any thoughts are welcome obviously they will miss his bat but this may be an opportunity to try more of a true lead off hitter out i would hope that when soriano does come back they will have found someone my thought would be having theriot and fontenot at the top of the lineup that does a good enough job to stay in that slot and get soriano hitting th behind lee and ramirez i hate to see a guy with that much pop hitting with nobody on base it might end up being good for them in the long run the role players have for the most part done a good job filling in when necessary so far this year and i see no reason why that won't continue 2003 World Series Alex Rodriguez Home run Texas Rangers (baseball) Toronto Blue Jays Baseball St. Louis Cardinals Babe Ruth Troy Glaus Sammy Sosa Chicago Cubs 2001 World Series Pete Rose Gary Sheffield Andr__s Galarraga November 1 in baseball Boston Red Sox World Series Detroit Tigers International League Hank Aaron 1957 World Series Chicago White Sox 2004 World Series Manny Ram__rez Pittsburgh Pirates Satchel Paige Robin Ventura Cap Anson Sandy Koufax Pittsburgh Steelers Seattle Mariners New York Giants Batting average Cleveland Indians David Ortiz Major League Baseball All-Star Game Cincinnati Reds Atlanta Braves Baseball Stars Hal Trosky Scott Podsednik Major League Baseball television contracts Derek Jeter Baltimore Orioles October 21 in baseball San Diego Padres Oakland Athletics Wrigley Field Florida Marlins Grover Cleveland Alexander Cincinnati Bengals Designated hitter Chicago Bulls July 2004 in sports Box score (baseball) Houston Astros Tris Speaker Baseball statistics Ozzie Smith Albert Pujols Indiana Pacers Tony Oliva National Football League NBA Finals Batting order (baseball) $ale of the Century Poker jargon National Football League Lore 2004 American League Championship Series October 3 in baseball Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Cleveland Browns 1919 World Series Ty Cobb October 31 in baseball Ellis Burks Felipe Alou Chuck Klein Super Bowl XXI Curse of the Bambino Torii Hunter Luke Appling Ravi Shastri Brian Roberts New England Patriots Volleyball Montreal Canadiens San Francisco Giants Jim Rice Byung-Hyun Kim 1986 World Series Lou Gehrig Mario Lemieux Miami Dolphins Rudy York
