blue jays v s alex rodriguez did you see the game well if you did you no what happend today and and i think what the blue jays are trying to do was wrong cant they move on what alex did last time they went to toronto was not the best thing but trying to hithim twice thats not good but what i did like is that then posada hit a double and runs came in so take that finally in the th roger retaliated he stuck up for his team i really admire that well what did you think about jaba chamberlin i agree with you it was very wrong for the blue jays to do that if you think about it josh towers was the one who started it today instead of being a mature adult that doesn't hold grudges he intentionally hits a rod and then when a rod is on first doing nothing but standing there and chewing his gum towers yells something at him which started a fight i was hoping that posada would hit well and he did i agree that what a rod did was wrong but they were winning anyway i like how roger did that too but he had a two hitter going joba chambelain is really good i like him Toronto Blue Jays 2003 World Series 2004 American League Championship Series World Series Alex Rodriguez New York Yankees 2001 World Series 1993 World Series Rogers Centre Toronto Raptors Roberto Alomar Seattle Mariners Boston Red Sox Batting average Joe Carter Hank Aaron Home run 1957 World Series Tris Speaker November 1 in baseball Texas Rangers (baseball) Satchel Paige Roger Clemens Yankee Stadium Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry Barry Bonds Philadelphia Phillies Alex Gonz__lez Shawn Green Interleague play Reggie Jackson October 12 in baseball Atlanta Braves October 2004 in sports Jorge Posada The Contender (television series) Detroit Tigers Baseball statistics Montr__al Expos Topps 1919 World Series Roger Maris Chicago White Sox Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim September 20 in baseball The Price Is Right Ice hockey October 20 in baseball Guiding Light Avenue Q Red Sox Nation October 13 in baseball John Olerud Sin City Baseball Detroit Red Wings Indianapolis 500 Alex Ferguson New York Giants October 14 in baseball October 5 in baseball Houston Astros Volleyball Major League Baseball All-Star Game Tower of Druaga Interference (baseball) Mark McGwire October 4 in baseball TSN September 2005 in sports Curt Schilling 1992 World Series 1994 baseball strike Tag Sammy Sosa Dave Winfield New York Rangers Top 500 home run hitters of all time St. Louis Cardinals Roger Federer Double the Fist True Crime: Streets of LA Poker jargon Toronto Argonauts Brian Close October 21 in baseball Rod Laver Ty Cobb Piccolo Junior Saga October 3 in baseball Andre Agassi The Joker's Wild Doug Ault Jeff Kent National Hockey League All-Star Game The Suffering (game) American League George Bell (baseball player) Babe Ruth
