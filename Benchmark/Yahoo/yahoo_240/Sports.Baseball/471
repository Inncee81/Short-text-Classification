roger clemens will he be exposed recently i read that the judges were asking for info on the grimsley scandal supposedly to give it to mitchell it was denied at the momemt and rumor has it clemens and his personal trainer brian mcnamee was yet again on the affidavit so the question is is roger clemens a steroid user or not and if he is what will be his fate never just as giambi fell apart and many users do sooner or later clemens fell apart in this last few seasons at fenway although no one says that he pulled himself together very late in his last season and must have discovered something of the sort of which thz or whatever it's called relates he expanded and he became far bigger stronger but he's also created an identity of a work program since then he's no dummy for cover who knows selig and mlb's brass are full of it they are selling a game to us and that's all not protecting integrity etc clemens is way up on a pedestal and is a mil investment now think about it and while you're on this thought which is pure reality and not the stuff selig wants you to express know that's there's already a juicer in the hall from the steroid era no matter what writers drivel on about and relay about mcgwire etc etc after full seasons of hrs and hrs he boomed to larger muscle mass easily seen on baseball cards and changed from a speedy but not that fast little cf to a hr hitting ever smiling sensation of a home grown happy faced black man in the whitest part of america yup kirby puckett people just don't want to know that or even discuss it and would rather pretend it wasn't done by what of mlb'ers and probably of nfl'ers just call it the steroid era and move on but grill check every mlber nearly every week from now on and stop playing games Boston Red Sox Major League Baseball History of baseball in the United States World Series Barry Bonds Home run Jason Giambi Baseball Houston Astros Oakland Athletics Andr__s Galarraga Roger Clemens Los Angeles Dodgers Mark McGwire Bud Selig New York Yankees St. Louis Cardinals Jos__ Canseco San Francisco Giants Playoff Major League Baseball All-Star Game Toronto Blue Jays MLB on FOX 2005 World Series National Football League Babe Ruth Pedro Mart__nez Pete Rose Detroit Tigers Baltimore Orioles San Francisco 49ers Washington Nationals Satchel Paige Red Sox Nation Randy Johnson Jim Rice Nolan Ryan 2003 World Series Kirby Puckett Texas Rangers (baseball) October 2005 in sports Leo Frank October 22 in baseball Manny Ram__rez Fenway Park Extreme Programming Cleveland Browns Washington Redskins October 1 in baseball 1986 World Series Miguel Tejada Mike Greenwell New England Patriots Plame affair Sammy Sosa 1919 World Series 1987 World Series Luis Tiant Los Angeles Clippers Baltimore Ravens Negro league baseball National Football League Lore Cleveland Indians 1994 baseball strike December 2004 in sports Wrigley Field Chicago Cubs Texas Longhorn Athletics Buffalo Bills Knots Landing Minnesota Twins Baby boomer 2001 World Series Dave Henderson Roswell UFO incident ESPN25 Stolen base 1981 baseball strike Tris Speaker David Wells Las Vegas metropolitan area Miami Dolphins Hulk Hogan Hal Trosky Rafael Palmeiro Sandy Koufax Dave Kingman 2004 American League Championship Series EastEnders 1957 World Series American football Big Brother (USA TV series)
