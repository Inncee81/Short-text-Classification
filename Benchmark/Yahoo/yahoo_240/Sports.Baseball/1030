steroid use and gambling are the same in any sport especially baseball and let me tell you why if you don't agree tell me why with a well thought out answer the reason why i believe steroid use is analogous to gambling is because they inevitably are the same thing let me explain let's say you're a player or a manager and you call your bookie to place a wager on a mlb game let's say for instance you are betting on a red sox yankee game and you take the over for a dime meaning you are betting dollars on the game and you are taking the over in total runs scored las vegas sets the lines let's say the over under for this particular game is runs that means if the combined total is or more you win ok here is where the argument comes in that steroid use by ballplay players is just as bad as betting on a game especially the over because if some of the red sox players like manny ortiz etc and some of the yankees like giambi rodriguez etc are juicing on steroids they are more apt to hit more home runs and inevitably over inflate the total runs scored in the game and thus creating an over in the runs which allows the manager i e rose or whoever or even a player or fan to win that bet so in essence the steroid use creates a market for people to gamble on games especially taking the over because there will be more power more hits more home runs and in the end higher scoring games salty what are you talking about man you can bet on the over unders in baseball games duh find a bookie they take that action and yes las vegas does set the lines and go there sometime they have a place called the sports book it's legal there to bet on games i have bet many over unders there true the ballplayers are using steroids to help their numbers their stats which inevitably make them more cash especially in contract years yes roids do help you hit more hr's i e the entire juiced ball era from brady andersons luis gonzalez over sammy over mcgwire bonds don't you think all of this scoring helped out with the overs in many games that people bet on yes they did because more runs were scored because of it so players take steroids to help their personal stats but in the end those over inflated stats wind up making a lot of gamblers a lot of money especially if they take the overs do your research laying low vegas sets lines on all games every sport what are you talking about every day you can get a bet in on any sport vegas sets lines for everything you can go to a lot of websites and bet www youwager com is one of them click on view lines everyday and you'll see the over unders and the point spreads money lines whatever they get all this info from vegas that's where the center is that's why there will never be a sports team in any of the major sports in vegas mmmk Boston Red Sox History of baseball in the United States Chicago White Sox Babe Ruth Baseball Major League Baseball Home run Jos__ Canseco Craps Pete Rose Barry Bonds World Series Mark McGwire 2004 American League Championship Series Detroit Tigers Sammy Sosa St. Louis Cardinals Tris Speaker International League Oakland Athletics Ty Cobb Blackjack Major League Baseball television contracts Poker jargon Satchel Paige Jason Giambi Alex Rodriguez Slot machine Manny Ram__rez Baseball statistics Los Angeles Dodgers Reggie Jackson Toronto Blue Jays Las Vegas metropolitan area Miguel Tejada Red Sox Nation October 4 in baseball Troy Glaus Spread betting David Ortiz ESPN25 Hank Aaron Chicago Cubs 2005 World Series New York Mets September 6 in baseball 1981 baseball strike Seattle Mariners Pedro Mart__nez Baltimore Orioles October 20 in baseball Roulette November 3 in baseball October 22 in baseball 1981 World Series October 12 in baseball Texas Rangers (baseball) History of Test cricket (to 1883) Curt Schilling October 26 in baseball Cricket Baccarat Bill James Gary Sheffield Cleveland Indians Las Vegas, Nevada Batting average MLB on FOX National Football League Betting (poker) Lou Gehrig October 27 in baseball Salary cap October 16 in baseball Match fixing Rickey Henderson Sabermetrics Atlanta Braves 1975 World Series Baseball Stars October 1 in baseball Super Bowl XXXVIII San Diego Padres Softball Cincinnati Reds Montr__al Expos Brady Anderson July 2004 in sports Jim Rice Derek Jeter
