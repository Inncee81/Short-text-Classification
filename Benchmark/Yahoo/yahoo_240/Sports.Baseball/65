is danny haren the best pitcher in the al yahoo fantasy baseball ranks him the best in the american league based on his stats which are pretty darn good they rank him above johan who is probably the most dominant pitcher of the st century so far in terms of start to start baseball who is the more dominant pitcher who would win the cy young right now danny haren has many shaky starts thats the difference between him and johan everytime johan goes out to the mound he strikes out a bunch of players and usually does not give up too many earned runs ive seen haren pitch live and he can lose his concentration often and ive seen him collapse under pressure johan is just a beast on the mound and hes always a second half player if you had to give the cy young out right now i would say haren earned it over johan but it would have been very close by the end of the year johan will probably win the cy young cause thats what he does the second half of the season Baseball Baseball statistics Nolan Ryan 2004 World Series Pitcher St. Louis Cardinals Roger Clemens 1919 World Series Sandy Koufax Johan Santana World Series International League Pedro Mart__nez Win (baseball) Pittsburgh Pirates Curt Schilling Mark Mulder Cincinnati Reds 2005 World Series Batting average Oakland Athletics Greg Maddux John Smoltz Detroit Tigers Randy Johnson Chicago Cubs 2004 American League Championship Series Satchel Paige Atlanta Braves 1981 baseball strike Major League Baseball Hank Aaron Baseball Stars Tris Speaker Carl Yastrzemski 1903 World Series Los Angeles Dodgers Seattle Mariners Softball Fantasy baseball Whitey Ford Jamie Moyer Sabermetrics November 3 in baseball Houston Astros Kansas City Royals 1986 World Series San Francisco Giants 1981 World Series Major League Baseball All-Star Game Hideo Nomo Norway national football team Chicago White Sox Philadelphia Phillies Robin Ventura Playoff Bob Friend Grover Cleveland Alexander Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim October 19 in baseball Cy Young New York Mets Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry Babe Ruth Cinergy Field Alex Rodriguez Reggie Jackson Bob Gibson Dennis Eckersley October 14 in baseball Fernando Valenzuela October 30 in baseball Pete Rose Ty Cobb October 16 in baseball June 2 in baseball Babe Ruth's Called Shot Negro league baseball Connie Mack (baseball) Don Newcombe November 2 in baseball Japanese baseball Montr__al Expos October 3 in baseball Florida Marlins No-hitter Tom Seaver Sammy Sosa Hal Newhouser September 28 in baseball
