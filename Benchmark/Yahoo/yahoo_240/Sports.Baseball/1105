why do managers argue why do they come out and argue over a call the ump made but of the time the call stands why are umps so reluctant to change the call there's a lot of reasons managers argue with umpires they argue with the umpire to try and get the call changed this rarely works because umpires are judged evaluated by the commisioner's office and if they reverse calls it looks like they second guess themselves and looks poorly on their decision making managers argue to try and get into the umpire's head to perhaps get a call later in the game if a manager argues with the ump and the ump thinks he made a mistake then perhaps a questionable call later in the game he might give the arguing manager's team benefit of the doubt to try and even things out over the long run doesn't always happen but it's a possibility managers try to fire up their team by getting into an argument a struggling team sees their manager giving his all during the argument and they get fired up themselves to go to battle with their leader who may be ejected Umpire (baseball) Umpire (cricket) Sydney Riot of 1879 Philosophical skepticism Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Judicial activism Theory of conduct History of Test cricket (1884 to 1889) Theodicy 1957 World Series The Apprentice 2 Baseball Laws of cricket Test cricket 1919 World Series Reggie Jackson Babe Ruth Don Denkinger Referee Leg before wicket Major League Baseball Tommy Connolly Ontological argument Extreme Programming Appeal Turing test Home run Chicago Cubs Official (American football) David Hume Tennis Workplace democracy Fathers' rights Deconstruction Resurrection of Jesus Sammy Sosa Microeconomics Melbourne Cricket Ground Australian rules football Goodness and value theory Free will Intelligent design Essendon Football Club Union for a Popular Movement Interference (baseball) Heckler & Koch MP5 Ad hominem New Orleans Saints Appeal play Stare decisis Cy Rigler Debate Ty Cobb Grandview, U.S.A.
