question to yankee fans jays fans and others do you think after last night the blue jays will get better as a team and perform better offensively the yankees are pumped but im jsut asking what about josh towers will burnett help following the jays has been quite the rollercoaster with a game win streak as the highlight they have such a hard time putting a good run together and it seems their spirit can be broken easily that said last night's beatdown was encouraging especially frank thomas' hitting as he's pledged to make good for his crappy first half over the rest of the season the playoffs certainly aren't impossible esp if glaus can get out of his slump they need to get the mark a bit farther in the rearview before the wild card is a serious topic towers has been solid i hope that burnett doesn't screw things up because the rotation has been great he's pretty hit or miss but can probably handle the pressure better come september over someone like litsch or towers if there's any pressure to be felt the yankees look to be headed to the postseason but i think they're rotation is going to hit a slump soon those old aces have just been around too long however it won't matter if they're scoring runs a game so we'll see Toronto Blue Jays Boston Red Sox Cleveland Browns Florida Marlins New York Giants St. Louis Cardinals Chicago White Sox New York Yankees 2003 World Series International League Cleveland Indians Atlanta Braves Detroit Tigers 2001 World Series Seattle Mariners 2005 World Series Miami Dolphins Cincinnati Reds Troy Glaus Chicago Cubs Alex Rodriguez October 4 in baseball Ty Cobb Houston Astros Pete Rose Los Angeles Dodgers Mario Lemieux Pittsburgh Steelers September 2005 in sports Milwaukee Brewers Babe Ruth Reggie Jackson 2004 World Series Major League Baseball television contracts Robin Ventura Baltimore Ravens New York Mets Toronto Raptors National Football League October 2004 in sports Indianapolis Colts San Diego Padres 1981 baseball strike Red Sox Nation National Football League Lore Buffalo Bills Carolina Panthers Baltimore Orioles Playoff Utah Jazz 2004 American League Championship Series New York Knicks Lou Gehrig Indiana Pacers Volleyball Satchel Paige Montr__al Expos New York Jets Minnesota Twins 1987 World Series October 16 in baseball Poker jargon October 1 in baseball Los Angeles Kings San Francisco Giants Pedro Mart__nez NBA Finals Hank Aaron October 12 in baseball Super Bowl XXV Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry 1993 World Series 1994 baseball strike Shot Heard 'Round the World (baseball) October 3 in baseball Baseball Super Bowl XXXIV Cincinnati Bengals St. Louis Blues (hockey) Professional wrestling slang Curse of the Bambino Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Derek Jeter Diving Montreal Canadiens October 10 in baseball October 21 in baseball Willie Mays Super Bowl XXII St. Louis Rams Super Bowl XXVII Oakland Athletics
