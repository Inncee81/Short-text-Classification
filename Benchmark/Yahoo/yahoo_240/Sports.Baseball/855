did a rod take steroids i think so i think he took them he gained so much more muscle and even though he had lost some weight he had some fat last year easy he burned some off and replaced some with muscle i mean when in texas they thought maybe also have u noticed that most people hate a rod that play the game with him also did you notice that every time he gets hit he freaks out an charges the mound another sign of steroids is mood swing oyu tell me what you think no i do not think that a rod took steroids you're not even backing your argument with reasonable evidence you can accuse every single player in the mlb for taking steroids but unless you can support that claim i won't listen to you a rod did burn some fat he only has a small percentage of body fat now due to the fact that he has been working out more as i heard of course that cannot be proven but it's a start most people that play with a rod don't hate a rod the toronto blue jays sure don't like him though he doesn't freak out every time he gets hit and charges at the mound he got hit one or two days ago but no confrontation between him and the pitcher occured the only reason he walked to josh towers on the mound is because he knew the reason towers had hit him and towers said something to him at first if you saw the replay that was closely following a rod's face a rod didn't just charge at the plate he was at first and towers yelled something at him so a rod confronted him there are a lot of people out there who accuse perfectly clean players of taking steroids just because they are good i don't mean to say that i think that a rod definitely didn't take steroids but there's not a great chance of it if that's all you have to back that claim up Toronto Blue Jays Detroit Tigers Baseball Baseball statistics Babe Ruth Major League Baseball 1919 World Series St. Louis Cardinals Satchel Paige Tris Speaker Weight training Boston Red Sox Piccolo Junior Saga Pete Rose 1957 World Series Barry Bonds Major League Baseball television contracts 2005 World Series Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an History of baseball in the United States San Francisco Giants Oakland Athletics Mark McGwire Pitcher Shot Heard 'Round the World (baseball) The Jim Rome Show Hank Aaron Equine conformation Doom enemies Los Angeles Dodgers Nolan Ryan Sin City Paul Is Dead Pedro Mart__nez Atkins Nutritional Approach Ty Cobb Chicago White Sox Florida Marlins Ben Johnson (athlete) Robin Ventura Matt Hardy Blackjack Androgen insensitivity syndrome October 20 in baseball New York Mets 2004 World Series Ron and Fez Time Out of Mind Troy Glaus Perfect game Jos__ Canseco Toronto Raptors Batting average 1993 World Series Softball M16 (rifle) Reggie Jackson Interference (baseball) Sammy Sosa Big Brother (USA TV series) Insulin October 5 in baseball Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Babe Ruth's Called Shot The Apprentice 2 Norway national football team 2004 American League Championship Series John Olerud Anabolic steroid Springfield Nuclear Power Plant Interleague play Ted Williams Avenue Q 2003 World Series Dieting Buffalo Bills Tower of Druaga Curt Schilling Battle City (Yu-Gi-Oh!)
