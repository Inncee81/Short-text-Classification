just a thought about barry bonds i'm pretty sure that barry used roids but my problem with this whole he cheated crap do we know how many others besides him were juiced do we know how many pitchers he went against got the same cream and clear that he did just a thought i'm not a fan of bonds hell not even much of a fan of baseball just something i was curious about your thoughts hank aaron has nothing to do with my point my point is we don't know to what extent steroids were used in baseball during the bonds era perishiphore don't you think it does matter if those guys are juiced and they are his competition doesn't that mean it's a level playing field hooray for you for thinking realistically and intelligently not a lot of that around here when it comes to this discussion babe was a coke head and hank had his little green helpers speed so how far down the list do we go before finding someone clean probably down to a rookie on his first at bat but he might be dirty also your question is great though as it addresses the pitchers i actually never thought of that yeah do you give barry some extra home runs he would have hit if the pitcher was not juiced or do we call it even great question Hank Aaron Baseball Stars Babe Ruth 1957 World Series Baseball Major League Baseball Home run History of baseball in the United States Ty Cobb St. Louis Cardinals World Series October 4 in baseball New York Yankees Softball September 6 in baseball Boston Red Sox Los Angeles Dodgers Professional wrestling slang 2004 World Series Nolan Ryan Reggie Jackson October 7 in baseball Lou Gehrig Oakland Athletics Tris Speaker Ted Williams Rafael Palmeiro October 5 in baseball Detroit Tigers Manny Ram__rez No-hitter September 20 in baseball Baseball statistics Atlanta Braves Jos__ Canseco Cincinnati Reds San Francisco Giants Jimmie Foxx Alex Rodriguez Mark McGwire October 16 in baseball Sandy Koufax Hank Greenberg November 4 in baseball Ken Griffey, Jr. Toronto Blue Jays Andr__s Galarraga October 27 in baseball Willie Mays New York Mets Shoeless Joe Jackson Wrigley Field June 8 in baseball 1919 World Series Houston Astros Seattle Mariners November 2 in baseball Origins of baseball Sabermetrics Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Batting order (baseball) June 12 in baseball November 3 in baseball October 8 in baseball Major League Baseball television contracts October 1 in baseball Chicago White Sox Pete Rose Baltimore Orioles October 13 in baseball October 3 in baseball Baseball (object) Chicago Cubs All-Star Baseball Minor league baseball Pedro Mart__nez October 19 in baseball Batting average Red Sox Nation Dead-ball era Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry Rickey Henderson Don Hoak Cinergy Field Don Newcombe Old Time Baseball June 10 in baseball Scott Podsednik
