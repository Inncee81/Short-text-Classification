did anyone hear bob costis on mike and mike wow did he make sense when he was talking about if bonds retired and would you think of him as the best ever i never thought about it that way anyone hear his comments what do you think of them yeah he made a lot of sense especially during that part bonds had his best years in the s bonds was still great before then but after he took it to that ultimate level i disagree with some of what costas said though because he's on the side that wants to see the steroid era punished by throwing out all the records since mcgwire i think that's a bit much because there's no way they can figure out exactly who did and who didn't and i think they're wrong to go to the extreme to find bonds guilty while ignoring everyone else Theory of conduct ESPN25 She Loves You Piccolo Junior Saga Mark McGwire Late Night with Conan O'Brien History of baseball in the United States Barry Bonds Plame affair Appeal Free will Home run Time Out of Mind Libertarianism Pitaten Philosophical skepticism Year of the Spider Married... with Children Blood on the Tracks Pittsburgh Steelers Ferret Insanity defense Social rule St. Louis Cardinals Sammy Sosa New York Yankees Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Days of our Lives Cro Infidels Hey Jude WFAN (AM) Grandview, U.S.A.
