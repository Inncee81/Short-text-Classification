hideki mastui is greater than arod right now mastui is been hitting better and been hitting homers lately while arod is in kinda of slump who would you rather have mastui or arod if you were to say for the last few weeks or month then matsui would be the obvious choice however a rod overall is a much greater player in the long run arod would be the better pick he consistently hits for average power he can run he is great defensively and he puts fans in the stands matsui recently has been playing much better than a rod and so has their nd baseman robinson cano but they fail to provide their hot sreaks for over the course of the season and career arod is almost a sure bet to continue to be great unlike matsui also matsui is injury prone while arod has only missed days this season arod also happens to be more clutch however matsui does provide benefits like doing great things without being a distraction to the team he never gets caught up with the media no english and he has a passion for the game arod does too for the past month matsui would have been a better choice but through the course of time arod is the best player to have in your roster Alex Rodriguez 2003 World Series Robin Ventura 2004 American League Championship Series New York Yankees Baseball Toronto Blue Jays 1957 World Series Boston Red Sox Troy Glaus St. Louis Cardinals Pete Rose Andr__s Galarraga Detroit Tigers Seattle Mariners San Francisco Giants Cincinnati Bengals Toronto Raptors International League New York Knicks Lou Gehrig Babe Ruth Softball Oakland Athletics Cleveland Indians Ichiro Suzuki Mois__s Alou 1919 World Series St. Louis Rams Willie Mays Lance Berkman New England Patriots English cricket team Yao Ming Brian Roberts Chicago Cubs Baltimore Ravens Indianapolis 500 June 12 in baseball Batting average Stolen base Reggie Jackson Carolina Panthers Alan Trammell Los Angeles Dodgers New York Giants Ty Cobb Tris Speaker Manny Ram__rez Major League Baseball 2004 World Series 1994 baseball strike Roger Maris National Football League Baseball statistics First baseman Florida Marlins San Diego Padres New Jersey Nets Cricket Steve Nash Albert Pujols Blackjack The Ashes Baseball scorekeeping Hal Trosky Cleveland Browns Hank Aaron Indiana Pacers Jeff Kent Gary Sheffield World Series Ken Griffey, Jr. Atlanta Braves Pittsburgh Steelers National Hockey League All-Star Game New York Mets October 2004 in sports Los Angeles Kings Rasheed Wallace Cincinnati Reds American football Manchester United F.C.
