what is a letter of creditable coverage and why does every insurance company want one before they cover you what's the deal with these things anyway the letter of creditable coverage lets the new insurance company know if you have had recent insurance coverage and it comes from your past insurance company the main reason they want one is because of pre existing conditions if you've had insurance you've probably been treated for those conditions and are in better health your new insurance will then waive much if not all of the waiting period for coverage of those conditions if you've not had coverage that means the insurance companies are taking a bigger chance on you because your medical history is unknown they will then impose the full waiting period for any condition you had prior to the effective date of the policy Life insurance Insurance Health insurance Contract Canada Health Act Auto insurance Publicly funded medicine Medicare (Canada) Health care in the United States Mortgage Legal aspects of transsexualism United Kingdom corporation tax Pharmaceutical company Medical malpractice Canadian and American health care systems compared Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus HIPAA Title insurance Social Security (United States) Berkshire Hathaway Medicine Medicare (United States) Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Unemployment Actuary Wal-Mart Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation US health reform 1912-1920 US health reform under FDR Homeopathy National Insurance US health reform under Truman Phimosis Bank Prostate cancer Citigroup Financial services Lloyd's of London Unemployment benefit Nuclear power phase-out Scientology beliefs and practices Commodity markets Annuity Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Blackjack Liability insurance Abortion Social security US health reform under Carter Downing Street memo Infertility Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Infantilism General Electric Medicaid Adverse selection Health savings account Vicente Fox Certificate of deposit Visa (document) Childbirth Slander and libel Speed limit Taxation in the United States Air ambulance Hereditary peer Health maintenance organization Doomsday argument Home insurance Copyright ITV National Health Service Credit score Economy of the Republic of Ireland Same-sex marriage Trade union Term life insurance Global warming Barbara Boxer Influenza Hillary Rodham Clinton Bipolar disorder Public policy American Express Risk management Jardine Matheson Holdings Limited Poker jargon Workers' compensation Medical prescription Growth hormone treatment Credit card Bosniaks Intellectual property Transsexuality Fair Game (Scientology) Capital accumulation Divorce National identification number United States embargo against Cuba
