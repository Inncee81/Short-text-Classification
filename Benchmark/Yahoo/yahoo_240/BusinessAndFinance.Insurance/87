do i need to hire a lawyer to fight against health insurance company for denied claims i am having problem with my health insurance company who denied coverage there is outstanding balance which supposed to be covered but were denied because of i am also listed under my husband's health insurance the claims were re routed to both insurances and i haven't contacted the state agency dept of insurance yet on the state agency's web site it saying if you have an attorney representing you in this matter or if there is a lawsuit currently ongoing or pending our ability to mediate this matter is limited but we will investigate your inquiry for any regulatory issues however if a lawsuit is pending we may defer the regulatory investigation until the finality of the litigation we ask that you still complete this form so we have a record of your issue the original service was rendered month ago and i am losing time shoud i file a complaints to state agency first and wait for what they are come up with or hire an attorney now well what's the time frame will they honor claims filed within days or i'd be very inclined to do the insurance department first an attorney is going to cost you money up front and they're not likely to be able to do anything for you i'd also be inclined to gather up all the paperwork including copies of both policies and truck it down to have a meeting with your homeowners insurance agent and get their opinion free of charge your policy would be primary depending on why your policy declined to cover then your husband's should be secondary covering you so the declination from the primary carrier should trigger coverage from the secondary unless we're talking about an uncovered procedure here like cosmetic surgery you need to have both claim eob's and both declination letters to send to the insurance department now they're usually pretty fast you'll likely have a response within two weeks and normally the days retriggers from the date the claim was denied so that should buy you a little more time Insurance Life insurance Plame affair Wal-Mart United States Postal Service Medical malpractice SCO-Linux controversies Karl Rove 2004 U.S. election voting controversies, Ohio Lloyd's of London Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 National Health Service Medicare (Canada) Lawsuit Terri Schiavo 2005 Philippine electoral crisis Eliot Spitzer Tort reform Downing Street memo Patent Citigroup Hillary Rodham Clinton Plame affair timeline Software patent debate E-mail spam Government of India Fair Game (Scientology) Asbestos Tom DeLay Blue Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Probation officer HIPAA 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities Michael D.
