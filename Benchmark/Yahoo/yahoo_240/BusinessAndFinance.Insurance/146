is there a way to get care at hmo prices without the hmo i am considering getting emergency medical coverage only however i know that unless i am in managed care every doctor will screw me on prices for doctor visits normal stuff is there a way to be part of a health network get their prices cash up front to doctor and not participate in an insurance plan adam actually some states are looking at this as a way of reducing the cost of healthcare a consumer would pay a hugely reduced premium to an insurer in return he or she gets access to its network of participating providers and will pay the insurer's reduced negotiated fee to my knowledge no state has enacted legislation of this type yet the key word being yet i'd look for action on this sometime next year you might try calling your state's insurance commissioner's office to ask whether your state is considering similar legislation edit this concept is entirely different from a health discount plan mentioned by the answerer below Health insurance Health maintenance organization Publicly funded medicine Managed care Insurance Medicare (Canada) Health care in the United States Canada Health Act Canadian and American health care systems compared Wal-Mart National Health Service Medicare (United States) Mutual fund Medical malpractice HIPAA US health reform under FDR US health reform under Nixon Medicine Health savings account Microeconomics Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme Credit card American Medical Association Citigroup Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Social Security (United States) Preferred provider organization Contract Health care Education in the United States Kaiser Permanente Bond Pharmaceutical company Variable universal life insurance Food Stamp Program Healthcare system Medicaid Democratic Party (United States) Tax Mortgage Nurse Public policy Predatory lending Dalton McGuinty Economy of the Republic of Ireland Barbara Boxer Medical ethics Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Emergency Medical Services Non-economic damages caps Financial services Title insurance Capitalism Berkshire Hathaway Primerica Financial Services Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Social Security debate (United States) Employee Retirement Income Security Act Open access Social security Unemployment benefit Federal Emergency Management Agency of the United States United Kingdom corporation tax US health reform under Clinton US health reform 1912-1920 Tort reform Hillary Rodham Clinton Evidence-based medicine Warren Buffett Social issues in the United States US health reform under Carter Euro Annuity Personal finance Inflation Term life insurance Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Pricing Unemployment Risk management Futures contract Nuclear power phase-out Lloyd's of London Copyright US health reform under Truman Medicare (Australia) Food and Drug Administration Health care in the Republic of Ireland Economy of India Medical prescription Economy of Russia Overpopulation Pension Stock Medical record Supply and demand
