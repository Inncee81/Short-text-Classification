my company is being taken over what can i expect expect a change of management a new system of information flow new computer software etc different tasks responsibilities standards etc sometimes it will be for the better sometimes its hell sometimes its a bit of both for example you might have more work to do you get more vacation days better health care a young know it all boss a company match of k investments etc or it might be reverse an awesome new boss less work but you might get less paid vacation etc but the goal of the take over company isn't to upset the workplace they simply want to keep the gears in motion but with their way of business i mean it can't be that bad if the company was sucessful enough to buy out your company i would just beware because the bigger corporations usually play a bit more strict structured to compensate for their size but i would do as others have suggested in looking at the job market its always a good idea to have a back up plan edit also you won't be able to tell until the new management system has started you might know right off the bat for example they might take advantage of everyone and simply overwork underpay them to eliminate all the existing employees and replace them with college grads Wal-Mart Apple Computer Investment bank Corporate governance Outsourcing Mutual fund Microsoft Unemployment Insurance Workplace democracy Blackjack Gross domestic product Electronic commerce Mach kernel Software patent debate Corporate finance Management information system Management Alex Ferguson Capitalism Boss (video games) Product Lifecycle Management Finance Health insurance Strategic management Publicly funded medicine NeXT Dilbert Working time Free trade Enterprise content management Canadian and American health care systems compared ITV Electronic Arts Corporation Life insurance IBM PC compatible Keynesian economics Rational Unified Process Education in the People's Republic of China United Kingdom corporation tax MMORPG Digital circuit SCO-Linux controversies Financial services NVIDIA Norway national football team Video game developer Anarchism and capitalism Call centre AMD Amiga Quality control Economic inequality Bond ISO 9000 Capital accumulation Wheel of Fortune Redundant array of independent disks Privatization Bretton Woods system Democracy Business process reengineering CPU design Efficiency wages Manual transmission Anarchism and society Database management system Ashton-Tate Public policy Lloyd's of London Steve Jobs Day care PLATO Sony IBM Inflation Social Security (United States) Virtual memory Stock Theory of the firm Newcastle United F.C.
