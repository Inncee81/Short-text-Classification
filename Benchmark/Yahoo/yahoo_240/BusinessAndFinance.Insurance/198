i need help please i'm yrs old and pregnant for the first time i have a job at ge but it's an internship because i'm in college full time since it's an internship i can't get benefits yet unless they take a chunk of money out i've applied for a medical card to pay for my appointments but they haven't sent anything telling me something yet the deadline hasn't come yet for it to be here but it's rapidly approaching i know the bills will start rolling in soon my dad just put me back on his medical insurance since i'm still a student and stuff so my question is if the medical card doesn't come in time the clinic told me to come in only if i didn't have insurance can i show them my insurance card from my dad with my name on it will they bill the insurance company without me having to pay at least until i get the medical card i hope i haven't confused anyone thanks so much in advance for your help weeks pregnant with if you are on your dad's insurance policy then they should pay although they could consider it a pre existing condition and in that case they won't pay you or your dad should call the the insurance company and find out usually insurances pay for maternity related issues so you shouldn't have a problem if you tell your doctor's office that you have insurance and give them the card they should bill it you will probably have some kind of co pay or deductible to meet before everything is paid in full some doctor's offices make you pay the deductible up front and some will just bill you after your baby is born if you qualified for a medical card it may pay for anything that you had done before the card arrived or if you get a medical card the doctor may bill your dad's insurance the primary insurance and whatever that doesn't pay for the medical card secondary insurance will pay for i suggest that you or your dad call his insurance company and explain the situation and see what you have to pay for and then find out if you are getting a medical card and if you are explain the situation to them and see what they say each state is different and each insurance policy has different requirements so your best bet would be to explain the situation to them and see what you have to do i hope i have helped in some way congrats and good luck Health insurance Insurance Unemployment Publicly funded medicine Medicare (Canada) Contract Blackjack Health care in the United States Wal-Mart Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Friends Medical malpractice Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 National Insurance Professor Auto insurance Social Security (United States) Craps Prostate cancer Stomach cancer Medical school Draw poker Theory of conduct Abortion in the United States Education in the People's Republic of China U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Centrelink Education in Germany Annuity US health reform under FDR Warren Buffett Medicine Barbara Boxer General practitioner Mortgage Chiropractic EastEnders Plame affair Legal aspects of transsexualism Ocean's Twelve Osteopathy 401(k) Scientology beliefs and practices Physician Gambling Karl Rove Doomsday argument Canadian and American health care systems compared Haven (TNG episode) Stud poker United Kingdom corporation tax Internet fraud Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Texas hold 'em Citigroup Emergency Medical Services Health savings account Folic acid Tax Health maintenance organization Pai gow poker 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines National Health Service Social rule Androgen insensitivity syndrome Expert system Medicare (United States) Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses National Kidney Foundation Singapore Abortion debate Roe v.
