i need a lawyer in southern nevada that handles medical insurance claim issues i had an injury occur on where as i injured my lower back i have two bulging discs one is cracked as well i was ordered for surgery as i am covered by anthem bc bs less than hours before scheduled surgery anthem has put my claim on hold i need a lawyer who handles these types of cases whom i can contact it has been months since my injury happened and still i have yet to be taken care of go to your yellow pages any lawyer should be able to help you for a fee they are going to want you to put down a hefty retainer up front you're not saying why the claim is on hold so i'm guessing they think it's work related or a pre existing condition that you didn't disclose those would be two valid reasons for the health insurer to not pay and a lawyer isn't going to help you override the reasons having an injury that needed surgery months ago that you haven't taken care of yet also indicates that maybe the need isn't as great as you think it is or else you would have the surgery and worry about the payment later Insurance Health insurance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Transsexuality Plame affair Life insurance Traumatic brain injury Publicly funded medicine Health maintenance organization Wal-Mart Canada Health Act Unemployment Hillary Rodham Clinton Urinary incontinence Medicine Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Legal aspects of transsexualism Unemployment benefit Infantilism United Kingdom corporation tax Philosophical skepticism Triage Breastfeeding Fair Game (Scientology) Democratic Party (United States) Prostate cancer Stroke Traditional Chinese medicine John F.
