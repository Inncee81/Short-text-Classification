why is not considered discrimination when health insurance companies exclude coverage for pregnant women my concern is about insurance for women who are planning on becoming pregnant as well as if they already are pregnant this is a great question because it addresses what insurance is really about insurance is designed to help people avoid the risks of medical expenses not the certainties of something that is in progress if you take a large group of people who do not have a medical condition statistically you know that a few of them will get that condition you can price a your policies to be affordable by dividing the costs of treating the condition among the whole group in the average pregnancy cost over unless it was a cesarian that cost over if i was pregnant and i wanted you to pay for the delivery in six months how much would you have to charge me each month in order to break even it's simply not affordable i just compared a few matirnity riders for customer and i found that golden rules policies would save her to on the child she was planning to have in two years the extra cost of the insurance was worth it Insurance Health insurance Pregnancy Auto insurance Abortion Medicare (Canada) Growth hormone treatment Canadian and American health care systems compared Legal aspects of transsexualism Contract Pharmaceutical company Mutual fund Health care in the United States Infertility Title insurance Canada Health Act Psoriasis Variable universal life insurance Medical malpractice Folic acid Food and Drug Administration Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Nuclear power phase-out Medicine Unemployment Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Social Security (United States) Predatory lending Mortgage Breastfeeding Turner syndrome US health reform under Clinton Childbirth Roe v.
