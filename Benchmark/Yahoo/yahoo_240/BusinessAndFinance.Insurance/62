health insurance question i have never dealt with health insurance before sorry if my question is silly my health insurance nj horizon blue cross covers prenatal care including ultrasounds and blood work my doctor's office keeps on billing me for an ultrasound that supposed to be covered i've got the same bill about times when i call my insurance agency they say that my ultrasound is completely covered but doctor's office should use another code to fill in the claim i asked the office to change the code many times but i still do not get coverage is there anything i can do i feel like i am going in circles who can really resolve this problem doctor's office or insurance agency thank you doug sorry i was not clear before but i dealt with horizon directly too i did bring the paper that explains my responsibilities to the medical biller horizon even gave her customer number to call in order to change the code she filed claim again and it did not get covered again if your insurance company has received this claim and processed it then the charge is either covered or denied it sounds like they denied the charge due to the cpt current procedural code being either invalid or possibly not matching the diagnosis code regardless of why it was denied you should not be stuck in the middle your doctors office should be working with your insurance company to correct this you should have received an eob explanation of benefit says this is not a bill and it will say on the eob what the patient is responsible for many times your insurance company will deny the charge due to coding errors however it will say the member responsibility is zero that means the provider cannot balance bill you for this if the provider is a participating provider than it is more likely that you should not be billed contact your insurance company and demand that they do a three way call to the doctors office and get it resolved right away if the insurance company says they cannot contact the provider than ask to speak to a supervisor they have to work with you to resolve this i have been in the health insurance business for years and i deal with this all the time and it usually is a matter of the providers office rebilling to correct it whatever you do dont pay for this as long as the denial remains a coding error cpt codes are often updated yearly and many times the providers office is not aware of this and they bill with a deleted code there is no reason why your plan would not cover an ultra sound and you may just have to be more persistent in getting it taken care of good luck Health insurance Insurance Publicly funded medicine Life insurance Extreme Programming Medical malpractice United States Postal Service Transsexuality National Health Service Medical prescription HIPAA Health care in the United States Stomach cancer Expert system Medicare (Canada) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus SCO-Linux controversies Information Technology Infrastructure Library Medical record Appeal US health reform under FDR Canadian and American health care systems compared Prostate cancer Emergency Medical Services Canada Health Act Ethics Wal-Mart National Insurance Scientology beliefs and practices Food and Drug Administration Managed care Contract Unemployment Prenatal diagnosis Health care in Canada Chiropractic Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Fathers' rights Citigroup Homeopathy Alternative medicine Speaker of the British House of Commons Classified information Plame affair Microeconomics Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Involuntary commitment Probation officer Killian documents Mental Health Act 1983 New Deal Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Education in the United States Auto insurance Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Hillary Rodham Clinton Social Security (United States) Bill Frist Barbara Boxer Linked list Call centre Domain Name System Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Pharmaceutical company U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Supernatural Air traffic control Secretar__a de Inteligencia Risk management Construction Surveillance Democracy 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities Medicare (United States) Lloyd's of London Customer relationship management Internet fraud US health reform 1912-1920 Church of Christ, Scientist Traditional Chinese medicine Partial-birth abortion Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Steam (content delivery) Canadian Senate Deconstruction
