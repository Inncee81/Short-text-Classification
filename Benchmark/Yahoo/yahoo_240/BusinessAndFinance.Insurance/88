is it possible to collect social security benefits and not be enrolled in medicare at all i obviously wish to keep recieving benifits from social security but the medicare has really messed up my enrollment into tricare prime i have medicare part a but refused part b now that i want to enroll in tricare prime i have to pay a surcharge ad wait unti next year before i can enroll it was so much easier before i collected social security because i was enrolled in prime before and simply paid the quarterly premiums then when i started collecting social security i got tossed from tricare prime because i didn't know any better at the time and disenrolled in part b medicare so if i could i would rather just completely ditch medicare if i can just so i can requalify for tricare prime and not pay so much out per month can it be done thanks thanks for the answers so far i am well under and i had tricare prime first before i got ss then when i got ss they automaticially enrolled me in part b medicare then i dis enrolled to save money because i figured i didn't need that as i can go to the va hospital as well social security medicare and tricare are all government agencies for those that don't know tricare is the military health plan this is a confusing situation you said you refused part b but then said you were disenrolled from part b did you refuse it within the time limits it sounds like you didn't if you refused it in time you couldn't have been enrolled in it to become disenrolled you become automatically enrolled in part b social security and part b have no correlation it doesn't matter what health plan you have to get ss and getting ss will not affect any health plan tricare acts as a supplement to medicare you are still on medicare but you get your services from tricare you will need to contact tricare to find out what you need to do to get back on you should also contact medicare there are rules about when you can enroll in any plan so that is why you need to wait Medicare (United States) Medicare (Canada) Social Security (United States) Taxation in the United States Health insurance Medicaid Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Medicare Part D Medicare (Australia) Health care in the United States United States Department of Health and Human Services Payroll Social Security Administration Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Health maintenance organization Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act Pharmaceutical company Politics of Canada Hillary Rodham Clinton Canadian and American health care systems compared Economy of the United States Flat tax Health care in Canada HIPAA Social Security debate (United States) Life insurance Student loan Heather Wilson Gross domestic product Insurance Government debt Chiropractic United States Code FairTax Wal-Mart H-1B visa Social issues in the United States Contract United Kingdom corporation tax Military unrest since the Fiji coup of 2000 Pitaten Canada Health Act Annuity Plame affair Ontario Liberal Party Canadian federal election, 1965 Winter of Discontent Bond Dalton McGuinty Warren Buffett National Health Service Charlottetown Accord John Howard Vivian Solon Social rule American Medical Association Nursing home Amish US health reform under FDR Canadian Senate Managed care Ocean's Twelve George W.
