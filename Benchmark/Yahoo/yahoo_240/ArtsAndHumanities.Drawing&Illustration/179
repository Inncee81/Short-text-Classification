does anyone know where i can get design templates online i want to do some clothes designing but need templates because i have trouble drawing the body shape i'm though and need them free or somewhere to copy them from hi i tried to answer this question for someone else recently a lot of people looked into it and it seems that there are not a lot of free templates going online but you can if you have the means buy expensive books of them so my idea was why not make you own find some fashion photographs or drawings that you like that preferably show the arms and legs quite a bit trace them off add a good dark outline and you can then use them as templates for creating designs if you don't want to use tracing paper and i imagine you don't have a lightbox you can always tape them up on a window and trace for the same effect using ordinary paper kitchen greaseproof paper by the way works just as well as tracing paper and is a lot cheaper i really don't think this is plagiarism just a learning curve so long as you don't try to sell them as original fashion drawings good luck Traditional animation Theory of conduct CPU cache Clothing Violin Don Rosa Strap-on dildo Microeconomics Drill bit Philosophy of language Drawing Altruism The nature of God in Western theology Spline (mathematics) Origin belief Social rule Bass guitar PostScript African American Vernacular English Scientology beliefs and practices Logo programming language BASIC programming language Star Trek Customizable Card Game MP3 Reality Copy protection Academic publishing Book IBM PC compatible Plagiarism CPU design Ebook The Crying of Lot 49 Gaia Online Barbie Wood carving 2000 Australian Grand Prix Apple typography Immanuel Kant Hangul Perl Extreme Programming Garth Brooks Gramophone record H.
