fashion design drawer i'm not sure if this is an actual job title but could someone be a fashion design drawer i mean your a person who just comes up with the designs and sketches for the clothes but it' snot your clothing line i hope that make sense if this is an actual career how do you get trained in it fashion design illustration is definitely an actual job most illustrators working in fashion design are not working on their own lines but rather working for a larger clothing company their designs are then pooled together and reviewed by a director or head designer who then decides which illustrations will get made most major art colleges offer courses in illustration and a number of them have specific fashion design tracks that you can sign up for outside of art schools you could look into reference books on fashion design and try and teach yourself this is a bit harder as you miss out on some of the fundamentals of art training and it is harder to get placed in a design studio without a college degree i hope that helps Savannah College of Art and Design Fashion Institute of Technology Undergarment Royal College of Art Fashion design University of Central Florida College Air Education and Training Command Fashion Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design Physician Bill Peet Community college Librarian Juris Doctor Law school Oxford English Dictionary Art school Tai Chi Chuan Game programmer Professor Education in Germany El Lissitzky Reiki Software engineering Dublin City University Purchase College Education in the People's Republic of China Electrical engineering Australian National University Education in Portugal Miniature (illuminated manuscript) Bachelor of Arts University of North Carolina at Charlotte Modern dance Ryerson University Trinity College, Dublin Lyceum of the Philippines Association for Renaissance Martial Arts Teacher Haute couture Washington University in St. Louis Robert Altman School counselor York University Martial art CPU cache City and Guilds of London Institute Social aspects of clothing Education in the United States Chris Benoit Carl Barks Master's degree University of Alabama Graduate school Seneca College Advanced Placement Program Kingston University Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Entropy Gucci Chinese martial arts Luther College Grunge music Smith College Image Comics Billiards UCAS Larry Hama Raffles Institution O scale Academia University of Chester Marvel Comics Mac OS X Robert Hutchins Boston College University of Michigan Brown University Dog training The Apprentice 2 A Course In Miracles French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools GED Far Eastern University Rick Sternbach Linus Pauling Philadelphia University Robert E.
