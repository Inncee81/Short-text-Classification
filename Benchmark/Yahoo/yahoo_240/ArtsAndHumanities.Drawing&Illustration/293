how do i shade like a pro i know that varying the pressure is important but what about the angle and the way i hold the pencil direction of shading length of pencil strokes density of lines for some reason i can't get my lines to blend together if your lines don't blend you either a are holding the pencil at the wrong angle or b varying your pressure too quickly ive never found direction very important it has always worked better for me if i used the side of the lead rather than the point to shade try this excercise get a piec of paper and turn it so its wider than it is long start shading at the far end so you're creating a strip of color about an inch or so thick stay at the same pressure for the first inches across the paper at that point start lightening your pressure but very slowly see if you can make it to the end of the sheet and still have a consistently brightening strip of color i had to do this hundreds of times in school it really made me better Drawing Traditional animation Billiards Drill bit Terminal ballistics Textile manufacturing Pencil Drag racing Computer representation of surfaces Knife Wood Stairway Volleyball Saw Table tennis Ballpoint pen Internal ballistics Plasma display Laser engraving Fluorescent lamp Pinhole camera Punch card Softball Mattress Rigging Cartridge (firearms) Gramophone record Welding Textile manufacturing terminology Snooker Rail terminology Bicycle frame Stereoscopy View camera Bong Apollo Command/Service Module Ray tracing Canoe Bookbinding Fourth dimension Rayleigh scattering Racetrack (game) Headlight Anemometer Trigonometric function Strap-on dildo Dog agility Paper size Springfield 1903 rifle Cinematography Dominoes Leather Car handling Angle Temporal bone Equine conformation Drew Struzan Slide rule Laws of cricket Shade Pachypodium key to species Pachypodium ambongense Atari 8-bit family Euclidean plane isometry Pastel Fountain pen Snowboard Fast bowling Sundial Color theory Glacier Sacrum Stage lighting Breaststroke Audio tape length and thickness Punt (boat) Phong shading Lathe Marching band Thermal power station Horse Chess strategy and tactics Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Pressure Fire fighting Sternum M__bius strip Paper Helicopter Violin Archery Amateur telescope making Badminton Mitsubishi 3000GT Surrealist techniques Tobacco Wassily Kandinsky Parallax Etching
