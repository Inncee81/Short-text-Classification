does anyone know how awesome caricature artist bill douglas is he's amazing my question is do people still want their caricatures drawn and would they rather have something that captures them or makes fun of them like mad magazine style bill douglas of www drawmebill com is a serious artist who doesn't make fun of people you know by drawing big noses and stuff just wondering i've never heard of that guy but i love caricatures i'm an artist and i really want to learn how to draw them it seems so complicated but i think most of the time people want something that captures them and sometimes capturing someone is making fun of them thanks for the website Caricature The Ashlee Simpson Show MAD Magazine Cyndi Lauper S.N.O.W.I.N.G.
