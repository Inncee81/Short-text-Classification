are you a really good portrait drawer ok so i really need a portrait of me for this assignment and i cant do it myself none of the people i know can draw people so i was wondering if i sent somebody a pic of me would they draw it and email it to me ok well if you will then please please send me an email to penpalforyou yahoo com and tell me that you will draw my portrait and i will email u a pic of me thanks everybody begin by getting a good clear photograph of yourself maybe take it digitally and print it on x paper grid it up into a bunch of sections with a pencil and ruler say boxes or something now draw the same grid on your drawing paper either same scale or enlarge it then turn your photo and paper upside down and recreate the drawing upside down this is good because you don't think ok i'm drawing an eye and then it comes out looking like a generic eye upside down however you think more abstractly ok i'm drawing simple shapes and lines i promise this is the best way to get it to actually look like you when you're of the way done flip your drawing and photo right side up and make corrections oh also using the alphabet or numbers across the top and side of your grids can be helpful in finding the corresponding spot on your own drawing counting boxes is annoying Photography Sudoku Drawing Crossword Wallpaper group Dominoes Traditional animation Aerial (dance move) Eye Stereoscopy Patricia Ford British national grid reference system Polygon Leica ZIP Code Geographic information system Punch card Dog agility 3D projection UBASIC Table tennis 2D computer graphics Kammerlader Professional wrestling throws Mathematics Password Digital photography Writing Chinese character Racetrack (game) Logo programming language E-mail Typewriter Ballpoint pen Francis Bacon (painter) Fischer Random Chess Mattress Self programming language Screenplay Bookbinding Digital art M.C.
