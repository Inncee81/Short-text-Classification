how to get designs out there my son is an artist using oils watercolors etc for the last year he's been creating designs for cd covers he is in his last year of high school and his designs are really good is there a free site to maybe put up one or two designs just to get your name out there because money is limited and he's dealing with up and coming local rap groups they don't pay much thanks i wasn't sure if that was okay he does have a myspace account what about a portfolio should he actually put his phone number cell or just have people email him thanks you guys are really helpful appreciate it get a deviantart com membership its free its a portfolio and its a website you can give people to go view your work thats good enough for now also have him enter competitions theres cd competitions and other visual art competition too winning gets you name out there also why not have him send his work samples to different bands just so they know theres this kid who can do this kinda work and you never know what could happen i think the hard thing about doing album art is that album art is so personal to an artist at least the good ones because its the visual face of their music to get into that kinda work i would pursue a graphic design area for university but its really cool hes using traditional media that makes him different in a world of technology DeviantART Grammy Award The Emancipation of Mimi Digital art Graphic design Music genre Surveillance Hip hop music Beastie Boys Art Rich Mullins Windows XP Internet fraud ABBA Nine Inch Nails ATI Technologies Poker jargon Jennifer Lopez TLC Marching band Copyleft Sampling (music) Mixtape E-mail spam Hip hop culture ITunes Gangsta rap Grunge music Computer Negativland Alternative hip hop Kelly Clarkson Snoop Dogg Time Out of Mind Drew Struzan Monopoly Iggy Pop W.
