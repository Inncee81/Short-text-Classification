what are some anime shows similar to inuyasha i here everybody talking about anime all the time and i wondered what was so good about it so i went to peekvid com and watched the whole first season of inuyasha took me the whole day i really like it anything else similar to it i'm a big fan of rumiko takahashi's work and you might want to check out her older works ranma mermaid saga maison ikkoku urusei yatsura i haven't seen or read mermaid saga or maison ikkoku yet but i know everything about the inuyasha ranma and urusei yatsura anime and manga i would say they are my favorite series and i couldn't choose which was better so try them you will definitely see some patterns as far as characters go for example there is always a pervert in the main group of characters in inuyasha it's miroku in ranma it's happosai in urusei yatsura it's ataru also there is always something wierd with the main romantic couple inuyasha is a hanyou half demon ranma is cursed to turn into a girl when splashed with cold water and lum is an alien they are defenitely good shows InuYasha Urusei Yatsura Ranma Saotome InuYasha (character) Mamoru Oshii Anime Naraku VIZ Media Miroku (InuYasha) Maison Ikkoku Manga Sesshomaru Richard Ian Cox Sh__nen InuYasha media and release information BattleTech Kagome Higurashi Harem anime Fuji Television Sango (InuYasha) Dragon Ball Kanna (InuYasha) Shichinintai Fan fiction Yu-Gi-Oh!
