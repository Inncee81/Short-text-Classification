i am a graduate student can i study any other subjects in master degree g'day from the countries you mentioned australia is most likely have the lowest cost of living and probably the lowest tuition fee as well due to currency exchange for australia on top of tuition fees you will need to pay for campus fee vary from each uni and overseas student health cover abt aud yr and text books abt aud
