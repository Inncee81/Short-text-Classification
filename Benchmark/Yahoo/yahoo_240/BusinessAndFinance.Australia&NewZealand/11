why did you introduce a major change to our taxation system from sales tax to gst without a referendum i do know at the time you said because you had been elected you had a mandate from the people but to do what you want if any responsible leader of any country were to dramatically change that taxation system then don't you agree that the change ought to be ratified by the people's vote on that very critical change or is it a dictitorial decision that because i am your leader then i will do what ever i want because the majority in this case not elected me i found and still find that decision reprehensible mr howard i trust that you will have a peaceful retirement from having to make decisions and overide the needs of the australian people in spite of their well being and best interests we have paid far too much and far too well for your dotage yes remember him saying there will never ever be a gst under my government the old core and non core promises had to love janette recently saying in defense of her deceitful hubby that sometimes he just says he's going to do something but that doesn't mean he is going to really or something hilarious to that effect it was inevitable since the asprey report in the 's that under a liberal government at some point we were going to get a high revenue raising broad based tax such as gst of which a greater burden is borne by low income earners because it is not a progressive tax liberals opposed the labor introduced capital gains tax which is essentially a tax on wealth and is fair under our progressive tax system i e the greater your means are the more tax you pay that nicely illustrates the traditional difference between the parties as far as their views on social welfare and equity are concerned Flat tax John Howard Tax Progressive tax Taxation in the United States Democracy Microeconomics Supply-side economics Goods and Services Tax (Canada) Liberal Party of Canada Canadian federal election, 1993 Liberal Democrats (UK) Value added tax Democratic Party (United States) Brian Mulroney Capitalism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus United Kingdom corporation tax Social Security debate (United States) FairTax Australian legislative election, 2004 Social democracy Australian Democrats Supply and demand Politics of Canada John Hewson Conservative Party (UK) Social Security (United States) Liberalism Publicly funded medicine Australian Labor Party Goods and Services Tax (Australia) Progress Party (Norway) Taxation in Canada Inflation Poll tax Margaret Thatcher Reaganomics Article One of the United States Constitution Australian constitutional law Left-wing politics Paul Keating Free market Canadian and American politics compared Charles Haughey Local government in the United Kingdom Corporate governance Economic inequality Gross domestic product Joe Clark Regressive tax Property tax Mike Harris Politics of Ontario Voter turnout Protectionism Income tax Quebec general election, 2003 Taxation in the Republic of Ireland History of the United Kingdom Economy of Russia Celtic Tiger Peter Costello Modernization of Sweden Politics of the United States Canadian Senate 39th Canadian federal election Australian electoral system Canadian and American economies compared Surplus value Non-aggression principle Progressive Democrats Free trade Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution Alliance (New Zealand political party) Trickle down effect Bob Hawke Labour Party (UK) Politics of the Republic of China Kyoto Protocol Liberal Party (UK) Labour economics Post-Confederation history of Canada Elections in the United Kingdom Libertarianism Tariff Bob Rae
