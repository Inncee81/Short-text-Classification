can someone tell me if it is possible to salary sacrifice a car lease in nsw i would like hubby to consider a new job same pay less hours but no car the less hours is the part we like i was wondering if it's possible to lease a car for his work and if it effects his tax etc he works in transport industry but in an office as long as the employer is agreeable a car lease can certainly be salary sacrificed a common solution is via novated lease which is a tripartite agreement between employee employer and a lessor while the employee remains with the employer the employer takes responsibility for the lease payments once the employee leaves the employer the novation lapses and the employee becomes directly responsible for the lease in simple terms the car goes with the employee when they leave while the novation is in place all running expenses of the vehicle including the lease payments can be salary sacrificed but on the flip side the employee will also pay fringe benefits tax on the vehicle care needs to be taken when entering these arrangements as the fbt can significantly reduce or negate any tax benefit achieved from salary sacrifice make sure you do your numbers beforehand and just a response to the answer below once a vehicle is structured into your salary there is no other tax break or deduction available outside sacrificed costs regardless of business or personal use Leasing Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Tax Microeconomics Taxation in the United States Salary Insurance Unemployment benefit Salary cap 401(k) Social Security (United States) Airline Student loan Unemployment Compensation of employees Economy of the United States Publicly funded medicine Education in England Leasehold estate Flat tax Operating surplus Gross domestic product United Kingdom corporation tax Health insurance Wal-Mart Child support Economic inequality Surplus value Life insurance Pension Hybrid vehicle Food Stamp Program London Congestion Charge Sport utility vehicle Minimum wage Principal-agent problem National Insurance Tariff Income trust Domestic partnerships in California Employment Centrelink Great Depression New Deal Contract Personal rapid transit Outsourcing Expert system Wayne Corporation Progressive tax FairTax Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 United States Postal Service Economy of India Alcohol fuel Islamic banking Intermediate consumption Labour economics C__ile Ferate Rom__ne Tax credit Personal finance Rail transport in Great Britain Reaganomics Transport in Hong Kong Inflation Amtrak Working time GO Transit Trust (Law) non-USA Airbus Arturo Frondizi Article One of the United States Constitution History of the United States (1918-1945) Value added tax Toll road Freeters Delta Air Lines United Airlines Capitalism Renting Lloyd's of London Assignment (law) Auto insurance Subsidy Automobile Health savings account New York Central Railroad Day care Contract with America Labor theory of value Economic history of Japan Efficiency wages
