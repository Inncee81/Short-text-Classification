do you like jane fonda and if so why i actually like jane fonda and when i was a child she was my dream bed partner she was fiesty and sexy as ever when she was young she still looks quit good i watched her aerobic movie once and it was awesome she is a very talented actress one of my favorites was on golden ponds in which she stared with henry her father it was his last movie i believe he was a great actor also jane got on the bad side of a lot of americans when she visited vietnam during the war it wasn't really a declared war however american serviceman were upset over what she told the vietnamese i don't hold this against her here at home we had thousands picketing against the war and most of the nation didn't think about all the riots and all the deserters that fled to canada and other places not did they say much about the thousands that wiggled their way out of the service by saying they were sick or signed up for college and on and on but yet they took it personal against jane it takes a very brave person to do what she did she risked everything for what she believed in at that time and atleast she stood up for her beliefs and didn't run can't say the same for so many other thousands of americans if jane wasn't populat at the time nor had the money she had most the people would not have cared so what were most people really upset aboput envy she is still my favorite and completely forgive her all the others i would not forgive savvy Jane Fonda Henry Fonda Marilyn Monroe Knots Landing The Catcher in the Rye Humphrey Bogart Characters in the Smurfs Highway 61 Revisited Jane Wyman Grandview, U.S.A.
