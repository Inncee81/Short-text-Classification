why does zack efron keep acting like a year old i mean i have heard of targeting your audience but doesn't it seem a little bit strange to not want to try to attain an older age group by now seeing him and amanda bynes on the screen acting like year olds during promo commercial things is very disturbing to me not to mention pigeon holeing yourself to be viewed as an immature wussy the rest of your career ala justin timberlake and leonardo decrapreo because deep down on the inside he is a year old boy not only that but he like to have homo erotic dreams about simon cowell o gasp he seems so immature and annoying he just tries to be cool or something as for the 'target audience' thing he just wants to target little preteen boys and girlys and then rape them later i think it's probably his mediocre horrid acting that won't work for the older scene but his lame skills will work on younger kids who are extremely gullible into thinking he's an amazing actor All That Adolescence Motion picture rating system The Fairly OddParents Kimi Finster Anime Statutory rape Ed, Edd n Eddy El Goonish Shive The Inside EastEnders Justin Timberlake Boy band Drawn Together I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Alfred Hitchcock Salad Fingers Eric Cartman Asperger syndrome Robert Clark (actor) Punk'd Hey Jude Child American Idol Hip hop rivalries The Chemical Brothers The Young Ones (TV series) Late Night with Conan O'Brien Child sexuality Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Green Day Married... with Children Shaggy dog story Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Brit Awards Duran Duran Zoophilia Science fiction on television Scenes from a Memory Equine conformation Futurama (TV series - season 5) Little Britain Milton H.
