pepper spray has anyone ever had to use pepper spray on a dog i was told it is not effective because dogs do not have tear ducts i know there a sprays available especially for dogs but i want to know of any first hand experiences with regular pepper spray years in law enforcement and i can tell you from personal experience that you are the exception to the rule if you are able to find out of dogs that pepper spray will work on it seems the bigger the dog breed the less likely the pepper spray will work i have had extensive experience with dog trainers that illegally teach pit bulls to fight and most of these a use pepper spray on their dogs as a training aid to train them to be more vicious and fight my experience has been that it works on a few slows down a few more but really pisses off the majority that are left the newer sprays supposedly attack the mucous membranes in the dogs eyes and mouth my friends still in k think that's a joke too in other words don't bet your life or health on it working Pepper spray Pit bull CS gas Dog Capsaicin Cockfight Poodle American Pit Bull Terrier Fire fighting Chile pepper Police dog Working dog Dog fighting Oral sex Riot control agent One Piece minor characters Contract Paul Is Dead German Shepherd Dog Rabies Tenshinhan Dog training Eric Cartman Pet skunk Non-lethal force Common cold Martial art Sgt.
