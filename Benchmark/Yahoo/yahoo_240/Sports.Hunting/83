air rifle power upgrade i want to get a logun gladi or and the power will be below ft lbs limit what i want to know is if it can be upgraded to the higher ft lbs mark also would it be possible to do it very easily myself or would i have to take it to a gunsmith and finally if i did take it to a gunsmith to get it done about how much will it cost to get it upgraded p s i know i will need an fac for an upgrade according to the specs on this rifle i don't know how either is possible a at fps is going to have nowhere near ft lbs not unless it can push a gr pellet at fps and i highly doubt that air gun manufacturers are in the habit of using light er weight pellets so that they can exaggerate the fps of their air guns gr fps ft lbs would be more like it logan gladi or http www pyramydair com cgi bin model pl model id referer it's a pcp not a sp air rilfe http www pyramydair com Pound Cartridge (firearms) First-person shooter Krag-J__rgensen Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Natural Selection (computer game) M16 (rifle) Internal ballistics Tribes 2 Battlefield 2 Counter-Strike A-10 Thunderbolt II Browning Model 1919 machine gun Rifle Frame rate Shotgun Firearm .357 SIG Mitsubishi 3000GT Helicopter Marilyn Monroe Machine gun RX-78 mobile suit series Laptop Gunsmith Carbine OV-10 Bronco AK-47 MS-06 Zaku II Cessna T-37 Pagani Sniper rifle Sound Blaster Web server F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Mouse (computing) Assault rifle Railgun Turbocharger Laser applications .303 British Computer and video game genres ZGMF-XX09T DOM Trooper Team Fortress Classic Tank Airbus A320 Bullet Beretta 92F/FS Ruger 10/22 M14 (rifle) MSA-0011 S Gundam E85 Mega Man X (character) Nuclear fuel cycle Sturmgewehr 44 Video F-16 Fighting Falcon Colt Commando Comparison of 21st century fighter aircraft Porsche 911 SA80 F/A-18 Hornet GunZ The Duel M4 Carbine Star Trek: First Contact Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawk Apple Macintosh Lee-Enfield Gunsmith Cats Terminal ballistics Bren Mercury Cougar M1 Carbine Cannon Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne Armored Core Remington Arms Medium machine gun Beretta Varmint rifle Panzer I B-26 Marauder ZAFT Armed Keeper of Unity Sega CD Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 Quake 4 ZGMF-X12 Gundam Astray Out Frame Webley and Scott Medal of Honor: Allied Assault Indian Army M60 machine gun Wildcat cartridge F-15 Eagle Gundam W G-Unit: Last Outpost Nintendo 64 Hard disk Sport utility vehicle Messerschmitt Bf 109
