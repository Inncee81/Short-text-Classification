asthma question what does wrosening of asthma mean using your inhaler more than u have ever before it means that your asthma is not under control anymore this happened to me all year what you need to do is get yourself to a pulmonologist a doctor who specializes in asthma and have him her re evaluate your situation they may have to adjust or add medications so you can keep your asthma and your attacks under control as you get older your respiratory system changes a little bit and your asthma can change worsen too are you on any preventative medication i'm on preventative meds plus an albuterol rescue inhaler keep your doctor informed of your situation especially if it is worsening if there's anything i've learned it's that you have to be on top of this and incredibly aware of what's going on your symptoms what's working and what's not if you have to write down when you're experiencing attacks how often what your symptoms are etc etc i see my pulmonologist again later this month and am hoping the new meds will give me an improved reading on my breathing tests good luck and please see your doctor Asthma Medicine Pulmonology Pneumonia Migraine Allergy Tobacco smoking Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Homeopathy Salbutamol Influenza Hay fever Prostate cancer Childbirth Breastfeeding Multiple sclerosis Chronic fatigue syndrome Placebo effect Folic acid Autism Traditional Chinese medicine Congestive heart failure Legionellosis Alternative medicine Sleep apnea Clinical depression Epilepsy Terri Schiavo Sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway Atrial septal defect Rabies Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Psoriasis Pulmonary hypertension Drowning Propranolol Urinary incontinence Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Star Wars: Galaxies Chlamydophila pneumoniae Extreme Programming First aid Physical therapy Air pollution Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Myasthenia gravis Malaria Triage Lung cancer Parkinson's disease AIDS Methylsulfonylmethane Hypoglycemia Hypothermia Multiple chemical sensitivity Bronchitis Duesberg hypothesis Fecal incontinence Myocardial infarction Botulism Potassium bromide Acute respiratory distress syndrome Heliox Stroke Growth hormone treatment Insulin Medical record Stuttering Mesothelioma Gastroesophageal reflux disease Obesity Diabetic neuropathy Milton H.
