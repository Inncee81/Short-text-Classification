when i run i can't breathe asthma or something else this may seem like an odd question to post on yahoo q a but i figured i'd wing it out there before eventually making a dr appointment somewhere ever since high school i've had a hard problem breathing when i run i was in marching band since i was and it never affected me during marching band etc unless we had to run i'm fine walking fast but jogging give me minor breathing problems where it seems that my heart is beating too fast and i can't catch up to myself internally when i finish running or jogging etc my entire body feels overexerted like i'm going to pass out or something and my heart beats very fast my mother's side of the family has an asthmatic history with my mother having the worst case with near death experiences due to her asthma and my oldest brother years older used to have it bad but his died down a bit and my other brother mos older doesn't have it at all my brothers and i didn't go to dr growing up from anyhow so possible asthma thanks for all your comments if it helps i don't jog or run regularly however i do swim at times and don't have any problems swimming no matter how fast i swim i'm ' and weigh about or so that's pretty normal it is possible you may or may not have asthema or other health problems but you can also be healthy and have that problem it all has to do with being strong and in shape when you lift weights your muscles get sore in the same way your heart is a muscle when you run it works harder movig more blood and air through your body at the same time your lungs have to work harder too if you don't run alot your heart and lungs are not in shape or used to it so it's normal to feel that way if you run more and more your heart and lungs become stronger and you are more able to handle it but even athletes face that to an extent so it's not that it isn't perfectly normal it's ok for running to be hard but the only thing is don't overdo it or do more than your body can handle if you really want to run start slow and just do a little then work your way up to more and more as you desire i would also recommend keeping up with your target heart rate you can google target heart rate and find lots of information about that find out how to measure yours the range you need to be in and work to stay within that range you could also talk to a health professional like a personal trainer or your doctor about that if you think you might have asthma or anything else find out about that too just remember that those are seperate things best of luck Asthma Equine conformation Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Theory of conduct Drowning Prostate cancer Running Urinary incontinence Muscle Social rule Dieting Pneumonia Pitaten Swimming Stomach cancer Diabetes mellitus Weight training Anorexia nervosa Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Heart Cancer Diving Exercise Cardiac arrhythmia Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Myocardial infarction Breastfeeding Hypoglycemia Decompression sickness Childbirth Fecal incontinence Breaststroke First aid EastEnders Kender Lung cancer Episodes of Lost (Season 1) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Tobacco smoking Time Out of Mind Aspartame Shock Shaggy dog story Microeconomics Tocopherol Butterfly stroke Unreal Piccolo Junior Saga Poker jargon Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Traumatic brain injury Aerial (dance move) Carbon dioxide Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Cocaine Babe Ruth Blood (computer game) Computer virus Sport rowing Backstroke Death Poliomyelitis Mattress Physical examination Knife Lung Psoriasis Shen Gong Wu Coeliac disease Heart rate Milton H.
