asthma advair question someone told me that advair can could cause heart problems that it can could cause someones heart to stop is that true why or why not why would she say such a thing that isn't true the person told me it made her have heart problems but if that was true i wouldn't think that the fda would approve of the drug doctors wouldn't prescribe it i'm so worried about taking it now i'm going to see if my psycharist will help me take it tonight just in case i have a serious side effect of the medince just in case i have a allergic reaction to the medince since my whole family doesn't take things seriously should i have my psycharist help me take it tonight why or why not why does she think advair caused her heart problems i would like to check more into this because when my son was at the allergist on wed he lowered his advair from to and kept asking if he was having any chest pains he also started telling me that i shouldn't worry about things that god was in control and there was nothing i could do i had not idea what he was getting at i thought he was just trying to be nice to me at first the only thing i was worried about at the time was his weight because he weighed over lbs and is only going to be yrs old on i have not called him back over this because he is only in the office on wed and thurs i have not been able to sleep worrying about this i got up at am and started checking on the internet and found your message i am going to call his pediatrician this morning and make an appt because i think there is something to this i will freak out if he has something wrong with him and i was not told about that this medication can cause problems if you want i can report back what i found out there are a lot of medications that cause serious problems out there that the fda approves and the reason they do is because it is apparently worth the risk of fixing one problem and taking a chance that the other problems it could cause would not happen i am tired and i guess what i am trying to say is i think they feel it is better to treat the asthma and take a chance that you may never get the heart problem i know my dad had a brain tumor and the medication they gave him helped the tumor but in the process he developed luekemia which is what he died from i don't think it makes any sense but that is the way they do things i am not happy thinking that my son may have or develop heart problems and i think you should talk to someone i am definiately going to this morning do not stop taking it though it can be very dangerous and cause you to have an asthma attack i am still giving it to my son i am just going to have him checked out and that is what you should do i do not know how old you are but have your dr give you a ekg Asthma Prostate cancer Theory of conduct Aspartame Stomach cancer Urinary incontinence Debugging Social rule Avenue Q Traumatic brain injury Grandview, U.S.A.
