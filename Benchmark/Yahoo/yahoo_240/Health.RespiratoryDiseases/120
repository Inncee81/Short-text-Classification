why can't i stand smokers i've always hated it when those close to me smoke i get this overwhelming feeling of disappointment and anger i really can't control it i know it's because my grandpa died of lung cancer and my uncle is now paralyzed from a stroke due to smoking and drinking no one else really smokes in my family just my grandpa and uncle when i found out my bestfriend smoked i was so angry i told her i was disappointed and thought she should quit today i found out my bf started to smoke he said sorry to disappoint me usually i would storm out in anger but i've learned that i can't force people to stop smoking so i told him not to do it around me or even let me see the pack i have also requested that from my bestfriend for some reason i always have this heavy weight on my chest when i see something like that i know not seeing it won't change what i'm feeling but it'll make me forget even for a moment i really just want to smack them instead of being calm i can't accept it it's understandable really especially those who have lost someone close to them you can't help but think god how can people be so idiotic to smoke it is only going to kill them quicker i know i feel that anger being a smoker before what stopped me was watching a video on youtube go figure basically have your friends do this get a fresh kleenex inhale and hold the smoke in your mouth blow it onto the kleenex inhale the pull and then blow out you will notice how much tar there is from not inhaling and then on the other blow there is hardly any thus meaning all that tar is going somewhere in your lungs ever since seeing that i've quit smoking how gross you can't force people but you can tell them how it makes you feel and why Tobacco smoking Bong Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Smoking pipe Cigarette Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Cigarette Smoking Man One Piece minor characters Lung cancer Causality Cannabis (drug) Cancer of the larynx Drowning Shaggy dog story Avenue Q Piccolo Junior Saga Tenshinhan EastEnders God Emperor of Dune Megan Griffin Tobacco Humphrey Bogart Characters of Lost Medical cannabis Milton H.
