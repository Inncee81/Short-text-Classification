i am looking for a training to get a job with good money making i was thinking of computer related career like computer programing or repair or web design what do you think or is there any other career that makes good money i decided i don't want the medical field i live in a small town and to personal and no jobs i would like something that i can get to go into my own business if possible thanks you iln advance if you are in a small town good luck the better technology careers are in larger cities start by looking at the jobs that are available in your area then decide or don't make money your primary search item just looking for a job where you make good money doesn't help you find something you are good at and computers and technology are things that either you are good at or you are not you generally don't learn it well and won't make good money consulting is a good money making career but it takes experience you can do that in any area so find what you like and do that you will be much happier inthe long run Software engineering Computer W.
