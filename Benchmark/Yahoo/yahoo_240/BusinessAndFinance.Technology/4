picking a career hey all am starting collge this fall and will be basically enrolled into the general requirement classes mostly because i have no idea what i want to be i do however have some interests like travelling doing research but not things like which molecule has more cells if thats even existent basically i dont think am a science buf i like home renovation shows does that even matter i like cooking baking i am very interested in foreign languages and cultures and am currently trying to be fluent in spanish i toke it for years in high school so i know much of the basic stuff thats just a window into my head i guess it just seems like some things i like but not so much to do it as a career and i really dont want to be one of those people who do a job for the wrong reasons and just plain miserable i do want to be able to support myself though any input would be great thanks in advance ciao that's what electives are for to explore what you like most people do not know what they are majoring in until end of sophomore year remember your major does not necessarily have to match up with your career it's a common misconception it helps finding a job after college but other people gain valuable experience and skills in part time or summer jobs i know people who are in education administration but majored in communications i majored in computer science math but i am a technical trainer my advice is to take electives in your freshman year that might interest you as a major for example take a psychology course and anthropology course Education in the United States Secondary education in the United States Mathematics Science Education in the People's Republic of China Francis Crick Economic inequality Stuyvesant High School GED Education in Romania Psychology Computer Cornell University History of science Anthropology University of Central Florida BASIC programming language Lisp programming language SAT Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Advanced Placement Program Color Education in Germany Cultural relativism Philosophy of science Second language acquisition Cooperative education Chinese University of Hong Kong Worcester Polytechnic Institute Anti-intellectualism Education in Japan Georgetown University XML Parapsychology Physics Graduate school Amateur radio University of Massachusetts Amherst Professor Franz Boas University of Connecticut American University Affirmative action Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy University of Pennsylvania Password Game programmer Martial art Florida Institute of Technology University of Michigan Quizbowl Multilingual Religion Social psychology Duke University Lynbrook High School University of Coimbra Georgia Institute of Technology Pennsylvania State University Trinity College, Dublin Education in Portugal Intelligence quotient G__del's incompleteness theorem University of Tennessee Merrimack College Game Complexity classes P and NP Electrophysiology Human Education in Hong Kong W.
