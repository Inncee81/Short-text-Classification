computer related degrees can someone give advice between two currently i am attending college for a computer degree i am in the intitial phase of classes and am thinking about changing the degree somewhat the current degree i am taking is computer information systems and i am starting to struggle with the amount of programming involved although i could probably push myself through it with lower gpa so what i am considering is the computer network administration degree however i'm worried that a network admin degree may somewhat limit my job qualification in the field is this a somewhat accurate asumption would i be making a sacrifice possibly pay wise by choosing this degree i would love to hear advice from those with similar degrees and where your degree has taken you my advice to you is to go for any computer degree these days employers do not care what type of computer degree you have as long as you have one you can easily enter any career you want it's all about the knowledge aptitude and experience i personally have a b s in computer science this degree allows me to get any technical job i have been a technical writer i t support tech trainer tech writer web developer i also wouldn't worry about gpa as long as you pass it's a misnomer that employers care about your gpa for your interest i would stick to a computer field that interests you there is no point in learning something that you are not interested in cis and cna is not going to affect your salary all technical jobs pay well unless you are planning on making six figures any technical degree will do programming is more versatile than network administration you can program in the video game web applications desktop applications it's pretty much endless Grade (education) Education in Germany Game programmer Expert system Master's degree Education in Portugal IBM PC compatible Graduate school Password College admissions Medical school X Window System Management information system Academia Windows 2000 Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Lawyer Nurse Georgia Institute of Technology Mach kernel Software engineering Education in the United States Open access Hacker Economic inequality Paralegal Electrical engineering Computer virus Pretty Good Privacy Inheritance (computer science) Psychology Mac OS X Middle Tennessee State University Bluetooth Education in Romania Common Unix Printing System Surveillance Backgammon Education Stevens Institute of Technology Software testing Internet Apprenticeship University of Michigan Apple Computer Cooperative education OpenGL Education in Hong Kong Outsourcing Education in Japan Electric motor Computer-supported collaboration Global Positioning System College Musical Instrument Digital Interface Physician Apple Macintosh Digital photography Whois Windows XP Health insurance Logic 2channel Embedded system Professor PostScript Amateur radio Mouse (computing) Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution Redundant array of independent disks Enterprise content management Central processing unit Extreme Programming Computer science Stereoscopy Public policy No Child Left Behind Act Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Law school MMORPG Second language acquisition Education in Australia Futures Studies Grid computing Chiropractic Student loan Computer role-playing game The Citadel (Military College) Linux
