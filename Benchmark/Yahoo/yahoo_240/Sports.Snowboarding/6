for snowboarding do all bindings fit all snowboards and do all boots fit all bindings i'm thinking of buying a snowboard by purchasing separate parts online but i'm not sure if the parts have to match each other or be the same brand i wouldent recommend buying boots online as you really need to try them on first before buying then your boots are your most important bit of kit its vitally important that they fit your feet well go down your local shop and try on all the boots in your size and in your price range and buy the ones that feel the most comfortable regardless of brand or style once you have your boots then get your bindings not all boots fit all bindings if they are different makes so it best to take your boots with you when buying bindings to check the fit is right i know this from having made the same mistake myself a few years back if your boots and bindings are the same make they will fit together guarenteed but you don't have to stick to the same brand for all parts to be honest most peoples set up is made up from various different brands most bindings fit most snowboards but again there are a few makes that clash with each other so its best to check the fit before you buy good luck Snowboarding Snowboard Skiing Skinhead Shoe PlayStation 2 Mattress Ski touring Boot Monopoly (game) Tesco Ski Theory of conduct Handloading The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time weapons and items IPod Surveillance Cowboy boot Poker jargon Electronic commerce Tire Binoculars Kitesurfing Upholstery Diving suit Hard disk GURPS Mutual fund File Allocation Table Neopets High-heeled shoe Motorcycle Ethical consumerism David Beckham Economics RuneScape economy Commodore International Boots Group Bondage (BDSM) Electronic Arts World Championship Wrestling Sears Holdings Corporation Team Fortress Classic Leyland Princess Supply and demand Bicycle lighting Skateboarding trick Airsoft IBM PC compatible Partition (computing) Winter Ford Sierra MapleStory Sydney Riot of 1879 Gramophone record Ski binding O scale Betting (poker) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Equine conformation Brassiere Booting Shit Lego F-16 Fighting Falcon Kimberly-Clark Corporation PlayStation Portable Spanking Internet fraud Advanced Squad Leader Advertising USB flash drive De Lorean DMC-12 Car handling Nintendo Ed, Edd n Eddy Scale model Violin Toyota MR2 Mid-levels Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man Best Buy Autogyro Diving cylinder Wellington boot Horseshoe Windows 2000 Milton H.
