why answer questions in a sarcastic way to all of you who answered the walmart question with sarcasim why i come on this site to ask a question and get a fair respectable answer not to be disrespected so this is not a question but a response please be respectful i just wanted an opinion not judgement passed upon me for daring to bring my car to walmart i was just asking a question i do not need the smart sarcastic remarks hmm sarcasm is sometimes in the eye of the beholder i don't think i was sarcastic in how i answered but i did give you a real life example flipping the situation around to show you a different perspective on things i really really like real life examples because they help put the situation in perspective not to say that i'm not sarcastic sometimes because hey i am i don't get paid to answer questions i do it for fun and this doesn't apply to your question but it can be frustrating to have people taking the time to post a question that gets asked every day but not wanting to search the questions to see if it's been asked before like can i take out life insurance on someone without their knowledge is a daily question also not necessarily your question some of the questions can be answered with basic common sense and then of course some are so ridiculously out there that they read like a joke and if it looks like a joke they can expect a jokey answer that's entirely fair in my book there are a few people that are just answering for the points i don't know and then you get the spammers sigh borrrriiiinnnnggg lastly we're all human here none of us are perfect and none of us are wikipedia so you can expect personality to come through and with the millions of people that use yahoo well you're just flat out not going to like some of the personalities that's the way the world works hope that helps a bit Theory of conduct Slashdot subculture Social rule Irony Goodness and value theory Have I Got News For You U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Internet troll Jeopardy!
