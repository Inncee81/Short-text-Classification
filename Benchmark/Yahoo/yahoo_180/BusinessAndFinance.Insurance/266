canadian health insurance medicare or private and which private companies are best right now i am on my father's work insurance plan i turn in january and will no longer be insured under his plan i work full time am not a student right now am a non smoker but my problem is that i've been diagnosed with depression and a slew of other mental health problems so i take a lot of prescription medication i also have scoliosis and see a chiropractor on a regular basis i called up manulife insurance which used to be my insurer a few years back and i was basically told that i would be refused under their flexcare policy because of my depression i would probably be accepted under their followme plan my question is would i be better off getting my own plan with a private company or should i just stick with regular medicare will they cover my drugs if i should go with private which companies are best thanks a lot in case anyone else is as dim as these two yes i live in canada hence the 'canadian health insurance' part of my question ayoy t'es pas vite um dunno what government you're talking about there p m but canadian medicare does cover many prescription drugs not always in full and some only if it's the generic brand but they certainly do cover many prescriptions unfortunately our government health care plan does not cover drugs note that the canada health act does not cover drugs although some provinces may offer some assistance for some people in various socio economic groups the two most common carriers i quote for clients tend to be manulife financial and desjardins financial i find both of them flexible in underwriting depending on the situation work with an advisor in your city town and see what he she can do personally i find that if i speak with the carrier's marketing underwriting consultant before i submit the application i am better able to position a case to the carrier for a more favourable decision for my client its likely there could be some exclusions added to the contract but it doesn't hurt to apply to find out Publicly funded medicine Health insurance Medicare (Canada) Insurance Health care in Canada Medicare (United States) Canada Health Act Chiropractic Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Social Security (United States) Pharmaceutical company Economy of the United States Citigroup Psychiatry Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Financial services Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme Controlled Substances Act Emergency Medical Services Health maintenance organization American Medical Association Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Same-sex marriage in Canada Medicare Part D Taxation in the United States Drug abuse Contract Drug test Unemployment Addiction Politics of Canada Government debt Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act Ethics Security (finance) Convention on Psychotropic Substances Graduate school Divorce United Kingdom corporation tax Mental illness Canadian Senate US health reform under FDR Keynesian economics Osteopathy Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe Canadian House of Commons Homeopathy Barbara Boxer Medicine Dalton McGuinty Unemployment benefit Clinical depression Professor Bank Mediation Tommy Douglas Lawyer Target Corporation Food and Drug Administration Medical cannabis Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Medicare (Australia) Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Plame affair Privatization Annuity Abortion in Canada Health savings account Mortgage Lloyd's of London Medical prescription Government agencies in Sweden Auto insurance Medicaid Brian Mulroney Arguments for and against drug prohibition Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome GED Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation John Hancock Tower Managed care Emergency contraception Prostate cancer
