can an insurance company use the fact that i had an hiv test as the basis for increasing my premiums i heard through the grapevine that someone from gb was in the u s and had a mandatory hiv test my understanding is that subsequent to the test and independent of the result the test was negative his health insurance premiums went up in effect the individual believes that the fact of having had an hiv test increased his premiums e g as the test may have been a risk factor indicator to the insurance company i am wondering if it is legal in the u s to use the simple fact of having had an hiv test as the basis for risk determination and adjustment of health insurance premiums thanks for your insights there are lots of conflicting responses here shakes head in disbelief the answer is no nowadays an hiv test is considered part of a normal workup for sexually active adults a health insurer cannot raise a person's premium simply because of such an innocuous test secondly while this may be an individual policy instead of a group policy individual policies do not receive individual rate increases in other words your friend's insurer calculates premiums based on the claims losses from all insureds having the same policy that your friend does so he was not the only one whose premium increased generally premiums can only be individually increased due to a person transitioning into a higher age bracket if your friend wants to confirm the reason s why his premium increased he can file a complaint with his state's insurance commissioner's office which will investigate one final thought insurers cannot do whatever they want to do as some folks wrote above they must abide by the insurance laws of the states where they sell policies actually insurers are highly regulated Insurance Life insurance Health insurance Contract Microeconomics HIV test Annuity Lloyd's of London HIV Medical analysis of circumcision Taxation in the United States Auto insurance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Mutual fund Duesberg hypothesis Inflation Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Cancer Medical malpractice Prostate cancer Cable television Supply and demand Variable universal life insurance Consensual crime Intelligence quotient Keynesian economics Economics AIDS reappraisal Citigroup Methamphetamine Antiretroviral drug Hepatitis C Infantilism Legal aspects of transsexualism Unemployment benefit AIDS in Africa HIV vaccine Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Tax Human sexual behavior Biology and sexual orientation Wal-Mart Model (economics) E85 Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Capital accumulation Pharmaceutical company Medicare (Canada) Government agencies in Sweden Transsexuality Same-sex marriage AIDS pandemic Liability insurance Coeliac disease FairTax Psychology Capitalism Arguments for and against drug prohibition Corporate governance Growth hormone treatment United Kingdom corporation tax Bioethics of neonatal circumcision Anorexia nervosa Mobile phone radiation and health Social Security (United States) Herpes simplex virus Rape Drug test Ethics Abortion Estoppel Administrative law of the United States Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Hypoglycemia Free trade Liberalism Health care in the United States Food and Drug Administration American International Group Expert system Hyperinflation Publicly funded medicine Drug abuse Education in the United States Borderline personality disorder United States Postal Service Probation officer
