auto insurance question my insurance company wrote an estimate to repair my vehicle and didn't use new parts what is the difference between 'used' and 'aftermarket' parts are they allowed to do this used parts come from a similar vehicle as yours that was already wrecked but still has good parts on it aftermarket parts are 'new' but not made by the company that made the original parts on your vehicle they are suppose to be made to the standards of the original parts aftermarket parts on things like brake pads etc are usually fine however when it comes to body parts i would prefer used this is because they usually will take a group of parts already together this will limit the number of welds needed to put the parts on as for if they can do this it is standard practice to do this for vehicles more than a couple years old Insurance Auto insurance Vinyl roof Ford Mustang Toyota Camry Toyota Prius Health insurance Volkswagen Golf Motorcycle Rail terminology Station wagon E85 Dodge Neon Drag racing Automobile Dodge Charger Automatic number plate recognition Welding Car handling Bicycle frame Life insurance Road-rule enforcement camera Chevrolet Corvette Chevrolet Corvair engine Toyota Land Cruiser Radio controlled car Sport utility vehicle Personal rapid transit Reliability engineering Speed limit Annuity Disc brake Porsche 928 BMW De Lorean Motor Company Lamborghini Diablo Lloyd's of London Ship of Theseus Automatic transmission Auto racing NASCAR Unemployment Mini Clarinet Mazda RX-7 Nissan Skyline Variable universal life insurance Autobahn M1911 Crew Exploration Vehicle Novelty (locomotive) Crash test dummy German car number plates Coupling (railway) Solar car Screw Wayne Corporation Floppy disk Tire Locomotive Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Knight Rider Four wheel drive M16 (rifle) School bus Strap-on dildo Casting Drifting (motorsport) Contract M4 Sherman Bicycle brake systems Road traffic accident Atmospheric reentry Inertial guidance system Yugo Semi-trailer Normal distribution Audi Bicycle helmet Wal-Mart Land Rover Range Rover Security (finance) Mitsubishi Eclipse Grand Theft Auto (game) Hybrid vehicle Citigroup Mutual fund History of the automobile BMW Z1 Saskatchewan Government Insurance Arc welding Driver's license Truck Gmail Chair Warranty Progressive Corporation Microeconomics Volkswagen Beetle
