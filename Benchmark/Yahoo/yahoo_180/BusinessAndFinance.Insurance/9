my home was burglarized my homeowners insurance company allied said that if i file a claim my insurance premium will increase as mush as let me understand this allied will give me a check for the items taken then make me pay for the check over time isn't that like being vicimized twice why would my premium increase for using my homeowners insurance isn't that what i've been paying them for every month for the last years actually that's how it works with every insurance company these days yes i hear lots of complaints about that but then they are assigning your rates based on your risk score how likely you are to have a claim the only way they wouldn't charge you claims points which is what they're talking about when they say your insurance will go up is if they charged everyone like they were in the highest risk group why don't you ask the people who were in the path of katrina how they like those kinds of rates in other words they could just assume that you're going to turn in a lot of claims and charge you the highest possible rates all along or they can rate you based on your risk profile and then increase your premium if your risk profile changes incidentally i doubt they meant a increase a theft claim will assign you claims points and that usually translates to a increase for big claims there's no question you turn it in but this is why insurance agents recommend you take larger deductibles because it's rarely worthwhile to turn in small claims you'll likely end up paying more out in premium over the three years that you're assessed claims points than you ever got back out of the claim in the first place Insurance Life insurance Health insurance Annuity Auto insurance Wal-Mart Home insurance Publicly funded medicine Citigroup Predatory lending Lloyd's of London Flat tax Earthquake insurance Mutual fund Mortgage Medical malpractice SCO-Linux controversies FairTax Neopets Adverse selection United Kingdom corporation tax Karl Rove Variable universal life insurance Unemployment benefit British national identity card Blackjack Warren Buffett Primerica Financial Services Betting (poker) Taxation in the United States Contract Capital accumulation Title insurance Secretar__a de Inteligencia Poker jargon Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Extreme Programming Bank Yield curve Universal life insurance Hurricane Rita Probation officer Gasoline Oil-for-Food Programme Philosophical skepticism Gun politics Tax Theory of conduct Cable television Debt ELO rating system Goodness and value theory Microeconomics Health care in the United States Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Prostate cancer Telephone numbering plan Social Security debate (United States) Mediation Unemployment Interest E-mail spam Firefighter Financial markets Property tax Model (economics) Surveillance HIPAA Cost of capital CPU cache Grand Theft Auto (game) Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change George W.
