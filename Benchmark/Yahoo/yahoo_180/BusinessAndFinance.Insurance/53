life insurance investment hi i recently got life insurance and illness insuance i'll be paying around month ouch im only and my dad said after years my life insurance would be free and i'll be able to collect all the money back which i gave to the insurance company plus interest i asked the insurance company and they said if i take out the money when im than they would give me about k or something but if i take it out when im years of age the money i'll be able to take out would be around k is this how most insurance companies work or is this something fishy i still don't have anything in writing since i just signed papers last friday i believe thanks life insurance is not an investment your dad is likely wrong they don't pay interest even those paid up ones the insurance company keeps the interest they are way overcharging you do the math if you invested a month use this calculator that's what i'm plugging in http www msfinancialsavvy com calculators monthly deposit savings calculator php at a very modest the market averages you'd have over after years and at you'd have almost million so the insurance company is investing your money and giving you a paltry of it back keeping if you did it at the stock market average you'll retire at with almost five million dollars yes that's how they work the lion's share of the profit goes to them always do the math and remember life insurance is not not not not an investment or rather it's a crappy one Life insurance Insurance Annuity Warren Buffett Mutual fund Bond Finance Social Security (United States) Citigroup Bank Economy of Russia Money Personal finance PE ratio Security (finance) Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Stock Wal-Mart Financial services Short selling Lloyd's of London Health insurance Primerica Financial Services Capitalism Gold as an investment FairTax Variable universal life insurance Capital accumulation Financial markets Hyperinflation Investment bank United Kingdom corporation tax Temasek Holdings Reaganomics Credit card Dividend 401(k) NASDAQ Individual Savings Account Unemployment MMORPG HIH Insurance Bank fraud Derivative (finance) Certificate of deposit Taxation in the United States Dot-com Unemployment benefit Interest Prudential plc Michael Milken Debt Gross domestic product Tax Enron Corporation Gambling New Deal Mortgage Actuary Ocean's Twelve Economy of India Corporate finance Sears Holdings Corporation Donald Trump Inflation Deflation (economics) Stock market Health care in the United States Microeconomics National Insurance Advance fee fraud Economy of Pakistan Foreign exchange market Hillary Rodham Clinton Cost of capital Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Economy of Chile Retirement plan Salary cap Income trust Handelsbanken United Artists Corporation Blackjack Trust (Law) USA Pension Keynesian economics Bretton Woods system Money creation Margin (finance) Oakland Athletics Supply-side economics Privatization Mad Money Usury
