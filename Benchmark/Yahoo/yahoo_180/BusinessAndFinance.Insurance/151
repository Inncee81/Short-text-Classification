optional liability damage waivers my boyfriend and me are currently renting a lap top from colortyme and we have been paying for the optional liability damage waiver well in june our home was broken into and the crooks stole my laptop and we are still being held responsible for it what i would like to know is what does the waiver cover i am so confused because the manager has lied to me about what i have been responsible for before we put a deposit on a tv but then changed our minds and called to tell him the next morning and he said he would not refund our deposit but then i called the corporate office on him and he was told to give it back to us so i'm not sure if he is just trying to get the money or if we are still responsible if we are then i want to know what the purpose of having the waiver and paying for it was for please help me if i find that i should not be responsible i will take as much legal action against him or the company as i can thank you the lease agreement paper i have says absolutely nothing about what is covered it doesn't even mention the protection plan which is what they call it i can't read what is not there it just shows what they charge me for having it you need to read the waiver to see what it covers and what it doesn't typically it won't cover theft that's what renters insurance is for Auto insurance Life insurance Annuity Poker jargon Plame affair Estoppel Taxation in the United States Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Liability Contract Intellectual property Credit card Security (finance) Lloyd's of London Tax Corporation Rental agreement Tort reform Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Enron Corporation Slander and libel Home insurance Citigroup Public domain United States Postal Service Mortgage Avenue Q Octopus card Bond Leasing Surveillance Bank Johnny 5 Ocean's Twelve Babylonian law Internet fraud Renting Microeconomics Bank fraud Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Xerox Business ethics REAL ID Act Laptop United Kingdom corporation tax Stock Schabir Shaik Trial Medical malpractice Price discrimination Scientology beliefs and practices Trust (Law) USA Money creation Islamic banking Jury trial Fractional-reserve banking Product liability International Criminal Court SCO-Linux controversies Glossary of American football Wal-Mart Piercing the corporate veil Corporate personhood Derivative (finance) Timeline of the Enron scandal Creative accounting Copyright infringement of software Warranty Miranda v.
