quick question about how college courses work thank you hi i'm about to apply to colleges and excuse me for sounding so ridiculous but i have hardly any idea about how college courses and lectures are set up here are my basic questions for a few of the colleges i'm interested in they have the syllabi right online that includes the lecture dates the homework and when the homework is due in most cases there are only lectures listed spread out across or months is that really all the classes that there are i'm used to the hours a day days a week in high school do college courses really only meet like once a week or are there other meetings that you're required to go to that aren't called lectures and i thought i had another one but apparently i forget ha i'll add it later if i remember anyway thanks for any help and i'll pick a best answer today thank youuuuuuu yes most colleges classes only meet once or twice a week each class has a certain number of hours that it meets per week depending on how many credits i go to a small private college in california so ours are a bit different but all classes meet for a total of hours per credit and each class is one credit so either they will meet once a week for hours twice a week for hours or three times a week for minutes each this is different at larger universities because then you have section and whatnot that's required i'm not exactly an expert on all that since i've never dealt with it so to answer your question no you're not in class for hours a day if you have any more questions feel free to message me GED Theory of conduct Scientology beliefs and practices Grade (education) Professor Education in the People's Republic of China College University of Massachusetts Amherst Extreme Programming Law school Advanced Placement Program Secondary education in France Student loan 2005 trial of Michael Jackson National Certificate of Educational Achievement Hunter College High School Adjoint functors Savannah College of Art and Design Education in Malaysia Juris Doctor Plame affair London Congestion Charge Education in France Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act PLATO Intelligent design movement Education in Hong Kong Community college Dog agility Chiropractic Education in Portugal Victor Cousin Have I Got News For You Object-oriented programming Shaggy dog story Charles William Eliot IB Diploma Programme Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Mao (game) Expert system Hey Jude G__del's incompleteness theorem Password Dublin City University Hogwarts Internet fraud Secondary education in Japan Abington School District v.
