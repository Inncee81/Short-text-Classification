best way to retain information for exams any tips for remembering large quantities of complex information for my law finals in three weeks thanks everyone i really appreciate your suggestions there are alot of techniques you can use 'situation dependent learning' can be useful if you have access to where you will actually sit your exams i'd suggest doing some of your studying there it's amazing how effective this is if you could get hold of an nlp learning style diagnostic tool don't know where you could get one but if you can't find it woth google then you might try a p p network i'm always surprised at what obscure stuff i can find on things like limewire and shareaza then you can work out your ideal learning strategy whether you are predominantly visual auditory or kinaesthetic personally i find transferring notes to audio and listening to them whilst i argue with it in my head and doodle works but there are other ways that may work for you studying when you are tired has been shown to be more effective in terms of info' retention but my guess is that has alot to do with the extra effort and focus you have to bring to the topic then i'm a big fan of networking ideas if you read critically then you appply whatever other knowledge you have to the stuff you are trying to 'memorise' and the more links yuou can draw the more 'embedded' it becomes in a similar vein spider graphs showinig the links between different ideas helps especially if you're a visual learner personally as a kinaesthetic learner it's important that i fidget and doodle when i am studying studying in min working min doing something completely different not tv has been shown to be more effective than studying for the full hour upon hour any use Second language acquisition Educational animation Hypnosis GED CPU cache Neuro-linguistic programming Graph theory Learning styles Computer Dyscalculia Google search Autism Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Software engineering Chinese language Milton H.
