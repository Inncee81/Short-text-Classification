how long will it take to get a master's degree in social work i need a master's degree in social work typically it takes four years to earn a bachelor's degree and then two years after that to earn a masters i say typically because that estimation is for a full time student it depends on the pace you set if you have a full time job and are taking night classes it could take a little longer to earn that degree it depends on how many hours you take per semester the average full time student will take credit hours basically classes some take more some take less a part time student is someone who takes less than credit hours per semester credit hour semesters are considered full time student but it can add an extra year on to your degree less than can add multiple years sometimes though it's best for full time workers to do a class or two here and there because they have other priorities in life it really depends on you i hope this helps Graduate school Juris Doctor Master's degree Professor The Citadel (Military College) Community college Bologna process Lawyer Nurse Education in Portugal Academic term Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Australia Social Security (United States) Economic inequality Kwantlen University College Massachusetts Institute of Technology Education in Romania Medical school Bachelor of Arts Cricket Dog agility Software engineering Education in Taiwan University of Houston Physician Unemployment Architect Attorney at Law Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Working time Electrical engineering Clements High School Gwinnett University Center Japanese tea ceremony Social work Western Kentucky University Franklin W.
