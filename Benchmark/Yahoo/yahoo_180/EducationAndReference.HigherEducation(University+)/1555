how do i be as stress free as my bf when it comes to college classes he hardly ever studies for any class and he manages to get all a's and b's i study my a off and get the same grades sometimes it really ticks me off last semester i was in of his biology classes we had our finals for those classes the next day i was freaking out and studying for hours i decided to go over to my bf's place so he could help me study i get over there and expect to find him studying instead hes playing xbox with his roomate he told me that studying is a waste of time you either know it or you dont he shows up to classes with nothing he did make a good point why he does this however one day after class he started talking about stuff and i had no idea the professor had said these things then he tells me because i was too busy taking notes that i did not pay attention and thats why i have to study so long i noticed that on our tests he misses all the easy questions that you would know from studying like vocab while he gets all the thought thinking ones correct should i try his ways or is he just smart and he doesn t have to take notes he told me that he wasn t smart and that i was smarter then him he also said that when i stress out over tests like finals i m too busy worrying about taking the test and that s what i think about while i m studying therefore i need to study longer so then how do i change my habits should i change my habits i would like to be as stress free as he is and enjoy my last year of college when i was in college i hardly studied hardly took notes and manage to get as and bs on my tests what i do is i study a day or two before the tests with an outline of materials i find that to be enough most of the notes in classes are posted on the internet or can be purchased from a local student notes store with that being said i think there is a difference between girls and guys when it comes to studying for guys the ones that i know likes to be logical and when they study they go for why once they understand why the answer is the answer they are satisfied and this is a good strategy because most questions on exams are just variations of practice problems or homework questions girls on the other hand tries to cram in as much as they can you will often see girls in the library taking up a whole table with class notes course printouts practice exams etc if this is you then it explains why you get the easier questions on the exams correct the easier questions are most likely the ones that tests your memory to see if you remember something that was said in class or on notes and because you spend so much time memorizing the answers you will tend to get those kind of questions correct however when it comes to questions that tests your core understanding of the material you might have trouble with i think you two should combine your study habits Education in Romania Economics Extreme Programming Theory of conduct GED Test (student assessment) Education in Germany Education in the United States SAT Graduate school Education in the People's Republic of China Advanced Placement Program Scientific method Philosophy of language Jumpstart 3rd Grade Debugging Procrastination Massachusetts Institute of Technology Species Social rule Milton H.
