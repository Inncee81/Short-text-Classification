can you type college exams papers in college do you have the choice to type your exam rather than handwriting it i'm really just curious my typing abilities sadly surpass my handwriting capabilities well for the most part you either fill in the blanks or do multiple choice sorta like the standard tests unless it requires a thorough demo like in calculus chemistry or other subjects if at all intimidated by the essays ask your professor if you could email him the exam and do it right there on your laptop they'll likely work out something for you but most of my exams were multiple choice true false or combo or standardized tests where you darken circles what's your major cuz it it's english lit comp tough luck chances are that if your major tends to be more technical mot of your professors have the same dread about handwriting stuff so good luck i hope you like college it was the best time of my life besides term papers projects most places ask for typed papers so you're in luck i guess you were born at the right time enjoy the hi tech and digital era hope it lasts a while Test (student assessment) SAT Education in Romania Apple Newton Computer Education in Germany Massachusetts Institute of Technology Normal distribution IB Diploma Programme Graduate school GED Grade (education) Laptop Education in Portugal Physician Typewriter American and British English differences Coming of Age (TNG episode) Magic: The Gathering Sudoku Junior Certificate Poker jargon Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination Tripartite System Ebook Architect Education in Taiwan 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines A-level The Princeton Review Law school Prostate cancer Kanji Galactic Civilizations Artificial intelligence Stuyvesant High School Wheel of Fortune Musical Instrument Digital Interface Juris Doctor Dot matrix printer Medical prescription Franklin W.
