what who is a minority when applying to university and why does this help a minority is group usually racial group that is less than the main typically this means a non white it helps because universities want a diverse student population their student populations often don't have the of minorities equal to that minority's population in the general public so they lower their standards for minorities to boost their numbers in the student population however when talking about applying to universities the key term is underrepresented minority at some schools certain minority groups are well represented far more so than the of their group in the general population so schools may not give those minorities extra consideration race quotas aren't legal but affirmative action is still going strong so if you're in a minority you normally don't need to meet the same stringent standards as whites unless you're in a minority group that's overrepresented at a university while it isn't always the case this typically just refers to asians the uc system is the easiest example to show this by population latinos should make up the largest minority population blacks would be right up there too asians should be a pretty small however in colleges particularly the public uc schools asians make up huge of the school population at uci the asian population is so great there are more of them than white people so the term underrepresented minority came about if race is given consideration for admission than you need to be an underrepresented minority to get the leeway and get the less stringent standards than whites at say the ucs asians aren't underrepresented so they have to meet the same standards as white possibly even greater standards i know on the high school level for some elite public magnet schools like lowell or whitney asians have to meet far greater standards than even whites to gain admittance Affirmative action College admissions Equal Protection Clause Lowell High School (San Francisco) Education in the People's Republic of China Grade (education) Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Grutter v.
