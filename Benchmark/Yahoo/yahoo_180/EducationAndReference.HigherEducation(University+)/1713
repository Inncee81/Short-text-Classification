online degrees university of phoenix vs community college my husband is in the military and i was wondering due to the fact that we are going to be moving around a lot would it be smarter to go to an online college or a community college to get my associates degree in arts and sciences we have a baby on the way and i have to work the extra money is nice and i become moody and depressed if i don't work i've heard that the university of phoenix is over priced and that a lot of companies do not accept it as a legitimate degree however if i do go the community college i'd have to take night classes plus there is always a chance that we could get stationed somewhere else if that happens will my student loan be transfered over to my new school and will i still only have to start paying once i graduate any answers will be appreciated thank you my experience friends that did online degrees and also in class participants in colleges like those online is that they are way overpriced and like you said aren't considered quite legitimate degrees to my knowledge all colleges now offer online classes not all classes are offered online but you'll be surprised at how many are this option would get you out of taking night classes if you have an idea of where you might be transfered to next i would suggest submitting your fafsa information to colleges in that area as well as the one you want to attend where you are now this will cover your butt when you have to transfer and relieve a lot of frustration dealing with financial aid tracking keep in mind that if you stick to online classes and then move you probably will be able to finish the semester online and not worry about it do keep your school informed of any changes though generally student loans become payable days after a six month grace period after you graduate drop to less than half time status or withdraw from school sit down with an adviser at your local community college and pose all of your questions to them then while you are there talk with a financial aid adviser as well regardless your first step is to fill out a fafsa you can do that here http www fafsa ed gov good luck and congratulations on your decision to continue your education Education in the United States College admissions Graduate school Student loan Education in Germany GED Tuition Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Education in Romania Carnegie Mellon University Life insurance Brown University Social rule Academia Medical school Education College Community college United Kingdom corporation tax Education in Portugal Associate's degree The Citadel (Military College) Franklin W.
