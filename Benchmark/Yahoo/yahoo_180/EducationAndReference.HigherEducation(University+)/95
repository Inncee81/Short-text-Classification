admission reconsideration i just got a rejection letter for masters program is it advisable to ask them to reconsider my application they haven't received all my recommendations yet should i ask them for a personal interview with admissions please advise has their application deadline already passed if their deadline has already passed they can deny just based on that did they tell you what their reason for denying you did they attempt to contact you before they denied you if they denied you due to your gpa ask if you can be reconsidered for unclassified status sometimes if you take courses as an unclassified graduate student you may be able to raise your gpa to their standards while also working towards your degree don't be discouraged take their advice as far as what your application may have been lacking and re apply for the next term best wishes College admissions Graduate school Grade (education) Law school Medical school Barrister Regents of the University of California v.
