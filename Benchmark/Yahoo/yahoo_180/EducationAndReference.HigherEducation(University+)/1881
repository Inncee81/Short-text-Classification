ucla or uci which would be better for an undergraduate degree if i wanted to go to graduate school later on because uci would give me a higher gpa but ucla is more prestigious it depends on what you want to get out of an undergrad school uci is a smaller campus historically more a commuter school and the surrounding area more suburban it also has beautiful campus and their housing much more intimate than ucla's that's not to say that uci's program is any easier than ucla's like with any u c school you'll have to put in your hours of studying ucla is a huge campus and is more prestigious you'll be up against a lot of competition because of the sheer number of its student body that being said it's also located in a pretty amazing area getty museum to the north santa monica beach to the west downtown l a to the east and manhattan beach to the south it has an active alumni as for graduate school yes it's probably true that the ucla name will impress more than a uci but remember grad schools are also looking at your gre scores as well as other criterion such as internships extra curricular activities faculty recommendations etc it's a tough call but you can't go wrong with any u c school good luck University of California, Los Angeles Graduate school University of Southern California Education in the United States Southern California UCLA School of Theater Film and Television University of California, Santa Barbara Columbia University Georgia Institute of Technology Santa Monica, California Simon Fraser University Medical school University of California Law school Physician Rice University University of Toronto Carnegie Mellon University College admissions Los Angeles County, California Affirmative action Johns Hopkins University Middle Tennessee State University University of California, Riverside Babson College Stony Brook University Juris Doctor University of Arizona State university University of Houston Georgetown University University of Connecticut Boston University Education in Portugal University of Pittsburgh Quizbowl American University University of British Columbia UCLA School of Law Cornell University University of Pennsylvania Australian National University Pennsylvania State University Regent University Northeastern University, Boston Grand Forks, North Dakota University of San Diego Harvard University Education in Australia Stern School of Business Brown University Stanford University Grade (education) Caldwell College Boston College Cleveland State University University of Maryland Baltimore County Ryerson University Westwood, Los Angeles, California University of Waterloo Stevens Institute of Technology Kennesaw State University University at Albany Sirindhorn International Institute of Technology Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Yale University California Polytechnic State University Western Michigan University Florida International University York University Whitman College University of Texas at San Antonio Williams College University of Tennessee Lowell High School (San Francisco) North Carolina State University Pace University Miami University Wake Forest University University of Mississippi University of North Dakota University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill National Autonomous University of Mexico Temple University Law School Admissions Test Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur University of Glasgow
