how do online colleges and classes work how is it even possible to take a class online can anyone explain this i am currently enrolled in an online university they do not work poorly that statement was coming form someone who obviously has not had much experience in this category i will say though that is does depend greatly on what type of degree you are going for i already have a position lined up for when i get my degree the company is even helping me with my degree by offering tuition reimbursement the online classroom setting is much more advanced than the traditional classroom setting because there is no one you can cheat off of you have to do your own work i am taking a math class currently that when i take my questions to someone who is enrolled in a traditional college for help they have no clue what to tell me they say that we are not learning that until next year so far all of my instructors but one has a phd in their respective fields it is a lot tougher than traditional colleges also in that each course only lasts weeks so while traditional college students have the entire semester to work on their final papers we only have weeks i like it much better than traditional colleges in that i can go to class any time of the day and stay for as long as i like if i have my assignment completed early all i have to do is submit it on the appropriate day and i get credit for it the only piece of advise i can offer you if you choose this method of higher education is stay ahead on the assignments do not wait until the last minute to do them because you never know if your computer will be working properly or of their website is down if you can't submit your paper on time it is always your fault and you will be counted off for it but if you are ahead of the game you will never be late Graduate school Education in the United States Education in Romania Education in Germany Academia GED Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Australia Juris Doctor Grade (education) University of Massachusetts Amherst Community college Princeton University Gwinnett University Center North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics Massachusetts Institute of Technology Columbia University Kwantlen University College The Citadel (Military College) Education in Taiwan Teacher Cornell University Academic term Education in Portugal American University Credit card Georgia Institute of Technology Professor Education in Hong Kong Education in Austria Virginia Military Institute Brown University Hopkins School Pennsylvania State University Dog agility Stuyvesant High School Athabasca University Cooperative education College admissions Mathematics Doctorate Chiropractic SAT Education National Certificate of Educational Achievement California Polytechnic State University University of Coimbra Japanese tea ceremony Associate's degree PLATO No Child Left Behind Act Nurse The Amazing Race Bowdoin College Community High School, Ann Arbor, Michigan __cole Polytechnique Education in Malaysia Physician Lawyer Advanced Placement Program Florida Institute of Technology College of the Southwest University of Houston Education in Japan Student loan Test (student assessment) Education in France Middle Tennessee State University North Carolina State University University of Central Florida Redundant array of independent disks Caldwell College Scientific method College IB Diploma Programme Emerson College Rick Santorum The Princeton Review Salt Lake Community College University of Maryland University College Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets Quizbowl Sudoku Drew University Florida State University Harvard Division of Continuing Education Computer and video game genres Virginia Commonwealth University Experiential education Northeastern University, Boston Worcester Polytechnic Institute Babson College
