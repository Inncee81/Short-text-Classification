if you have taken classes in the past year can you continue where you left off or do you have to start over i'm assuming you're talking about classes in a series such as for example bio a c if you've completed a but not b or c then you can continue off at bio b of course this may not be the case for all schools but i believe it is the case for most the only problem is that for some series the subsequent classes require prior knowledge taught in the previous classes so if you do continue where you left off you might struggle to recall past information Graduate school Natural deduction Doomsday argument GED Dynamical system IBM PC compatible Cryptanalysis Plame affair Propaedeutic value of Esperanto No Child Left Behind Act Education Final Fantasy magic Hogwarts subjects Fibonacci number Standardized testing Plurality electoral system Sonic the Hedgehog Creationism Self programming language Modchip Education in Australia British Rail Class 86 High school British nationality law Advanced Technology Attachment Education in the People's Republic of China Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Janashakti Life Existence of God Expert system Stare decisis Debugging The Amazing Race Driver's license Many-worlds interpretation IB Diploma Programme Professor Medical school Master's degree Starfleet ranks and insignia British Locomotive and Multiple Unit Numbering and Classification Danish Folkeskole Education History of operating systems Lebesgue integration Software testing Sant Thakar Singh Creation and evolution in public education Grade (education) Unified Modeling Language Equilibrium (2002 film) Free will Convergence of Fourier series Education in Romania Scientology beliefs and practices Education in the United States Requirements analysis Bayesian inference Patch (computing) Juris Doctor Autobot Matrix of Leadership Bah__'__ Faith and Education Annuity Brown v.
