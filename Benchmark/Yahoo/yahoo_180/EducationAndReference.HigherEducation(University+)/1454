what classes should i take okay im thinking about working in the wall street buisness but im not actually sure which classes i should be taking in my last years of high school and college anyone have input also i would like some advice bc i noe itz kind of hard for woman on wall street does anyone have any experience or noes someone who works on wall street well im in all of the top math classes including pre calculus and i think i have a business course in my school and as for a computer course yea i have one but tat teacher hates my guts so i dont myself taking that class anytime soon lmaoooo you should talk to your guidance counselor before you start school they can probably point you in the right direction of classes to take lots of math and business classes i don't know if your school has a business program like mine but if you do it would be a great thing to apply for and probably trying to get a job with a bank through your school or ojt program would really give you some experience and with the woman thing as long as you work hard and know your stuff there should be no problem best of luck Mathematics W.
