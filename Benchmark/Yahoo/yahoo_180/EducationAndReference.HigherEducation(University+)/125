aba approved school for paralegal vs b s and non aba school for paralegal i received my b s in business i have researched many schools that offer the paralegal certificate some are aba approved and most are not my question is this would you hire a person who has a b s degree with a paralegal certificate from an on line school that is not aba approved thanks it depends on the law firm organization if you want to work for a reputable law firm many of the larger more prestigious firms then an aba approved certificate is preferred if you're interested in a smaller more boutique firm or possibly a government agency then a non aba approved certificate may pass muster many firms will look at your undergrad degree as a plus there are paralegals without degrees and many firms prefer their paralegals have an undergrad degree that and an aba approved certificate makes you a solid candidate if you have any more questions e mail me Paralegal Juris Doctor Law firm Lawyer Education in Portugal Certification John Edwards Corporation Master of Laws Harriet Miers Education in Australia IB Diploma Programme Regent University City and Guilds of London Institute No Child Left Behind Act Classified information A-level Physician Public relations National Certificate of Educational Achievement Master's degree Accountancy Management Architect Motion picture rating system Nuclear option (filibuster) Software engineering Graduate school Education in Germany Identity theft Education in France Paramilitary Practice of law Coercive monopoly Security (finance) Federalist Society McKinsey & Company Autism rights movement Apprenticeship Professor General Certificate of Education College UCAS University of Hawaii at Manoa Class action American Baptist Association College admissions Copyright law of the United Kingdom Corporate governance James Hahn Referendum Doctor of Philosophy Kentucky Colonels Law School Admissions Test Attorney at Law Washington University in St. Louis Junior Certificate Autism Bumiputra Education in Hong Kong Librarian Biodiversity Education in Canada Legal aspects of transsexualism Hypnosis Politics of Hong Kong Same-sex marriage Organic certification SCO v.
