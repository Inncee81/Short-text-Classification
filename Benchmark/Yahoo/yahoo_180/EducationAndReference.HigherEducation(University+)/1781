i hate math but need to take a math logic class to graduate should i take this class i hate math so much i took algebra and had to really study and struggle to get a my overall gpa right now is so its not a matter of being a bad student its just that i suck at math i graduate in december with my bachelors degree but have to take a math or logic class to fulfill all requirements does this class look like it would be worse than algebra math linear programming elementary functions description systems of equations matrices and linear programming simplex method rational exponential and logarithmic functions would you recommend taking intro to logic instead oh i got a in statistics as well i guess i'll probably take the logic class i worked harder in the algebra and stats classes than i've ever had to work in my other classes not that i don't want to work but this is my last semester of college ans i want to enjoy it thanks for the suggestions yeah math looks harder than college algebra i'd take into to logic if i were you i took a logic course in college and we had a group project as a final grade our group had to logically prove something in front of the class well all these groups got up and tried to prove that abortion was wrong or that taxes are bad or there is no such thing as aliens and crap like that well it doesn't matter what you think you can't logically prove those things so our group got up and had poster boards this was pre powerpoint mind you bob is a goldfish goldfish are freshwater fish freshwater fish will die if placed into the ocean for extended periods of time bob will die if placed in the ocean for extended periods of time the end got a and let me tell you the other groups were pissed at us but it was a logical proof and that is all the teacher wanted linear programming and elementary functions is going to be a lot harder than proving bob would die if placed in the ocean Mathematics Education in Romania Grade (education) Logic Linear algebra Complex number Polynomial Education in the United States Orthogonal matrix Exponentiation Complexity classes P and NP SAT M__bius transformation Education in Germany Ordinary differential equation Education in Taiwan Graduate school Exponential function Philosophy of mathematics Field (mathematics) Algebraic geometry Adjoint functors Dynamical system Number theory Scientific method Algebra Elementary algebra Medical school Lebesgue integration Matrix (mathematics) Josip Plemelj Linear regression Computer algebra system Numerical analysis Hyperreal number Fibonacci number Matrix exponential Sheaf (mathematics) Arthur Cayley Quaternion Augustus De Morgan Simplex algorithm Clifford algebra Juris Doctor Irrational number Polynomial interpolation Real number Reverse mathematics Halting problem Axiom Causality Timeline of mathematics Hermann Weyl Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Normal distribution Stuyvesant High School Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy George Boole Physics Tensor Newton's method Quantum mechanics Square root Law school Trigonometric function Areas of mathematics Theodore Kaczynski Master's degree Basis (linear algebra) Aberration in optical systems Lie group Extreme Programming Mathematics of general relativity Quantum logic Linear programming Digital circuit Lie algebra William Rowan Hamilton Lorentz group Intelligent design Group representation Determinant Geometry Mathematical logic Where Mathematics Comes From Combinatorial species Newton's identities Calculus Group (mathematics) Aristotle Chiropractic Optimization (mathematics) Laws of Form Logarithm Bertrand Russell Philosophy of language Group theory
