help i am in big trouble what should i do i am going to a uc college university of california and tuition is approx k a year and i'm still jobless i have applied to many places and seem to be very unlucky i have to pay off tuition all on my own my parents are not paying a cent of it i will be going into my freshman year so is it advisable for me to work on campus my freshman year if not what should i do any suggestions would be greatly appreciated i did not qualify for any financial aid and i was not rewarded and grants or scholarships if you didn't get financial aid your parents make too much money but won't help you pay for school right the best way to pay off that amount of money is to apply for a private loan which is not based on need so it shouldn't matter how much your parents make working on campus is good because you can work in between classes before or after classes so you won't have to worry about driving around town however i think you still need to apply for the loans because if you are going to be going to school full time and it's your first semester you might find it a bit difficult to get used to juggling school and work at the same time i suggest getting a loan first then working part time to have cash in your wallet once you get used to college life and work then you can get more hours or a different job Student loan Education in the United States Tuition Graduate school Education in the People's Republic of China Princeton University Scholarship Brown University Unemployment Franklin W.
