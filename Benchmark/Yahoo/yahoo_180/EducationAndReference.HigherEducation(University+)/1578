anyone an art major i'm one i was just wondering if anyone has any advice for my first year realize that you will spend alot of time working outside of class so get yourself into a routine early put your name on your art supplies i don't think theft is as much a problem as borrowing and if you've put your name on rulers and equipment it'll help keep them in your hands do reading and research outside of class if the professor names a couple artists or shows examples of their works go look them up to know a little more about them it'll pay off and you'll find artists who will become inspirations to you keep up on your general academics too many art programs are competitive and even if you do well in art classes if you don't do well in art history or you blow off general studies it may prevent you from getting a bfa degree when students minimize the importance of their non art classes my response is to say what is your artwork about how will you gain new ideas and insights for the content of your work how do your ideas fit into a larger view of the art world and the wide world beyond remember you have to feed your brain as well as your passion for any artistic media good luck Art Graduate school Education in the United States Copyleft Emerson College Aikido Education Tai Chi Chuan Mixed martial arts Trinity College, Dublin Microeconomics Keynesian economics Max Weber Master's degree Censorship in Australia Public domain Massachusetts Institute of Technology Electronic Arts Second language acquisition Education in Japan Objective-C Software engineering Professor Plagiarism Martial art Kitsch Otterbein College Computer Economics Plato GED Henri Poincar__ Johns Hopkins University Niels Lauritz H__yen Education in the People's Republic of China A Course In Miracles Second Battle of the Atlantic Education in Portugal Capital accumulation American University Education in Australia Copyright Noam Chomsky Open access The Wonderful Wizard of Oz Homeschooling Asperger syndrome Democracy Education in Germany Postmodernism California Institute of the Arts Labor theory of value Degrees of Oxford University Bernard Williams Washington University in St. Louis Economy of Africa Lisp programming language Tarot CPU design Coercion Past teachings of Prem Rawat Sociology Librarian Logic Princeton University Savannah College of Art and Design Photography Welding Dream Mathematics Esperanto as an international language Jean-Jacques Rousseau Object-oriented programming Inflation Transformer University of Michigan Academic art Ishmael (novel) BBC ASCII art C.
