what steps would help me get my sorority recognized by the college i'm party of a city wide capter of a sorority the college i attend has so far refused to recognize my sorority on campus our tenents include scholarship and service and our sisters are stellar students and very active in the community both on and off campus still the college refuses to recognize us and this causes lots of problems when we want to hold community service events advertise or even hold meetings we have had meetings with the director of greek affairs at school and even though we are not looking for a house or funding just recognition and a place on the website is all we still haven't gotten far i need some suggestions to catch the attention of the administration and finally get the recognition we deserve thanks for the incredibly useless answers if you read the question you'd have seen i was looking for ideas that would help us get recognized the college doesn't want to add more greeks yet and we need to continue showing that were here interested and not going anywhere thanks also for noting that we can't force them to recognize us because i was sure until then i had control over free will maybe you could try doing joint events with greek organizations that are already recognized on campus if the university sees that you're accepted within the greek community they might be more willing to change their opinion you could also ask the other greek chapters to sign a petition you could try involving faculty in some of your events host easter egg hunts or halloween parties for faculty children also get a faculty advisor if you don't already have one the more people at the university you can convince you're legit the better chances you have i'm not sure the university can stop you from forming a community service organization even if they do say no to greek organizations you may even want to try establishing yourselves as this instead at least then you might not have problems with holding events another option is to go to the npc and see if they're interested in colonizing a national organization at your university it might just be that your university doesn't want local organizations Fraternities and sororities University of Alabama Cornell University University of Michigan Education in the United States Delta Tau Delta Alpha Phi The George Washington University Rice University University of Arizona Brown University Franklin W.
