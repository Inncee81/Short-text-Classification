im in high school now private school th grade and i want to be a surgeon heart transplant please tell me please tell me what to do in high school and what to do after high school so it can all be easy on me during college im thinking of going to csun california northridge for my masters and usc southern california for my medical stuff so please help me and tell me how many years it will take to be this thanks so much oh yeah i go to a private school im in th grade and im graduating next year so when i go to a public high school i'll be in th and my high school that im going to next year is a medical magnet wil that help me with anything or does magnet not really do anything for my college stuff thanksss soooo much ohh yeah i forgot my bachelors ya how many years is that too and i just dont get what the residency is can you guys help me on that thanks again well what i would do if i was you is do good in high school get a good gpa and sat score i would definitely also try to volunteer at a hospital maybe times a week afterschool just to get an idea then when you're done from high school go to any good year university csun is a good one and major in anything you want biology is good but the problem with biology is that everyone that wants to go to med school majors in that my good advice for you is to major in something lets say nursing because you will be taking courses like biology chemistry anatomy physiology etc that will be pre requisites for medical school anyway the reason why i am telling you to do nursing is because to get into medical school is very and i repeat very competitive and lets say that if you don't make it the first year after graduating from csun i don't know if csun has a nursing program at least you can fall back into finding a nursing job for a year and getting the experience then you can reapply again to medical school at the same time look at other prerequisites to get into medical school that nursing does not need u to take i know physics is a prerequisite and nursing students don't need to take that this is only if you do decide to do nursing if you decide biology then physics is already a course to get the degree medical school also love it if you volunteer in anything for a good cause have some medical experience etc for medical experience whether you're a biology or nursing major i would try to get a pharmacy tech license while you're at csun or when you're a senior in high school and find a job at maybe cvs or any pharmacy and gain working experience throughout your years at csun i had a friend who got her pharm tech license when she graduated from high school and worked at cvs for four years in college oh and you don't need to get a masters to get into med school after a bachelors degree you can jump straight to med school and after you graduate from medical school lets say usc you have to do residency and that you will learn later it doesn't matter what high school you go to as long as you enjoy your experience there and get good grades good luck Education in the United States Medical school Doctorate Physician Chinese University of Hong Kong Graduate school Medicine Education in
