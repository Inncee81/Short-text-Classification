torn between two programs advice please i want to get into genetics but i can't decide between a genetics bsc at a huge university and then master's etc or a double degree program of biochem chemical engineering at a smaller university if i go for the first then i get a jump start but if i do the second i have a solid background and a backup plan i can't choose though can anyone help i recommend the first option because a masters degree will make you more marketable and earn you a higher salary both of these options are in high demand and the career outlook looks very promising but if it were my decision i would choose to earn the highest degree possible before working in the field best wishes Graduate school Lawyer Academic degree Chinese University of Hong Kong Education in the United States Education in Portugal College admissions Dog agility Professor Education in Australia Linus Pauling Nurse Biochemistry Software engineering Mutual fund Oregon State University City and Guilds of London Institute Francis Crick Architect Tianjin University Juris Doctor Stevens Institute of Technology Space Shuttle program Washington University in St. Louis Student loan Degrees of Oxford University Associate's degree Civil engineering University of Texas at San Antonio Education in Germany Academia Bachelor of Arts National Football League Electrical engineering Bologna process University of Bristol Windows Vista College School counselor University of California, Berkeley Education in Finland British degree abbreviations Master of Business Administration Michael Griffin Economic inequality Redundant array of independent disks Microeconomics Baseball Education in Japan Cancer Education in Sweden Master of Laws Gramophone record Columbia University Pennsylvania State University Education in Austria Education in Hong Kong University of Sheffield Satchel Paige Education in Taiwan Olympic Stadium, Berlin Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Cooperative education Sammy Sosa The Dalek Invasion of Earth Medical school 401(k) Labour economics Diving Atari 8-bit family Social Security (United States) Norman Borlaug Governor-General of Australia Publicly funded medicine Master of Engineering Florida Institute of Technology Ford Thunderbird Hydrogen economy Hearts (game) Bicycle lighting Offices in Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth Durham University Physical therapy Stud poker Myopia Toyota Prius Social Security debate (United States) Taikyoku shogi High school Higher education in Japan Doctorate University of Washington Management information system University of North Carolina at Charlotte Houston Nutt RISC Royal Institute of Technology William Stephenson Progressive tax
