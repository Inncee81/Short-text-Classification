i made a huge mistake and i'm really worried i was so stupid and i actually ditched school and i unfortunately got caught i recieved straight days of detention and my counselor said that all of what i just did will end up on my permanent record will that badly hurt my chance in getting into a decent college if so how can i try to make it up a decent college no it will go on your record but goodness you're only in high school scare tactic should you be ditching school no but in order to get into a decent college you must go to school in order to make it happen if you do this a lot yeah the colleges will see that you don't want to be in class why would they admit you if it happens only once i can't see any reason why it would harm you to make it up all you need to do is show some committment do some extra volunteer work i am not sure why but colleges love that considering they so readily churn out folks who would rather die than volunteer but that's a different conversation you're on the right track and you're remorseful for what you've done unless you're only worried about admissions to college don't worry too much and try to hang in there during whatever horrible classes are chasing you off take good care and good luck with admissions sense Social rule College admissions Jon Secada Capital punishment Little Britain Pitaten The Fairly OddParents Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Saved by the Bell Ra (board game) The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie True Crime: Streets of LA Grade (education) Hiberno-English Scouting The Adventures of Pete & Pete Singlish Education in the United States 1957 World Series SAT Philosophical skepticism Time Out of Mind EastEnders Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Kyle Broflovski Fast bowling Mississippi John Hurt Brian Close Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 She Loves You John Peel Characters in the Smurfs Team Fortress Classic Transactional analysis Community college New York Giants Theory of conduct Luck Involuntary commitment Numerus clausus Norway national football team Pittsburgh Steelers Harvard University Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 The Catcher in the Rye Shaggy dog story Good Morning, Vietnam Kodocha Characters of Naruto Tai Chi Chuan Dad's Army Dead Like Me University of Southern California A Milhouse Divided Diving American football Billboard Hot 100 Chess strategy and tactics Unlawful combatant Midori's Days Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) The Lovely Bones Donovan Battle of Jutland Humphrey Bogart Cliff Richard Can't Hardly Wait Poker jargon Joseph McCarthy Education in the People's Republic of China Honey and Clover Futurama (TV series - season 3) Regents of the University of California v.
