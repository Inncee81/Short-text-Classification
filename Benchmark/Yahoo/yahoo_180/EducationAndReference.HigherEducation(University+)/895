for pursuing mba does really accreditation to college required i have joined in engineering college which have got accreditation to my branch till but will be my final year if suppose the college didnt renew its accreditation till does it affect my higher studies do really accreditation required from the way you worded your question i think you may have a misconception about what accreditation is it is not a license which can be renewed by a school by paying a fee for example accreditation is a process of evaluation of the university done by an outside organization of the quality of the college so the college doesn't renew its accreditation the outside organization does this if the accreditation isn't renewed it means that the college was judged inadequate that could be harmful to you as you try to move on to graduate school Education in the United States Master of Business Administration Architect School accreditation Athabasca University Law school Associate's degree Saint Joseph's University Franklin W.
