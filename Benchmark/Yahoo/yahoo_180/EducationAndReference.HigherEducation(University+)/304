i really want to go into diagnosis what universities do you recomend right now i'm in highschool and have excellent marks i'm in biology honors so i think i'll have alot of options for university god knows i've been working hard i want to save lives and i found diagnosis facinating to me what universities do you recommend as in diagnosis of diseases in poeple sorry if i was unclear i believe i would officially be called an internalist i guess you want to go to medical school and become an md then well i cannot go off and recommend a bunch of universities for your undergraduate education when i know so little about your situation like what state you are from what your finances are like which is very important for private schools so here's what i will say go to a four year university that has a reasonably good reputation or at least some respect you don't want to go to a school that is so easy that it will be considered a joke you may not even be admitted to medical school if you have a gpa if you go to such a university however don't go to a university that is so hard that you think you won't be able to at least get a gpa a college gpa would be preferable as that is the average gpa of people who are accepted to medical school even if you are trying your hardest you have virtually no chance of being accepted to medical school if you get lower than a in the mean time i will advise you to take honors chemistry honors physics and college level biology or chemistry whether you take the course dual enrollment ap or ib while you are in high school you should also at least take enough high school math that you will be comfortable taking calculus when you get to college and preferably you should take calculus in high school if you can make sure your english skills are strong too so you will want to take the most advanced courses that you can in english Grade (education) Medical school College admissions Education in Romania Advanced Placement Program Graduate school Physician Stuyvesant High School Chiropractic Education in the United States Education in Hong Kong Education in Portugal Education in the People's Republic of China SAT Cornell University Education in Germany University of Connecticut Chinese University of Hong Kong Education in Taiwan Education in Australia Belmont Abbey College University of Central Florida Stevens Institute of Technology Education in Singapore Johns Hopkins University Prostate cancer Troy High School Secondary education in the United States Middle Tennessee State University Law school Juris Doctor Vanderbilt University National Certificate of Educational Achievement GED Florida State University Affirmative action Dublin City University Oregon State University University of Queensland Stern School of Business Medicine Pennsylvania State University American University California Polytechnic State University Dentistry Columbia University University of Pennsylvania A-level Redundant array of independent disks York University Test (student assessment) Calculus University of Maryland Baltimore County Clements High School University of California, Riverside University of California, San Diego Georgetown University Hypertension Stanford University University of Alabama Gymnasium (Denmark) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma University of Rochester College Brown University Ivy League Physics University of Virginia Paralegal University of Maryland, College Park Hopkins School New Trier High School Jaime Escalante Furman University University of Szeged University of California, Santa Barbara Australian National University Hunter College High School University of York Massachusetts Institute of Technology University of Chicago Osteopathy North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics NUS High School of Mathematics and Science Turkish education system King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals Johns Hopkins Hospital Secondary education Harvard University Numerus clausus University of Coimbra Kwantlen University College Far Eastern University Student loan Virginia Commonwealth University
