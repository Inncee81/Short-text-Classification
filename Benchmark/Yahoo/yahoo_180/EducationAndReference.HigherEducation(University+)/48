for a career in dentistry which school is better usc or ucla i am having a really hard time deciding which school i want to apply to in order to pursue a career in dentistry i know that they are both great schools and that one school is public ucla and one school is private usc other than that i can't really figure out what i need to be looking for in order to decide which one is better for me any adivce ucla and usc are ranked equally i don't believe usc has a bachelor dds program where you're guaranteed a spot in the dental school so it mainly boils down to cost since they're basically equal in prestige University of Southern California University of California, Los Angeles Bowl Championship Series Dentistry Temple University Education in Portugal Education in Australia Education in the United States USC Trojans Football University of Indonesia United States Code Education in Germany Film school Ivy League Sam Barry Tulane University Baylor College of Dentistry Publicly funded medicine Affirmative action The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio Juris Doctor University of Connecticut Tim Floyd Unlawful combatant Health care in Canada University of California, San Diego Equal Protection Clause University of Michigan Master's degree Education in Malaysia Virginia Commonwealth University Marshall School of Business Legal research Graduate school University of Toronto Divorce Texas Longhorn Athletics Stanford University School of Medicine Columbia University Pepperdine University Doctorate University of Washington Student loan Education in Taiwan Education in the People's Republic of China Brentwood, Los Angeles, California Pacific Ten Conference University of Rochester Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus College admissions National Health Service Education in Hong Kong USC School of Cinema-Television University of Notre Dame Numerus clausus Cheryl Miller Public domain Work of the United States Government University of South Carolina Upstate University of California, Riverside Law school Microeconomics British degree abbreviations Mack Brown Education in Canada Seton Hall University State university Laura Schlessinger Naismith College Player of the Year Dental fillings University of Detroit Mercy Case Western Reserve University Privatization Conscription Oral and maxillofacial surgery Anna Lee Fisher University of Alabama at Birmingham Tooth enamel Education in Japan Autism epidemic Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Public policy Dental brace Crespi Carmelite High School Plame affair Dynamic programming New York University College of Dentistry Education in Finland Washington University in St. Louis Boston University Separation of church and state Fudan University University of Houston UCLA School of Theater Film and Television Lawyer Public education Karl Dorrell Orthodontics NCAA Basketball Tournament Most Outstanding Player University of Louisville
