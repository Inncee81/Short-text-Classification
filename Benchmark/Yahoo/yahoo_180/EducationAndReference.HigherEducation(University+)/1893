biochemistry is this a good undergrad to take if i want to apply to med school does it cover all that i will need to know for the mcat should i just do a honours specialization in biochemistry program or should i major in it and minor in something else thanks daniel biochem you dont take your senoir year you major in it dont know what the person about me was thinking biochem would be a good one because you do need to take a lot of genetics bio classes no eovlution ecology ones also you take a lot of chem organic so the mlcs youd be studying ar the ones in your body also youd take a physics and a math course so that is always good so i think biochem would be fine also it may stick out from a bio major idk just guessing you also may wish to major in bio and minor in chem or vise versa or if you are really up for it double major but biochem should be fine Biochemistry Biology Medicine Genetics Chinese University of Hong Kong Protein University of Connecticut Botany Medical school Omega-3 fatty acid Life Allan Wilson Splicing (genetics) Linus Pauling Education in the United States Ecology Education in Romania Artificial life James D.
