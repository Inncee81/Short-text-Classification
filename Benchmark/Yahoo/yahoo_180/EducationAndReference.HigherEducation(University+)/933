do i have a chance of getting into any philosophy grad school i have a on the gre gpa and what i deem to be a very good analytical essay however the school i am currently attending has an unknown philosophy reputation and overall weak academic reputation what do you think my chances are getting into any philosophy grad program with funding it's really impossible to say i cannot say anything about your gres since your analytic writing score is quite important and you did not provide the percentile rankings of your quant and verbal scores scores in the low s in each section are often fine but not outstanding enough to put you in the running for assistantships or fellowships you must select programs wisely keeping in mind that fit is the critical factor that is to say if you wish to focus on kantian epistemology then be sure to apply only to departments with at least one kant scholar and at least one specialist in epistemology i also advise you to make sure you have documented reading ability in either french or german before you apply to any graduate programs most programs these days are extremely competitive and applicants with no research languages often do not make the cut it might also be wise to apply to one or two terminal masters programs these usually serve as feeders to phd programs so great work at and great recommendations from faculty in these programs will enhance your applications a great deal finally and most directly in answer to your question your undergraduate program's reputation can enhance but will not usually damage your applications superb letters from your professors a terrific writing sample and a literate and focused statement of purpose that shows facility with method and theory in your subfield are the factors that will make or break your application i wish you every success Philosophy Graduate Record Examination SAT Immanuel Kant Objectivist philosophy Epistemology GED Bertrand Russell College admissions Education in the United States Psychology Intelligence quotient Law School Admissions Test Logic College and university rankings Franz Boas Martin Heidegger Master's degree Critical theory Karl Popper University of Michigan Education in the People's Republic of China John Rawls Intelligent design movement Neuro-linguistic programming Doctor of Philosophy Western philosophy Ethics Chinese University of Hong Kong University of Central Florida Grade (education) Philosophy of science Analytic philosophy Bernard Williams Second language acquisition Aristotle Theory of conduct University of Toronto Education in Portugal University of Bristol Physician Race and intelligence Cornell University Philosophy of language Juris Doctor Philosophy of space and time Critique of Pure Reason Literature Michel Foucault Extreme Programming Stanford University Princeton University Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel D.
