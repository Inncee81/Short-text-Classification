management studies im about to start uni and just wanted to know what kind of carers would be open to me with a management studies degree this answer will probably sound to general but the nice thing about a management degree is that it is so open practically any organization out there can accept it anything from financial institutions to health institutions to insurances to educational departments to credit organizations and so on will all gladly accept your degree as a way to enter their workforce whatever your heart is set on your management degree will allow you to be looked at by any organization that caters to it that generality can be somewhat of a con as well a management degree is so general that sometimes it becomes difficult to try and make yourself stand out if you choose an employer that caters to a specific trade several of my management professors have rightfully said to pick a strong minor as a backup so that any future employer can see proof that you have special interests in whatever your minor happens to be hope this info helps i currently am a double major in finance and management and am primarily getting the management portion because it correlates so well with finances and is a good thing to knock out for future advancement positions my current career in banking perfectly encompasses both aspects of these degrees too Education in Portugal Education in the United States Psychology College Software engineering Sexual orientation Capitalism Education in the People's Republic of China University of Maryland Baltimore County Monetary policy GED Citigroup Economic inequality Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Finance Social Security (United States) Insurance Economics Chinese University of Hong Kong Arturo Frondizi Commodity markets Social work Education in Germany Lawyer Toronto-Dominion Bank Health insurance Paralegal Science Contract Wal-Mart Mediation Education Mutual fund Independent agencies of the United States government Life insurance Abortion debate Affirmative action Capital accumulation National Institutes of Health Simon Commission National Health Service World government Neville Chamberlain United Kingdom corporation tax University of Pennsylvania Law School Business A-level Risk management Education in Hong Kong Publicly funded medicine Microeconomics Primerica Financial Services Johns Hopkins University Nurse Economy of India John De Lorean Teach the Controversy Professor Trust (Law) USA Economy of the Republic of Ireland Intelligence quotient Master's degree A Course In Miracles Corporate finance Unemployment Credit union Inflation University of North Carolina at Charlotte Major League Baseball Bank Labor theory of value Liberal Democrats (UK) Institutional fund management Productive and unproductive labour Medicine Juris Doctor Accountancy Philosophy of business Alternative medicine Cooperative Bertie Ahern Education in Australia Actuary Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Student loan Scientology beliefs and practices Academia Gambling Bond Financial services Politics of Canada Poker jargon Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Cass Business School, London Community college Baseball Microsoft Theory of conduct CPU cache
