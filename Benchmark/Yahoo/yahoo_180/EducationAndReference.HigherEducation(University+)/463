university what are the most important things to consider when choosing also which do you think is better to choose something vocational or a subject that you're particularly interested in but isn't vocational i guess you may have to first ask yourself who you want to be before you start thinking where you should go for example if you are thinking of becoming an engineer you should then look at school that is good in engineering next you should see how much it cost you to go to school there if you can get scholarship or if not can you pay out of your own pocket then its geographical location big or small city and if you will like to stay in that city as you will be there for a few years so you see that you narrow down your choices to a handful after you consider all that apply to about of them if you can some slightly above your standard some of your standard and some slightly below your standard the strategy is that if you try the good school and let's say you make it you will definitely be happy to go if not there is some schools that you know are about your standard and you should have no problem getting admission if you are not so lucky in all your applications there are still a couple of those universities that you feel that is slightly below your standard and even on the worst day they will still offer you a place try all the options and then evaluate them before you commit to anyone make wise choice good luck i wish you well Education in Portugal Education in Germany Education in the United States Economics Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Romania College admissions Poker jargon Goodness and value theory Education in Australia Microeconomics GED Education in Hong Kong A-level Graduate school Education in England Ra (board game) UCAS Social rule Theory of conduct Prisoner's dilemma Decision making Grade (education) City and Guilds of London Institute California Polytechnic State University 2000 Australian Grand Prix Higher Technical Examination Programme (HTX) Higher Commercial Examination Programme Education in Taiwan Education in Sweden Software engineering Institute of technology Education in Malaysia Life insurance Bilkent University Leaving Certificate Winning Streak High school Ethics Heinkel He 100 Health insurance Laserdisc ELO rating system Expert system Pitaten Science Philosophical skepticism Student loan Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Theodicy National Certificate of Educational Achievement Charles William Eliot Supply and demand Gross domestic product Higher education in Japan Extreme Programming Cooperative education SAT Corporate governance Education IB Diploma Programme Homeschooling Principal-agent problem Luck Backgammon Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Economic anthropology Current teachings of Prem Rawat Betting (poker) Galactic Civilizations Gliding Numerus clausus The Amazing Race Craps Physician Peer review Quicksort Divorce University of Michigan Pai gow poker Normal distribution Game theory Public policy Risk management Knife Philosophy No Child Left Behind Act Law school Danish Folkeskole Education Socrates Bicycle lighting S__ren Kierkegaard Standardized testing The Price Is Right Economic inequality Education in Japan Conscription Intelligent design movement Search engine optimization
