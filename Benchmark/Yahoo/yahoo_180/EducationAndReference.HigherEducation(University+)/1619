what is university life like i'm curious to know i'm a fairly hard working student and do well in school i'm just in high school and already i'm swamped with so much homework that i usually only have the weekends available to rest or socialize is university any different is there tons of homework involved do you have time to just take it easy hard tests to study for etc i think that it depends on what country you study in and what you major in it also depends on your expectations goals and part time work i have studied in both canada and the us in civil engineering it has been my opinion that in canadian universities there are less weekly assignments however in order to pass your classes you will be required to do more independant studying and reading ie reading without being told by the prof that you have to in the us i have seen that there are alot more weekly assignments all considered there will be the same amount of time dedicated to school work i study civil engineering at a canadian university i take a full course load and i work at a part time job aside from class work about to hours a week to be honest i don't at all have the same amount of time to hang out as i did in high school high school was a breeze but i suggest that the best way to adapt to the new environment is to hit the ground running stay up to date with all assignments the first week or so will be a period of adjustment from my experience by the end of the first week you will be already well into the subject matter of your classes soon you will realize how easy you had it in high school and you will be proud of your new accomplishments in university life if i can suceed you can too engineering is also a pretty heavy subject though anything else and you should be just fine GED Graduate school Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Romania Professor Daylight saving time Mutual fund Grade (education) Education in Taiwan Extreme Programming Homework Hogwarts 2000 Australian Grand Prix University of Massachusetts Amherst Canadian House of Commons Student loan Tai Chi Chuan Education in Japan Wind power SAT College Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Education in Germany Education in the United States Lawyer Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Australian constitutional law Marching band Heinkel He 112 Quizbowl Game programmer Anchor Spark plug Scientology beliefs and practices Master's degree Education American football Stevens Institute of Technology American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Carburetor Homeschooling Gliding Same-sex marriage in Canada Fixed-wing aircraft The Citadel (Military College) Test (student assessment) Asperger syndrome Science Explosive material Mach kernel Expert system Web crawler Aikido Anti-intellectualism University of Bristol Unemployment Billboard Hot 100 Massachusetts Institute of Technology Tank Gravity Annuity Juris Doctor Secondary education in Japan Electric motor IB Diploma Programme Second language acquisition Education in Portugal Prostate cancer Embedded system Pilot certification in the United States Affirmative action Fast bowling York University Parliament of Canada Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Architect Tianjin University Education in Australia Electrical engineering Hyperinflation Ben Johnson (athlete) Appeal Politics of Canada Georgetown University Driver's license Carnegie Mellon University Civil engineering Jet engine Electrophysiology Civil Marriage Act Charles William Eliot Unemployment benefit Plame affair Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Boston Public Kyoto Protocol Hunter College High School Bah__'__ Faith and Education Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix
