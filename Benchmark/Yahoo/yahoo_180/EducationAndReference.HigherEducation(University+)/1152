i want to go into a career in forensic science what college should i go to like i want to have to years in community college and then years of a different college harvard for example can someone tell me the best colleges to go to i found a website with some resources on becoming a forensic scientist see below some advice though as for going to harvard etc being a boston gal myself who currently works for a college and has had a few years in the working world some words of advice unless you get a really really good scholarship stay in community college no one actually cares where your degree is from just as long as you have one and i've worked for top law firms in boston that confirms it wish i knew that secret although i got some great scholarships i still have college loan debt my parents paid half i picked up the other half in loans and in a career like forensics you don't make much money at first so you won't make enough to off set what you paid for that pricey degree i don't think a lot of students take into account the long term financial responsibility of student loans and how greatly the debt impacts your future unless you're independently wealthy if you are in that case ignore what i said Student loan Education in the United States Ivy League Graduate school Deflation (economics) Bond Education in the People's Republic of China Monetary policy Debt Corporate finance Government debt College Interest Bentley College Corporation Education in Germany Boston College Bayesian inference Scholarship Financial markets University of Tennessee Bretton Woods system Students' union Brown University Bank Capitalism Tertiary education fees in Australia Mortgage Schabir Shaik Trial Financial aid Economy of the United States Annuity Economy of Africa Marshall Plan Great Depression York University Princeton University Finance College admissions Franklin W.
