how do i talk to a professor that i feel gave me an unfair final grade i did really well in the class but when i did my paper my professor thought i cheated which i didn't and gave me a failing grade for the class how do i confront them without loosing my cool well i'm also a professor so perhaps i can suggest an idea or two for you first do you still have the paper this is your best evidence if you've not already spoken to the professor go see him with the paper and ask him to explain his position understand that cheating is a huge issue these days and students are very good at it like never before and he probably has good reasons for his decision there are clues and ques that cheating has occurred and you may well be innocent but you need to investigate why he thought you cheated did you do a lot of cut n paste did you put proper citations in your paper and quotation marks wherever needed if not that's legally considered plagiarism and he had to fail you this isn't high school your actions are considered to be real intentional and knowledgeable that means we have to presume that you knew what you were doing next if you haven't convinced him otherwise you can go to the dean be tactful you'll need to make your case that he's mistaken and have some way to demonstrate this a dean will be open minded but they are as much an advocate for the professor as they are for you at the very least you need to give the dean a good reason to question the professor's decision ultimately nobody but the professor can alter your grade it's illegal for a dean or anyone else to tamper with student grades plan your argument and organize your evidence before you take any other steps be able to show if you can that there was clearly an error made in your case best of luck this may an uphill battle but remember that neither the prof or the dean is your enemy there was a reason he failed you you need to figure out why and challenge it as thoroughly and as tactfully as you can Theory of conduct Appeal Philosophy of language Teach the Controversy Plame affair Plagiarism Intelligent design movement Grade (education) Theodicy Abortion debate Intelligent design EastEnders Pitaten Estoppel Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Social rule Goodness and value theory Graduate school W.
