which disney park is your favorite and why what night show do you like best i love magic kingdom and epcot i used to not like epcot when i was little but i was crazy epcot is one of the best parks in my opinion not to mention the reflections of the earth show at night is absolutely stunning i love everything about epcot magic kingdom is also a blast i rode space mountain like times last time i went lol which park is your fav if we must choose then i say the best park is mgm but only due to the great movie ride the rock and rollercoaster and the tower of terror oh and the sci fi drive in and the freshly baked cookies at the nestle store but there is the magic kingdom with the world's greatest breakfast buffet at the crystal palace priority seating reservations a must and dog nuggets at casey's and hot fudge sundaes in freshly baked waffle cone bowls right across the street when the dough of the waffle is still warm and soft and pirates and the haunted mansion and the worlds best build your own burger at pecos bills the mushrooms are so good you'll be tempted to take your empty burger tray and go get some after the burger is gone of course there is always epcot with the short but recharging nap on spaceship earth after a long day of walking the parks and dinner at alfredo's outside in december when the balmy florida weather becomes cool enough to enjoy sitting outside and you can sip the homemade honey mead while enjoying some of the worlds finest calamari and then the noodles my god and of course there are those extra special days when you grab a scuba tank and hop into the living seas and descend feet through the crystal clear water and you get to be part of the show by swimming into view of folks eating supper at the coral reef restaurant of course you can make faces at the kids up by the walkway glass too so i guess my answer is every park is my favorite being at disney is like being home i know every inch of the place yet everytime i go i see some detail i missed the thousand times before Epcot Walt Disney World Resort Magic Kingdom Disney's California Adventure Cuisine of Denmark Breakfast Walt Disney Orlando, Florida Ice cream Happiest Homecoming on Earth McDonald's DisneySpeak Disney-MGM Studios Japanese cuisine Hamburger Disneyland Walt Disney Parks and Resorts Pizza Thorpe Park Futurama (TV series - season 5) The Haunted Mansion Innoventions Walt Disney World Railroad Tea Tourism in Hawaii Vegetarian cuisine Fast-food restaurant Audio-Animatronics Japanese tea ceremony Burger King Coral Tomorrowland Disney's Polynesian Resort Tom and Jerry (MGM) German cuisine Solar power The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Cha chaan teng RuneScape quests Bread Pancake Bocas del Toro Province World's Fair Shaggy dog story Horizons (Epcot attraction) Dead Like Me Coachella Valley MRE Great Barrier Reef Popeye Street food Jewish cuisine Walt Disney World College Program Termina Knoebels The Walt Disney Company Chocolate Cookie Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Maple syrup The Time Machine Saimin Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Six Flags Over Texas Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle SpongeBob SquarePants Climate of the United Kingdom Mickey Mouse Invader Zim FoxTrot Cuisine of the Philippines Brewery World Series Dim sum Comanche Opportunity rover Celebration, Florida Universal Orlando Resort London Carbon dioxide IllumiNations: Reflections of Earth Places in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Timeline of alternative rock Carlsbad Caverns National Park Impact crater Yosemite National Park Fishing Coral reef The Muppets at Walt Disney World The Amber Spyglass Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Anchorage, Alaska Delicatessen
