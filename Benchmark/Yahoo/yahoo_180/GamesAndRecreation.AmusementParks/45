i am terrified of rollercoasters i hate being afraid because all of my friends love them i decided that i should try to face my fear head on so i went on the sooper dooper looper in hershey park i hated the feeling in your stomach when you are going down the drops for some reason i just freak out when that happenes what should i do i am not really afraid of heights i just hate the feeling of falling there's nothing wrong with not liking that feeling if you are going on a roller coaster or other amusement park ride at a reputable theme park six flags cedar fair disney etc know that you are safe if you follow the operator's instructions stay in the vehicle etc if you want to build your 'tolerance' for that feeling start going on smaller coasters first until they don't bother you and then go on the larger ones i tend to follow the track with my eyes so i know where i'm going it's becomes a safety net for me when i'm scared but i don't go on a lot of the extreme coasters it's not my thing good luck and have fun Roller coaster Hersheypark Cedar Point RollerCoaster Tycoon Launched roller coaster Space Mountain Wooden roller coaster Six Flags Magic Mountain Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Six Flags Over Texas Kennywood Disney's California Adventure FoxTrot Millennium Force Dorney Park Alton Towers Amusement ride The Smoking Room Knoebels Disney's Animal Kingdom Six Flags Shaggy dog story Bolliger and Mabillard Valleyfair!
