does anyone know which swimming pool pump has the best value for the money for both pool and spa i had a pool built just years ago my spa is not generating any bubbles or jets as it was the first year it has a hayward pump to filter both pool and spa this was highly recommended by the builder but now my pool cleaner guy cleans the filter every week so the spa can get some pressure he says that he wouldn't have bought a hayward pump also said he would have another pump for the spa i don't know anything about pools and want to learn so i don't have to second guess everyone in the pool business i don't have money to burn like some friends of mine that just keeps paying a pool guy to fix everything for them i would like to do it myself and save my money any comments or suggestions are welcomed thank you in advance it sounds like your pool guy might be a dealer for sta rite and not hayward haywards are an ok make and i'm actually quite fond of them particularly the super pump series with the squarish wet end if you had no issues the first year the pump won't be at fault unless the impeller is bunged up with debris which can happen i'd be looking at a few other things first as the culprit it sounds as though your system is made up of two valves that you turn over to spa when you're planning on using it and you have just the one pump this isn't uncommon for a smaller pool spa combination that over flows into the pool it's a cheaper alternative than having a separate spa booster which can add over bucks to the price of a new pool spa usually this sort of set up is quite adequate for a smaller spa with or less jets if you're using a hp or hp motor which in all likelyhood you are has your filter pressure changed since the first year has it gone up more when in spa mode it may indicate a blockage in one or more of the spa jets or a dirty filter you mention that everything works just fine after a filter cleaning so your filter is getting debris in it that's going to have an impact on the strength of the water from the jets and the amount of bubbles you see for the bubbles to show up you need water rushing through the jet's venturi at a good rate to draw air into the mix from the air line if it's not going fast enough it won't draw that air in well or even at all for that matter the master air line valve may be shut check it it's located on the top of your spa usually round in shape it needs to be open for air to get in if the jets are as strong as they were initially and you're just looking at one or more of them not producing the same bubbles i'd be checking the air line that feeds them they can get blocked up rather easily also some types of jet actually have an adjustment on their face that allows more or less air to come out the jet your's may be turned down or off not to mention the air venturi in them might be blocked not uncommon at all if you winterize your pool as these are removed when winterizing and need adjustment when you re install them as the re installation process for some types of jet actually uses the air control on the jet itself as the thing you turn to thread them into the spa wall essentially shutting the air off as you tighten it in your pool guy's idea of installing another pump booster pump in the spa lines can be done how difficult it'll be will depend on how smart the original contractor was in plumbing everything up in the first place if he left a lot of room for the pump and it's associated plumbing then not a big issue installation wise as long as everything is in inch and not pipe it will cost you a chunk of change for the pump they're not cheap and if you have only jets a booster pump may actually be to much oomph for your spa you may not be able to sit down and stay put Glossary
