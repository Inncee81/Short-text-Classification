forced to swim hours a day is that reasonable i'm on a high school swim team so of course it's going to be intense seeing as i'm on varsity but really isn't it a bit ridiculous that we have to swim not just sitting around or running either like swimming very fast yards at a time for four hours in the morning and two plus one hour of dryland in the afternoon maybe it's just because i'm a bit out of shape and we're nearing the end of the first week but what do you think any swimmers' opinions or anyone else really is fine well im a competitive swimmer for a club team and of course its going to be intense yeah and i know what you mean about yards fast at a time it does get really hard at points but it will ease up my guess is that its the start of the season and your coach wants to get you in shape and ready for some big meets i dont think its too bad hours i mean it might be overwhelming at first but youll get used to it for my club team we had alot of big meets coming up and hard summer training so we practiced normall days a week but we practiced hours in the morning then in the afternoon including about an hour and half of dry lands mostly running and hard core stuff after a few weeks and some meets come closer than your coach will ease up a bit and then about weeks before a big meet he will probably taper you so dont stress out now i know what your going through and some practices will get to an extant of non stop pain where you just want to faint and i know how that feels when we did one of the hardest sets we have ever done and it was x s on on on and i broke down in the middle of the set i kept going but i was crying because the pain was at an extant to where i didnt think i could go any further but you just have to remember one thing during those hard practices dont ever give up and you will accomplish so much and achieve the best hope this helps good luck Swimming Diving New York Giants Texas Longhorn Athletics 2000 Australian Grand Prix Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Pittsburgh Steelers Fanny Blankers-Koen Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Tai Chi Chuan Operation Market Garden Bryan Robson Babe Ruth Backstroke Volleyball Super Bowl XXV Social rule USS Alden (DD-211) Butterfly stroke Fast bowling Toronto Blue Jays Kansas City Chiefs Extreme Programming Dog agility Jon Secada Frogman Sydney Riot of 1879 FC Rostov USS Yorktown (CV-10) Cleveland Browns USS Waters (DD-115) The Ashlee Simpson Show Norway national football team Medley swimming History of swimming Episodes of Lost (Season 1) American football San Francisco 49ers USS Tunny (SS-282) New England Patriots The Contender (television series) Super Bowl XXVII She Loves You St. Louis Rams Super Bowl XXI Equine conformation Scientology beliefs and practices The Chemical Brothers Sport USS Uhlmann (DD-687) Breaststroke Good Morning, Vietnam Super Bowl XXVI Shaggy dog story Battle of Tarawa National Football League Sandy Koufax Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina USS Wasp (CV-18) West Bromwich Albion F.C.
