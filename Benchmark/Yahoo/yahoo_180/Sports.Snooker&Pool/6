finally lost a game in indiana next stop california r ball clubs please so i finally lost a game on my us trip at nevada bobs in bloomington i was talked out of it possibly jet lag catching up with me i did come from ireland but hey i ain't crying i've won every other game i'm rolling into california soon so top clubs lay them on me the difference between a professional and a top amateur has a lot to do with being honest with themselves a good player will recognize when they are jet lagged and adjust their game accordingly they may play a more conservative game they may pass up on a shot that they might usually try and play a good safety instead the amateur player will use jet lag as an excuse for losing i'm not trying to lay into you but i don't want you to fall into that trap you're better than that incidentally when you say game do you mean match how many games do you play in a match or do you just add up the money at the end of the night to determine the winner i'm just wondering if you're doing this for money or to beat people let me know if you'll be in the wisconsin area anytime on your trip again best of luck m d bca instructor referee Rugby union Golf Football (soccer) Norway national football team Cincinnati Bengals Snooker World Series Billiards Tennis Jack Charlton The Football League American football Australian rules football Eight ball Poker jargon Paintball English cricket team History of Test cricket (to 1883) Ice hockey Hulk Hogan Super Bowl XXVII Winning Streak Bryan Robson Sydney Riot of 1879 Paul Morphy Cork City F.C.
