how can you spontaniously make guitar solos louis armstrong used to say that at least six hours of practice went into every spontaneous solo he ever played knowledge of major minor modal pentatonic chromatic and exotic scales helps quite a bit especially that lovely hungarian scale but the secret to a great solo is to find the alternate melody within the same chord structure some people can do this off the top of their heads but most of us have to work on it the process is simple but time consuming learn the song learn everything you can about it every nuance and every alternate melody line remove the chord progression from the melody i use a sideman band in a box or a similar program play the chord progression over and over while you play over it incorporate bits of the melody alternate melody bass line and even quotes from other songs within what you are doing notice that i did not say cram every note that you can into every measure until your fingers bleed make an alternate melody with spaces pacing a buildup a climax and a release just like any good movie just like any great joke memorize the best bits and string them together into a comprehensive solo write it down in a notebook if you can keep track of all the great bits repeat the process eventually you will learn that most chord progressions are very similar and that there are many one size fits all phrases that can be used in soloing you can't just use them all the time but interspaced between bits of genius they can get you through the night nicely you can also listen to the great soloists and borrow little bits from what they do this is called quoting and the more you do it the better you get if you tell people who you borrow from they will inevitably start comparing you to that musician it never hurts to get your name mentioned in the same breath as someone famous this is called borrowing someone's authority and it is legitimate and cool remember a plagiarist is a person who steals from one artist a genius is a person who steals from everybody mostly you play you set up a side man and play on your own you go through the solo part over and over again with your band until you get a sound that everyone agrees is complete genius and you keep track of everything that went right in a performance so you can do it again many lead guitarists record every performance they possibly can it isn't because they're vain it's because something might go right and they want to make sure they can do it again hope this helps Musical mode Harmonica Chord (music) Tonality Modal jazz Blues Guitar Bitches Brew Louis Armstrong Trance music The Velvet Underground Heavy metal music Blood on the Tracks Bluegrass music Guitar solo Native American music Bringing It All Back Home A Hard Day's Night (song) Music Music genre Violin Clarinet Pop punk Bass guitar Marching band Goldberg Variations Video game music Miles Davis The Beach Boys Folk music Yes Steely Dan Figured bass Umphrey's McGee Bee Gees Bon Jovi Timpani Charlie Parker Trey Anastasio Queen (band) Bebop The Beatles Sampling (music) Roxette Tablature The Who Please Please Me The Church Klezmer Hey Jude The Jam Jewish music Classical music era Metal music Genesis (band) She Loves You Nine Inch Nails ABBA Harp Romantic music Gothic rock Oasis (band) Rock (music) The Emancipation of Mimi RISC A Day in the Life Yesterday (song) Pet Sounds Sonata (music) Led Zeppelin Music of Ireland Nirvana (band) Tone cluster Paul McCartney Love and Theft CPU cache Hurdy gurdy Britpop Blink-182 Carnatic music Black Sabbath Bagpipes Time Out of Mind Serialism Elton John David Bowie Music theory Bob Dylan
