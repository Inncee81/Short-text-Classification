i'm so confused wrether i should be a singer dancer but mostly singer ex j lo chris brown usher micheal jackson or a dancer just plain dancer i've been on my grind since i was and i'm now but my parents dont' support me or bearly let get sing in gigs and things so i have to pick my fights well but i do proform thought and for dancing i can dance but i'm a way better singer than i am dancer because i've been singing since i was and i mean i can really acutally sing but dancing i've been doing since but never really took it seriously till now and i know that if i keep on drilling i can become great so it's sorta now or never and things like canadian idol or americain idol won't work because i'll have to become an americain citizen and canadain idol well you have to have parent supervison and my mom has to go to school and she won't sacrifice for me i really gotta and want to make it at least by i'm so confused i don't know what to do please help first even though it seems like it believe me you have a bit more time to get it all together before your carriage turns to pumpkin however your concerns are good ones to have dude i sounded like you at your age my thing was being a famous writer and outdoing my hero evel knievel of all things two very un forgiving dreams all in all my parents were cool with it but not supportive as far as money or education went not to get into my own story but there's a point for you every dollar i made at your age and after getting out of high school went for my dreams i hid it in coffee cans and stuff and managed to save ok i bought borrowed and begged all the things i needed to make a journey happen you know those corny movies like rocky your story in life is the same thing one dude all odds against his plans right you need to trust your inner thoughts become your own best friend on earth keep all your practices up and believe me one day not for ever but one day you wake up and you know you have arrived when they say that god loves a working man in my experience that is a fact for you little surprises will arise based on your own invisible efforts i swear from age until currently every hard day i spent in thankless effort was always met with thousands of cool opportunities that ultimately lead to my surreal life i've had so far i've seen half the world i probably made a million dollars i'm a published writer and i've broken world records and experienced some degrees of fame unfortunately my stunt end of the dreams cost me broken bones and last year a broken neck but that lead to my current business making films and i love it now if you can stay away from breaking legs you will enjoy your trip even more than i did to stop the pannacky feelings you have you need to be your own sensible word in your path to your dreams which means you need to establish your own plans of how you can work in between getting your craft down and how you can build up just enough power to make your own choices in art if you cut two lawns and hide that cash away you will be doubly rewarded in good luck toward your dreams i know what i'm talking about bro it works now make us all proud and i look forward to seeing you knocking us all dead in the entertainment world your frusterated because you have what it takes get it God Emperor of Dune Miss Saigon Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Jon Secada Evel Knievel Eric Cartman The Amazing Race The Amber Spyglass Jennifer Lopez A Course In Miracles The Emancipation of Mimi Garth Brooks The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Tina Turner Emotions (album) Billboard Hot 100 Sin City Episodes of Lost (Season 1) C__line Dion The Adventures of Pete & Pete Another Side of Bob Dylan Janet Jackson Faye Wong Bringing It All Back Home Spice Girls Journey (band) Knots Landing About a Boy Slow Train Coming Year of the Spider Luther Vandross Philosophical skepticism The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan W.
