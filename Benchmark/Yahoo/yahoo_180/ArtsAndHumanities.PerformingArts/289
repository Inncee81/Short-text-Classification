i would like to learn to play the guitar which is easier bass or an acoustic theres a difference between bass and a traditional string guitar if your really dedicated to it i would suggest you learn on acoustic once you start learning playing an electric will be much easier they are the same music wise except acoustic guitars have thicker strings and wider frets bass is a whole different subject bass is easier to learn how to play than guitar if you can play guitar you can play bass but it doesn't work the other way around Bass guitar Guitar Double bass Twelve string guitar Fret Bluegrass music Slide guitar Tablature Violin Mandolin Acoustic bass guitar String instrument Electric guitar Blood on the Tracks Clarinet Old-time music Michael Hedges Viola Lap steel guitar Musical ensemble Banjo Sitar Cello Electric violin Guitar pick Acoustic guitar Chapman Stick Classical guitar Dobro Harmonica George Crumb Pickup (music) John Myung Fender Blonde on Blonde Instrument amplifier Dixieland Seven-string guitar Electric Light Orchestra Jimi Hendrix Joy Division (band) Transposing instrument Phil Collins Lute Jethro Tull (band) Blues Billy Sheehan Fingerboard Harp Stanley Jordan Bringing It All Back Home Nu metal John Deacon Tapping Louis Andriessen Synthesizer Jaco Pastorius Never for Ever Rickenbacker Vibrato Pedal steel guitar Viol Rhythm guitar Chick Corea Spike (Elvis Costello album) Eddie Van Halen Pet Sounds Piano Focus (album) Marching band Time Out of Mind The Cure Ulver Drone (music) The Band Adam Jones Keller Williams Mario Davidovsky Trey Anastasio Arcturus (band) The Globe Sessions Buddy Guy Sea Change Back To Bedlam Rock band Authentic performance Mahavishnu Orchestra Grateful Dead Flute Randy Rhoads Electric upright bass James Jamerson C'mon C'mon Anton Webern Car Wheels on a Gravel Road Stevie Ray Vaughan Brian Jones (musician) One Wish: The Holiday Album Music of Ireland
