which of the following music instruments is easier than others to learn and play guitar bass guitar piano drum cello violin trumpet and saxophone listen them in order thank u i play litle bit of guitar and drum but since um just a beginner it gets really hard sometimes i love other music instruments listed above but just wondered whether they r hard than drum and guitar i am a saxophone player i came to it out of clarinet it is way easy to play and very satisfying i also fool around with cornet and piano i find piano challenges my dexterity it is important to know the piano a bit because the saxophone and trumpet family are constructed to mimic the piano they have the same anomaly at b c and e f i think knowing about basic patterns for finger drums is good learn clave to give yourself some freedom with time cow bell box and sticks are also useful to know maybe start with guaganco and mazacote as they provide the background for all kinds of rumba to be an adequate rumbero is an achievement in and of itself and to be able to sing coro really fun african saying if you can walk you can dance if you can talk you can sing learn to dance to play anything well you got to be able to dance and sing it is all just play have a good time if it feels like a chore switch activities there is nothing to gain by limiting yourself learn how they all work i like saxophone for its ease and the variety of sounds it makes i like it because the kind of women i like are drawn to saxophone players i have been playing years and i am still getting some nice attention i can recommend it to you Big band Transposing instrument Clarinet Double bass Saxophone Timpani Pet Sounds Music of Cuba Salsa music Sly & the Family Stone Violin Louis Andriessen Marching band Disco King Crimson Trumpet Blues Music of Nigeria Music of Ireland Concert band Bitches Brew Chick Corea Music genre Sonata (music) Jazz Authentic performance Bassoon Bass guitar Musical instrument classification Self Portrait Dixieland Mario Davidovsky Blonde on Blonde Steve Reich Musical ensemble Street-Legal Dave Douglas Philip Glass Cello Music of Brittany Anton Webern Harmonica Henry Cow Queen (band) Baritone saxophone Harmonic series (music) George Crumb Time Out of Mind The Lawrence Welk Show Guitar The Band Music history of the United States during the colonial era Quintet Piano Musical works of Mozart Songwriter Heavy metal music Bolero (Ravel) Soukous The Cure Louis Armstrong Music of Galicia, Cantabria and Asturias Timeline of trends in music (1950-1959) Heitor Villa-Lobos Tapestry (album) The Jam Klezmer Trombone Tablature Vibrato Herbie Hancock Miles Davis Charles Mingus Giacinto Scelsi Bee Gees The Beatles Music of Puerto Rico Journey (band) Brian Jones (musician) 2Step Ornette Coleman Van Halen Cornet The Who John Coltrane Blood on the Tracks James Brown (musician) Skeleton Crew (80s band) Rumba
