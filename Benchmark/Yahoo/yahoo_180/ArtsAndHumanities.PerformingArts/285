how do you write for banjo can they pick ths or just do chords what's the range for banjo is it hard to move fast as a pianist i'm not sure what would be too difficult for the average player a banjo can play anything that a guitar can and has i would recommend that you look at a program called tabledit powertab editor freeware or guitar pro i use four but i think that five and maybe six is out now they do a combination of notation and tablature most folk and bluegrass banjo players only read tablature although many ragtime and classical classical banjo players still read notation just fine remember that the banjo was the instrument of choice in pit bands before amplification equalized the volume level of the guitar with the other instruments the other thing you want to consider is the type of banjo you are writing for are you going to use a five string bluegrass style four string tenor banjo six string banjo tuned like a guitar or dobro banjolin tuned like a mandolin two courses of four strings g d a e same as the violin or banjolele tuned like a ukulele with a banjo head on it a banjo player can play single line melody chords fingerstyle or any combination of these styles the only limitation a banjo really has is imposed by the person playing it if you have any doubt check out bela fleck and the flecktones john mckuen from the nitty gritty dirt band check out the classical tunes he plays on banjo especially steve martin yes the comedian and jerry van dyke yes another comedian brother of dick van dyke and an excellent flailing banjo player flailing is playing chord melody while moving the plectrum pick back and forth in a tremolo style very rapidly hope this helps Mandolin Bluegrass music Harmonica Tablature Violin Music genre Double bass Music of Ireland Old-time music B__la Fleck Ukulele String instrument Blood on the Tracks Acoustic guitar Grateful Dead Trey Anastasio Lute Fingerpicking B__la Fleck and the Flecktones Jazz Slide guitar Steve Martin Music Tony Rice Ragtime American popular music Guqin Country music New Grass Revival Plectrum Dixieland Phish Floyd Rose Eddie Van Halen Vibrato Jazz guitar Classical music era Tremolo Music of the United States Romantic music Musical terminology Heavy metal music Grammy Awards of 2005 The Country Gentlemen Sitar Harp Clawhammer Pedal steel guitar Bouzouki Vibraphone Vassar Clements The Beatles Samples of music from the United States Authentic performance Piano Electronic organ Viol Lap steel guitar Hurdy gurdy Pet Sounds Jimi Hendrix Jerry Garcia Timpani Music of Hawaii Metal music Clarinet Emmylou Harris Cuatro Music of Arizona Trombone Cittern Charango Chord (music) Music theory Big band Django Reinhardt Cello Grammy Awards of 1990 Gary Rossington Balalaika Power chord Brian May O Brother, Where Art Thou?
