ideas for events for the drama club we do events like the drama musical children theater workshop skits for halloween for kids what did your drama club do that you thought was a really big success in addition to what you have listed my high school's drama club found great success in going to see live stage productions in philadelphia and new york we are from southern new jersey so those cities were closest holding trips to see broadway shows or any touring hit show is a great way to bring publicity to your drama club and get people interested in joining as an additional point of interest to the existing members of the club we often had speakers before we would see a show to discuss with us the theatrical and technical aspects of putting on such a performance sometimes we were even able to schedule a meeting time to talk with some minor cast members before showtime most theatres are open to that kind of thing for the sake of arts education so it is generally not too terribly difficult to make this kind of thing happen hope that helps Drama Theatre Broadway theatre Saturday Night Live Jerry Herman Polish theater Hunter College High School Lincoln Center Rodgers and Hammerstein Sally Ann Howes Theater in the United States Barbra Streisand Sketch comedy Soap opera West End theatre Avenue Q Garth Brooks Carnegie Mellon University Wonderful Town Hair (musical) EastEnders Yiddish theatre Peter Allen Lindy Hop Requirements analysis Dream Theater King Crimson Science fiction on television Barry Humphries Spice Girls The Monkees Jacob Pavlovitch Adler George Abbott Irish theatre Porgy and Bess Richard Wagner Sound design Infantilism Broadway (Manhattan) Monty Python One Tree Hill (TV series) Stanislavski System Tony Bennett God Emperor of Dune Sesame Street Chess (musical) Live 8 John Cage Tris Speaker Humphrey Bogart English grammar The Emancipation of Mimi Software engineering Musical theater Theory of conduct Miss Saigon Restoration spectacular Meat Loaf Sheryl Crow Otakon Entr'acte Our Gang Jesus Christ Superstar Ken Hill KISS (band) Harrow School Hall & Oates Rock Follies Television syndication Petula Clark WWOR-TV Sport Marching band Fred Ebb Guthrie Theater Dorama Television in the United States The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Lauren Bacall Abbey Theatre Tony Award Grand Forks, North Dakota Toastmasters International BBC television drama Musical works of Mozart Grunge music Goodness and value theory Jon Secada Styx (band) Theatre technique CPU cache The Ashlee Simpson Show Film Death rock Jennifer Lopez Tony Kushner Kylie Minogue Edward Pawley Radio drama Fame Academy
