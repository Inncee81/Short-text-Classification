casio privia vs yamaha dgx digital piano i'm looking for a nice digital piano for my apt natuarally i would like it to sound and feel as close to a real piano as possible i want it to have weighted keys which the dgx series says are semi weighted until you get up to the model i'm wondering if any of you had an opinion on either series of these keyboards i'm looking at the or model of the dgx or the or model of the privia depending on the deals i can find if anyone who knows about this stuff could rank those or eleborate on any it d be greatly appreciated please don't just say yamaha because you hear they are better if you have an opinion please state a reason why you like a certian brand thanks in advance i appreciate the quality of the yamaha voicings and their sequencing is vastly superior but if you are using the instrument primarily as a piano the privia has a better action and the stereo piano sound is quite good that being said the other factor is price i picked up a privia for under five hundred dollars to put in my classroom there was already an old beat up yamaha cp or something like that sitting there but it was well past it's prime painted over and i was tired of making the minor repairs to keep it going i liked the privia so much that i bought another one for the living room i like having the headphone option so that if i have to try something out while someone is watching a show in there i don't have to wait until it's over or ruin it for them i like the keys and i like the stereo piano sound i hate the pedal the first thing i did was replace the foot pedal that's the other thing about casio the nice korg foot pedals don't work you have to get it re wired or buy the off brand pedal with the reverse wiring yamaha is becoming a lot like intel they deliberately cripple their models to create value you can have a pretty nice keyboard for the same price as a casio but you have to put up with organ style keys with a three level controller casio has a much more primitive accompaniment feature something you may not care about but when it comes to the mechanics they shine this is a case where i would go for price by the way i got mine from one of the warehouse stores that require membership and begin with s normally i would recommend that you patronize a music store but i know what the markup is on pianos and that isn't going to change anytime soon get the thing on sale if you can there should be some nice back to school sales coming up if they aren't already going on it isn't going to make any difference it comes in a box you get the keyboard a stand that takes forever to put together i have the keyboard at school on an x frame and if you are going to move yours around i would recommend you do the same a pedal that you are going to want to throw away as soon as you unwrap it a boom stand and mike and the inevitable apocryphal instruction manual buy a damper pedal on the way home there is a plug for a faux una corda diminuendo as well but you might actually get away with using the cheap pedal for that unless it is an issue with you that's another area where the yamaha gives you more choices for the left foot i have a psr that i've used for years i don't think you'll be pleased with the mike either but i just threw a shure d on there to play with the headphones don't come with the package so you will want to get a set with a phono plug and a long cord plugs in from the left side nice that it doesn't plug in from the back or front and interfere with your playing but you do need enough cord to reach you should be able to get the for under especially since the new models are already out or will be out soon in your area i still consider casio the next best thing but often the next best thing is the
