in vista get a popup window with title windows script host and content object error what is it every time i start up my notebook with vista i get a small window that only says object error the title of the window is windows script host any idea what this is could it be related to my notebook freezing everyday so that i have to use the power button to shut down and restart ctrl alt del doesn't work and the mouse won't move windows script host is the script interpreter for windows basically it's what's used to run certain types of scripts on the windows operating system bottom line when you start your pc there is some application or service legitimate or otherwise that is attempting to run a script on your computer there is an error in the code or there is some file service functionality or otherwise that's the object it's referring to that's missing and the script needs that object to run successfully here are some things you can check i don't have vista here so hopefully these xp instructions will work for you start run eventvwr check all of the log types most likely you'll see some errors that tie to your object error message i'm guessing you'll see them in either the application log or the system log most likely the application log start run msconfig then go to the startup tab all of the entries you see are applications services etc which start when your pc starts the command column lists the actual file that's being run look for something with a vbs extension that may be your culprit if you don't want to troubleshoot it yourself just look up that entry on google and see whether it's required for example if you find a syscfg vbs under the command column just do a google search on syscfg vbs there are a few good sites that should come up at the top of the results and these will give you an idea of what it is go to c documents and settings all users start menu programs startup whatever you see in this folder is executed when you log in to your pc also look in the same path except replace the all users part with your username start run regedit then expand hkey local machine software microsoft windows currentversion run highlight the run part and then look on the right hand side if there is anything there it's something that runs when you log in if you don't find anything in any of these locations it could be one of the services that is running i can't really explain how to investigate those in this answer i'm hoping you'll find something in step that will give you an answer if you find anything in any of these steps just do a quick update to your question here telling us what you've found and we can take it from there DOS IBM PC compatible Delphi programming language User agent Wine (software) Microsoft Windows WordPerfect Linux MS-DOS Mac OS X GNU X Window System Windows 3.x Windows 2000 Microsoft Office AMD64 X86 FreeDOS Personal computer OpenOffice.org Symbian OS Common Unix Printing System Palm OS NX bit Free Pascal Java programming language Integrated development environment GNOME Timeline of computing 1990-forward Adobe Acrobat PHP Mandriva Linux Unix Macromedia Flash Cross-platform MSN Messenger Unix shell NTFS Windows XP DirectX DLL hell Windows 95 OS/2 PowerPC AS/400 DragonFly BSD Free software Linspire Lotus Notes TRS-80 64-bit OpenStep Visual Basic ITunes Control-Alt-Delete Microsoft Word GNU General Public License Python programming language File Allocation Table Windows XP Professional x64 Edition StarOffice WordStar Ubuntu Linux Comparison of media players Windows API Booting Perl AmigaOS IA-64 Vorbis Sound Blaster PearPC DESQview RPM Package Manager Hello world program Microsoft .NET Windows 1.0 Pocket PC Xen Session Initiation Protocol IPod Microprocessor Platform (computing) Gambas Upper Memory Area FreeBSD Xbox Visual FoxPro Skype ReactOS Linux distribution Application programming interface Apple Macintosh LabVIEW Comparison of file systems Knoppix IA-32
