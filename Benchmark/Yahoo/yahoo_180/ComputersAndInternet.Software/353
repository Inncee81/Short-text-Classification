please help me with my vista before i lose it i'm just going to suck it up and try to get used to vista there are some things bothering me though that if fixed would make me much happier i was using xp in the past which i love and miss and when working with files folders there was always that handy box to the left with the options move rename copy delete etc it isn't there with vista is there a way to get it if not how can you easily move several files into a folder for example i'm trying to organize my picture folder into several subfolders and the help only said drag and drop but that is only good for one file please help also is there a good site with simple helpful vista info help windows vista is different to say the least microsoft wants to create a program that is childproof so it changes how people can move and delete things meaning the software will work seamlessly so they think if you want to control any program like the good old days you have to right click on the program and select run as administrator then windows will verify with you if it's safe to continue feel free to do what ever after that good luck Windows XP Windows 2000 Windows Vista AmigaOS Macintosh Finder IPod IBM PC compatible Musical Instrument Digital Interface Object Desktop Computer virus System/36 Windows 3.x C programming language Common Unix Printing System ITunes History of Microsoft Windows File Allocation Table File system System 7 (Macintosh) Windows Me Blue screen of death Debugging Screenshot History of the graphical user interface Microsoft Windows Mouse (computing) USB flash drive Disk image Computer Mach kernel Windows Media Player Floppy disk Apple II family X Window System Architecture of Windows 2000 Atari 8-bit family Commodore 64 SonicStage System 6 Apple Macintosh Copy protection Stardock Embedded system Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Java programming language Digital rights management Windows registry Hello world program Virtual memory Gmail System/34 DOS MS-DOS Atari ST Personal computer Burroughs B5000 Mac OS LiveCD IBM PC Objective-C Windows 1.0 Macromedia Flash Microsoft Ethernet Vorbis Windows Mobile Unicode Bluetooth Universal Serial Bus PlayStation 2 Plan 9 (operating system) Xerox Star Device driver Kernel (computer science) Library (computer science) Windows Server 2003 Control Panel (Windows) Konqueror Compact disc Pretty Good Privacy Backup FreeDOS Spring operating system Digital audio player Windows API PowerPC Jumpstart 3rd Grade ZX Spectrum Palm OS Cascading Style Sheets
