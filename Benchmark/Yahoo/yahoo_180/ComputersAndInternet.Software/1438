whats the difference between windows vista and windows vista upgrade ok i looked at vista boxes and i saw different windows vista ultimate i saw windows vista ultimate cost around and windows vista upgrade cost what the hell is the difference hey joao chris a windows vista ultimate upgrade is the cheaper edition of vista for good reason the upgrade edition allows you to upgrade your exiting operating system like windows xp pro or home to windows vista whilst keeping your existing files and settings basically the upgrade edition is cheaper because microsoft has chosen to charge less if you are already using their software the idea is that vista upgrade edition will only let you 'upgrade' your current software to vista and not do a 'clean install' windows vista ultimate complete edition typically comes with new pc's and allows people to 'clean install' vista should they need to the complete edition can also be used to 'upgrade' an existing operating system basically ultimate upgrade can upgrade your existing software whilst ultimate 'complete edition' can upgrade and clean install hope this helps regards richo ideastorm Portable Document Format Adobe Acrobat Adobe Systems Ebook Windows Vista Warez Adobe Illustrator Macromedia Flash PostScript Opera (web browser) Mac OS X Common Unix Printing System Microsoft Office OpenDocument LaTeX TeX Gmail WordStar WordPerfect Computer virus Unicode World Wide Web PNG Debian Windows 3.x Digital rights management Kazaa Digital photography ITunes QuickDraw GX MDAC Mac OS X v10.4 Emacs Windows 2000 Typeface Microsoft Windows Perl Open-source software Visual Basic Domain Name System Copyleft First-sale doctrine Rootkit JavaScript Display PostScript PHP FreeBSD MP3 Debugging Adobe InDesign Podcasting Killian documents HyperCard Spyware Linux Forth programming language Filename extension GIF SAS System XML Lisp programming language BASIC programming language Lotus Notes Computer IPod Windows XP AmigaOS Linspire BitTorrent Trademark IPhoto Musical Instrument Digital Interface Encapsulated PostScript Python programming language Comparison of web browsers Mach kernel Microsoft 2D computer graphics Plan 9 (operating system) Palm OS Pump It Up Apple Macintosh Scalable Vector Graphics Enterprise content management Translation memory ALGOL 68 Patch (computing) Copyright infringement of software Trusted computing QuarkXPress C programming language MSN Messenger E-mail NX bit EMule United Kingdom corporation tax Postcode
