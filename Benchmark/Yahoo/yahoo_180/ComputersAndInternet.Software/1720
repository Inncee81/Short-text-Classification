microsoft word clipart problem i just wanted a bloody clipart pre given and included in microsoft word so i try to insert a clipart when it started taking and organizing every single file in my computer pictures songs etc what the heck is going on and how do i get rid of it its embarassing because now if someone tries to find a clipart by searching 'girl' on the computer for something innocent they'll find me and my girlfriend in your program files under microsoft office tools you may have the ms clip organizer you can go through the items and delete the ones you do not want included you may also want to set the location of your clip art in word by going to tools options file locations how did it happen probably when you opened the clip art taskpane there is an search in option to check everywhere you can change that to search in a specific location hope that helps and good luck OpenOffice.org Microsoft Office OpenDocument StarOffice Windows XP Warez Copyright infringement of software Mozilla Firefox Microsoft .NET Pretty Good Privacy Linux distribution Microsoft Common criticisms of Microsoft WordPerfect Spyware Stardock Macromedia Flash Linux Computer virus Copy protection Wine (software) Mac OS X MP3 BitTorrent XML Open-source software Digital rights management Microsoft Excel Laptop GNOME DVD Free software Sun Microsystems SCO-Linux controversies GNU General Public License Richard Stallman DR-DOS Mozilla Application Suite Pirate decryption OpenBSD Modchip Open source culture Wget Perl MDAC Java programming language Knoppix Intellectual property X Window System Transport Layer Security GIMP Emacs Berkeley Software Distribution Windows Vista Public key infrastructure History of Microsoft Windows QuickTime Unicode Apple Macintosh Timeline of computing 1990-forward United States Postal Service ROM image Ubuntu Linux Portable Document Format Software cracking Windows 2000 IPod ITunes Music Store Craps Patch (computing) Compiler optimization Trusted computing USB flash drive Apache HTTP Server Linspire Debian MD5 ReactOS Python programming language Copyright infringement Tablet PC VBulletin Microeconomics Year 2000 problem Xbox Bulletin board system MS-DOS Make Abandonware SUSE Linux C plus plus Library (computer science) Xbox 360 CPAN Atari 8-bit family GNU KDE Bluetooth
