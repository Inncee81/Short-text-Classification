this is a biggie music is starting on desktop no program running virus maybe the last times i've started my computer music has begun playing that i did not put on it so far queen's flash gordon song with some conversation at the end something that sounded like sugar ray then a song that spewed countless obscenities for about minutes then the first part of some punk song that just stopped playing about seconds in i've had some computer problems here lately but this is just beyond me i think this is a virus but i'm not sure what to do about it i have put on virus protection and spyware blocker software but it hasn't resolved this issue to be fair it did remove a great deal of problems i just want to know if anyone is familiar with this problem and what to do about it if it goes deeper than some punk playing music on my desktop i want to know what to do thanks skyler i just restarted my computer and it didn't play the music so i'm going to assume it's an erratic virus that in mind any ideas on how to tackle it i've run virus scans and they haven't found it once again if anyone has ever heard anything about this virus i appreciate any input i can get this might be a joke program or a setting that someone changed on purpose if the music plays only when you start up the computer try going to the control panel then 'sounds speech and audio devices' then click on 'change the sound scheme' for win xp you will see a popup box with a list of 'program events' sounds scroll down until you see 'start windows' and 'windows logon' then select one at a time and click the 'play' button to see which one has the music then select whichever one and in the 'sounds' selection choose ' none ' this might solve the problem otherwise it's an active process virus Streaming media Windows Media Video Warez Gmail World Wide Web Macromedia Flash Portable Document Format PlayStation Portable BitTorrent Wget Video codec Kazaa Microsoft ASCII art Common Unix Printing System Nine Inch Nails XML Wiki Website Mozilla Firefox Representational State Transfer Digital photography Web crawler HTML Mozilla Application Suite Karaoke Enterprise content management QuickTime Uniform Resource Locator Internet HyperText Transfer Protocol Web server E-mail Ebook Opera (web browser) Screenshot Online music store Digital rights management Source code Trusted computing Windows Vista We Belong Together Game show Domain Name System Xbox 360 Internet pornography MSN Messenger CPAN Windows XP Mac OS X v10.4 Laserdisc Richard Stallman AOL Instant Messenger VJ Uniform Resource Identifier Proxy server Podcasting Mac OS X Lotus Notes Anonymous remailer AmigaOS Phishing Google Web browser Commodore 64 Copyleft Slashdot subculture Usenet Xbox Wireless Application Protocol Spyware Secure Shell Ajax (programming) TLC Floppy disk MIME File Transfer Protocol LaTeX Theora Jennifer Lopez PlayStation 3 Ayumi Hamasaki DivX Comparison of media players IPod Filename extension OpenOffice.org MPlayer America Online Vlog Web page Blog Computer virus Super Audio CD ZX Spectrum Trillian (instant messenger) MP3 Nintendo GameCube
