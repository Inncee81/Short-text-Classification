osx mail app copies files instead of moving them hi using mail app v on osx tiger i've got my program set up to access our exchange server i've tried setting up my account both as an exchange account and as an imap account but alas there is something wrong when i move email from one folder to another it looks like everything went correctly inside mail app ie the file is now in the new folder and has been removed from the original folder however if i log in to the exchange server directly via owa i can see the message in both the old and new folder this is no good how can i make it so that when i move messages from one folder to another it actually moves them instead of just copying them please advise and thanks stu some files are changed when they go though a different program for example when i did a symbol in microsoft task like i was making a maze and i tried to copy it and send it to yahoo mail and id turned into and stuff like that some programs act differently and will not let you send it through at all do to a different programing language if that makes since to you hope that helps Trojan horse (computing) MSN Messenger Windows 2000 Spyware AOL Instant Messenger Blue screen of death Windows XP ITunes Internet Explorer Object Desktop Konqueror Macintosh Finder Macromedia Flash MDAC 98lite Miranda IM Yahoo!
