do i need to add relationships to all tables in access i am creating a access database for work the database is going to be of hotel venues with tables such as name contact name room name room measurements equiptment available ect i have been on a access course and still have pretty much no idea what i'm doing i have made the tables and i know i have to join them up with relationships but as i need all the data in the tables to be connected do i just join all the tables up and then it will work this sounds to simple am i missing something out i'm really stuck and didnt expect access to be this complicated if someone can explain it to me in dummy terms that would be great my job depends on it so i would be very grateful thanks the relationships between the tables depend on how you've stored your data but not all tables need relate to all other tables look for relationships where one set of data applies to more than one row in another table for example you've indicated hotel name and room name each hotel would presumably have more than one room so the room table would contain a row for each room with all the information about the rooms measurements etc and a link or relationship pointer to the hotel name the hotel table would contain all the information about the hotel contact name etc only once but is linked to all the rooms at once through the relationship Windows XP Windows 2000 Apple Macintosh Booting IBM PC compatible Linux Hard disk USB flash drive Windows 3.x Blue screen of death Virtual memory Apple II family Common Unix Printing System Floppy disk Library (computer science) System 7 (Macintosh) Computer virus Screenshot Knoppix Spyware FreeDOS Commodore 64 Atari 8-bit family Mac OS X Mouse (computing) Embedded system Personal computer DOS System/36 Kernel (computer science) File system Emacs Perl IA-32 NeXT Microsoft Windows Windows Vista Laptop Partition (computing) BASIC programming language NX bit Windows Server 2003 Redundant array of independent disks Hello world program Nintendo GameCube Computer software Mach kernel Windows registry CPU design PHP Random access memory Macintosh Finder 64-bit Atari ST TRS-80 Color Computer Portable Document Format Upper Memory Area Copy protection Macromedia Flash Acorn Electron ZX Spectrum IMac Ethernet Apple Computer History of the graphical user interface Rootkit Java programming language Sun Microsystems MIPS architecture WordPerfect BIOS Ajax (programming) RISC HyperCard Computer forensics Novell NetWare Mozilla Firefox PlayStation 2 Expansion Bay TRS-80 Btrieve IBM PC Disk cloning CPU cache Timeline of computing 1990-forward PC Engine WordStar OpenVMS History of Microsoft Windows
