where can i find a program to overclock my intel core duo i want to overclock my intel core due but cannot find a program to do so anyone know where to find one there are several ntune is good if you have an nvidia based motherboard but really the best and most reliable way is going into the bios and doing it yourself the program you use has to access the bios anyway so why not cut out the middle man and do it yourself if you need help on where to go send me an im and i can help you out as for what dan said uninformed answer is all i can say low end core duos can be quite easily overclocked which most definately yields a performance gain even high end ones can be overclocked somewhat his answer was spot on when the pentium s were running in the ghz range becaue you couldn't go much higher due to heat limits but the core s have changed that they are great overclockers and as for the speed of the ram most of the time it is the fsb that is the bottleneck not the ram and overclocking the cpu means overclocking the fsb as well World Wide Web Web server HyperText Transfer Protocol Common Unix Printing System Wget Cross site scripting Web browser HTML REALbasic Hello world program Slash (punctuation) Computer and video games Mozilla Firefox Uniform Resource Locator REBOL Windows Movie Maker Warez Independent film Window Maker Ajax (programming) ASCII art Web application Spyware Machinima Domain Name System Website Lotus Notes MP3 BitTorrent Gmail HTTP cookie SAS System Game Maker Cross-platform Representational State Transfer HTML element Uniform Resource Identifier Outlook Express Unicode and HTML Windows Vista Resident Evil: Apocalypse HyperCard Mozilla Application Suite Apache HTTP Server Screenshot Internet Filename extension Film Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events Character encodings in HTML Microsoft Windows IBM PC compatible Netscape Macromedia Flash Windows 98 Film director RISC The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Easter egg (virtual) Transmission Control Protocol Windows Media Video Microsoft Wiki JADE programming language History of the graphical user interface Mirmo!
