where can i get microsoft access i have searched everywhere to find that either it's discontinued or out of stock i know that there is now but i need specifically ebay doesn't have it neither does amazon any other places thanks i have but i'm curious why you need this particular version when you configure access you can tell it to open in prior versions this sometimes don't require any conversion from your part the only problem is when you have used activex controls that are only available in the newer version if that is the case you can get the ocx files from the machine you coded the application and register them on the old computer you do this by looking the broken missing links on the vba reference section you place the ocx and dll files on a folder that is for this purpose only then you can browse to the directory from the vba reference section to fix the broken links some dll's require registering there is a command like regsvr that you need to use for this another option is to get the access developers edition and compile the code for a distributable package that can be installed in any computer that needs it it will contain the access run libraries if you need more info let me know Synthesizer Keyboard instrument Synthpop Organ (music) Musical keyboard Musical Instrument Digital Interface Musical instrument Electronic organ Roland Corporation Analog synthesizer Herbie Hancock Pipe organ Synth rock Electronic musical instrument Player piano Keyboardist Kraftwerk Sampler (musical instrument) Skinny Puppy Hornbostel-Sachs Guy Sigsworth Wavetable synthesis Yamaha Corporation New Order Tony Banks (musician) Manual (music) Robert Moog Drum machine Ensoniq Just intonation The Who Pat Metheny Ministry (band) Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark Mellotron Freestyle music Hammond organ Fairlight CMI Electronic music Farfisa Union (album) Subtractive synthesis Vocoder Pat Metheny Group Wendy Carlos Korg Texas Instruments Guitar/synthesizer Texas Instruments TI-99/4A MIDI controller Minimoog Sequential Circuits Pedalboard Electronic art music Songwriter Tangerine Dream ARP Instruments, Inc.
