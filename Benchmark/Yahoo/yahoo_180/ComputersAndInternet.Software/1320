excel function to find average of only the most recent 'x number' of entries i made a nice little spreadsheet to keep golf handicaps but i want to also make a handicap of my last and last rounds only obviously if i get better bad scores from some time ago will skew my handicap is there a way to only average the last x number in my case and then entries i keep dates with my scores so that could be used also or just the last i entered well that's definitely an idea however the layout and information on my spreadsheet would be much better suited to just have one box that always averages the last entries of that column i have different courses in different columns two subcolumns with date in one and score for that day in another at the bottom of each course column i have a handicap box averaging all scores from that column then under that i have an overall handicap box averaging all the scores together i was hoping to just add two more boxes in each course column to find my last and last handicaps it's really not that big of a deal i'm just playing with excel since i payed to get office so i'll enjoy playing with any help you give me oh also what is the for in the if function you gave me if d average d d is that just how you say if there is an entry then find the average of the last cells seems weird with the two sets of dude you rock i always figured i'm pretty good at excel but you got it down thanks alot and you are right different number of entries in each course column thanks for the help man i'm trying to enter the first function in the b column and i'm getting a value error the function is max if b b row b b scores start in b and will end at b although i only have scores through b as of now in this column also i kinda like to know what i'm doing so am i correct in that this just returns the row of the last entered score which will then later be used in the second function to average the last and last let's say you have a row for each round and your latest round is on row and you don't skip rows between rounds and let's say your scores are on column d you can add formulas in column e for the average of your last and in column f for your last in e average d d last in f average d d last you can copy these to lower rows and the row numbers will change to always refer to the last and last respectively you can even copy them far down the column so you don't have to add them later if you do that you will only want to calculate the average if a round score has been entered on that row so you would have in e if d average d d in f if d average d d if your setup is more complicated than i've assumed add detail or e mail edit i will need to take another look at how to do it with your additional info but the is two double quotes with nothing in between so essentially a blank so the formula says if d is blank no entry then display a blank otherwise calculate the average edit ok i'll assume your courses have varying numbers of scores filled in since you haven't played them all the same times assuming one of these course columns is column b somewhere in the column put this formula to find the last row that's filled in in that column assumes that scores start at row and that row is a blank row below all the scores max if b b row b b you could hide the row with this formula if you didn't want to see it i'm going to assume the above formula is at b this will be your formula to average the last average offset indirect b b this will be your formula to average the last average offset indirect b b repeat for the other columns replacing b in all three formulas if having trouble add detail again or e mail edit i knew i forgot something i just forgot to tell you that the formula that you're getting a value error on is an array formula which just means that you need to input it with ctrl shift enter rather just enter when you enter it with ctrl shift enter it will have curly brackets around the formula just fyi an array formula acts on a lot of cells at once in this case it's checking each row to see if it has an entry and if it does it gets its row number and at the end it finds the max row number and you're right on about what it's used for hope that fixes it for you Peer-to-peer Azureus BitTorrent Computer virus Java programming language Ares Galaxy ITunes Macromedia Flash I2P Malware Eclipse (computing) Copyleft Spyware
