genuine copy of windows alright i know my version of windows is fake because when my sister tried downloading windows media player she ran the validation check and it turns out ours isn't genuine my dad said that either i should pay for my own copy of windows or i should switch from windows to linux i'm a jobless highschooler so paying for a genuine copy of windows will dig the biggest pit of doom in my already empty wallet but i'd die if i had to switch to linux because all of my online role playing games and my other games won't be compatible with the system and that's an even bigger waste of money so my question is how much is it to get a genuine copy of windows also if i re install the genuine copy of windows after i buy it will everything on my computer be erased yes reinstalling a new copy of windows will erase your information if you had a new validation code it would not to get a copy of windows try looking on www mininova org of course downloading a cracked copy is illegal and you can't update it but whatever a new copy should run you about on ebay Windows 2000 Anti-virus software Windows registry Computer virus Windows XP Rootkit System 7 (Macintosh) Windows Vista Blue screen of death Filename extension Microsoft Windows Trojan horse (computing) Cmd.exe File system Mac OS X Malware Macintosh Finder Spyware Mouse (computing) System 6 Dialer Btrieve Object Desktop OS/2 Hello world program AmigaOS Partition (computing) Start Menu Macromedia Flash Icon (computing) .NET assemblies Mac OS history Mydoom NX bit Xerox Star NTFS junction point Stopping e-mail abuse Ebook Mozilla Firefox Emacs Common Unix Printing System Windows API Control Panel (Windows) Screenshot GNOME AOL Instant Messenger Unicode Portable Document Format Computer security Home directory History of the graphical user interface Google Desktop OpenOffice.org Linspire LiveCD Internet security Windows 1.0 Windows Installer Knoppix Windows 3.x Classic (Mac OS X) COM file Mac OS X v10.4 IPod USB flash drive Konqueror OpenBSD Stardock MSH (shell) Apple typography WordPerfect Bluetooth X Window System MegaMan Battle Network 3 Host file Palm OS MegaMan Battle Network 2 Web page AppleScript Comparison of web browsers PlayStation Portable Taskbar Common criticisms of Microsoft Skype Norton Utilities Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing Gmail Common User Access System/36 Apple Macintosh MegaMan Battle Network Mac OS Window Maker Spotlight (software) Directory Software testing Outlook Express
