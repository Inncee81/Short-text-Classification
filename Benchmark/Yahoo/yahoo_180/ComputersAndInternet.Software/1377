computer programs to view edit videos i can't watch videos on my computer because of itunes itunes is messed up which screwed with quicktime which screwed with java etc it's an ongoing problem i haven't been able to fix itunes i've tried re installing everything but that doesn't work i've also tried just re installing quicktime but that doesn't want to work either if you can fix this problem then great but i'm not really worried about that the point is i want to download a program that will allow me to view and edit videos that i have stored on my camera but nothing that runs off of or uses quicktime if you know of multiple programs i'd love to hear all of them thanks if you have a pc you can use windows moviemaker to view edit your videos and if you have a pc you can also use windows media player to view after saving your video and a wmv file if you hav a mac you can use imovie to view edit your videos i don't know whether you have a mac or pc but if quicktime isn't working and you have a mac you can get windows media player for the mac if your mac doesn't already have it if quicktime isn't working then maybe you could search the internet or apple's website for quicktime updates or upgrades Unicode Windows 2000 Computer virus Filename extension Blue screen of death Newline Btrieve Windows registry Macromedia Flash GNOME Linux AmigaOS Cmd.exe Portable Document Format OpenDocument Emacs Hello world program Notepad Rich Text Format Stardock Forth programming language Windows API Trojan horse (computing) Word processor Common Unix Printing System Windows Vista Microsoft File system Ebook Mac OS X ITunes Microsoft Windows Microsoft Word Mozilla Firefox Text editor Mouse (computing) File format Library (computer science) Spyware Metadata USB flash drive Windows XP Opera (web browser) Windows 3.x Computer file BitTorrent Dialer XML Gmail Mozilla Application Suite Rootkit SAS System Perl COMMAND.COM AbiWord Microsoft Office Object Desktop Patch (computing) Computer security Podcasting Icon (computing) Virtual memory AppleScript Screenshot Embedded system Internet Relay Chat Computer software Java programming language Anti-virus software Musical Instrument Digital Interface Freenet Malware WordPerfect ZX Spectrum History of the graphical user interface MDAC Cocoa (API) MSN Messenger C programming language Pipeline (Unix) Mach kernel PHP Computer Objective-C GNU Mac OS X v10.4 Microsoft .NET HyperCard Shell (computing) Macintosh Finder Commodore 64 Wget Knoppix Computer science Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol JADE programming language Minesweeper (computer game)
