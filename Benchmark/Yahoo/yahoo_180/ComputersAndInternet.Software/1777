what is a good program for editing video on the computer i don't mind buying though share or free ware would be welcomed i am looking to create a music video for my favorite song as i don't like the one produced by the artist i don't have any video editing experience and the camera i have is a mini dvd so any clips would be pulled off of the dvd since you don't have any video editing experience i highly recommend you use imovie if you have a mac or windows movie maker which should already come with windows xp they are both easy to use and fairly intuitive adobe premier is the high end program but you probably will not use many of the functions it has also adobe premier was fairly hard for me to learn how to use i had actually used windows move maker in the end to do most of my edits i suggest using a low end program learning how to use it then buying a more sophisticated program once you start needing more functionality OpenOffice.org Microsoft Office StarOffice OpenDocument Microsoft Excel ReactOS Sun Microsystems Apache HTTP Server Microsoft Word Free software Open format Open-source software Open Database Connectivity Mozilla Firefox World Wide Web Wget HTTP cookie Reverse engineering Quotation mark Session Initiation Protocol Proxy server Internet Uniform Resource Locator AbiWord GIMP HyperText Transfer Protocol Microsoft Apple II family Mydoom Scalable Vector Graphics Ebook Macromedia Flash Domain Name System E-mail Afrikaans Application software Portable Document Format Stardock Sun Industry Standards Source License Digital audio workstation Google XML Website BitTorrent WebDAV BASIC programming language Common criticisms of Microsoft Ajax (programming) KDE WordPerfect Streaming media Copyleft Software componentry Apple Computer IBM PC compatible GNU General Public License Web server Web browser Microsoft Publisher Intellectual property Presentation program Richard Stallman Usenet Slashdot subculture SAML Windows Mobile History of Microsoft Windows Mozilla Application Suite X Window System Microsoft PowerPoint Zulu language Machine translation USB flash drive HyperCard Phishing Proprietary software MSN Messenger Linux Copyright infringement of software Microsoft Windows Internet Information Services Quattro Pro CPAN Opera (web browser) GNOME Corel Macro Jabber Slashdot The Book of Mozilla Microsoft Access Flowchart Digital video recorder Spyware Xbox
