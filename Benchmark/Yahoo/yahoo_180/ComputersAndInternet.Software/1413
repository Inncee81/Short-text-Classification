i need help how do i put pics on my pc to send to a friend via email simple instructions please don't know anything about doing this any help would be appreciated thanks firstly you need to specify where you're putting the pictures on your computer from e g camera phone but the basic instructions are connect your device with the pictures on to your pc using a usb cable bluetooth your computer should recognise this device and if it asks for drivers to be installed either insert the cd that came with your device or search on the internet for the driver i will send you a link for the driver if you tell me what device you have go into my computer click on the device which is most likely to be called removable disk or the company name of the device and try looking in that folder or any sub folders for your pictures once you find your pictures open your email client hotmail yahoo outlook and insert the email address of the person you want to send the pictures to then either copy and paste pictures into the text area or click on attach file and find your pictures and attach every picture you want to send one by one all at once depending on the email client and press send voila there sent lol hope this helps feel free to ask for anything else or tell me if i have missed anything out d LimeWire ITunes ITunes Music Store Macintosh Finder Windows Vista Warez System 7 (Macintosh) Napster Gnutella BitTorrent File sharing Spyware EMule File system Windows XP Gnutella2 Peer-to-peer Gmail Object Desktop Uploading and downloading MGM Studios, Inc. v.
