what is so different about vista that makes most programs unworkable on its os will this problem be fixed i badly need a new computer current one is win i wish to play games like sim city gta and true crimes on a new computer is this possible is vista just a bad os that should make me settle for win xp no dont believe all that negative stuff about vista i dont get why people hate it soo much i have had mine since it became commercially available it does not have many program drive compatibility issues and if it does when the setup fails you can choose to run in compatibility mode the only thing i do not like at all is if you buy a computer with on board graphics no graphics card and you use the aero gui it will hog all your ram so i had to swich mine to the classic windows gui to save ram and im trying to intsall windows xp on a gb partition but i need support for raid drivers but i dont have a floppy drive also there is a better chance of those games having better performace than running those on a vista computer since vista requires more computer power Spyware Uninstaller Windows registry Computer security Windows 2000 Gmail File system Microsoft Windows Pretty Good Privacy Rootkit ITunes Windows Installer Computer virus E-mail spam NTFS Windows XP Trusted computing Norton Utilities AOL Instant Messenger Macromedia Flash Debugging Enterprise content management Kazaa Stopping e-mail abuse Microsoft Norton Commander Password Computer Open Directory Project Library (computer science) Hard disk Computer forensics Filename extension Censorware Mozilla Application Suite Mac OS X Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Netscape Communications Corporation Macintosh Finder British national identity card Windows Server 2003 Phishing Symantec 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines New.net System 7 (Macintosh) Burglar alarm MSN Messenger Master Control Program Ghost (software) Anti-virus software Instant messaging Perl Unicode Mydoom Java programming language IPod Object Desktop Expert system Norton AntiVirus Directory Management information system Firewall (networking) Barbara Boxer Surveillance America Online Model (economics) Acronym and initialism PNG Spam (electronic) MDAC Backup PHP Computer software Killian documents Files-11 Windows Vista Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Bluetooth Proxy server Dialer NTFS junction point 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities Group Policy Google CPAN Mutual fund System/36 Common Unix Printing System Slashdot subculture Wikipedia Mach kernel Digital rights management Linked list CPU cache
