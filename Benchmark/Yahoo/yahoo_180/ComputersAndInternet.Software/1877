vista and torrents cannot open port i just upgraded to vista ultimate and now can't open a port for torrents i have already setup my router to forward the port and the vista firewall i even shut off the firewall to see if that would work it worked great in xp and i thought i was relativiely advanced with this stuff any suggestions my vista upgrade has not been easy check to make sure you saved your router settings also if you are using utorrent make sure it is not randomizing the port last if you are behind a router you should check your ip address is the one you used for port forwarding routers dynamically assign the nat address so if there are other computers behind the router it may change your address each time you log in you can try to configure your router to put you in the dmz zone and see if that helps if you are connectable in the dmz but not behind the router then it is your router config thats all you can do open ports in router and unblock your firewall if it is not a firewall problem and your router is open then it is not a port problem when i got the new puters here and hooked em up they did indeed get assigned new lan ip's check in your router and see what lan ip it may have assigned you i had the same problem using bitlord change to utorrent worked perfectly make sure they match utorrent all my suggestions are from the voice of experience these stupid little things will drive you nuts when you figure the problem you smack yourself in the head the solution usually comes after you have gone crazy from trying for over two hours to figure out what is wrong Booting USB flash drive Dual boot LiveCD Boot image FreeDOS BIOS Windows XP Partition (computing) Linux Knoppix Windows 2000 Computer virus File system Password cracking Malware Microsoft Windows Computer surveillance Windows Server 2003 SYSLINUX Spyware Rootkit GRand Unified Bootloader Password Hard disk GNOME Computer forensics AmigaOS System 7 (Macintosh) Digital rights management MAME Windows 3.x Modchip Mac OS 9 Disk cloning Backdoor Puppy Linux PlayStation 2 IBM PC compatible Control-Alt-Delete IPod Surveillance MediaMax CD-3 Preboot Execution Environment Windows registry NTLDR Blue screen of death Apple II family Disk image PlayStation 2 Expansion Bay Monkey Island Personal computer Apple Macintosh Telnet Trojan horse (computing) Boot image control Oracle database Thin client NTFS Commodore 64 Installer Stopping e-mail abuse Secure Shell Apple Remote Desktop Baldur's Gate series Passphrase Case modding RISC OS Windows 95 Screensaver Copy Control File Allocation Table SUSE Linux Bootable business card Virtual Network Computing DVD-RAM Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing SAM Coup__ WordPerfect Compact disc Apple Computer Computer role-playing game Net Yaroze Filename extension QuickTime Phishing RSTS/E Anachronox Copyright infringement of software Kerberos (protocol) Upper Memory Area Mandriva Linux Desktop computer Sega Dreamcast Two-factor authentication Final Fantasy VI Floppy disk Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol MIPS architecture
