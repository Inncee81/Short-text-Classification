how do you install an os on a blank hdd hi i have a crappy old dell box p mb ram gb hdd a macbook pro previously i had windows ' on the dell but i wanted to try something different so downloaded xubuntu i can copy that to the hdd or a blank cd to put in the dell but when i do that if i start it up it just says no operating system found on the screen it repeats that every time i press a key i copied the hard drive of the dell to my mbp before wiping it too but now that i restore the dells hdd to its' original way it still says no os found when i put it back in i'm using an external firewire enclosure w my mbp so can anyone tell me how can i get wins ' or xubuntu onto this thing i also have the original not pirated install disks for wins me but not the rego key i've tried about other rego keys which haven't worked after installing wins me thanks i think your main problem is that the cd drive is not the first boot device you need to go into the bios and change the boot order sothat the cd is first copying the files of a os system wont work as there are other bits that don't appear n the os file system to check your xubuntu cd is correct put it in the mac and check that there are a lot of files if there is only one with a filename that ends in ' iso' then you will need to rewrite the cd with burning software that writes the iso file as an image you may be able to reinstall win but you will need an original cd email me if you need further info Warez Web server Spyware Apache HTTP Server Free software Digital photography ITunes Maya (software) Web browser Web application Ajax (programming) Macromedia Flash MySQL Copy protection Digital rights management ZX Spectrum Computer animation Eddie Murphy Amstrad CPC Software cracking Web hosting Uniform Resource Locator Movie theater Common Unix Printing System CPAN PHP Stardock Walter Grauman Brainfuck Patch (computing) Screensaver Digital watermarking MSN Messenger LAMP (software bundle) Knoppix Electronic commerce Windows XP IMac GIF Software engineering Dubbing (filmmaking) Screen Gems Sega Machinima ILife Computer software IMAX Proxy server Borland Jennifer Lopez Subtitle PHP-Nuke IBM PC compatible Commodore 64 Video game controversy America Online WIN Television Claris Stopping e-mail abuse Microsoft Windows ICalendar HTTP cookie Screenwriting Enterprise content management Modding Captcha Streaming media Multimedia Messaging System IPod Nintendo DS GoldenEye 007 Microsoft First-sale doctrine Subscription business model Python programming language Yohoho!
