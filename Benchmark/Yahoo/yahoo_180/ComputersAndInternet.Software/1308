photoshop question how come i cant change the color of any thing from grey i pick a different color but it still shows up as grey it depends on how you turned the image into grayscale if its in grayscale mode it needs to be changed to rgb or cmyk etc this setting resides under image mode rgb if you added an adjustment layer on top of the layer you are trying to paint this would also have the same effect if you desaturate the image using ctrl shift u you should be able to use another color over it or on another layer if you prefer you also may have started a new document with grayscale selected instead of a color mode your problem could be a result of several things but i hope this helps Adobe Photoshop Adobe Systems Adobe Illustrator Paint Shop Pro Adobe Acrobat GIMP Macintosh Finder IPhoto Microsoft Office GIF Adobe InDesign Tagged Image File Format Macromedia Fireworks Finale notation program Windows Vista Uploading and downloading 2D computer graphics Photoshopping Portable Document Format TeX Valve Hammer Editor Macromedia Flash Corel ImageMagick PNG Warez Object Desktop JavaScript Version Digital image editing Desktop publishing IPod Plugin Download manager Mac OS X ITunes Trademark Tux Paint Library (computer science) Windows registry Automator (software) System 7 (Macintosh) Fark.com Carbon (API) Cue sheet Favicon PlayStation Portable Bulletin board system IrfanView Secure copy Windows 2000 Ebook Encapsulated PostScript ILife Apple typography Stardock MIRC Weekly newspaper P__li Gnutella PostScript TrueType System 6 Brush Drawing Outlook Express WordPerfect Norton Commander Windows Me Spatial file manager Graphic design Multiple document interface Mod (computer gaming) Xerox Star Slash fiction Web page .NET assemblies Display PostScript Google Desktop ZIP (file format) Opera (web browser) OpenType Windows 3.x Computer virus Windows XP BitTorrent Bryce Avatar (virtual reality) RGB color model Directory Copyright infringement of software OpenDocument Raw image format Windows Explorer Lotus Notes Start Menu Transparency (computing) Gmail
