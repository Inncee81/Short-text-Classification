how do i remove all skipped lines from an already single spaced ms word document i have a word document andi would like to remove the skipped lines it is already single spaced so altering those setting will do nothing i would like one line to follow the next uninterrupted i am trying to avoid doing it manually thanks from the 'edit' menu choose 'find' and click on the 'more' button at the 'find what' click on the 'special' button at the bottom and choose 'paragraph mark' click on the 'replace' tab and click 'replace all' this will leave one continuous paragraph with no line gaps if you have paragraph formation that you want to keep but want to omit an extra line between them insert 'paragraph mark' twice at 'find what' and insert it once at 'replace with' then click 'replace all' Mouse (computing) PlayStation Portable JPEG Image file formats Macromedia Flash Microsoft Paint GIF WordPerfect ASCII art Cut and paste Windows Picture and Fax Viewer Common User Access WordStar Windows Vista IPod Web page Windows 2000 Mac OS X v10.4 Digital photography AmigaOS Atari 8-bit family Blue screen of death Object Desktop Emacs Cmd.exe Xbox Pixel art Double-click (computing) Gmail Common Unix Printing System File format Pixel ITunes Opera (web browser) History of the graphical user interface Digital image editing NTFS Palm OS AppleScript Control key Portable Document Format Inkscape JPEG 2000 Xbox 360 Stereoscopy Microsoft Windows IBM PC keyboard Macintosh Finder Commodore 64 Mozilla Firefox Apple II family Hello world program Lemmings (computer game) Minesweeper (computer game) ZX Spectrum Windows 1.0 HTML element Mac OS X Menu (computing) Microsoft Stardock Nintendo GameCube CPU cache Ebook Sega Dreamcast System/36 PlayStation 3 Keyboard layout Steganography Lossless data compression IBM PC compatible Google Graphics Super Nintendo Entertainment System Game controller Favicon Goatse.cx Anaglyph image Floppy disk Cascading Style Sheets Raw image format Computer File Allocation Table NaturallySpeaking High-definition television Forth programming language Linked list Cheating in Counter-Strike Apple Macintosh Graphical Environment Manager OS/2
