i have a lot of trouble clipping my dog's nails med size dog any suggestions he is a strong one my dog is one of three min pin and fox terr mixes the other two are fine but he freaks not even my husband can keep him still i am scared to hold too tight thinking i might break his legs when he squirms but if i don't hold tight enough he can pull away when i have the clippers on him and it will do more damage i have tried using treats and a dog harness but nothing works if he is such a difficult case that you can't get them clipped even with your husbands assistance then he is probably a candidate to go to the groomers or vet's office for this often a pet will allow the staff in one of these offices to get the job done especially if you are not in the room they tend to freeze up and fight less when it's not mommy and daddy doing the work if they are unable to do it then another option is sedation by the vet you might also try filing the nails every few days with a big nail file some dogs will tolerate this better than the nail clippers some trainers who show dogs actually use a dremel tool to round off the nails good luck to you Screw Equine conformation Garfield Maison Ikkoku Working dog Nine Inch Nails Nail (anatomy) Ferret Dog Woodworking Knife Airedale Terrier Upholstery Los Angeles Clippers Nail (engineering) Pekingese Rabies International League Trent Reznor Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) German Shepherd Dog Professional wrestling match types Internal ballistics Prisoner (TV series) Lawn mower Poodle The Apprentice 2 Glossary of climbing terms Social rule Time Out of Mind The Smoking Room Manicure Spidey Super Stories Mike Tyson Mixed martial arts Glossary of American football MTV2 Keeshond Strap-on dildo Plame affair The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Textile manufacturing Jam (TV series) Fancy rat The Contender (television series) Handloading The X-Files The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Brewery Kodocha Drill bit Housebreaking Music video Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Neopets M60 machine gun Reservoir Dogs Weight training New York Giants The Critic Timeline of alternative rock Milton H.
