are people out there trying to stop the dog meat and fur trade and puppy mills i was wondering i find it really hard to sleep at night as i hate knowing that somewhere in china or the philippines or kora there are dogs and cats being slaughtered eaten skinned burned chocked abused and even made to mate all day puppy mills i saw on the internet really horrible images of theses acts and of abuse of dogs i was wondering are their people who go over to these country's to try and stop these crimes also animals used in laboratories are they still allowed or is it banned i really find it hard not to think about these things i picture their sad little eyes and how terrified they must be its makes me cry i hate knowing that right now a dog is being hurt or killed if find it hard to take i would just really love to know if their are kind hearted people out there trying to stop theses vile acts on humanity like peta or the human society or rspca etc could anyone tell me if there are people and what do they do too help stop it thanks texelgirl if you have seen the footage and images i have seen your just as bad as they are they rip the fur from the animal while its still alive they dont feed them they beat them they crush their bones its people like you that disgust me wake up if i was starving i would eat veggies not dogs i agree fully i find it hard to take and it sickens me to no end to think of the harsh reality that many animals face and yes many people are making efforts to stop it but it seems to be a hopeless effort more people need to get involved more signatures are needed on petitions to the government in an effort to change laws more money is needed in the form of private donations to fund rescue efforts from puppy mills more education is needed to inform the public about puppy mills and why not to buy from pet stores and these are efforts that everyone can help at if you know someone that wants a puppy take the time to educate them about the horrors of puppy mills and ask them to rescue or at least buy from an honest breeder you can donate money to organizations like the spca or humane societies whose main goal it is to improve the lives of animals many efforts are being made but many more people are needed People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Livestock Dog Zoophilia Sin City Animal testing Animal rights Taboo food and drink Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pet skunk Pitaten One Piece minor characters Knots Landing Skinny Puppy Domestic rabbit Hunting Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Animal Farm Housebreaking Vegetarianism Guinea pig Shaggy dog story Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Puppy mill Blood (computer game) Video game controversy W.I.T.C.H.
