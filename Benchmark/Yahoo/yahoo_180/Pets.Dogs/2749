how do i know if my dog is pregnant i've noticed her stomach getting a little bigger but it doesn't seem pregnant big is her stomach gonna feel hard also a couple days ago i noticed that a slight discharge came out of her it was clear im not sure if this is a sign of pregnancy but maybe someone can answer this for you information im not a breeder okay the fact that my dog got pregnant was a complete accident the only reason we aren't getting her spayed would be because we don't want to kill her babies if in fact she is pregnant i don't plan on selling them or giving them away because i don't trust that people would treat them as well as we do sorry i had to ask the question here its just that i hoped that someone would give a kind answer because i don't have the money to take her to the vet right now why don't you go find something better to do with yourself instead of calling people ignorant when in fact your the ignorant because i bet you didn't any of these things that i've just told you it sounds to us like your dog is not only pregnant but is close to giving birth that clear discharge often preceeds the births and lubricates the birth canal if she doesn't have a big litter her tummy might not be very large take her temperature twice a day if she's near to giving birth her temperature will drop to about degrees to hours before the whelping starts we also suggest taking your dog to the vet and ask him to do a sonagram or xray this will let you know for sure if your dog is pregnant how many pups she's going to have and how far along they are Dog Guinea pig Friends EastEnders Breastfeeding Fertility awareness Abortion debate Cat Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pet skunk Gray Wolf Knots Landing Poker jargon Theory of conduct Humphrey Bogart Oral contraceptive Plame affair Kodocha Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Neighbours Birth control The Death Gate Cycle Shaggy dog story Sharon Tate Stomach cancer Contract Philosophical skepticism Jennifer Lopez Blonde on Blonde Urinary incontinence Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man Reservoir Dogs Hearing impairment Care Bears The nature of God in Western theology Time Out of Mind Kurt Cobain Vitamin C Joke Abortion The Lovely Bones The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Adoption Shark Jam (TV series) Ferret God Emperor of Dune Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels Slow Train Coming Dog training Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Lucille Ball The Smoking Room Vernon Schillinger Doomsday argument The Apprentice 2 Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Rei Ayanami The Ashlee Simpson Show Big Brother UK series 6 Hamster Breath of Fire III Traumatic incident reduction Characters of Lost AFI 100 Years series Smallville (Season 4) RuneScape quests Spina bifida Menstrual cycle Current teachings of Prem Rawat 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Pok__mon Live!
