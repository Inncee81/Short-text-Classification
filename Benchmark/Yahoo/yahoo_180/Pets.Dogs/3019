can a lot of ticks kill a month old puppy i'm sorry i have a lot of questions my puppy was rescued from a puppy mill he can to them very skinny and with fleas and ticks they never used any flea or tick treatment that i know of i know he must have have a lot because when i finally had the chance to check him i found about ranging in size on him they all looked like brown dog ticks but i can't be sure i'm taking him to the vet as soon as i can but could it be to late and he has a disease is there a chance that because of what he's been through that the ticks will kill him i'm really worried because he is so lethargic plus he is skin and bones and i'm afraid he can't fight off a disease advice i did use frontline plus on him yesterday day i got him i already pulled off every tick i found carefully he just fell asleep a little while ago he was rescued by the humaine society and they gave him all his shots except for lyme disease they said he was checked out by a vet but i don't know if i believe them from the way my baby is acting i'm calling them tomorrow to see what they have to say the diseases he could get are lyme all kinds of worms and then maybe anemia from being so loaded with fleas and ticks they can suck the life right out a pup you will not know until you have your pup seen by a vet he can draw blood and test it and you will have your answer within a day or two of the drawing i've seen rescued pups bounce back from some pretty horrid condition so i would not worry too much until your vets tells you to ok now get the pup into the vets asap Tick Lyme disease Dog Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pet skunk Sin City Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Prostate cancer Ehrlichiosis Flea Stomach cancer Heartworm Sickle-cell disease Rocky Mountain spotted fever Shark Syphon Filter Hematophagy Folic acid Anemia Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Bat Livestock Shaggy dog story Crohn's disease Mattress Cancer Psoriasis Housebreaking Coeliac disease The Amber Spyglass Mosquito Animal testing Rabies John F.
