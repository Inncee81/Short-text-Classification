do all humane societies do this i'm looking to get a dog from a humane society but they first have to come to my house and see if it's suitable it's like i'm adopting a child not a dog i understand why they do it but do they all do it this is the first time i've ever heard of anything like it please don't get me wrong i'm not one bit annoyed that they do it i was only wondering how many other people have heard of something like this the humane society branch i'm getting him from only takes rescue dogs i know the dog i'm looking at was a rescue from a puppy mill i want to give him the best life possible but i'm just so afraid someone will sneek in and get him before i do they will let him see and play with him before i adopt so that's a good thing i've been calling and calling and even e mail to get him but i'm not good at the waiting game he really can't even be seen to the public til saturday because they just got him a week ago you should not be offended or surprised at a shelter doing something like this first of all a puppy mill rescue could take months and i mean months to rehabilitate so viewing the dog and interacting is usually out of the question this dog could be starved injured or worse right now do you want to see that or do you want the shelter to take care of the animal second i love the idea of a home visit anyone who doesn't like that idea is suspect in my book i volunteer for a rescue group and i do home visits we also require personal references and vet references if you missed one rabies shot or heartworm test you are out of luck with us we take this seriously as these poor animals need stable homes that will be there for their lifetimes dog ownership is a responsibility and is not for the fickle or the impatient if you really want this dog you will be patient and do whatever the shelter asks of you if more shelters were this picky there would probably be a few less dogs in rescue and more dogs in happy homes john p you haven't a clue you need to do some volunteer work yourself and get an education about shelters and adoption Pet skunk Dog Golden Retriever Theory of conduct Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Socialization Heartworm Shaggy dog story Social rule Pitaten I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Game show Zoophilia Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Cat Animal shelter Altruism Extreme Programming Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Rescue group Dog training Animal rights Sin City Kender Milton H.
