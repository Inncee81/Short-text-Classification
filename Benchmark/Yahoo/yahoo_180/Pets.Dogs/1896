have you ever been bitten by a dog i was bitten on my leg by a rottweiler on saturday and after speaking to other people about it they said i would probably be scared of dogs now has your experience made you scared of dogs i was bitten when i was a kid by a golden retriever and chased and bit by a lab whoda thunk these breeds huh am i scared of dogs no i have been around dogs since i was a baby and bred and raised lots of different dogs including purebreeds and pedigreed mutts i am the owner of a rottie now and he is a great dog however the owner should be smacked of that dog that bit you for not controlling his dog i am more cautious and aware when a dog i do not know is around but not scared unless they are charging me fangs bared and looking for my carotid artery then no and haven't experience that lately thank goodness i have been chased by dogs when i am running exercising not running away just to clear that up but i am not scared of them because they usually stop and run home before they get too far and because they are used to most people running by i would suggest being cautious around dogs you don't know and since i don't know what happened when you were bit i can't say more than that one thing that may help you dealing with any anxiety or fear of dogs you may have is to see dogs in a controlled environment such as an obedience class dog show agility or other kind of contests in which the dogs' owners are a little more concerned with the behavior of their dog just be around them and see how it goes this doesn't mean you have to pet them or even acknowledge them just watch them might help i hope you will not let one bad experience linger long and give yourself time to digest and reflect on this episode just remember that most dogs are great and would rather shake your hand or lick you than bite you and sometimes talking to someone helps too i wish you well and hope you get better soon Dog Mixed-breed dog Dog agility Dog training Obedience training Labrador Retriever Cat Golden Retriever Dog show Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Theory of conduct Pet skunk Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Keeshond Schutzhund Rottweiler Working dog Rocko's Modern Life Hamster The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Australian Cattle Dog Pit bull Domestic rabbit Border Collie German Shepherd Dog Housebreaking Domestication Shaggy dog story Alaskan husky Shen Gong Wu Dobermann Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Jam (TV series) Time Out of Mind StarCraft: Uprising The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Jack Russell Terrier American Pit Bull Terrier Garfield Krypto the Superdog Characters in the Smurfs Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Social rule Flyball Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Havanese Teacher's Pet (Disney) RuneScape quests Kender The Ashlee Simpson Show Rich Mullins Game show Nintendogs Poker jargon Companion dog Crufts Saved by the Bell Vampire Horse American Kennel Club Toy dog The Lovely Bones Mnemonic Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) God Emperor of Dune Bart Simpson Chevy Chase Scooby-Doo Weimaraner The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Chesapeake Bay Retriever Ron and Fez Police dog Herding dog The Price Is Right Trailer Park Boys Meta-reference The Fairly OddParents Sonic the Hedgehog Whippet Italian Greyhound The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Guinea pig Avenue Q Brian Griffin Get Fuzzy Ed, Edd n Eddy Philosophy of language 2000 Australian Grand Prix Doug
