does he really love me or does he love my salami i have a pomeranian and he only gets excited around me when i come home and when i act excited around him and when i act excited the first thing he always does is run straight to the fridge sometimes i wonder does he really love me or does he love that i occasionally give him treats how do you tell when a dog is a gold digger i've felt really unloved by him ever sice he grew up wasn't a puppy anymore he doesn't even like when i pick him up i think he only loves the fact that i give him food and tummy rubs i doubt he would really rescue me from a burning building like the dogs i had as a kid would they were golden retreiver lab mixes and extremly loyal loved me more than anything he likes to growel at people who touch me but i honestly believe that's for his own enjoyment much more than for my protection how do i know for sure if he's a golddigger and if he is a golddigger is there any way i can make him fall in love with me i'm sure he loves you try teaching him a few simple tricks take him for walks and do other none food things with him the more you do with him the more attached to you he will become every time you get a chance give him a little pat when he runs to the fridge ignore him every time you give him something out of the fridge it tells him the begging worked so he does it again poms seem to take a bit longer to show their loyalty and love at least mine did but it will come also some again like mine do seem to growl and snap at strangers i think its because they are small they figure they will growl before that big person hurts them or their master another thing that helped with my dog was obedience classes a pomeranian will never be the same as a golden retriever they can't help it Dog training Shaggy dog story Ron Weasley Care Bears Billboard Hot 100 Salad Fingers Theory of conduct Kim Possible RuneScape quests Golden Retriever Trailer Park Boys Dog Episodes of Lost (Season 1) One Tree Hill (TV series) Pomeranian (dog) Blood on the Tracks Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Death Gate Cycle Past teachings of Prem Rawat Housebreaking Kodocha Aerial (dance move) Sonic the Hedgehog Great Teacher Onizuka Dog agility Piccolo Junior Saga German Shepherd Dog Zoophilia Characters in the Smurfs Into the West (miniseries) The Amber Spyglass Shetland Sheepdog KaBlam!
