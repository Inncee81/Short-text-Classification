my pup isnt snapping back i adopted my pit bull mix puppy from the humane society at age mos approx mos ago when i got her she had whip worm and kennel cough later to find out she also has puppy mange now she was treated with antibiotics and for the whip worm in june and treated again for whip worm in the end of july she's on ivermectin for the mange now and it isnt improving she hasnt gained much weight and doesnt seem to have the puppy energy that she should at this age she is only active for maybe hrs at the most each day otherwise she is sleeping she's on pedigree puppy food and seems to eat it x a day anybody have any ideas on what im doing wrong or changes i could make to help her i need to figure out why she doesnt have energy vet doesnt seem to be worried about it thanks for any help i would try a different food pedigree really isn't healthy and don't use purina either as someone suggested it is worse than the pedigree if nothing else use people food if you can get it canidae is really the best if you can't use people food or canidae or nutro try science diet it's not great but better than either pedigree of purina iams would be along that level too demodectic mange is a immune disease large doses of ivermectin are the preferred treatment but try to do what you can to build up your dog's immune system good food is the best way to do that unfortunately demodectic mange which is common in pits comes back if the immune system stays weak in the past before ivermectin was available the affected dogs were usually euthanized to alleviate suffering if the disease wouldn't respond to topical treatments i know a vet who still suggests it if the demodectic mange doesn't respond well to treatments Guinea pig Dog Common cold Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Chronic fatigue syndrome Fancy rat Fox hunting Diarrhea Psoriasis Allergy Nutrition Scabies Asthma Heartworm Dog show Prostate cancer Stomach cancer Ferret Pneumonia Urinary incontinence Domestic rabbit Greyhound racing Dog training Crohn's disease Omega-3 fatty acid Folic acid Gray Wolf Dieting Livestock Rabies Medicine Acne Dog food Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Bipolar disorder Onchocerciasis Pet skunk Anorexia nervosa Vitamin C Clinical depression Binge eating disorder Natural health Atkins Nutritional Approach Fecal incontinence AIDS Obesity Diabetes mellitus Mange Autism Addiction Eugenics Tocopherol Coyote Duesberg hypothesis Eczema Skinny Puppy Hypoglycemia Mixed-breed dog Tooth enamel Cancer Ecology Theory of conduct Raw food diet Socialization Sugar substitute Ulcerative colitis Ivermectin Chemotherapy Schistosomiasis Growth hormone Chlorpromazine Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Natural Hygiene Garfield Antibiotic Lupus erythematosus Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Antiviral drug Shark Radiation therapy Veganism Vegetarianism Streptococcus pneumoniae American Kennel Club Homeopathy Cystic fibrosis Health insurance Cirrhosis Earthworm Cardiovascular disease Coronary heart disease Milk Alzheimer's disease
