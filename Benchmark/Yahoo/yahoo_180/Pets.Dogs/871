should i get a gaurd dog ok so here's the story i raise rabbits recently someone had broken into my house and destroyed it they also broke into my bunny barn and kicked and beat one of my rabbits so badly that i'm still not convinced he'll pull out of this he's still at the vets almost a week now in critical condition i've now placed security cameras in my barn but in your opinion would it be a good idea for me to get a guard dog if so what breed in your opinion would be best i live on a large farm and don't really have anyone near me also in your opinion what is the best way to train a guard dog let me explain by guard dog i do not want a dog that is just mean and vicious more of a large loud barking dog that would knock an intruder over late at night i do not intend to just leave a dog outside all the time and anyone who does is just down right cruel well it's a unique situation i too have had to have a guard dog where i live being burgalized many times there are two different types when you talk about guard dogs there's guard dogs that will aggressively protect the home meaning it will bite then there's watch dogs which simply bark when intruders are present only professionals can train a dog to be a good guard dog but many dogs are naturally a good watch dog and many will even nip if barking doesn't get the message across many breeds would make a good watch guardian dog i would think the best would be a great pyrenese i always spell that wrong they are natural livestock guardians a german shepherd or rottie would also make excellent deterents usually just the very sight of these dogs will make an intruder walk the other direction such as my lb black german shepherd australian cattle dogs are fierce protectors of their family and come in a nice small package but whatever breed you decide on you will need to keep a few things in mind one you'll need to keep them away from the bunnies great pyre's may eventually become acustomed to them if raised properly also these crooks could also simply poison or shot the dog and finally you sound like a person who cares about animals so just remember the dog still needs attention and love just like any pet not just be a guard dog my german shepherd sadly spent years of his life as a warehouse guard dog he's now learning how to live a normal life goes for long morning runs with the bike each day and an excellent family protector as well Dog German Shepherd Dog Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Domestic rabbit Dog training Gray Wolf Garfield Livestock Bugs Bunny Sin City EastEnders Obedience training Herding dog Keeshond Housebreaking Tenshinhan Dobermann Police dog Social rule Avenue Q Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Guinea pig Monster Rancher monsters Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Australian Shepherd Ferret Working dog Fox hunting Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Schutzhund Escape from New York One Piece minor characters YuYu Hakusho The Legend of Zelda series enemies Pulp Fiction Reservoir Dogs RuneScape quests Pit bull Pekingese Combine (Half-Life 2) The Daleks' Master Plan Vegeta Docking Piccolo Junior Saga Miss Saigon Cat Who Framed Roger Rabbit Traumatic incident reduction Hunting Fancy rat Billboard Hot 100 Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Colony in Space The Lovely Bones Breath of Fire III Ty Cobb Poker jargon The Death Gate Cycle Carl Barks Excel Saga Blood (computer game) Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Nintendogs Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters Animal husbandry Animal rights Hamster Iditarod Resident Evil (film) Kakapo Australian Cattle Dog Pet skunk USS Ammen (DD-527) Characters of Lost Battle of the Bulge Falconry Milton H.
