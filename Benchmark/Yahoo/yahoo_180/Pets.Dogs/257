potty training an week old pup ok my sister has an week old dachshund and when we first brought her home she did really well going on her pee pads and in her potty box but lately she has gone backwards it seems she has been having more and more accidents in the house like times within a short while i tell her no firmly when she does go in the wrong spot and take her to her appropriate area and prase i have an month old maltese who didn't have problems although she was a bit older when we got her months old anyways i really need some suggestions we bought a carpet cleaner and clean the areas right away plus i have an eye on her all the time but with her being small and fast accidents do happen but there are just way to many accidents happening i'm at my wits end and not sure what to do or what could be the problem i think she might be getting confused by other family members giving her the wrong message so how can i put her back on track thanks so much please help and hurry well first off i just got a daschund this summer i already had one who's and i now have a week old my daschund loved peeing on the floor she still has a few accidents but that's the joy of potty training well first off what we do is praise her with treats and a good belly rub when ever she goes to the bathroom where she's supposed to and when they go inside where they aren't supposed to you have to be very firm on them but if you don't catch them in the act you shouldn't scold them they won't know what's going on try clapping really loud and using a tough voice don't shriek or anything use a deeper voice and make it clear that it is bad typically i scold mine but give her a quick pat to reassure her that it's not the end of the world when other people start messing with your method of training though you should ask them to back off very kindly i know my parents love screaming or going berzerk on her so i'll ask them to calm down and if you catch her him in time take them to where they're supposed to go it takes a very watchful eye i know mine's sneaky but daschund's are the best Shaggy dog story Housebreaking Social rule Dog training Poker jargon The Shining (film) Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 2000 Australian Grand Prix Toilet humour Reservoir Dogs Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Ron and Fez EastEnders Friends Aerial (dance move) Tag New York Giants Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Blood on the Tracks Salad Fingers Pittsburgh Steelers Glossary of American football Fecal incontinence The Fairly OddParents Saturday Night Live Diving Sin City Jam (TV series) Hansel und Gretel The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Milton H.
