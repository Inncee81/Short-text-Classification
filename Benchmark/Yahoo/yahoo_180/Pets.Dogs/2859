can someone explain why would people cut a dog's tail would people crop the ears would people get rid of the dew claw that extra weird toe dogs have on their front paws are there specific pragmatic reasons originally i really want to know why thank you i wanted to add that i am asking because i am curious but i don't intend to do that to my dogs i just was in the shelter this morning and a woman was commenting on one of our dogs and said to her husband that once they crop that dog's ears it will look almost like a purebred i got terrified and mentioned it to the adoption officer that's why i ask because even though i know tons about dog behavior and stuff and i don't know anything about those practices except when we see some dogs who end up in the shelter with those altered traits dp i agree with the abusive things you mention i work in the shelter and i heard them all my question is about those alterations and their origins some people find it cruel and i understand why if your dog is not a working dog what's the point then a surgery is a surgery as any surgery same for people there is a risk if a surgery is not necessary why do it as for dew claws it seems that's a good reason but i would not do it to my dogs as they might never hurt it i have had fast running dogs all my life and none of them have injured theirs but i am not opposed to it if it's done under good conditions for tail and ears as some people mentioned it seems that some working dogs needed it back in the day when infections were fatal but how many people have working dogs really the ones i see in the dog park are not on the farm or hunting they are companion family dogs so i learned a lot about the origins of these practices and i truly thanks everyone if you decide to answer stick to the question i do know that there are other abuse of dogs out there and this a genuine question and not a question about abuse originally don't undermine my question by making feel like i don't have the whole picture goldergal read my question why on earth did i ask the question because i wanted to know the origins working dogs being hurt etc etc etc make sense right people answered and some people just all fussed up because some people find that cruel i would not do that to my dogs because they don't need it did i ever say anything else did i say people are cruel or anything like that i am the one asking the question i said a surgery is a f d surgery the same for people if i can avoid a surgery i will if my dogs get hurt i take them to the vet and the vet determines what's necessary not all dogs who get those procedures are working dogs so some dogs get the procedures for no real pragmatic reason other than looks and please don't tell me i am not right here who is narrow minded you and read first before insulting people and it is a question site i ask a question don't judge me based on my question you don't know me don't need to use thumbs up and down people it's actually not respectful to the answerer back when dogs were used as more than simply being companions certain dogs would be in different elements cropping the ears and docking the tails was made to protect the animal pricker bushes and wild animals always seemed to be going for those to spots the dew claws were removed for dogs who ran fast as they usually got snagged on something and started bleeding it was found that they didn't need them so they were removed no a days unless you have a show dog there is no reason to have the cropping and docking done unless you really want it to look of it's old
