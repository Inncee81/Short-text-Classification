my dog lab collie mix is weeks old and will not potty outside i got her from the spca a week ago i have followed all the instructions steps that experts and owners have recommended but everytime i bring her outside she will either lay on the grass or chew on the grass or jump up and down i bring her out minutes after a meal once every hour and whenever i see her pacing sniffing circling etc but she still won't potty outside i try to encourage her by saying go potty but i don't think she understands what that means once she comes back inside she'll try to find a spot inside when she does go i quickly pick her up and take her outside but at this point she will continue her business when i carry her and once outside she is done and just lies there i do this game many times in a day and she is not wanting to change i also have her crate trained so when she doesn't go potty outside i will put her in the crate right after for about minutes and then take her outside again that also doesn't work yet help any suggestions for something different thanks shelter puppies sometimes have a bit more trouble with training because they have become used to relieving themselves indoors and in cages your dog is very young and can learn but may need extra enthusiasm and positive reinforcement to get it she is still so young take some of her favorite tiny treats like freeze dried liver pieces dogs go nuts over that and when you take her outside to potty take her on a leash and keep circling her in her potty area show her the treat and then say go potty even if she just squeezes out a few drops as soon as she does praise her and give her that treat that extra reinforcement may be enough but give her some time to catch on to it and change that habit because she has a bad habit and is a baby dog besides don't let her lay on the grass just keep circling her with the leash until she does something do that in a certain area of the yard so she will relate potty to going outside in that part of the yard take her out for play time in other parts play times are like reward times it's a lot of work but she will get it with your consistency and you sure sound dedicated to getting her trained when she has an accident inside take her out immediately and if it is number two take that out with her and place it in the area where you want her to go then tell her to go potty and circle her with the leash and even if she just squats like she is peeing but doesn't actually do anything tell her good girl and bring her inside clean the area where she has the accidents thoroughly the best combo i have found which gets rid of odor very effectively is warm water and distilled vinegar mixture pour over area where soiling occured if pee from the center of the circle until it extends just slightly beyond let it sit about five minutes then tamp up with rags or paper towels beyond the visible circle then spray liberally with resolve tough stain carpet cleaner and scrub that into the carpet with an old toothbrush or floor brush let it sit a few minutes and then tamp up the liquid as before once it dries there should be no odor whatsoever since you are using a crate and not over using it do not put water in it or any bedding whatsever not even a towel or a pee pad make sure the crate is not too big so she relieves herself in a corner that she can get away from really accentuate the rewards for when she goes where she should Housebreaking Obedience training Fecal incontinence Hamster Toilet humour Dog Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Crate training RuneScape quests Fancy rat Japanese toilet Pump It Up Menstrual cup Mattress Guinea pig New York Giants Kasparov versus The World Upholstery Cat Ron and Fez Fire fighting Professional wrestling match types Urinary incontinence Combine (Half-Life 2) Poker jargon Dry cleaning Toilet Comanche Textile manufacturing Volleyball Sento Dog agility Domestic rabbit Cleveland Browns Professional wrestling holds Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Tea 2000 Australian Grand Prix Genericized trademark Glossary of American football Equine conformation Wildfire Jackass: The Movie Landmarks of Hoboken, New Jersey Pet skunk Drowning Japanese tea ceremony Breastfeeding Toilet training Mixed martial arts Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Massage 1957 World Series First aid Snooker Tofu Unreal Opportunity rover Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Milton H.
