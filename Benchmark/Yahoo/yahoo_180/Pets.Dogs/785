should i call spca about my neighbors pup my neighbor recently just got a puppy i found out because i heard it yapping outside a few times from my balcony at first i thought this alright but recently it's getting worse the puppy is perhaps or weeks old and is a labrador obviously a pup of that size shouldn't be left outside should it the owners let the pup in sometimes but most of the time it's outside in all kinds of conditions i've been thinking about running over there and getting the pup over so i can raise it should i call spca and complain puppies should be with their mother until they are or weeks old but you might be wrong about the age why not go round to their place and say you've heard they have a new puppy and since you love sweet little puppsie wuppsies you get the picture could you just come in and pet it for a minute take a cute child with you if you have one available act all wussy and they won't say no unless you're a hairy guy with tattooes of course lol or unless they have something to hide in which case i'd assume straightaway that they are neglecting the puppy assuming they let you in to see it you can then ask all kinds of questions like how old where did it come from and so on and you will be able to assess the situation under cover of admiring the puppy take it from there if you still believe the puppy is neglected then definitely contact the animal authorities in your area good luck ps i wouldn't just steal it because it might be microchipped and if you're caught you are in really big trouble people on here shouldn't be encouraging you to do it they're not the ones who will end up with a criminal record Dog Dog training Garfield Guinea pig Humphrey Bogart Our Gang Housebreaking Labrador Retriever Shark Microchip implant (animal) Kodocha Fair use Friends Maison Ikkoku Ron and Fez Adoption Neighbours Social rule Socialization Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Theory of conduct Avenue Q 101 Dalmatians: The Series Golden Retriever Theodicy Nerpa User Friendly Blooper Pedophilia Situation comedy The Ashlee Simpson Show Care Bears W.
