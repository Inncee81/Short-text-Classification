dog growls and bites at one of her puppies the male one our chihuahua had a litter of pups females male about weeks ago this is her second litter and just yesterday she started displaying weird behavior towards the male puppy at random times it seems like she just spazzes out and will growl and start biting the puppy very ferociously to the point of making him cry i haven't been able to observe before it happens to maybe understand if she's doing it because he tries to leave the nest to discipline him or maybe she just doesn't want him any input is greatly appreciated thanks momma dogs will exert dominance over their puppies and teach them lessons on manners lol there are two possibilities here discipline something is genetically wrong with the puppy if she breaks his skin then step in if not then she's just being a momma if she won't let him eat or otherwise not take care of him then it looks like you've got some looooong days and nights of feeding a puppy from a bottle Dog training Housebreaking Hamster Guinea pig Cat Kakapo Dog show Skinny Puppy Gray Wolf Dog breed Sick Puppy Fancy rat Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Randomness Domestic rabbit Dog breeding Mixed-breed dog Labrador Retriever Pet skunk Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Animal communication House Mouse Crate training Red Squirrel Golden Retriever Socialization Dobermann The Legend of Zelda series enemies Breastfeeding Docking Basset Hound Mountain Gorilla Tasmanian Devil Taikyoku shogi Kodocha Sea Otter The dozens Equilibrium (2002 film) Zoophilia Philosophy of language Ork (Warhammer 40,000) Kim Possible Invader Zim Beethoven (film) Puppy mill Human Genetic algorithm The Realm of the Elderlings/Characters Platypus "Weird Al" Yankovic Chihuahua (dog) Piccolo Junior Saga Tarantula Minor Harry Potter Beasts Rabies Leatherback Sea Turtle First aid Stitch (Lilo & Stitch) Havanese Traumatic incident reduction Brian Griffin Social rule Domestication Kangaroo Monogamy Digital circuit Ant Hey Jude Nintendogs Quicksort Anthropology Liger James Dobson Eddie Guerrero Ecology Pok__mon Live!
