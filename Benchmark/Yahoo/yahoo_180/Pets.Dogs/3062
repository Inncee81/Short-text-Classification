honking chihuahua i'm fostering an older male chihuahua for a rescue they believe he was dumped just after th of july he's been to the vet he's fixed he's had his teeth removed due to massive rotting for the first weeks he was great but now he's coughing or honking a lot especially at night many times he honks like a seal several times and then kinda gags at the end i'm worried he acts fine otherwise eats goes for walks is alert and playful does anyone have any ideas i was told that chihuahuas and other toy breeds sometimes do this i would apprieciate any input thanks in advance and have a relaxing evening first of all good for you for fostering we used to do that until we failed miserably and adopted them anyway you should get it checked out at your vet to rule anything serious out however one of my chi's has learned to do that on purpose he does it only when he wants attention and he stops immediately once you pay attention to him they are smart little devils as someone else mentioned it is probably a collapsing trachea which is extremely common in small breeds it is nothing serious this may sound silly but try blowing into his nose that is what our vet told us before we realized we were being fooled it could also be kennel cough it is rare to get it when dogs aren't kenneled but it is possible he got it just from a walk again not typically a big deal just keep an eye on him and make sure you don't start to see green discharge Dog Shaggy dog story Drowning Chihuahua (dog) Pet skunk Three Stooges Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Obedience training Toy dog Kodocha Dog training Border Collie American Kennel Club Docking Nintendogs Poker jargon Hamster Rocko's Modern Life Domestic rabbit Betting (poker) Sin City Humphrey Bogart The Shining (film) Clown Invader Zim Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Ferret Marilyn Monroe Social rule Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Fancy rat Eddie Guerrero Equine conformation Treehouse of Horror V Pekingese Paragliding Iditarod Bart Sells His Soul Great Dane Dead Like Me Dog show Working dog Game show Randomness Traumatic incident reduction The Ashlee Simpson Show Housebreaking Little Britain The Critic Common cold American Eskimo Dog Advance fee fraud Doug Trailer Park Boys Jack Russell Terrier Extreme Programming Pug Characters in Bleach series Baroque chess Golden Retriever Killian documents The Fairly OddParents Thermal power station The Den (television) Tai Chi Chuan Havanese Dog breed Guinea pig Cat Tasmanian Devil The Amber Spyglass American football Russian joke Artificial selection Poodle Toy Story 2 American Pit Bull Terrier Late Night with Conan O'Brien Boston Terrier Piccolo Junior Saga Urinary incontinence The Star Wars Holiday Special George W.
