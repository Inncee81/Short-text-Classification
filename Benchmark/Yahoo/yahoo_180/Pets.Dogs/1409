how can i stop my dogs aggresive behavior and take back control of my house i own a yorkie poo a yorkshire terrier poodle mix i sometimes will attack my feet when i walk near him growl at me and my family members and if he's sitting next to me and i move my arm foot body etc he will snap and attack me others say that we need to take control of our house but i'm unsure how i need help i'm afraid that we might have to put him down be sure your vet has ruled out any medical problems that might be causing your dog to act agressively sometimes something as simple as a rotten tooth can make even the most placid dog fly off the handle so get a checkup at the vet if you haven't already lately if you free feed your dog food is out all day stop feed your dog twice per day morning and evening before the dog eats he must sit and wait for your to put the bowl down then you allow the dog to eat you decide when eating happens not him if your dog is pestering you for attention ignore him ask him to sit and then pet him talk gently to him and praise him for sitting and listening your choice not his if your dog is trying to get you to play ask for a sit first no sit no play ignore wait minutes and give no eye contact no words nothing then try again when you get the sit play and be enthusiastic praising and affectionate your message got through if your dog wants to go outside get a sit before you put on the leash sit before you exit the house no sit no outside be patient and wait if you wait minutes and the dog won't sit take off the collar and ignore try again in minutes or so when you get a sit no matter how brief praise and go outside the point i'm trying to make is to put some structure into your dog's life dog trainers call it nothing in life is free and dogs live very happily by it it starts to build some respect into your relationship if you don't get what you want the dog can't have what he wants simple as that if all else fails leave the room and shut the door no dog wants to be alone a few time outs like this and you'll get the message across loud and clear i'm in control of this house not you doggie never in the history of dogs and humans has punishment or pain caused a dog to respect a human pain causes fear nothing more if your dog is acting out because he's fearful why in the world would you add more fear i don't have enough information to know why your dog is acting this way scenarios time of day activity levels daily routine other family members etc i don't think it matters if your dog doesn't live by standard rules you need to take a more active role and control the resources that your dog wants control the resources control the dog no hitting no yelling no pain no additional fear it's surprisingly simplistic but you have to be consistant if something is off limits today it's off limits tomorrow and forever don't change the rules halfway through it's extremely reassuring for a dog to be able to predict the consequences of his behaviour your dog is warning you that something you are doing is upsetting it watch carefully to hear what he's saying watch for movements situations and behaviours people do that make him nervous and act agressively then try to avoid these situations and set the dog up for success for example don't let the dog on the couch for a week and see what happens it's not going to kill the dog get a nice doggie bed for him instead put it out of heavy traffic areas if the dog is already on the couch don't yank him off lure him with a treat and keep him off with your voice don't manhandle a frightened dog or you are risking a bite if you need to let the dog wear a collar and a light leash in the house to help him off the couch gently and kindly please this will keep your hands and fingers safe just in case if the dog is frightened of kids take your dog's best interest at heart and protect him if he's hiding under something don't grab him to pull him out let him come out on his own if your dog is being obnoxious and is attacking someone the dog needs a time out in a safe place alone this gives the dog time to cool down and has the added benefit of isolating an animal who's just acted very poorly another good reason to keep a light leash on the dog when your home take if off when you leave him alone you can escort the dog into his time out place safely you don't have to yell or scold you could just say too bad or you blew it in a neutral tone the act of being isolated from his family will get the message across if he throws a barking fit ignore him until he is quiet even a few seconds never release him when he's having a fit or you will teach him that temper tantrums get him freedom and off the hook and he'll scream louder every time after that after the time out keep things quiet and keep him calm for a while don't start playing a game or go for a walk just leave him be for a while when he seems calmer and able to reason ask for a sit and invite him to cuddle don't stay angry at your guy he just doesn't know the rules show him what you want consistantly kindly and firmly and you'll be amazed at what a nice dog you have there Theory of conduct Similarities
