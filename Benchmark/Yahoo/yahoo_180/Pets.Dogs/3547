a dog that doesn't bark much except for a basenji please don't just respond by saying thats impossible we live in an apartment complex and we would be fined dollars if we had an insane barker i do not want a basenji i can't tell you any specific breed but i would suggest a quiet natured dog one that is calm not scared of everything but calm you can tell the difference between one that is rowdy and wants to play vs one that wants to be loved and cuddled with yes the cuddly ones are still gonna bark of course they all bark alot has to do with training also you are going to have to train your dog pup that its not ok to bark for example when the door bell rings or someone knocks my suggestion would be pick your favorite breed one you will be happy with owning not a specific breed just because they are known for barking pick your favorite and find a well natured quiet one pup or dog if you are picking one yourself from a pound of shelter look for one that loves you and is sittin quietly not jumping and barking at you already before you even walk up to the kennel if you are gettin one from a breeder ask them what the pup is like and what the parents temperments are like visit the pup and be sure to ask plenty of questions to the owner breeder this is what i would do for myself if i were in your situation good luck Dog Golden Retriever American Pit Bull Terrier Dog show Obedience training Mixed-breed dog Basenji Shaggy dog story Gray Wolf Australian Cattle Dog Pit bull Whippet Breed registry Carl Barks Basset Hound Horse Autism Keeshond Domestic rabbit Humphrey Bogart Labrador Retriever Pekingese Maison Ikkoku Dog breeding German Shepherd Dog Guinea pig Coyote Cat Pet skunk Species Docking The Fairly OddParents Dachshund Social rule Reservoir Dogs Boston Terrier Alaskan husky Scooby-Doo Australian Shepherd Nintendogs Border Collie Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Midnight Sun Shetland Sheepdog American Kennel Club Weimaraner Working dog Futurama (TV series - season 5) Housebreaking Greyhound Beagle Jack Russell Terrier American Cocker Spaniel The Price Is Right Akita Inu American Black Bear Great Teacher Onizuka Back to the Future timeline Hamster Little Britain Jennifer Lopez Rent (musical) Selective breeding Dog breed Staffordshire Bull Terrier Puppy mill Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Piccolo Junior Saga Taikyoku shogi Great Dane Belgian Shepherd Dog Havanese Border Terrier Dobermann Alaskan Malamute Smooth Collie Game show The Inside Combine (Half-Life 2) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Philip J.
