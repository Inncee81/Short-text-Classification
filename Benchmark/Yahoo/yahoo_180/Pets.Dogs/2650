dental cleaning for basset hound i have been procrastinating on this for two years and my vet has told me that the benefits outweigh the risks i'm just so nervous b c i've heard the horror stories she has been under anesthesia before just not for a few years she is and has addison's disease that is under control ok this is how we approach dentals so maybe you can ask your vet about some of these things first we run labwork to make sure the dog doesn't have any other underlying problems that need to be addressed first then all patients receive an iv catheter safe short acting anesthesia to induce we use propoflo are intubated and maintained on isoflurane gas anesthesia heart rate temperature and o levels are monitored as is blood pressure they receive warm iv fluids throughout the procedure to maintain hydration and blood pressure they are on a heating mat to maintain normal body temperature the teeth examind by the veterinarian and cleaned by a certified veterinary technician they are cleaned polished very important step and sealed the pet is then monitored and placed in a warm cage with blankets and extubated when ready no pet is just placed in a cage and left unattended until fully awake and comfortable afterward we call the owner and let them know how the pet is doing set up a pick up time and when they come back we go over detailed homecare instructions and any medications the next day we follow up with a phone call to make sure the pet is doing well we just really do everything we can to be safe and to minimize risk you must understand that no anesthetic procedure is completely without risk but complications are very rare for us dental disease is not just bad breath it serves as a source of infection and pain in the animal hope this helps Local anesthesia Anesthesia Dialysis Prostate cancer First aid Asthma Traumatic brain injury Epidural Guinea pig Urinary incontinence Diabetes mellitus Multiple sclerosis Cancer Intravenous therapy Animal testing Lethal injection Cat Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Chronic fatigue syndrome Fancy rat Stroke Decompression sickness General anaesthesia Drowning Childbirth Pneumonia Medicine Emergency Medical Services Dentistry Tooth enamel Pet skunk Domestic rabbit Breastfeeding Obstetrics Acute respiratory distress syndrome Shock Certified Nursing Assistant Coeliac disease Bone marrow transplant Abortion Dog Liquid breathing Blood pressure Chlorpromazine Malignant melanoma Veterinarian Psychosis Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Methamphetamine Brachial plexus Hypoglycemia Mesothelioma Nitrous oxide Hypertension Crohn's disease Vitamin C Myocardial infarction Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Medical analysis of circumcision Coronary catheterization Foodborne illness Stem cell Diabetic retinopathy Blood transfusion Psoriasis Acupuncture Carburetor Dental caries Cytomegalovirus Growth hormone treatment Atrial fibrillation Lung cancer Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Aortic dissection Angioplasty Intubation Nuclear power Electroconvulsive therapy Rabies Atherosclerosis Kidney Safe sex Tobacco smoking Jet engine Chiropractic Hamster Turner syndrome Paget's disease of bone Hyperbaric oxygen therapy Anorexia nervosa Atrial septal defect Ferret Colorectal cancer
