getting a dog i already have a year old staff cross female im thinking about getting another dog but from a rehoming centre does anyone else have experiance of rehoming a dog im not sure weather to get a male or a female as my dog can be quite dominant and i dont if i should get the same type of breed any advice on diffrent breeds or adopted dogs would be great thanks good for you for wanting to rescue a dog i have worked in rescue for many years and i have quite a few tips for you first of all the breed you choose is not really and issue so don't worry about that if your current dog is a female i suggest either a male or a very submissive female females will fight almost worse than males however a dominant and very submissive female will usually do fine when introducing the two dogs introduce them on neutral ground not at your property or your dog will feel the need to defend the territory from the new guy if they get along on neutral ground then take the new guy home but put him in a crate where your current dog can see and sniff him but she won't feel threatened and he will not challenge her in any way if she shows any aggression at all correct it immediately by telling her no and placing yourself inbetween her and the new dog leave him in the crate for an hour or two and if that goes well then let them have a little freedom together but do not leave them unsupervised until you know they are fine together introducing a new dog to a dominant dog can be tricky but it can be done so just be patient and don't rush them into being best friends and don't be surprised if you have to keep them separated for awhile good luck Dog Housebreaking Dog show Shaggy dog story Golden Retriever Dog agility Gray Wolf Dog training RuneScape quests The Critic Rescue group Fox hunting Iditarod German Shepherd Dog Reservoir Dogs Dog breed Prisoner's dilemma Continuation War Tenshinhan American Pit Bull Terrier Battle of France Kakapo Mixed martial arts Karen Horney History of SNL:1980-1985 Cat Humphrey Bogart The Death Gate Cycle Infantilism The Contender (television series) The Amazing Race Transsexuality Platypus Same-sex marriage in Canada God Emperor of Dune Theory of conduct Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Yom Kippur War Working dog Knots Landing Kira Yamato Democratic Party (United States) Good Morning, Vietnam Companion dog Sicilian Expedition Obedience training BDSM Avenue Q Philosophy of language Fianna F__il First Battle of the Atlantic Schutzhund Ruy Lopez Professional wrestling match types Social rule Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Jack Russell Terrier Great Dane Team Fortress Classic Canadian Senate Korea Jindo Dog Firefighter Time Crisis 3 Pittsburgh Steelers Battle of the Bulge Eastern Question Manual transmission Battles of Lexington and Concord Pack (canine) Milton H.
