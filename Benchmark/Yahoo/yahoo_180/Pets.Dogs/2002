what should i do if my puppy ate an oreo she's a month old chihuahua i just recently got my month old puppy out of the animal hospital because she ate something that upset her stomach and caused her intestines to become inflamed she spent four days in there and i'm still having to give her meds chicken skins and chocolate are the two main things that can cause this to happen in puppies she may be fine it really depends on the dog whether this will affect her or not but here is what you do make sure she gets lots of water do not give her dog food tonight if you must feed her give her a small helping of boiled boneless skinless chicken breast meat and or boiled rice this is a very mild meal and will be easy on her stomach watch her tonight and tomorrow closely if she starts to vomit or her bowels change at all then she needs to go to the vet immediately all vets have an emergency call back even if they don't list one my vet did tell me though when it happened to my puppy that if she is only vomiting and the bowels have not changed then give her of a teaspoon of pepto bismol and don't give her any food or water the rest of the night if she vomits that up then take her to the vet immediately you have to be careful if she does vomit or her bowels loosen but they can dehydrate quickly and this can kill her good luck i hope that she has no reaction to this at all and that is possible just be more careful from now on also be sure that she never gets a hold of anything that contains artificial sweeteners because this can cause liver failure in pets oh and btw my vet told me to never give her rawhides because they will chew pieces of them off and choke on them just wanted to add that little bit of helpful advice i hope you will be very happy with your puppy dogs are wonderful pets Stomach cancer Fecal incontinence Dog Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Fancy rat MRE Chicken Diarrhea Housebreaking Dog training Chocolate Vomiting Guinea pig Coeliac disease Rabies Cuisine of Denmark Hamster Irritable bowel syndrome Japanese cuisine Adjustable gastric band Ferret Domestic rabbit Garfield Pneumonia Colorectal cancer Cat Gastroparesis First aid The Ashlee Simpson Show Food Cuisine of the Southern United States Foodborne illness Korean cuisine Cuisine of the Philippines Comanche Egg (food) American Chinese cuisine Customs and etiquette of Japan Cantonese cuisine Breakfast Animal testing 613 mitzvot Botulism Dehydration Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an RuneScape quests Dumpling Nutrition Sulfasalazine Raw food diet Kosher foods Glycogen storage disease type I Taboo food and drink Escherichia coli O157:H7 Livestock Pet skunk Ramen Charles Darwin's illness Jewish cuisine Fried chicken Kodocha Trichinosis Cuisine of Brazil Folic acid Psoriasis Fasting Insulin Socialization Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Spidey Super Stories Skinny Puppy Hot dog Fugu Roman eating and drinking Hyperthermia Small intestine Rice pudding Russian cuisine Anorexia nervosa Pitaten Offal Treehouse of Horror V Constipation Social rule Ulcerative colitis Aspartame Chicken soup Coffee Agriculture Diabetes mellitus Tooth Haggis
