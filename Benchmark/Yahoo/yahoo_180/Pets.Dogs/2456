doggie paw problems roxie is a golden retriever she has recently begun licking and bitting at her paw she is also limping my parents have recently moved and she is in a new place she is an outside dog we thought it may be the stress of being in a new location or she stepped on something or stung by a bee what do you think like previous posts check her paw thoroughly to make sure there is nothing there you may even want to clip back some of the hair on her paw if it's very long so you can get a better look my dog sometimes sprains one of her front legs and she usually gets over it the next day so if it persists take her to a vet to get it looked at another thing with my dog is she's obsessive sometimes she will keep biting the same spot over and over so that she pulls her hair out and is bleeding this happens in some dogs and we put ointment and an e collar on her but if your dog continues to limp it could be more than just a sprain there's another weird story that i've heard of that this one dog would limp the vet checked her out and she had no problems but she would just keep limping i'm sure you're dog isn't like this one tho just something interesting i saw on tv Dog Late Night with Conan O'Brien Limp Bizkit Dog training Equine conformation Shaggy dog story Garfield Iditarod Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Kodocha Professional wrestling holds A Day in the Life Portuguese Water Dog Guinea pig Poker jargon Snoop Dogg Kim Possible Professional wrestling match types Trapping Futurama (TV series - season 5) Jersey Devil Dilbert Cat Housebreaking Labrador Retriever Vampire Gray Wolf Philip J.
