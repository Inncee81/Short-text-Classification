are shelties generally good with cats i'm trying to find out as much as i can about shelties as they are a breed of dog that appeals to me i understand that they can be quite vocal but the shelties i have previously worked with have not been as vocal as i would have expected i volunteer at a veterinary clinic where we have lots of sheltie patients my one concern is that i have young cats if i do choose to get a sheltie they would be about one and a half years old at the time they don't seem to be adverse to dogs so i am not overly concerned about them and i would also take the nessicary precautions to introducing canine to feline i would like to know if shelties are generally good with cats as this will be one of the deciding factors thanks in advance i have a sheltie and a cat both females my sheltie was very vocal when i got her at the time i had an older dog who couldn't stand it she made air chomps to the sheltie and it stopped now my older dog has passed on and every now and then she gets a little mouthy but they're so easy to train i just have to look at her for her to stop my sheltie and my cat get along so well it is amazing every morning my cat grooms the dog she licks her eyes and her mouth and pretty much all of her head and the dog seems to like it my vet and my dog trainer were the ones who suggested that i get a sheltie and i'm so glad i did this is the easiest dog i've ever had Shetland Sheepdog Cat Obedience training Shaggy dog story Veterinarian Dog Dog training Horse Ferret Tobacco smoking Garfield Dog agility Domestic rabbit German Shepherd Dog Randomness Schutzhund Guide dog Fancy rat Milton H.
