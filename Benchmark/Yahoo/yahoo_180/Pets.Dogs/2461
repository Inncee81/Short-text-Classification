i have a yr old pomeranian she's from a puppy mill will she ever stop submissive wetting how when help i rescued this very loving very shy dog from death after years of having babies she is so submissive that she pees every time she approaches or is approached is there any way to help her stop she also becomes spastic when i put a leash on her what do i do because the fear urination is emotionally based and your dog has basically been abused for years it's going to be almost impossible to completely stop it you can help her though by taking her outside extra times during the day to empty her bladder especially if you know you're going to have company when she meets people with an empty bladder and therefore has no pee to pee her body and brain will begin to associate contact with people with dryness she may then be able to overcome her fear urination or at least limit it somewhat part of her problem too may be that her muscles aren't strong enough to stop her stream walking her each day and making sure she's properly exercised will help to tighten those muscles along with her other ones the spastic behavior on a leash comes from the fact that she'd been in a box for years and was never taught how to behave on a leash she can still learn but you have to be patient with her take her outside a couple of times during the day on her leash when she starts her spastic thing stop walking and wait for her to calm down don't scold her for being afraid and don't try to drag her around you'll just reinforce her fear the minute she stops her spastic thing give her lots of praise and start walking again stop when she freaks out walk and praise her when she's calm she'll eventually learn that the leash is good thing keep these initial trips very short about minuets until she's more comfortable with the leash this is going to take a lot of patience and consistency on your part don't try to rush the dog go at her pace and thank you for rescuing a dog from a puppy mill Dog training Urinary incontinence Housebreaking Obedience training Dog Diazepam Urination Milton H.
