how do i start training my dog i want to make my dog follow me with out a leash how do i i thought my dog was ready for me to take off its leash because when i walk my dog with the leash it i never have to pull my dog or my dog pull me my friends dog can walk with out a leash but mine can't when ever i let it go free i go nutz it run around and of my friends were all trying to catch it so i though of a plan we run the oppisite way my dog is running so it can chase me then when its near i try to catch it but i dont even chase me lol but at the beach it goes around craxy too but it willl comme back when i call it but at home when i call it it won't come back my dog already know how to sit and stay but when i head for the door it runs and wants be to carry it because it knows im leaving and heel is it the same a sit you know you and your friends are on the right track as far as letting the dog chase you i'm sure you've seen the hilarious to you not to them attempts of dog owners trying to catch their dogs they don't seem to get that their dog will always be faster than they are so running away is perfect that gets the dog interested in catching you especially when you reward that behavior with treats food playing tug etc the trick to successful dog training is finding out what's reinforcing to the dog my list for my dog looks like this salmon jerky treats playing tug with rabbit fur playing with soft frisbee boiled chicken butt skritch in order of preference your dog's will not be the same but it shouldn't be hard to figure out the treats your dog gets for coming when called should really blow his mind chicken cheese steak and so on not huge amounts little pieces that you've already cut up are fine remember too that dogs don't speak english you can shout sit sit sit all day to your poor pup and he won't get it here's a link to a training technique called shaping http www clickersolutions com articles index htm shaping take some time to read the articles that interest you there's also info on that site about loose leash walking last thing when your dog isn't doing what you ask the reasons why he's not successful are very simple environment too distracting reward not good enough you are not marking the behavior and then rewarding quickly enough the dog is confused about what you're asking him to do so when your dog runs amok note to self aha i shouldn't let fido loose here he has no recall and i haven't spent enough time working on the behavior in a more boring place set your dog up for success good luck Obedience training Aerial (dance move) Dog agility Dog English grammar Kitesurfing RuneScape quests Shaggy dog story Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Falconry The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Garfield Tenshinhan Theory of conduct Domestic rabbit Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Volleyball Hamster RuneScape skills The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie The Shining (film) Taikyoku shogi Time Out of Mind Gray Wolf The Apprentice 2 The Death Gate Cycle Fancy rat Milton H.
