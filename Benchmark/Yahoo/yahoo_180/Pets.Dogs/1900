what to look out for when buying a new puppy hi im looking at some border collies puppies this weekend what should i look out for when checking them out anyone own one what should i pay special attention too cheers obviously its a pedigree and from a respected breeder i meant what to look out for any thing important first of all when you get to the place take a really good look around it should be clean and not smell then look at the puppies the shy ones could grow up to be nippy and nervous when older the bolder ones could become more bouncy and uncontrollable it really depends what you want the dog for if it is going to be a family pet then choose a middle of the road pup who runs up to you licks you but it still quite gentle remember you are new to them so they will be very excited if one pup has a dull coat and it not interested in you at all then it is more than likely not a healthy pup check for a pot belly that could indicate worms but could also indicate good feeding and one of the most important things go with your instinct it can bring you a lovely puppy a dog or bitch is a personal choice sorry it's really annoying when i write the word for female dog yahoo automatically turns it into stars Dog Dog training Mixed-breed dog Labrador Retriever Golden Retriever Guinea pig Beethoven (film) Hamster Care Bears Dog show Border Terrier Irish Wolfhound Social rule Domestic rabbit Basset Hound Havanese Housebreaking Dog breeding Dog agility Pet skunk Poker jargon Docking Shetland Sheepdog Whippet Fancy rat Breed registry Puppy mill Great Dane German Shepherd Dog Socialization Domestication Dobermann Our Gang Scooby-Doo Smooth Collie Australian Cattle Dog American Kennel Club Toilet Hip dysplasia Kim Possible Finnish Spitz Garfield Betting (poker) Best of Breed Humphrey Bogart Shaggy dog story Staffordshire Bull Terrier Horse Siberian Husky Skinny Puppy English Springer Spaniel 101 Dalmatians: The Series Internet troll One Tree Hill (TV series) American Eskimo Dog Mickey Mouse The Shining (film) Livestock Gerald Durrell 1957 World Series Jam (TV series) Alaskan husky Rugrats Shit German Shorthaired Pointer Nerpa English Cocker Spaniel Bull Terrier The Cat in the Hat Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Love Felis sapiens Bulk vending Rottweiler Wheel of Fortune Eric Cartman American Pit Bull Terrier The Price Is Right Winx Club Taikyoku shogi Dog breed American Cocker Spaniel Rammstein Buffer overflow Discus (fish) Goodness and value theory Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier Keeshond Characters in the Smurfs The Smoking Room Azumanga Daioh Stomach cancer Monster Rancher monsters Equilibrium (2002 film) Bitch Nintendogs
