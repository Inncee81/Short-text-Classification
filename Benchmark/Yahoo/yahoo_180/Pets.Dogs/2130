do dogs have a fear of lightning our dog has recently developed a pretty large fear of lightning i don't know whether or not it's the loud cracking of it the flashing lights or just the ambiance that it provides nevertheless whenever it storms it cowers either becoming very close to me or hiding under the sofa bed etc can anyone explain this my dog too use to have a fear of storms too sometimes he would just shake if you held him and he always wants to be as close to me as possible if no one is around he finds the smallest spot he can and crawls into it a lot of animals are scared of storms i think it could be all three bright light thunder and the feeling of it my dog i found out was mostly scared of thunder but i then bought a cd with the sound of storms on it and i just kept playing it over and over even on the sunniest of days now he just gets scared if it is a really bad one but i think animals in general can feel the electricity in the air when a storm is approaching my horse hates storms and about an hour before the storm arrives he gets really nervous prancing snorting and always wants to get into the barn so i see no reason why it isn't the same for dogs i also know that some animals don't like bright lights either i think his behavior has to do with the dog's natural instinct he probably sticks close to you because she sees you as the alpha dog and looks to you for protection he will also try to find a tight area because this kind of acts like a den most animals try to find their greatest protection against storms just like us and some are just scared of it just like us hope this helps i also take these opportunities to bond with the dog such as petting and grooming Lightning Milton H.
