puppy potty training i recently bought a jack russel terrier pup for my girlfriend she's a wonderful pet except she seems to like to use the bathroom everywhere they she isn't supposed to sometimes when i take her outside she just lays down in the sun and when we come inside she takes a dump on my carpet i purchased potty pads and have used them in various ways both in her crate and over places where she has urinated or pooped as of today she's getting into the habit of ripping up the potty pads like it's a newspaper frankly i'm getting irritated but i know there has to be a way to overcome this any advice in my opinion pads are a mistake the use of them just teaches the dog to go indoors the first thing to remember about house training a puppy is there ability to hold themselves is limited a rule of thumb is they can hold it usually hour for each month of age months old hours months old hours etc when your puppy wakes up morning nap whatever the pup has to go right then take the pup out when the pup eats or drinks it has to go take the pup out after exercise play take the pup out when the pup does it's thing outside praise it a lot tell the pup how good how smart it is you have to pay attention to the pups looking for it's spot behavior when you see that behavior indoors whisk the pup out if you catch the pup in the act simply tell it no and whisk it outside if you find a puddle or pile after the fact clean it up with an enzyme cleaner pet food store get a newspaper and hit yourself in the head and say i should have been paying more attention daytime training they get pretty fast night time training is easier if you crate train the pup also remember the one hour one month rule you will have to get up through the night to take the pup out good luck Housebreaking Dog training Hamster Dog Urinary incontinence Crate training Gray Wolf Socialization Poker jargon Garfield Domestic rabbit Sin City Scooby-Doo Cat Social rule American Pit Bull Terrier Japanese tea ceremony Volleyball Neighbours Beethoven (film) Our Gang The Fairly OddParents Avenue Q Pet skunk Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Toilet Elvis Presley Ben Johnson (athlete) Ron and Fez Hypoglycemia Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Aladdin (1992 film) The Inside Animal Crossing Alexander Technique Fast bowling Dilbert Nintendogs Nerpa Procrastination Pitaten Illegal drug trade Pete the Pup Mattress Tag Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind USS Wasp (CV-18) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Earless seal Ultimate (sport) EastEnders Surveillance Nicomachean Ethics Kodocha Jack Russell Terrier Shark Blackjack Ron Weasley Piccolo Junior Saga Breastfeeding Sears Holdings Corporation Magic (illusion) Microeconomics Coyote Narcolepsy Futurama (TV series - season 2) Futurama (TV series - season 5) Beavis and Butt-head Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Humphrey Bogart Skinny Dip Golden Retriever Cheating in poker Neopets Calvin and Hobbes Fox hunting Make money fast The Body (Short Story) Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Characters in the Smurfs Boston Terrier In-N-Out Burger The Sims
