my dog started heat today but no blood is comming out so i noticed my dog started her second heat today because there was a little blood near her vulvu so i put her diaper on her with the pad so then i checked it right now and the pad is still clean with no blood and i know she started today because i cleaned her wit a wet paper towel and there was blood in it i know it came from her vulva whats happening here compared to when she had her first heat the blood was dripping alot its normal is there a way she is licking herself she may be nudging the pad over and licking herself clean after the first time females are very aware of what is going on and out to keep themselves clean i dont think you have anything to worry about you could probably even take the pad off during the day if you wanted at night i'd leave it on though or if you were to be gone for a period of time Dialysis Diaper Upholstery Menstrual cup Urinary incontinence Sanitary towel Menstrual cycle Hazing Japanese toilet Teen Girl Squad Milton H.
