do you think deaf puppies should be put to sleep i mean dogs that are born deaf not ones that get old and go deaf later sheisfunky you wanted to know what made me ask this question this is why i met a dalmatian breeder she said deaf puppies are often startled and frightened more easily and often than ones that can hear because of this they do not make good pets for of people and they are not good for breeding in the wrong hands a deaf puppy can get so nervous that it becomes very aggressive and has a higher tendency to bite than normal dog she said with all the over breeding of dalmatians there were a lot of deaf puppies that were born unsuspecting people bought them and the dogs became mean and bit and the owners could not handle them now dalmatians have a bad rap for being mean dogs that is what the breeder told me that is not my opinion so don't yell at me please a lot of dalmatian breeders practice culling they will put to sleep any puppies that are deaf because they believe they won't make good pets the truth is deaf pets are a lot of work they aren't appropriate around smaller children because it's too easy to startle a deaf puppy you've got to make a bigger effort to train a deaf puppy because obviously the standard methods won't work deaf dogs have a bad reputation because the owners were not aware that a lot of time and training needs to go into making a deaf dog a good family pet basically they aren't for everyone the reason some dogs tend to be born deaf is simply bad breeding the gene that makes some dogs have white in the coat merle is the same gene that causes deafness and blindness breed two merles together and you wind up with deaf and or blind puppies i really can't compare a deaf child to a deaf puppy quit anthropomorphizing your pets they aren't human and they never will be which do you think is better for a damatian breeder to do some dalmatians are unfortunately born deaf no matter how good the breeder sell the poor deaf puppy to someone who has no clue how to take care of him her or humanely put the puppy to sleep it's a hard choice and i can't say i'd be able to do it but i can see why Dog training Shetland Sheepdog Labrador Retriever Havanese Ferret Dalmatian Cat German Shepherd Dog Mixed-breed dog Great Dane Puppy mill Housebreaking Domestic rabbit Hearing impairment Border Collie Docking American Pit Bull Terrier Golden Retriever Hamster Fancy rat Alaskan husky Dobermann English Springer Spaniel Guinea pig Theory of conduct Nintendogs Social rule Staffordshire Bull Terrier Dog show Pit bull Border Terrier Basset Hound Pet store One Hundred and One Dalmatians Rottweiler Poker jargon Jack Russell Terrier Boxer (dog) Keeshond Whippet Australian Cattle Dog Theodicy Livestock Australian Shepherd Socialization Shaggy dog story Turkish Van Korea Jindo Dog Eugenics Breed standard Horse Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier Gray Wolf Skinny Puppy Monster Rancher monsters Hypnosis American Eskimo Dog Dog breeding Komondor Coat (dog) Dog breed Animal euthanasia Humphrey Bogart Weimaraner Daredevil Milton H.
