is it cruel to lock my dogs in the kitchen we live in an apartment and have small dogs we walk them a lot and they have no problem being potty trained when were home but as soon as we leave they go to the bathroom all over the house at first we felt sorry for them thinking that they couldnt hold it but then we realized that they go even if we're gone for minutes i just took a shower and came out to see puddles of pee and a pile of poop i wasnt in there for more then minutes and i walked them before im thinking about buying some baby gates and keeping them in the kitchen when im going to be gone i feel kind of bad doing that will it teach them or just upset them is it cruel if i lock them in the kitchen no it's not cruel you are giving them ample space most people use crates when they are gone they are much less likely to make a mess in a confined space that they know they will need to be in until you get home if you leave them in the kitchen they will probably still mess but at least it will be easier to clean up you might want to also get some wee pads Housebreaking Social rule Kitchen Crate training Toilet humour Pitaten The Shining (film) Humphrey Bogart Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Friends Shaggy dog story Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Philip J.
