is it normal for my month old german shepherd to bite our puppy is a very well behaved german shepherd months he is potty trained sits shakes on command fetches so i know he is listening to me very well i am home with him most of the day so i am the one working with him when my fiance gets home i show him what commands im doing he does the same the pup will listen to him also however in the past few weeks the pup has been biting my fiance a lot when he plays with him the pup isnt biting him in anger he is trying to play with him but thinks that my fiances hand is like one of his toys he tried this with me for a while but ive taught him not to do that to me im thinking it's because i am able to spend more time with the pup all i know is that he is getting bigger hes really starting to leave bleeding bite marks bruises on my fiances hands some people say he needs a butt whoopin but i dont think hitting him is gonna help but i do need some help trying other ways to make him stop biting mouthing help yes it is normal they have to be taught not to play with human body parts with their teeth you did this and that generally is enough to stop the behavior but i'm betting your fianc encouraged the behavior so now he is confused however a firm ooww ouch no hey whatever just be consistent then stopping the play session will likely make him understand an adult dog would grab a pup by the neck and pin it to the ground or even nip the snout enough to bleed but i don't recommend having your fianc mouth him lol one has to be careful not to have a dog associate anything bad with the hands or things like cleaning ears first aid and hooking a leash to a collar could become difficult Dog training Dog Gray Wolf Shark German Shepherd Dog Hamster Milton H.
