i have the most loving loyal and docile year old neutered male golden retriever however his quality of life is being diminished because he is extremely agressive with strange dogs he was fine at the dog park until he was about two at that point when the other males kept trying to mount him he got aggressive and started to pin them on their backs growl scarily and pretend to bite their neck he never has bitten and i think he is just exerting his alpha role however tonight he got out and did this to a strange dog being walked of course it scared that owner and she was very mad and said he needed to be locked up i don't know how to handle this because in all other sense there has never been any even small signs of agression he's just a big lovable golden except also i can't figure out how to deal with it because he seldom has the opportunity to exhibit this behavior he loves all kids and people and most female dogs we can no longer take him to the dog park or for that matter trust him around other dogs help i have a golden retriever and she doesn't like other dogs either of course this has happened as she's gotten older so i just contributed it to age however this is probably just your dog being cocky his dominance was questioned at the park that day when the other dog tried to mount it all you need to do is discipline him properly and let him know that his aggressive behavior isn't acceptable that's what i did with mine now she still doesn't especially like any dogs except the ones my relatives own but she refrains at least from showing physical aggression because she knows i'll scold her Dog Dog training Cat Mixed-breed dog Narcissism Hamster Theory of conduct RuneScape quests German Shepherd Dog Monster Rancher monsters Gender Golden Retriever Invader Zim Pet skunk Chesapeake Bay Retriever Code: Lyoko Kodocha Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Butters Stotch Trailer Park Boys Kim Possible Friends Philosophy of language Housebreaking Social rule Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Milton H.
