which dog s hi my family is adopting a dog now that our last dog has passed we visited a shelter today and are going back soon there are a few dogs we are interested in the first dog in a month old red bone coonhound merema sp mix he weighs pounds and is going to be very big think great dane big the other dog is a collie shepherd mix and is years old they are both very sweet the collie likes to be around people all the time because she has seperation anxiety and because we have a family of someone is always home the coonhound loves people but is a bit more independent and loves to run we have a big yard we are thinking of adopting them both but we do not know if they will get along we think the coonhound may be to agressive we have many other animals too that they need to get along with cats guenia pigs horses fish big pond and its just a tough decision help as an ex shelter employee i would say if you could swing it to take the collie mix i would do that almost anyone would be happy to adopt a mo old pup but it is rare indeed to find someone willing to take in a year old you will literally be saving his life based on personalities i would say that the collie mix might be your best bet coonhounds do tend to be a bit more independent the collie mix already has an established personality and is probably better mannered as far as training and commands good luck let us know who you go with and show us pictures Dog Coonhound Humphrey Bogart Scent hound Dobermann Care Bears Gray Wolf German Shepherd Dog Obedience training Mixed-breed dog Golden Retriever Cat Hamster Working dog Greyhound Border Collie Scooby-Doo Kodocha Dog training 2000 Australian Grand Prix Shark Garfield Guinea pig American Pit Bull Terrier Smooth Collie Animal shelter Brown Bear Animal rights Australian Shepherd Inuit The Chemical Brothers Ranma __ characters RuneScape quests Microchip implant (animal) Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Sesshomaru Ed, Edd n Eddy CatDog Charles Bukowski Iditarod Feral Pitaten Pet skunk Ren and Stimpy Dog agility Fruits Basket The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Livestock Domestic rabbit Animal Farm Alaskan Malamute Hobo Taikyoku shogi Sinfest The Smoking Room Philip J.
