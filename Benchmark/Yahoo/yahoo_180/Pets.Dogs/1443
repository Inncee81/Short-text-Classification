scared dog i took my dog to pet smart today she is perfectly calm if the store is empty she walks next to my leg and such but the minute she sees another person in the store she tries to run and hide if people come too close she kinda growls or backs away and tries to hide behind me some little kid kept trying to pet her and i thought they were gonna get bit even though i told her not to pet my dog she tries to pull me out of the store and doesn't respond to my corrections from the choke chain how do i make my dog more people friendly and not be scared crapless ps don't reccamend treats because she won't take any reward from strangers what so ever not even from me when she is scared that is a typical reaction from a dog who wasn't socialized as a puppy socialization starts at weeks old and exposes the puppy to lots of people places and things so that when they grow up they are not afraid at months it may be too late you can try taking her out more often get her to meet a lot of friendly people but you're going to have to take it slow so as not to scare her right now she is just scared to death be really patient and work with her a lot she still might have a chance to improve Dog training Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Dog Shaggy dog story Socialization Social rule Cat Urinary incontinence Tag Humphrey Bogart Time Out of Mind The Death Gate Cycle Milton H.
