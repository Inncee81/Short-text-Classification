why does my basset hound cough i have basset hounds and one is worrying my husband and i to death she has these coughing fits that last anywhere from a few seconds to a couple of minutes when she has the longer ones her eyes start rolling back in her head this is soooo scary we took her to the vet and he listened to her breathing and said she is fine she does not sound fine to us when she has these attacks we try and raise her front paws above her head like if a child were choaking it used to help but it did not help her attack last night any suggestions would be helpful we are willing to try anything for our baby she is so precious to us thanks for your help thank you to those who have answered so far i would like to add that i have not ever taken her to a kennel and she rarely goes around other dogs i dont think it could be a seizure but who knows i would take her in to have her observed but she does it so infrequently that i think it would be a waste of their time i could call the emergency vet while she is doing it however she has never had an attack that lasted more than or minutes i live out in the country and it would take atleast minutes to get to the closest bet and thats if they are open did your vet check her for heartworms please make sure he has done that not meanning to scare you but that is a classic symptom Dog Basset Hound Asthma Shaggy dog story Clarinet Heartworm Urinary incontinence Traumatic brain injury Dog agility Iditarod Guinea pig Epilepsy Betting (poker) Seizure Ferret First aid Prank flash Pertussis Hypoglycemia Cat Myocardial infarction Drowning Gray Wolf Childbirth Fox hunting Poker jargon Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Housebreaking Apollo 8 Garfield American Kennel Club Equine conformation Beagle The Archers Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Misfits Smooth Collie Angina Tag Scuba set Juliana of the Netherlands New York Giants Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Greyhound racing Cephalic disorder C__chulainn Pneumonia 1925 serum run to Nome Scent hound Pet skunk Xiangqi Triage USS Tunny (SS-282) Breech birth Jon Secada Elephant Breastfeeding Vampire Singlish Characters of Naruto Intracranial pressure Skinny Puppy Mamoru Oshii Love and Theft Blues Gambling B-47 Stratojet Professional wrestling throws Gastroesophageal reflux disease Chess terminology Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Obedience training Panic attack Spider Marching band Chlorpromazine Ravi Shastri Draw poker David Bowie Little Britain Alanis Morissette Social rule Migraine Water polo Sin City Decompression sickness Marriage Four square Gothic metal Berber languages Therion (band) Dog show Brewery Henipavirus Avenue Q Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis Blonde on Blonde
