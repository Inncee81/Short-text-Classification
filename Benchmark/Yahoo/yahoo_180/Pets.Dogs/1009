wouldn't the world be a better place if percent of you stopped breeding your dogs not another dog would have to be euthanized think about it dp no offense but that is just a flimsy excuse and why there is a pet overpopulation problem every breeder has that kind of attitude and most only breed because they can get money or something else out of the deal it is just pure selfishness to breed when so many pets have no homes breeders are obviously putting dogs in the hands of owners who cannot care for them well yes of course the world would be a better place if there were never any wars if people all got along with one another and had respect for one another but just because there are problems with humanity does not mean it is okay to let all these dogs and cat get euthanized k no offense to you personally but i am really sick of the 'standing by the dog and will take it back for any reason' justification k do you realize breeders put the dogs they take back in pet rescue that is where the dogs go into rescue it's just more dogs without homes yes the breeder thinks he or she is responsible but everytime you breed a dog and produce puppies you are making it harder for the unwanted dogs already here to find homes you are creating more lives who might not have homes in the future thus you are adding to the problem no matter what excuse you use to talk yourself out of it if everyone really loves dogs as much as they say they do wouldn't they be satisfied lavishing attention on a few beloved pets instead of insisting on having kennels that just end up adding to the pet crisis i don't agree with everything peta stands for i eat meat and i recognize that animals themselves eat meat and a bunch of what peta advocates has nothing at all to do with reality but sometimes i do agree with peta i do not have the peta mentality and i don't agree with everything peta advocates but sometimes they are correct about people exploiting animals unnecessarily for profit etc oh yes that's classic the breeders putting all the blame on the people they sell the dogs to why do you think there is an issue to begin with when will breeders realize that many people who want dogs will not keep them and take care of them if everyone was a 'good dog ownder' a breeder would need no clauses don't you see the circular nature of this it's just more excuse making with this kind of thinking pet overpopulation will be a chronic concern and just a fact of life i have only one thing tho say to that hallelujah Dog People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Animal rights German Shepherd Dog Cat Mixed-breed dog Domestic rabbit Dog training Golden Retriever Pet skunk Theory of conduct Animal euthanasia Dog breed Gray Wolf The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Friends Pet store Havanese Hamster Animal shelter Obedience training Dobermann Abortion debate American Pit Bull Terrier Dog breeding Shaggy dog story Simone Weil Dog show Docking Zoophilia Animal testing Border Collie Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Goodness and value theory Kodocha Objectivist philosophy Pet Sounds Rescue group Livestock The nature of God in Western theology Philosophy of language Ferret Overpopulation Guinea pig Intellectual property Animal Farm Kashrut Epistemology Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Housebreaking Selective breeding Altruism Cult Breed registry Rottweiler The Death Gate Cycle Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Greyhound racing Shetland Sheepdog American Kennel Club Taboo food and drink Monster Rancher monsters Nuclear power Brian Griffin Philipp Melanchthon Contract Garfield Trailer Park Boys Plant breeding Agriculture Domestic violence Knots Landing John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Pet Veganism Evil Government of India Act 1935 Meat Loaf Ranma __ characters Pitaten Alignment (role-playing games) Nintendogs Babe Ruth Australian Cattle Dog Hillary Rodham Clinton David Hume Microeconomics English Springer Spaniel Socialization
