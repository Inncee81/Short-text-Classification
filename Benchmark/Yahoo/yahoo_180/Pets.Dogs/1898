i have a staffordshire bull terrier boy years my friend has a girl staff and has asked me if i would i breed him with her i am concerned about the after effect it could have on my dog tempermant behaviour etc etc there are sooo many sbts in rescue you really shouldn't consider allowing your dog to be used to produce yet more puppies particularly if your friend hasn't got a clue what s he is doing there are also health tests which need to be carried out before breeding if it isi going to be done responsibly yes it can change your dog's temperament he may become more aggressive towards other dogs he may start lifting his leg in the house there is also the danger of the actual mating going horribly wrong if you don't know what you are doing staffies are powerful dogs if things go wrong one or both dogs could end up badly injured the handlers could also be badly bitten by stressed out dogs it's not just a matter of putting the dogs together and leaving them to it you also need to consider how you would feel about your boy's puppies ending up in rescue or in homes where they are badly treated Dog American Pit Bull Terrier Dog training Pit bull Jack Russell Terrier Skye Terrier Border Terrier Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Staffordshire Bull Terrier Boston Terrier Mixed-breed dog Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier Dog breeding German Shepherd Dog Bull Terrier Rabies Shaggy dog story Schutzhund Havanese Housebreaking Friends Terrier Puppy mill Zoophilia Great Dane Breed standard Pet skunk Working dog Little Britain Theory of conduct Docking Dog show Yorkshire Terrier Cube (film) West Highland White Terrier Social rule Nintendogs God Emperor of Dune The Amazing Race Fancy rat Breed-specific legislation One Piece minor characters Maltese (dog) Guinea pig Dog breed Rottweiler Labrador Retriever Kerry Blue Terrier The Death Gate Cycle Animal testing Jam (TV series) Fox hunting Skinny Puppy Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 American Eskimo Dog Spanking Dalmatian Police dog Domestic rabbit Milton H.
