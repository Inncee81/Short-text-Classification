german sheppard owners does your female dog pee everytime you pet her i know it sounds stupid but it is a real question all three of our sheppards have done it but not our other dogs help please it sounds as if your female is suffering from submissive urination it's not confined to one breed any dog breed can have it it's usually a sign of nervousness or timidity if all your shepherds have been related it may be a genetic tendency towards being nervous that causes it if they're not it's probably just a co incidence she's doing this because she's trying to show you that she knows you're superior and in charge she can't help it as it's a reflexive action if you get upset or mad at her she'll just do it more as she will know you're angry with her but won't know why so her answer is to be even more submissive try to ignore it and when you pet her do it calmly and quietly to keep her excitement level down if she tends to do it when she sees you after work or when you've been away all day keep your homecomings low key don't greet her excitedly and loudly as soon as you come in instead ignore her a little for a few minutes to take the edge off her excitement then pet her quietly sometimes a dog will grow out of this by herself other times you need to help her feel more confident german shepherds are very intelligent dogs perhaps an obedience class or something similar where she can work with you and learn and get praise would help her feel less nervous also make sure she gets out and has some socialization experience and plenty of exercise it keeps her from becoming a little neurotic from being home all the time and exercise helps her to relax a little above all be patient with her she's trying to please you that's all good luck Obedience training Dog German Shepherd Dog Housebreaking Cat Stuttering Urinary incontinence Shaggy dog story Mixed-breed dog Kim Possible Gray Wolf Dog agility Fancy rat Social rule Tobacco smoking Border Collie Alaskan Malamute Narcissism Australian Cattle Dog The Smoking Room Insulin Working dog Ron Weasley Chronic fatigue syndrome Australian Shepherd Internet troll Humphrey Bogart Singlish Prostate cancer The Ashlee Simpson Show Urination Dobermann Hamster Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Charles Darwin's illness Kurt Angle Karen Horney Golden Retriever Schutzhund G-Man (Half-Life) Diabetes mellitus Dilbert Free will Combat stress reaction Domestic rabbit Controversies in autism Ren and Stimpy Eugenics Rabies Drowning Shetland Sheepdog Autism Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Kodocha Extreme Championship Wrestling Anxiety Premature ejaculation Diazepam Weight training Big five personality traits Scientology beliefs and practices Psychosis Ferret The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Narcolepsy Guinea pig Dog show Socialization Asthma Lung cancer God Emperor of Dune Meditation 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Brain Lesch-Nyhan syndrome German Shorthaired Pointer Havanese Dog intelligence Little Britain Neighbours Newcastle United F.C.
