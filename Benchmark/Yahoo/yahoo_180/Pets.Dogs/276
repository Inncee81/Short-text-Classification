my dog has a westie allergy he used to be really energetic and spunky will he ever be like this again last august when my family and i went to go choose a dog i chose duke because of his spunky attitude and his energy when he came into the room he was jumping up all over us we loved him so we adopted him duke would play with us and keep us occupied all the time duke was fine until about march april he all of a sudden got really itchy he itched all of his hair off and became lazy he will not play with us at all duke sits on the couch all day and it breaks my heart seeing my first dog with an allergy my dog duke has a westie allergy on the skin we haven't yet started treating him but we will be very soon i trust that duke will grow his hair back but will he ever be his energetic and spunky self again you haven't mentioned whether you've taken duke to the vet yet please do i'm not a vet but we've had westies for over years and have battled the itch allergy problem for many of those after agonizing trial and error we found that miss molly is allergic to almost all grains e g corn soy wheat rice she can tolerate oats and barley the vast majority of dog foods and treats have one or more of these grains we now give her wellness brand fish and sweet potato food and voila no more allergies she gets dried pineapple bits for treats or pieces of her food she also gets washed with nolvassen prescription shampoo from the vet a very gentle kind of shampoo not cheap though i would guess that his lethargy is because his system is fighting the allergies so hard but a vet would know better than i our experience is that diet will resolve your problem please consider carefully if the vet recommends steroid shots they don't solve the problem long term also i read on the internet somewhere that feeding some dogs like westies constantly throughout the day puts a strain on their system and makes them more prone to allergies that turned out to be true with miss molly when we started limiting her food to meal time and perhaps a half hour after mealtime for a treat her system improved she didn't have to spend constant energy digesting food worth a try good luck will keep you both in my thoughts Coeliac disease Hay fever Food Allergy Bread Psoriasis Cereal Guinea pig Fecal incontinence Oat Cat Jewish cuisine Dog Insulin Asthma Soybean Agriculture Stomach cancer Food allergy Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Eczema Domestication Flour Fancy rat Crohn's disease Alcoholic beverage Soy milk Ferret Alcohol fuel Veganism Dietary fiber Rice Multiple chemical sensitivity Vegetarianism Breastfeeding Hamster Peanut Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Chronic fatigue syndrome Barley Dandruff Dog food Acne Potato West Highland White Terrier Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Sorghum Medical prescription Chocolate Japanese cuisine Little Britain Wheat Medicine Milk Protein Cuisine of Denmark Domestic rabbit Randomness Analgesic Shaggy dog story Cuisine of Malaysia Beer The Amber Spyglass Peruvian cuisine Bengali cuisine Starch Anorexia nervosa Ranma __ characters Weight training Prostate cancer Raw food diet Cassava Diabetes mellitus Carnivorous plant Calvin and Hobbes Folic acid Menstrual cup Cantonese cuisine Cuisine of the Philippines Miso RuneScape quests Arguments for and against drug prohibition Maize Genetically modified food Rice pudding Nut (fruit) Tofu Cuisine of Africa Common cold Green Revolution Economy of the People's Republic of China Equine conformation Conjunctivitis Hypoglycemia Breakfast
