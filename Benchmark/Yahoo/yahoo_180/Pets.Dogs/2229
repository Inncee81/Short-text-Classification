how do breeders name their puppies i have always wondered how breeders name the puppies that they breed my doberman's name not that i could ever say the whole thing like i do with the kids lol robyn isabela rose enlow we call her sage so how do they come up with these names i know that usually there are kennel names in there but where do the rest come from my dog was named after the first people to take her home we are the rd since the breeder for a total of homes in her first year of life i have been trying to track her breeder and thought that maybe she had a kennel name in there somewhere but i can't seem to find it many breeders use a litter theme or a letter so you could have the rock and roll litter or the b litter for example your dog does not have a typical show name more like a people name is enlow the breeder's name my first show dog was from the irving berlin litter his litter was born during a tv show about irving belin so i got to pick a name off of a list of song titles so my dog was kennel name moon at night cd fch sc tt not all my dogs had my kennel name on them some were already named before i got them but all of mine had their breeder's kennel names because they were show dogs my kennel is my house my show dogs live on the couch many breeders use a play on the sire or dam's name gold strike might sire gold rush gold key golden girl the reason they use several names is to make it unique akc will not allow a dog to have the same exact name as another dog i have a dog from the wind litter part of her name is mistral i have a dog from the raptor litter part of her name is falconet some names describe the dog's color or temperament or something they hope will inspire people about the dog i let my pet owners name the dogs themselves with some guidelines show puppies tend to have more rigid naming rules depending on the breeder really successful show dogs often use themes so people can easily tell littermates or relatives just by the name one of my favorite names was a borzoi named swanmanor cohwhatagooseiam call name goose sweet dog i think i got his name right but show or pet if a dog is going to be registered it has to have a unique name for it's breed as the registered name but as you already know it's call name can be whatever you want Breed registry Dog American Kennel Club Dobermann German Shepherd Dog Dog show American Pit Bull Terrier Mixed-breed dog Docking Dog breeding Havanese Dog breed Whippet Border Collie Jack Russell Terrier Belgian Shepherd Dog Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show English Springer Spaniel Shetland Sheepdog Newfoundland (dog) Hamster Toy dog Dog agility Obedience training Australian Cattle Dog Cat Pet skunk Smooth Collie Greyhound Basset Hound Chihuahua (dog) Domestic goat Nintendogs Alaskan husky Staffordshire Bull Terrier Working dog Dog training American Cocker Spaniel Catahoula Leopard Dog Schutzhund Rat Terrier Breed standard Chinook (dog) Great Dane Puppy mill Siberian Husky Borzoi Keeshond German Shorthaired Pointer Scooby-Doo Best of Breed Australian Shepherd Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Australian Kelpie Irish Wolfhound Toy Fox Terrier Billboard Hot 100 Tenterfield Terrier Poodle Miniature Fox Terrier Ferret Rottweiler Harry Nilsson Manx (cat) Dog hybrids and crossbreeds Guinea pig Selective breeding Maltese (dog) Housebreaking Redbone Coonhound Dachshund Fancy rat Greyhound racing Weimaraner Boxer (dog) Garfield English Cocker Spaniel Pet store Gray Wolf Taikyoku shogi American Eskimo Dog Cairn Terrier Pekingese Greater Swiss Mountain Dog Chinese Crested Dog Animal Farm Fox hunting Boston Terrier Alaskan Malamute Airedale Terrier Canary Beagle Pit bull
