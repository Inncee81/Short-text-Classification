i'm trying to find a specific breed of dog i fell in love with a dog i saw one time at pet smart with a family and i am trying to figure out what breed he was so that i can look into getting one or even see if he would be a good pet for me the problem is i have looked at a lot of the breeds lists and not found this particular dog he was very large i would say between feet from floor to top of back tan with no markings in other colors he had a large head with a broad flat sloping forehead most identifiable feature he didnt have facial wrinkles or jowls to suggest that he was a hound or mastiff i would appreciate any help i can get oh and he had very short hair are you thinking of a pointer or a short haired golden it might also have been a mix i would suggest asking the owners if you happen to bump into them again edit was this what the dog looked like if so that's a rhodesian ridgeback i've never seen the dog before but i checked a couple sites and that one fit your description best Dog Rhodesian Ridgeback Mastiff Cat Equine conformation German Shorthaired Pointer Shetland Sheepdog German Shepherd Dog Mixed-breed dog Griffon Bruxellois American Pit Bull Terrier Obedience training Keeshond Labrador Retriever Dobermann Basset Hound Pug Physical attractiveness Tibetan Mastiff Dog show Alaskan husky Rottweiler Fancy rat Siberian Husky Working dog Horse Border Collie KaBlam!
