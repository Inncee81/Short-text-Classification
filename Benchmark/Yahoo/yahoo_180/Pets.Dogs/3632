help on a beagle these are the questions i have some of them i'll post more later are they good with kids do they need a lot of excersise male or female which toys do they like inside or outside dogs i have room for both how often should they be walked a lot of energy how big to they tend to get yes they are good with kids however you should spend time with each dog before bringing it home to make sure it is gentle and not aggressive since every dog has a different temperament yes they need a lot of exercise just like all dogs do especially puppies or else they will become destructive however as adults beagles are quite lazy it doesn't matter if you get a male or female just make sure it gets spayed neutered toys nothing in particular it depends on the individual dog some dogs like kongs stuffed animals treat balls etc all dogs should be inside dogs no dog should be left out without human interaction that is just cruel so to answer your question they are inside dogs however they should get plenty of outside time to run around and have fun they should be walked every day if it is a pup it will need to go outside every couple of hours until it is housetrained adult dogs should go outside at least times per day a lot of energy yes they have a lot of energy as pups however they become lazy as adults in general they get to be about medium sized inches lbs ish overall i recommend that you get your beagle from a rescue or a shelter and i also recommend an adult dog while puppies are cute they are very difficult to deal with they take a lot of time and commitment just like a human baby does good luck Dog Socialization Dog training Hamster Housebreaking Care Bears Guinea pig Pet skunk Domestic rabbit Our Gang Gray Wolf Great Dane Social rule Beagle Vegeta American Pit Bull Terrier Snoopy Scooby-Doo Korea Jindo Dog Ferret American Eskimo Dog Peanuts Kitten Feral cat Animal shelter Theory of conduct Havanese West Highland White Terrier Fast bowling Whippet Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Australian Cattle Dog Greyhound Labrador Retriever Brian Griffin Komondor Animal testing Strap-on dildo Taikyoku shogi Garfield Puppy mill Nintendogs Invader Zim German Shepherd Dog Fancy rat Irish Wolfhound Internet phenomenon Russian space dogs Animal rights USS Sea Dog (SS-401) My Little Pony Humphrey Bogart Kodocha Textile manufacturing Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Toy Border Collie Sinfest Rottweiler Maison Ikkoku Younger versions of cartoon characters Weight training Hip dysplasia Beethoven (film) Toy dog The Contender (television series) Kid Buu Saga Monster Rancher monsters Toy Story 2 Elephant Livestock Zoophilia Extreme Programming Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier Belgian Shepherd Dog Dualism (philosophy of mind) Joke Rocko's Modern Life The Death Gate Cycle Animated television series Border Terrier Spider Azumanga Daioh The Price Is Right Quill (film) Little Britain The Sims The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius Energy development Pekingese Code: Lyoko Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Tibetan Terrier Microeconomics
