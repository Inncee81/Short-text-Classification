what do i feed my month puppy german shepherd i tried pedigree for puppies but she won't even touch it please help there are many dog foods on the market i personally use wilderness blend there are some better than this and a whole lot of others which are crap my best advice to you is look at the back of the bag at the ingredients the first ingredient should always be meat such as lamb chicken beef buffalo not 'by products' and especially not 'meal' i would also suggest you talk to your vet about switching your pup to large breed adult food he she is months old now and it would be best for your pup to go to large breed adult food this will help slow down the growing process somewhat if you pup grows too fast this could result in 'pano' which is growing pains and they can become temporarily lame and be in a lot of pain with gsd's you have to watch what you feed them their entire lives they are prone to hip and elbow dysplasia as well as allergies buying cheap food may help your pocket book in the short run but could have an adverse affect on your pup and many medical problems down the road something to think about Dog German Shepherd Dog Food Hip dysplasia Guinea pig Fancy rat Gray Wolf Livestock Mixed-breed dog Milk Domestication Labrador Retriever Equine conformation Chicken Breastfeeding Domestic rabbit Agriculture in Australia Factory farming Cuisine of Malaysia Vegetarianism Hamster Cat French cuisine Border Collie Cuisine of the Southern United States Veganism Domesticated turkey Coeliac disease Fast-food restaurant Basset Hound Housebreaking Peanut Taboo food and drink Great Dane Barbecue Docking 101 Dalmatians: The Series Alcoholic beverage Soybean Agriculture Dairy Fasting Healthy eating Tofu Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Cannabis (drug) Belgian Shepherd Dog Cuisine of Denmark Dog food Cuisine of Africa Growth hormone treatment Tyrannosaurus rex Insulin Shetland Sheepdog Dobermann Korean cuisine MRE Cattle Nerpa Socialization Aspartame RuneScape quests D__ner kebab Gastroesophageal reflux disease Ramen Whippet Ferret Cantonese cuisine Rapeseed British cuisine Glycogen storage disease type I Horse Stomach cancer Dog training Pizza Organic food Domestic sheep Fast food Genetically modified food Fecal incontinence Quorn Chocolate Halaal Local food Peruvian cuisine McDonald's Beef Urinary incontinence Puppy mill Cuisine of Brazil Roman eating and drinking Foodborne illness Cuisine of Thailand Garfield Beethoven (film) Trans fat
