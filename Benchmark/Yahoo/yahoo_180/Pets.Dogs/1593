i want a dog but my dad doesnt quite agree i just moved from another country with my dog poodle and i suspect that it is always best to have dogs instead of one just so they keep company to eachother know that i told myy dad that i want a sheltie he said ill think about it and untill now he did not touch the theme how can i convense him to get another dog without him getting mad you should never push getting an animal on someone who doesn't want one if you're living under his roof it's his decision and would probably be best not to pester him too much about it if he really is considering it all the more reason to give him time and not bug him about it Fictional crossover Ren and Stimpy Little Girl Lost (The Twilight Zone) Garfield Shetland Sheepdog Lisa the Vegetarian Kim Possible Fathers' rights Dog agility The Untouchables Grandview, U.S.A.
