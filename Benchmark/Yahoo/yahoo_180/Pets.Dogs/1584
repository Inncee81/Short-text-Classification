my puppy is mean help ok i have a puppy who is about weeks old and she is so mean is there anything that i can do to make her clam down everytime you walk up or down the stairs she follows and bites at your legs or pants anytime that i try to clean the house she attacks everything that i use and she plays really rough too biting and scratching plus i am tryingt o house train her but everytime that i lay down one of those mats she rips it all apart i can't keep her out of the bathroom trash and she eats all of our shoes up is there anyway that i can calm her down because in four more weeks we will be having a new baby and i dont want her hurting the baby i dont even want to have to worry about that because i want her to learn how to behave i just dont know how to teach her when she bites i tell her no in a mean voice but that just makes her worse and i have tapped her on the mouth a couple times but she thinks that i am just playing with her what can i do and is there like anything that i can give her to maybe help her calm down someone please help you need to get her into some puppy classes and later in obedience classes limit her access to the home so she can't get to stuff to destroy it try potty training her to go outside not to use potty pads start potty training over whenever the dog is in the house and not crated put a body harness and leash on the dog tie end of leash to your belt wherever you go the dog goes when you see the dog start to signal sniff circle scratch that it's got to go than run the dog out to where you want it to go praise reward immediately and use a command word consistently when the dog shows it's learned to go outside consistently by dragging you to the outside than you can undo the leash from your belt keep the leash on the dog still and keep an eye on it whenever it is in the house and not crated so if it starts to make an accident you can grab the leash and run it outside once it is going outside with no attempted accidents for at least a week than you can take the leash off the most common mistake in potty training is giving the dog freedom to roam the house without supervision where the human doesn't see the dog signal it needs to go and if your dog is a puppy remember it only has an average hold time of hour for every month of it's life until they reach months or so and can hold overnight usually small breed dogs stay puppy until about a year old and large breed dogs until and will require lots of exercise and socialization so if she's too much for you now what will you do when your baby arrives if this is too much consider re homing her with a family who has the time to train her and play with her Housebreaking Dog Obedience training Crate training Piccolo Junior Saga Aerial (dance move) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Ferret Basset Hound Horse Shetland Sheepdog Cat Dog agility Hamster Social rule Garfield Paranoia Agent Characters in the Smurfs Fox hunting Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Tenshinhan Shaggy dog story Dog show EastEnders Socialization God Emperor of Dune SpongeBob SquarePants Lady and the Tramp Diving Pet skunk RuneScape quests Kitesurfing Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Futurama (TV series - season 5) Fancy rat Beethoven (film) German Shepherd Dog Boy Scouts of America Schutzhund Skinny Puppy Brian Griffin Breastfeeding Glossary of climbing terms Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Mixed martial arts Marching band Vegeta Professional wrestling holds Richard Chase Aztec Dog collar Blood (computer game) Dog intelligence Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Equine conformation Professional wrestling match types Escape from New York Characters of Lost Havanese Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Shining (film) American Eskimo Dog 1957 World Series The Death Gate Cycle Four square Softball One Tree Hill (TV series) Textile manufacturing Professional wrestling aerial techniques Kodocha Equilibrium (2002 film) Falconry Urinary incontinence Swimming Reservoir Dogs Dutch Schultz Jennifer Lopez Guinea pig Milton H.
