what's the easiest way to trim my puppy's nails i have a month old black lab i bought the spring loaded guillotine style clippers and the only way i can get him to be still enough for me to trim is if i try and do them while he's napping the first time i tried he got up and walked right in to his kennel to lay down knowing that's his safe place i left him alone does anyone know of a tried and true trick for at home or should i just leave it to the professionals and pay to have them trimmed monthly i am a dog lover and owner of many many years i have owned up to dogs at one time i have trimmed many a dog nail in my day i find that exercising the dog s prior to clipping works wonders take him her for a long walk or play time until fairly exhausted tired they usually lie down willingly after this and are too tired to put up a fuss i get them used to having someone touch their paws also i have never used treats over time they all got used to it and actually have come to expect it it's like pampering to them especially if you talk nice to them and pet them gently while cutting now every thursday they expect me to break out the clippers and a towel for them to lie on while i do it Dog training Dog Obedience training Havanese Cat Shaggy dog story Dog agility Labrador Retriever Nintendogs Manicure Menstrual cup German Shepherd Dog Pet skunk Nine Inch Nails Hamster Docking Lawn mower Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Upholstery Housebreaking 1957 World Series Crate training Fancy rat Shetland Sheepdog Baseball International League Poodle Border Collie Dobermann 2000 Australian Grand Prix Alaskan husky Maltese (dog) Welsh Terrier Nail (anatomy) Oakland Athletics Dog breed Dog show Marilyn Monroe Neighbours Sumo Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Social rule American Pit Bull Terrier Ferret Futurama (TV series - season 5) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Australian Cattle Dog Karl Rove Reservoir Dogs The Amber Spyglass Ocean's Twelve Drag racing Domestic rabbit Newfoundland (dog) Working dog The Death Gate Cycle Pet KCAL-TV Milton H.
