help with my new dog she only relieves herself once in hours is there something wrong with her she is a one year old labradoodle rescue dog when i got her she was horribly infested with fleas and ticks those are now all gone she is very happy looks very healthy eats and drinks a normal amount and acts like she feels great but it concerns me because she only deficates and urinates one time in hours could this be a result of being crated in the past has anyone ever heard of an animal doing this she also will not go in the yard she has to walking on a leash somewhere off the property thanks for any help figuring out what a rescued dog has been through takes time and just plain watching and paying attention their actions will tell you i assume she has been vetted and make sure she is ok often bloodwork is needed for a heavily infested dog to rule out lyme disease or anemia from ticks and fleas i do not consider her bathroom timing to be normal for a one year old or any age dog she may have been crated way too much and forced herself to hold that long obviously holding for too long could lead to medical problems later apparently she was leash walked maybe a neglectful or too busy previous owner just in case make sure you walk her more regular in your yard spend time outside with her and do not rush her does she even know what play is look for clues it may takes weeks for her to settle and realize she has a better home and not spend hours in a crate or shut up in a room that she has a yard she can use maybe the owner lived in apartment be patient and give her time if she is eating drinking enough then she should need to go more often if allowed i'd hate to think i could only go potty when someone allowed me to and that could have been her situation crating is a good way to housetrain but crates should not be a way of life thank you for caring Housebreaking Dog training Urinary incontinence Hypoglycemia Tick Insulin Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Crate training Obedience training Fancy rat Lyme disease Prostate cancer Sin City Anemia Dairy Diabetes mellitus Shaggy dog story Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Chronic fatigue syndrome Social rule Garfield Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Milton H.
