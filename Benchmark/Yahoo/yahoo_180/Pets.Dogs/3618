how can i get mineral oil off my dog my puppy has real dry skin scratches all the time i feel so bad for her some one told me to put mineral oil on her now she is soooo oily and still itching help mineral oil isn't going to help with itchy skin a good way to get it off is dawn dish detergent it's safe to use on animal and great for removing oils and greases to eliminate the itchy skin you have to first located the problem behind it is it a food allergy pollen allergy flea allergy dermatitis demedex sarcoptic ringworm ect the most likely answer is an allergy of some sort dogs get allergies the same as people only instead of stuffed up noses and sneezing they usually exhibit them through itchy skin if it's flea allergies the first step is to get rid of the fleas frontline is great be careful of over the counter versions such as hartz because they have been known to cause seizures and even death if it's another sort of allergy and this works to control the allergy but not the fleas try benadryl aka diphenhydramine you will want to give mg of benadryl per pound for example if you have a lb dog a mg childrens benadryl would be a sufficeint dose not quiet mg to lb but close enough since it's impossible to be precise if it's something a little more serious like demedex and sarcoptic then it will require a more aggressive aproach that will have to be prescribed by a vet good luck and hope this helps and not to knock anyone down but garlic doesn't help that much doesn't hurt it's horrible to put vegetable oil on your dogs food it's as good for him as it would be dosing our french fries with an extra cup of it and malasab is an atifungal shampoo so unless your dog has ringworm it won't work Eczema Dandruff Allergy Scabies Cat Psoriasis Dog Shampoo Multiple chemical sensitivity Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Fancy rat Tattoo Guinea pig Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Tofu Fecal incontinence Mange Itch Clinical depression Ringworm Rapeseed The Star Wars Holiday Special Housebreaking Dimenhydrinate Fox hunting Theory of conduct Ranma __ characters Dog training Cantonese cuisine Characters of Naruto Futurama (TV series - season 5) Hamster Chronic fatigue syndrome Insomnia Tocopherol Domestic rabbit Tooth enamel Livestock Nut (fruit) Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Piccolo Junior Saga Asthma Cuisine of Denmark Narcotic Alcoholics Anonymous Chicken Urinary incontinence Sin City Ketoconazole Plagues of Egypt Rocko's Modern Life Aloe Medicine Garlic Chlorpromazine Soap Dry cleaning Jewish cuisine Acne In-N-Out Burger Hamburger Homeopathy Potato Sneeze Insulin Diving Good Morning, Vietnam Angioedema Burdock Stomach cancer Elephant Soy milk Tobacco Korean cuisine French cuisine Top-bar hive Tuberculosis Flax Cuisine of Laos Methamphetamine Food Fasting Kim Possible Soybean Rabies Yarrow Doxepin Plastic
