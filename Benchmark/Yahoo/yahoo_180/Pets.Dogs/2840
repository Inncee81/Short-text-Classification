what's the most effective way to train a puppy not to bite you i know she's teething so she'll bite anything but she shows a lot more interest in biting me than anything else those little teeth are sharp i've been just telling her no or ouch and get her off me and give her a chew toy but she kind of ignores the chew toy and comes right back to bite me what should i do when can i expect her to stop biting like this what i do with my puppy is i close his mouth with my hand but not too hard i dont want him to accidentally bite his tounge and look him in the eye and in a low tone say bad i've researched dog psychology in class and they say that dogs know when people are mad when they talk in a low tone b c it reminds them of when a dog growls its all instinct your doing right to correct him and give him a chew toy though from now on when he chews on his chew toys give him affection so he knows that he is being good so he'll do it more often best answer peez signed yr freshman friend Dog training Dog Fancy rat Skinny Puppy Theory of conduct Hamster Mojave people Social rule Tooth Kodocha Housebreaking The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Tooth enamel Animal testing Cat Psychology German Shepherd Dog Gray Wolf Ferret Dog show Late Night with Conan O'Brien Milton H.
