dog poked in the eye and now i see his third eyelid nictitating membrane i was walking my dog at night and as he walked by a bush he wimpered i think he was either stung by something or poked in the eye the next morning there was a film comming from the corner of his eye and it covered about a quarter of his eye it would go away and come back all day i called the vet he said it was his third eyelid and suggested to give him benadryl and use a warm compress it's been days and although it seems to be getting slightly better the problem is still there other than this looking weird his behavior is normal i dont know if i should just go to the vet or wait it out only reason why im hesitant to take him is because its alot of money should this be something to worry about will it go away over time why does the third eye lid go away and come back thanks so much in advance he may be rubbing it and aggravating it call the vet again to see what they say try calling a few vets about to see what they think and if at least suggest that you take the dog in take him in better safe than sorry Eyelid Cat Eye Shaggy dog story Dog Philip J.
