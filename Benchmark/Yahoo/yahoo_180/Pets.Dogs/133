ok i hate to be seeming to ask the same question but my new chihuahua doesn't seem to be necessarally afrain of people but does get nervous when people are loud or kids chase her when we are on our walks she is friendly and lets people pet her sometimes she gets on great with other dogs no problems there but she almost never comes when i call her unless i am firm with her and when she does come she creeps and then rolls over at my feet i feel bad because i don't want her to be afraid of me but i don't know what to do to break her out of it my friend told me to give her time i just adopted her very recently but i'm not sure that that is really all she needs any advice you are doing a great job but please don't use your voice in a screaming manner but rather calm assertive when she creeps and falls showing her belly by your feet that is a complete submission position if you recently adopted her she probably has had many different ways of interaction with humans she really doesn't understand come or even her name at first if she doesn't know it she doesn't know it she is not being defiant just confused would you be able to give your dog basic training classes pet smart has then for puppies costs it is worth it if you can do it you dog will be happier and so will you because she will understand the language good luck Dog training Dog The Fairly OddParents Shaggy dog story Theory of conduct Housebreaking Social rule Garfield Rocko's Modern Life Ranma __ characters The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Kodocha Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Philosophy of language Aerial (dance move) Brian Griffin Care Bears Obedience training The Critic Invader Zim Avenue Q Game show Jam (TV series) Reservoir Dogs Kim Possible Goodness and value theory Dog agility EastEnders Humphrey Bogart The Catcher in the Rye Friends The Ashlee Simpson Show Socialization The Death Gate Cycle Traumatic incident reduction Good Times Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Ren and Stimpy Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Nintendogs Diving Cat The Smoking Room W.I.T.C.H.
