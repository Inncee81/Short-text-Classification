how can i train my dog to listen better when we are outside my dog is for the most part very well behaved and listens to me almost all of the time as long as we are inside the house if i take him outside and he for some reason escapes the lease he will just run and run until i catch him but by no means will he come to me when i call if i call him when we are indoors he runs right to me he also gets very excited when he sees other people dogs he jumps all over them any suggestions on how to train him to stop these behaviors he is a mo old peke who receives plenty of attention i am also looking for bark parks to take him to so he can go play good or bad idea my dog is the same way when it comes to her behavior outside opposed to inside i started taking her out for walks on a short leash i walked in front of her and made sure i had complete control over her though she didn't listen still it was much easier for me to control her she's almost lbs and kind of hard to handle i have been working on her with small things for now i put my finger up she sits the best thing i've learned to do with her is to put her on a leash or runner outside the house in the yard and work with her outside i give her the same commands i'd give her in the house but in the outdoor environment and it seems to be working very well for her Dog training Obedience training Dog agility Housebreaking 1957 World Series Poker jargon Aerial (dance move) Tag Ultimate (sport) Athletics Leash Milton H.
