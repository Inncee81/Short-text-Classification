why does my pitbull do this everytime i go to give him some fresh water he paws at his water and knocks it all out of his dish or just makes it all muddy from his paws i hate this because he doesn't leave any fresh water for my other dog or if there is any left it is all muddy help ps he doesn't try to knock the bowl over he is just pawing at it literally just puttin his paws in the water im curious if you are using a stainless steel dish i have seen dogs and cats play with their water in these bowls i guess b c of the sound or reflection i have also seen them be afraid of these bowls and when the bowl is changed the behavior stops just a thought Cat Dog Korean cuisine Maine Coon Garfield Shaggy dog story Gray Wolf Grandview, U.S.A.
