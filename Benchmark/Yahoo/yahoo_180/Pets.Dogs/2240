how do i make her not scared we rescued a dog a lab pit when she was years old now she is and she is still scared of stuff taller than her how do i stop her from being scared and for her to see that she can trust me more just to let you know the big man she is a great dog one of my best dogs i have more she is loyal and very smart wish that there was a simple solution to dogs being scared in some situations you can desensitize the dog expose them to the stimulant that is causing a problem enough and they overcome their sensitivity to it unfortunately there are things that this technique doesn't work with or dogs that simply get totally overwhelmed by the stimulant similarly there are some dogs that you want to use comfort to get them through the situation and others that you're essentially telling them that it's okay to be afraid when you comfort them some times you have to simply have the dog tolerate the situation and realize that you are not going to let them get hurt best thing here is to go to a trainer who can work with you with the situation Kim Possible Shaggy dog story Dog training Traumatic incident reduction Sin City Premature ejaculation Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Insulin Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Dog Working dog Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Fairly OddParents Alcoholics Anonymous The Inside The Smoking Room Procrastination Addiction Smallville (Season 4) Maison Ikkoku Color Ex-gay Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Humphrey Bogart Characters of Naruto Breastfeeding B-47 Stratojet Strategic management Philosophy of language Extreme Programming Manual transmission Ranma __ characters GunZ The Duel Insomnia Vegeta Deus ex machina Milton H.
