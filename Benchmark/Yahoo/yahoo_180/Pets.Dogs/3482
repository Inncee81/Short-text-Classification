how to communicate to a neighbor my concern for her dog i bought a house next door to a nice woman who works hours a week three jobs so she can make her house payment she has two dogs that are inside and one that is chained in her backyard she seems to pay more attention to the house dogs than the one in the yard and i suspect she only has the outside dog for some protection dog can't really do anything if it's chained the other day the outside dog got loose and my bf caught him and tried to tether him back to the broken chain he noticed the dogs ears are bloody we have a huge mosquito problem from being at the edge of a swampy woodland and eye boogers galore he was very very needy for attention and my bf felt so bad we hardly see our neighbor and i don't want to have to call the humane society and cause a ruckus so how can i tell her she needs to tend to her dog without causing a major offense should i volunteer to spend some time with the poor dog or would that be too pushy rather than mosquito's flies are attacking his ears petrolieum jelly is a cheap way to go there are also repellents for flies they will literally eat his ears i would not 'tell' her anything about her dog except for the flies chances are she knows but doesn't know what to do why don't you bring a toy or a treat to her for the outside dog start some kind of a conversation about dogs in general offer to spend time with the dog i'm sure she'd appreciate that tell her what a dog lover you and your bf are and how busy you know she is and that you would really like to help anyone that has to work hrs a week is not a sloucher she is overworked and probably underpaid i'm really sorry for the dog but i'm sorry for her she has probably gotten in way over her head why don't you offer her friendship then she won't think you're being pushy or nosy don't bother calling authorities unless your help is either ignored or unwanted i'm sure she has enough problems without being made to feel she is being cruel to her animals The Apprentice 2 Mosquito Shaggy dog story Gray Wolf Social rule Dog Hamster Knots Landing Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Dog training The Death Gate Cycle Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Dairy The Smoking Room YuYu Hakusho Malaria Fancy rat Doug Housebreaking Code: Lyoko Characters of Naruto Working time Pitaten Cat Invader Zim Hot dog Steven Wright Brian Griffin The Shining (film) Domestic rabbit Billboard Hot 100 Tenshinhan Make money fast Keeshond Humphrey Bogart 1957 World Series Dead Like Me Sesshomaru Iditarod The Empty Child Battle of the Bulge Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Microeconomics Glossary of American football Big Brother (USA TV series) 2005 Iditarod USS Sea Dog (SS-401) Vampire The Inside Ocean's Twelve Abortion debate Cincinnati Bengals Game show Reservoir Dogs Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Garfield Tasmanian Devil Volleyball Animal rights Theory of conduct Monster Rancher monsters Blackjack Guinea pig Procrastination Health insurance The Contender (television series) Bulk vending The Evil Queen/Christine Slevil-Lewis-White (The 10th Kingdom) Craps Fox hunting Breastfeeding American football Jam (TV series) Ron Weasley Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Wall Street Goodness and value theory RuneScape quests W.
