hurricane katrina dog terrified of storms i have a sheltie who showed up at my house a few months after katrina and she is terrified of storms not due to the hurricane though her former owners whom i found through her id chip said she's always been afraid of them any way i can't seem to get her to relax even a small bit during a storm i use the general advice given by ceasar milan and do not comfort her when she is anxious but can never get her to relax enough to praise her for this she does not misbehave but she just tries to melt into my legs and is extremely fearful i don't won't to give her a tranq and hoped that just my being relaxed would help her i love storms by the way does anyone have a suggestion for me for this she is years old and has had this problem for a long time i've had dogs who are afraid of thunder and believe me desensitizing them does not work like it might for other fears they can't control this one the theory is its because of change in atmospheric pressure sight hounds and herding dogs are most susceptible and i've had sight hound and herding dog with this fear i don't like using the vet prescribed tranqs either because of the side affects but the dog needs help what i use is bach's flower essences rescue remedy it has no side affects takes about minutes to work and is enough to calm the dog my grey can just lay on the couch with me and not shake himself to pieces he's pounds and gets drops a sheltie would likely only need you can get it from holistic vets health stores and some drug stores the other thing that's helped my dogs is to be in a room with no windows or if they can squeeze themselves behind something like a big chair being in a confined space seems to be comforting Dog Housebreaking Hurricane Wilma Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina The Time Machine Insomnia Shaggy dog story Obedience training Urinary incontinence Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Blood (computer game) Hurricane Katrina effects by region Storm surge Sento 2005 Atlantic hurricane season Hamster Breastfeeding Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Ferret Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Piccolo Junior Saga Disaster Asthma Working dog Elvis Presley Civil disturbances and military action in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina 2005 Pacific hurricane season Sin City Alternative theories regarding Hurricane Katrina Hurricane Katrina timeline Hurricane Rita RuneScape quests The Smoking Room Fecal incontinence Basset Hound Cannabis (drug) Autism Milton H.
