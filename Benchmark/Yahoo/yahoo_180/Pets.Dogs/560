we put a fence up yesterday to keep our neighbors out and dogs in in that order our dogs are also small but the point is that our neighbors treat our property as their personal play ground this morning i found of the posts closest to their car port but well on our property bent just because they can can i make a citizens arrest i'm tired of all the bs we haven't gone onto their property even once in the almost years we've lived here but they drive their scooters around hubby's truck parked in front of our garage just because i don't have care that they drive between the garages half of the space is ours but if they didn't they'd drive through our backyard they've done it call and make a police report then get yourself a video camera so you can have evidence once you have the evidence you can sue for damages your neighbors are being unreasonable without proof it would be difficult to make a citizens arrest Paul Is Dead Shaggy dog story Dennis Rader Beltway sniper attacks Lee Harvey Oswald Plame affair Surveillance Steven Wright Indianapolis 500 Skateboarding trick Ocean's Twelve Tire Rosa Parks Easement Branch Davidian Volkert van der Graaf Manual transmission Professional wrestling throws Rachel Corrie Burning Man Reservoir Dogs West Side Highway Rear wheel drive Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Firefighter Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina 2004 Republican National Convention protest activity Laci Peterson Softball 2Step Divorce Mumia Abu-Jamal Cindy Sheehan Contract Driver's license The Inside Regina, Saskatchewan Montgomery Bus Boycott Ayrton Senna Seymour Hersh Traumatic brain injury Ferris Bueller's Day Off Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution Need for Speed Fred Phelps Honda Mamdouh Habib Neighbours 2004 World Series Animal Liberation Front Disneyland Westboro Baptist Church (Topeka) Speed limit Crime prevention through environmental design Isetta Year of the Spider Hearsay Closed-circuit television Bradley John Murdoch Automatic number plate recognition 7 July 2005 London bombings Battles of Lexington and Concord Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories Dog training Sport utility vehicle Grand Theft Auto (game) Axle Singlish Pickup truck Futurama (TV series - season 5) Slander and libel 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Universal Serial Bus The Lovely Bones Oasis (band) Penske Racing Lechaina Anti-Defamation League Columbine High School massacre Hybrid vehicle Wrigley Field Terri Schiavo Charles Manson Stomach cancer Elis Prefecture The Brady Bunch Fox hunting Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Bonnie and Clyde Sharon Tate Crop circle Community emergency response team Larry Walters Fallujah Fair Game (Scientology) Ernie Irvan John F.
