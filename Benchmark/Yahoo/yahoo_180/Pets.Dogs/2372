rimadyl versus cortaflex hi all just rescued a gs dog years already have a gsd years new dog has recently been diagnosed with chronic arthritis only noticed days after bringing him home he has been put on rimadyl by vet and doing well however have heard that cortaflex is better naturally and not the side effects that rimadyl can have also rimadyl is going to cost a fortune from vet as he needs to be on for life i have been told does anyone have alternative medications to rimadyl or experience of cortaflex vet is going to x ray our dog incase he has hip dylsplasia hi cortaflex and rimadyl are very different products rimadyl is a pain killer which is going to make your dog feel better whenever intoo much pain it works very well but prolonged use may lead to gasric ulcers cortaflex is a joint supplement glucosamine chondoitin which is helpful to keep a good joint health i would usually recommend to start with rimadyl to get the dog to feel better then a treatment such as cortaflex or equivalent may be started if it isn't enough to keep the dog pain free then rimadyl should be used on the top the cortaflex may then be helpful only to reduce the dose of rimadyl tricky problem good luck ps just read post before ibuprofen and aspirin belong to similar class of meds as rimadyl they will trigger gastric ulcers as well but only more frequently as they have not been designed for dogs my advise use vet treatment only and do not self medicate your dog with human products even if they are for kids Osteoarthritis Paracetamol COX-2 inhibitor Migraine Diabetes mellitus Aspirin Cancer Chronic fatigue syndrome Asthma Analgesic Methylsulfonylmethane Ulcerative colitis Malaria Clinical depression Multiple sclerosis Growth hormone treatment Peptic ulcer Carpal tunnel syndrome Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Gastroesophageal reflux disease Ibuprofen Stomach cancer Prostate cancer Gout Animal testing Rabies Antidepressant Rofecoxib Guinea pig Alternative medicine Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Herpes simplex virus Glycogen storage disease type I Drug addiction Crohn's disease Hypertension Fancy rat Diclofenac Transsexuality Pain Insulin Cluster headache Fibromyalgia Anxiety Celecoxib Immunosuppressive drug Schizophrenia Tocopherol Dog Chiropractic Breastfeeding Pneumonia Adjustable gastric band Mouth ulcer Endometriosis Helicobacter pylori Rheumatoid arthritis Diazepam Indomethacin Alzheimer's disease Tobacco smoking Anorexia nervosa Sickle-cell disease Vitamin D Equine conformation Osteoporosis Addiction Vitamin C Homeopathy Narcolepsy Coeliac disease Alcoholics Anonymous Arthritis Chlorpromazine Tuberculosis Cannabis (drug) Stroke Colorectal cancer Traditional Chinese medicine Stuttering Rocky Mountain spotted fever Post Polio syndrome Diarrhea Clomipramine Amiodarone Lupus erythematosus Irritable bowel syndrome Acupuncture
