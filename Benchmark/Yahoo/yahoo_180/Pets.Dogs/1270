do you think it's selfish to deprive your pet from its natural environment to be your companian an interesting question i was thinking earlier which i would like your opinions on since all dogs were once wild we are technically taking dogs out of their natural enivronment the breeds we have today are far from natural they have been created by people through many many generations of selective breeding they have been bred to live with us thus living in a house with people is the natural environment of these unnatural dogs putting those dogs in the wild would be certain death even if they would learn to care for themselves some require grooming or they would get so matted they wouldn't be able to move and they would die a slow painful death our colors are unnatural as well for the areas that most people live for example small white dogs like maltese westies papillons etc wouldn't survive long just because of their color anyone who has ever lived on a farm knows that the first cats to disappear due to coyotes or hawks every year are the white ones they just don't blend in with their surroundings they stick out like a sore thumb those are just a couple reasons it would be a horrible idea in short there is no benefit there are only negative consequences Ferret Cat Dog Domestic rabbit Hamster Domestication Theory of conduct Livestock Maltese (dog) Fancy rat Toy dog Papillon (dog) The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Dog agility Animal rights Pet skunk Pit bull Keeshond West Highland White Terrier Dobermann German Shepherd Dog Gray Wolf Shetland Sheepdog Havanese Guinea pig Extinction Wealth Animal testing Theodicy Selective breeding Border Collie Humphrey Bogart Dog breed Organic farming Stereoscopy Altruism Fox hunting Poodle Siberian Husky Philosophy of language Prostate cancer Golden Retriever Species Obedience training Sinfest Lion Docking Hunting Biodiversity Firefighter Korea Jindo Dog Equine conformation Aikido Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Cheetah Pug Garfield Whippet Rabies Simone Weil Coercion Pet Sounds Labrador Retriever German Shorthaired Pointer Azumanga Daioh Dog show Artificial selection Dog breeding Taboo food and drink Pekingese Greyhound Dog hybrids and crossbreeds Puppy mill Agriculture Medieval hunting Abortion debate Horse Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Zoo Black hole Ranma __ characters Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Morphology (linguistics) Salmon Bernese Mountain Dog The Origin of Species Manx (cat) God Emperor of Dune Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Chihuahua (dog) Mixed-breed dog Plame affair Staffordshire Bull Terrier Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Puma Original sin Smooth Collie Euphemism Tigon
