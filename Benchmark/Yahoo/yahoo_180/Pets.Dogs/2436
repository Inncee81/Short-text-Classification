is it good if i use a backpack to help my golden burn more energy we walk our golden for an hour twenty minutes jogging included on weekdays and at least two hours on weekends everyday still i am concerned that the daily exercise is not enough for the two year old exercise demanding pound golden since we don t have a yard and just a three year old pomeranian as its playmate when we are not home so i am considering using a backpack to help my golden burn more energy on daily walks here is my plan from the beginning i will put two bottles of water approx kg into the backpack then i increase slowly the load to kg what do you think mom of two fur kids from mainland china adding weight to a dog that may already be too heavy and then exercising it at length regularly while wearing these weights will probably put more strain on the joints than make it lose weight there's no reason why you can't do it occasionally but i wouldn't suggest that it be every time the dog is exercised one of the big problems in overweight dogs is the risk of arthritis due to the joints carrying more weight than they should be by habitually adding weight you are putting the joints at even higher risk over the long term i think your best bet is to perhaps change the dog to a lite diet and reduce the food intake if you have problems with it eating the food of other pets keep the dog away until any uneaten food is removed if the dog seems overly hungry on the reduced amount of food top it up with crated carrots and add other vegetables also giving the dog a bone to chew on will satisfy it's urge to eat you need to approach the weight issue from these angles less food less calories more exercise and keep the added weights to perhaps once or twice a week if there is a park you can take your dog to to run with other dogs in the open where it can really go crazy the other dogs will push it to exercise much longer than it would normally do and you'll find the dog is quite exhausted after an hour or two and this will make a difference to the weight Atkins Nutritional Approach Breastfeeding Hamster Obesity Weight training Anorexia nervosa Fancy rat Equine conformation Milk Adjustable gastric band Low-carbohydrate diet Domestic rabbit Brown Bear Super Size Me Garfield Cocaine Folic acid Omega-3 fatty acid Urinary incontinence Veganism Bodybuilding Backpacking (wilderness) Tocopherol Carburetor Guinea pig Explosive material Dietary fiber Marathon (sport) Fecal incontinence Diabetes mellitus Paget's disease of bone Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Tooth Binge eating disorder Calorie Jet engine MS-06 Zaku II Cat Nutrition Turbocharger Insulin Osteoporosis Raw food diet Sugar Vitamin C Sugar substitute Obedience training Iditarod Portable stove Fasting Ton Prostate cancer Terri Schiavo Hypoglycemia Genetically modified food E85 Frogman Hypertension Nuclear power Dog Diesel engine Tobacco smoking Running Heinkel He 112 Weight Watchers Weight loss Ramen Mattress Hydrogen economy Metrication Bicycle Poker jargon M16 (rifle) Diving Hiking Yosemite National Park Tooth enamel Cessna T-37 Alcoholic beverage Colorectal cancer RuneScape quests Healthy eating Dog training F-35 Joint Strike Fighter U.S. customary units School bus Decompression sickness Environmental concerns with electricity generation Bong Chocolate Bread Cantonese cuisine
