kennel cough we have a month old puppy and we think he has kennel cough we are not completely sure how he may have come in contact with it but he fits all the symptoms the list of symptoms he has shown yesterday and today are constant sneezing coughing gagging retching trying to vomit and a small amount of foam expelled after coughing these seem to come in spells that only last a few seconds except for the sneezing which is through out the day once the spell is over he goes back to normal activity he is still eating drinking and playing as usual he does seem to be sleeping more then he normally does though we are going to call our vet in the morning and see what their opinion is but we are wondering what the treatment will be so if anyone has ever had a puppy or adult dog that was diagnosed with kennel cough could you please detail what the treatment was i am just curious what he will be in for when we visit the vet's office thanks in advance brit yup sounds like bordetella kennel cough the good news is that its very very common and easily treated your puppy is not too young to be treated with standard antibiotics and old enough to have a mature enough immune system to recover from it the vet will take the dog's temperature and ask after his eating drinking peeing pooing playin habits if he suspects something more serious he will ask if you've seen any blood in his stools he will check to see if the dog is dehydrated you can do this by pulling the skin at the scruff of his neck and making sure it falls back into place quickly if it doesn't fall back into place then the dog is likely dehydrated also the dog's gums should be nice and pink being hydrated is important as its harder for the body to function and or recover if its not hydrated assuming the dog is hydrated they will likely give him a antibiotic shot and some antibiotic capsules to take home and give him twice a day for days depending on the severity of the infection that antibiotic will likely be mg of cephelexin which is standard treatment for upper respiratory infections such as bordetella if the dog is lethargic it may be an indication of dehydration brought on by the infection re hydrating the dog usual consists of sub q fluids injected under the dog's skin at the back of the neck through a needle tube and iv sac of fluid its something that needs to happen at the vets office and not something you can do at home as a amateur the quicker you arrest the infection the faster the recovery time your pup sounds like he's just going to need a shot and the regimen of meds at home you'll be surprised how quickly he bounces back once he gets the antibiotics especially at this young age keep him at less than his regular activity level while he recovers and away from other dogs bordetella vaccinations occur several times in the first year of the dog's life to be effective your dog will need these and it will not work to treat the dog with a vaccination for an active infection kennel cough is the most common of uri's in canines and can be found at shelters kennels and communal dog watering spots at parks he may have got it from exposure to another dog or just sniffing about at a park where other dogs have eliminated at good luck at the vet's tomorrow with the antibiotics you should see a turnaround in hrs First aid Tuberculosis Urinary incontinence Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Pertussis Rabies Chronic fatigue syndrome Prostate cancer AIDS Stomach cancer Cancer Rocky Mountain spotted fever Diabetes mellitus Dehydration Fancy rat Malaria Dialysis Traumatic brain injury Allergy Anthrax Asthma Guinea pig Intravenous therapy Hepatitis Leptospirosis Insulin Dog Hypoglycemia Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Infectious mononucleosis HIV Domestic rabbit Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Heartworm Psoriasis Dog training HIV test Decompression sickness Influenza Poliomyelitis Multiple sclerosis Medicine Conjunctivitis Ehrlichiosis Chemotherapy Ebola Marathon (sport) Leukemia Sickle-cell disease Cephalic disorder Lyme disease Cocaine Canine parvovirus Streptococcus pneumoniae Gastroparesis Drowning Fecal incontinence Antiviral drug Narcotic Hyperthermia Cytomegalovirus Coeliac disease Lung cancer Stroke Chlorpromazine Smallpox Breast cancer Schistosomiasis Measles Bone marrow transplant Legionellosis Herpes simplex virus Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Escherichia coli O157:H7 Hay fever Gastroenteritis Lupus erythematosus Myxobolus cerebralis Meningitis Syphilis Botulism Eczema Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia Sexually-transmitted infection Microchip implant (animal) Childbirth Mesothelioma Transmission (medicine)
