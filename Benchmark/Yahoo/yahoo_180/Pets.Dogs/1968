who owns a wolf hybrid i was just looking if anyone else owned a wolf hybrid and can give me any tips on how to potty train and stuff and maybe share some pictures here are some of mine http s photobucket com albums x goongy action view current makeeshawl jpg http s photobucket com albums x goongy action view current makeeshaoutside jpg yes i have a wolf malamute cross came from iqualuit in nunavut artic the local spca told us he was a husky malaute cross we knew they were guessing and thought we'd figure it out as he got older lineage when we first got him at months we knew something was very different about him the first time we ate dinner in his presence he went absolutely wild jumping up and down constantly yipping trying to jump onto our laps it was really crazy and not stop after some training he got out of that very quickly now at year old we can put a plate of food down for him tell him to sit and stay and he won't move until he's released walking him proved very difficult until he was about months old he would suddenly decide that he didn't want to go in that direction anymore and would basically hop backwards like a kangaroo he would also just decide he wanted to lay down and would not get up for minutes he is better now walking he still sometimes decides that he doesn't want to go down a certain street anymore happens about times a week i've been reading a lot about wolfdogs and at this point i don't force him i realize something might be spooking him so we non chalantly head in another direction the laying down thing was fixed by just standing next to him looking in the direction you want to go eventually he would stand up it took shorter and shorter periods for me to get him to stand up until we weaned that behaviour out of him when he was about months old we bought him a doggy tennis ball that would squeak when you squeezed it that was when he started howling a funny little puppy howl he rarely barks maybe once a week when he's spinning on the bed he goes 'woo woo' and kind of chats to you more like a malamute but he mixes woo woo's with howls also i thought potty training was never going to end he caught on for the first weeks we had him then we digressed and kept peeing and pooing in the house i used petzyne to get rid of the odour we kept doing all the normal dog tactics to housetrain him then one day for no particular reason he got it and was all of a sudden potty trained in one day he was about months old at this point sorry but i thought i'd tell you all the horrible truths since then he has been perfect he lives in the house with me and my husband and our year old cat he respects the cat and is very gentle with her he is big his back is inches tall he's got long legs long body weighs lbs and is still filling in at the dog park he is not aggressive and chooses to walk away from dogs he doesn't like on walks if dogs in their yard bark at him he just looks at them has never barked back wolf mentality flight not fight he always needs to be in the same room as you he is also destructive you cannot leave him access to the living room if you're not there leather couch has had chunks of stuffing removed so the use of baby gates is a must he 'mouths' your hands to communicate it's very gentle and from what i've read you will never get them to stop doing this as it's a big part of being a wolf he can get very protective over what he thinks is his the first time this happened we were heartbroken and wondered if we would be able to keep him and if he was going to become aggressive he growled made snapping motions towards us bared his teeth truly frightening wolfdogs will test you from time to time when they think it's time for them to move up in the wolfpack you will learn when you should confront them and when you shouldn't it will also depend on whether you have a low mid or high content wolfdog if he's playing with a bone and i put my hand towards him he growls and bares his teeth it's all for show if i continue and go to take his bone he will put on quite the display but the end result is a quick bite from him on my hand for show he doesn't put any pressure on me and then he licks my hand because my action of taking the bone makes me the dominant one just so you know i'm only ' and lbs the dog when he stands up and puts his paws on my shoulders a very wolf thing to do is the same height as me for pictures go to http www flickr com photos lycan i cannot take him anywhere without people asking me what he is and before i can say anything everyone says he looks like a wolf i would not go around telling people your dog is a wolfdog as people have preconceived notions as to what that means i'm perfectly happy that the papers i got from the spca say he's a husky malamute mix makes going to the vet easier i really do recommend that you do some extensive research on the web regarding wolfdogs i've found it a life saver and many things regarding his
