i have a year old poodle that is totally blind she has always been very active up to now she will not even walk on the leash and she always did now she just sleeps all day what can i do to get her to become more active she just went blind about months ago she was active up to that point thank you all for your answers i will apply them all to ebony s future she is a wonderful girl going blind is pretty much a shock to anyone your dog is older and not so active anyway and now getting around has become complicated i'm sure she doesn't think it's worth the trouble what you could try though is using a harness to walk her instead of a collar go slowly and let her enjoy smells as she learns you won't let her walk into things and you'll be able to control that better with the harness she may like it a lot more Dog training EastEnders Humphrey Bogart Joke Shaggy dog story Leash Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Death Gate Cycle Paragliding Horse Sheepshead Milton H.
