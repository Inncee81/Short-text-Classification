is it true that a dog boy dog will be more loyal and attach themselves to a male person and the girls dog the bitch would attach to the woman no it just depends on who the primary caregiver is and how hard you can be on the dog my dog might be a girl but she likes girls because of what we can only assume happened to her in the past she hates guys that wear hats she apparently ran up to a guy with a hat while on a walk randomly and started barking at him she also hates guys in sunglasses she'll do the same but not as vicious sounding barking i'm guessing a guy she knew in the past wore a hat and would take it off and hit her with it when she wouldn't leave him alone or wouldn't shut up or whatever my dog dislikes my dad the most but that's because he tends to yell more and squirt the squirty bottle more yet my dog loves my brother but not as much as my mom of course it all depends on how you act around the dog how you treat him or her how devoted you are to walking them giving them attention playing with them etc it's just that dogs like girls more because mostly on the hole girls are kinder and more giving to animals than guys are so no it makes no difference what gender the dog is or your gender it's all based on how you treat the dog which really does make sense doesn't it you're mean to the dog they'll be mean right back if you're kind caring yet let them know in a firm but not aggressive way they'll be more inclined to like you and of course it mainly depends on the dog's personality every dog is different just like people they'll like who they like and dislike what they don't The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Recurring South Park characters KaBlam!
