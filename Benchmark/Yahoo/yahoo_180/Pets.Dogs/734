a few questions about tibetan terriers i am currently considering to buy a tibetan terrier therefore i'd like to know if it can live in an apartment and also if it sheds if this breed does shed can i prevent the shedding by daily brushing thanks ahead liza by prevent shedding i mean prevent dog hair to be spread all over the apartment sorry for my vocabulary i always love when someone asks questions about a breed of dog i am not familiar with it encourages me to read and learn it seems that the tibetan terrier is quite a little dog indeed they are non shedding but they do have a double coat at around three months of age the way the hair grows will require you to brush it every day sometimes twice a day or it will matte they are very very smart and you will have to be sure and think of every possible thing they might do it seems they would be suitable to apartment life but they will need to be exercised they will need grooming but the article i read recommends scissor cutting instead of clipping a puppy cut is recommended i will post the link but one particular tib unscrewed the screws from this cage with his mouth another or maybe the same one figured out how to get out of his crate and made havoc in the kitchen for the owner to find when they got home p they sound like very interesting little dogs and did ya know they are not actually terriers at all according to dna testing they are one of the oldest dog breeds pretty cool huh Dog Kerry Blue Terrier Shetland Sheepdog Maltese (dog) Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier Havanese Skye Terrier Tibetan Terrier Airedale Terrier Guinea pig Border Terrier Keeshond Jack Russell Terrier Cat Dog training Housebreaking Welsh Terrier Toy dog Poodle Dog show Domestic rabbit Miniature Fox Terrier Border Collie Coat (dog) Pit bull Yorkshire Terrier Cairn Terrier Terrier Mixed-breed dog Nintendogs Bull Terrier American Eskimo Dog Tenterfield Terrier Basset Hound American Pit Bull Terrier Breed standard Whippet Toy Fox Terrier Chicken Dog agility Labrador Retriever Hamster Portuguese Water Dog Dairy Smooth Collie RuneScape quests Siberian Husky Pet skunk Staffordshire Bull Terrier Plame affair Alaskan husky Dog breeding Crate training Fox Terrier (Smooth) Golden Retriever Acne Australian Silky Terrier Fox Terrier Humphrey Bogart Friends Chinese Crested Dog Dachshund Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show Great Dane Working dog German Shepherd Dog One Tree Hill (TV series) Pug Ferret Laika Obedience training Livestock Griffon Bruxellois The Ashlee Simpson Show Avenue Q Drill bit Korea Jindo Dog Kodocha Francis Bacon (painter) American Kennel Club Miniature Pinscher Animal testing Dobermann Bernese Mountain Dog Tooth Bong Our Gang Rastafari movement Floppy disk Knife Richard Chase Tasmanian Devil Weimaraner Rottweiler Australian Cattle Dog Fox hunting Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Mastiff
