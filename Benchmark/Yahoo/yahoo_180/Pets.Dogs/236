i want to adopt a pomeranian but i'm afraid the shelter will reject me because i live in an apartment help will i get rejected for a pom b c i live in an apartment i know i can offer him her a good home hubby and i have 'worked our way up' with pets and proven our responsibility with each one we have a fish betta that we've had for months now we had guinea pigs we ended up giving them to a family member after months they weren't the right kind of pet for us needed something more interactive and i know they are cared for the same way they were here we had a cat he had to be rehomed because i developed an allergy to him but when he was rehomed i interviewed many people who wanted him and made sure he was going to a good home all of my pets that were rehomed went to wonderful new homes and i think that was more responsible of me than giving them to a pound or shelter we live in a sqft apt but one of us is always home hubby's night shift i'm day shift and a student i'm home a lot i know we're ready for this but will the shelter feel the same way i know a lot about the breed i know their biggest problem is grooming and shedding i know to brush him her everyday and never to shave them b c of sensitive skin i know they have fragile bones and should never be allowed to jump on and off of things i know to walk him her at least twice a day for a half hour each great for both of us b c i'm on a diet and i do that anyways i know to always update him her on his her shots all of the time and to watch for heavy shedding heavy shedding indicates improper diet or condition and requires immediate vet attention i know these things i'm just so nervous and afraid i'll be rejected any advice don't get a dog from a pet store jeez i hate it when people suggest that over adoption here's what you need from my shelter written permission or lease from landlord stating dog is acceptable vet history from previous pets proving you keep your animals up to date on meds shots checkups detailed info on your daily routine including primary caregiver's work hours and time spent at home contract to spay neuter if not already done all the people in the household come to visit the dog before adoption is approved signed contract stating you will return the dog to the shelter for any reason if you cannot keep it in other words you can't give away the dog like you did the cat if you found out you were allergic to it previous experience with dogs not necessary but helpful fenced yard if in an apartment you would need to describe the exercise routine also you might need to agree to purchase a crate for housebreaking we don't require this but recommend it and often give crates for free to people adopting dogs that are not housebroken if you meet these criteria and we are flexible on some of them you will be cleared to adopt thank you for wanting to adopt a homeless pet Cat Pet skunk Domestic rabbit Guinea pig Dog Fancy rat Hamster Animal shelter Garfield Ferret Contract Livestock Weight training Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Keeshond Socialization Coeliac disease RuneScape quests Friends Urinary incontinence Pet Vitamin C Havanese Anderson Cooper Asthma Microchip implant (animal) Milton H.
