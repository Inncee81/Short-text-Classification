why does my four year old labrador dog just sit in front of my wife and stare into her eyes he does this every night when we are sat together on the couch he just stares but moves away if you try to stroke him then he comes straight back he sounds really dominant staring is a direct challenge in dog language especially if he is denying your giving him affection the leader decides when he gets touched he may be trying to intimidate her out of the high spot couch the place he feels is his due as alpha does he have other pushy behaviors like guarding his food or toys grumping if you ask him to get off the couch or bed super aggressive when people come to the door dragging you on walks stealing food etc if so you may want to consult a professional trainer many people are intimidated by their very alpha dogs and they can be scary they have teeth and they may use them if you try to nose in on their pack status the wrong way also search nothing in life is free dog training on the internet there are many great articles on how to gently and positively unseat him from top spot confrontation isn't the key again they have teeth positive methods and changing routines will help to put you and especially your wife he may target her because women's higher voices and smaller frames often cause dogs to decide they are the weaker one we don't look or sound as intimidating back in charge without a major fight or getting bitten also is he neutered un neutered males are much more willing to push to the top of the pack if they don't see a strong leader in place and have a slightly higher chance of being aggressive they see it as being aggressive to earn breeding rights and that's a pretty big reward neutering often helps take these boys down a peg or two Dog Dog training Snooker Milton H.
