what did you do with your dog's ashes my dog is nearing death and i was wondering what everyone did with their ashes we don't want to bury them in the yard cause if we move then we won't have them anymore it would just be easier to tae them along what neat sentimental ways are there of keeping the ashes any good web sites for this type of thing not interested in spending an obscene amount of money but we do care for him a lot and have had him for years so i'm open for any suggestions if you know of any companies or whatever that specialize in this or of where you can look into this kind of thing please let me know i appreciate it much he's very close to my heart and like a brother to me make a garden stone out of quik crete the ashes and some pretty glass or pretty stones you can find a form at a hardware store like lowe's or home depot set pretty stones glass whatever reminds you of him in the bottom mix up the quik crete with your dogs ashes and pour slowly into the mold when the mold dries sets up you can remove it from the form remember things set in the form will be backwards from how you lay them when you view it from the top there are kits for this but they don't mention adding the ashes you can have a memorial box painted with a picture of your dog or a photo decoupaged onto the lid i used to do that for a living you can have the ashes pressed into a diamond Bong Casting Glass Pottery Theory of conduct Plastic Hamster Japanese tea ceremony Poker jargon Pok__mon Live!
