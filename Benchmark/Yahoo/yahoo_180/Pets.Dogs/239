dog suffering arthritis my dog is getting up there and hes suffering from severe arthritis especially in his right shoulder we took him to the vet and he put him on some medication big vet bill there and the meds don't really seem to work so we took him back to the vets office and they did x rays they know its arthritis and they prescribed him to quite a few meds but my dog is still acting like hes in pain its not all the time just when it rains snows etc does anyone know anything i could possibly do to keep him out of pain i bought like a heating pad that i put under his bed that seems to be working pretty well but he can't lay still for long anybody have any ideas the heating pad will definitely help you can safely give your dog glucosamine chondroitin tablets and they should help a lot my vet recommended them for my seventeen year old lab husky cross you do not have to purchase them from the vet just go into any health section of a store and look for the tablets that do not have dye and additives in them and they will be fine an important thing to remember with arthritis is that you have to keep moving the affected joint or it will actually worsen over time once i had my dog on the gly cond for about a month she enjoyed walking again and could even swim again which was one of her favorite play times swimming is great exercise with any joint pain as it will strengthen the muscles and tendons around the sore joint and make it a lot easier for the dog to move more comfortably you can even try massaging your dogs shoulder a bit if he will lie down on or near your lap this can be helpful also hope your pup feels better soon it's difficult when our furbabys don't feel well Osteoarthritis Equine conformation Repetitive strain injury Massage Chronic fatigue syndrome Paget's disease of bone Breastfeeding Fancy rat Guinea pig Dog training Psoriasis Fecal incontinence Swimming Hamster Fibromyalgia Mattress Rheumatoid arthritis Gout Dog Hormone replacement therapy (trans) First aid Clinical depression Pain Childbirth Migraine Tai Chi Chuan Milton H.
