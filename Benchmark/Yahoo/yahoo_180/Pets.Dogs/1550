my dog is neutered and housetrained for years but started peeing on rugs lately anyone have an idea why as with most of the answers you have already received could be an infection of many kinds best to get it checked out by a vet weeks ago i had my cat put down due to heart failure from a tumor a few months before she was peeing in the house at night very unlike her we thought she was just getting old so we put her out at night i wish i had taken her to the vets then it could be just a small sign that something else could be wrong don't make the same mistake as me take time to have your dog checked it could be old age but at least you won't have any regrets and you will know you did all you could for your dog it might be as simple as some medication to stop your dog from peeing on the rugs good luck i hope everything goes well at the vets Ferret Fancy rat Pet skunk Stomach cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Housebreaking Guinea pig Kakapo Garfield 2000 Australian Grand Prix Dog Randomness Urinary incontinence Socialization Humphrey Bogart The Apprentice 2 Social rule Philosophy of language Cancer Eric Bischoff Steven Wright Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Rabies Prostate cancer Heartworm Domestic rabbit Major League Baseball television contracts Veterinarian New York Giants Francis Bacon (painter) Pseudoscience Shaggy dog story Alanis Morissette Plame affair timeline Ron Weasley Hamster Traumatic incident reduction German grammar Saga (band) Aqua Teen Hunger Force Blue Peter Rocko's Modern Life The Price Is Right Traumatic brain injury Oh My Goddess!
