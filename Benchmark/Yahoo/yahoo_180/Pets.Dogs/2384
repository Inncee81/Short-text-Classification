i'm afraid there's something wrong with my puppy my almost one year old maltese mix keeps coming to be and crying then trying to get closer to me he's very intelligent so when i ask him do you have to go potty he jumps up and down if he does well since i thought this was the case i've taken him out several times in fact he keeps doing a very soft whine and then trying to get into my arms or be as close to me as possible which is uncharacteristic for him since he normally only lays at my feet at night what could be wrong with him he's not hungry or thirsty i give him plenty of attention sometimes to the point of excess actually so he's not doing it for that the to be was meant to say to me ' he keeps licking his lips and bobbing his head i don't know what to do for him and i'm really scared this dog is my baby all of this is really odd nothing new has happened in my life to bring this acting no new relationships animals nothing which means it's extra disturbing when we went outside to potty he did pee but when i watied for him to do the other he tried to run at our outside cat and came back to me as if he was done his nose is nice and wet and i'm not sure how to tell for tightness around his belly or how to take his temperature i live with my parents and i'm afraid to wake them about this problem because they have to get up for work in the morning and we have very little money and if we have to take him to the vet they'll make me be absolute on his condition i woke my mother up and we will not take him to the vet she insists that he's fine his nose is not moist and hot he keeps whining i am so angry i want to help him so badly when i mean attention to the point of excess i meant that i am home all the time have no job and he is with me constantly since he is a small breed if i do go somewhere he comes with me if i go out biking i have a basket for him to sit in he cannot stand to be away from me he even prefers my company than to that of the other dogs in the house i don't harass my dog and wake him out of a dead sleep or constantly cuddle him if he wants to be near me then he comes to me with a toy or jumps up beside me never in my lap he never sleeps next to me but only at my feet and sometimes on my side his nose keeps going from hot to cold i think his little gums look a light pink but i don't normally open his mouth to know the difference god i need help there is something wrong with him i've raised multiple puppies when they act like that as the other poster said they're trying to tell you something you didn't specify that when he acted as if he wanted to go outside you took him whether or not he ever tried to go at all has he been urinating normally routinely has his bowel movements been normal has he had the opportunity to get into anything that may be upsetting his stomach or causing a blockage of some sort check his gums see if they are nice pink which is normal take his temperature if you can't or don't know how to do the normal at home first aid to determine if he should be taken to the vet or not be safe take him into an emergency vet have him checked out good luck josi Housebreaking Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Cat Poker jargon Sin City Jam (TV series) Humphrey Bogart Aerial (dance move) Diving Guinea pig Fancy rat Avenue Q AFI 100 Years series Urinary incontinence Thermoregulation Garfield Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Grandview, U.S.A.
