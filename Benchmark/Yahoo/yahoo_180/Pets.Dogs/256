how often am i supposed to play with my dog i have a doberman pintcher that is months old she has a big back yard to play in i work full time and am not home all the time how often should i play with her am i giving her enough attention i spend weekends with her and some week nights she sleeps inside some nights she knows a few commands sit lay shake stay and fetch this is all i have been able to teach her so far i don't think there's anything wrong with keeping a dog if you work full time there are a lot of dogs that are mistreated and as long as you look after your dog well i'm sure that it's a lot happier than a lot of dogs are a big backyard is nice but no substitute for human attention you should spend as much time with your dog as you can fit in even when you aren't playing with them they like to be near you Dog training Dobermann Shaggy dog story Avenue Q Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Billboard Hot 100 Obedience training The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Reservoir Dogs Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Social rule Humphrey Bogart Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Emancipation of Mimi Roxette Theory of conduct Ocean's Twelve Bon Jovi Garfield The Death Gate Cycle RuneScape quests The Amber Spyglass Characters in the Smurfs Saturday Night Live Pitaten Housebreaking Rosa Parks Blood on the Tracks 2000 Australian Grand Prix Elvis Presley New Morning The Family from One End Street Thinks ...
