golden retriever calm down age i have a year old neutered obviously male golden retriever he's trained and very obedient inside and out i can walk him off leash as he responds my commands when he gets hyper as year old goldens will do i give him a down stay for several minutes and make him stay there no matter what's going on then i'll calmly release him and he'll usually be okay however when there is a highly exciting new situation someone coming to the door for instance it takes about two minutes for that command to get to him you can tell he's listening because he'll do the down stay but then his butt starts wiggling like he just can't get it to stay still and then he's up and hyper again oh and he gets plenty of exercise it's bad enough with normal guests but i'm pregnant with my first child my question is two fold one how might i train him to not be hyper in these situations it is a question of obedience but it's also a question of simply being able to perform the task i don't want to expect him to be able to do something that's simply too hard for him at his age the vet says he's the equivalent of an eight year old boy and he's got about the same attention span two at what age can i expect him to calm down like an adult dog i've heard around or but i know it's different for every breed any experience with goldens thanks i have two goldens i don't know if they are typical but they were pretty puppy like until they were each years old they are now it's great that your dogs are obedience trained but really nothing you can do can change their personalities especially when young these dogs need lots of exercise which it sounds like he's getting but you might try an extra walk a day even if it's just around the block also anything you can do to stimulate your dog's brain helps with excess energy too try a kong toy to keep him busy for a while or even have him perform a few tricks for a few minutes one thing that i use to tire my dogs out is basketballs in the yard my dogs love to play fetch and i throw the basketball across the yard and ask them to fetch it for me it takes at least minutes of hard exercise for them to retrieve it they use their noses and their paws soccer style to bring it back it makes them happy and it helps them burn off some energy i hope this gives you a few ideas on how to help them get rid of that extra energy good luck Dog training Dog Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story Social rule Housebreaking Poker jargon Aerial (dance move) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Dog agility The Shining (film) Ferret Autism Animal Crossing Mixed-breed dog One Tree Hill (TV series) Socialization Pitaten Little Britain Reservoir Dogs 1957 World Series Joke RuneScape quests Paragliding Time Out of Mind Nintendogs American football Labrador Retriever Australian Cattle Dog Shen Gong Wu Golden Retriever Milton H.
