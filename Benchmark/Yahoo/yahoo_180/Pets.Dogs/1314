my yorkie won't let me walk him so i've had this yorkie for about months he's months now and when i put him on the leash he doesn't have a problem with it but the minute he hits cement he tenses up and lays down but if i put him on the grass he goes wild and wants to run around like crazy he's an indoor dog and i feel bad he can't really go outside and enjoy himself so i guess my question is is there anything i can do to get him used to walking on the cement i've tried just sitting with him outside so he could get used to it but he won't budge help he's probably been in the house and his paws are tender and the cement is too hot for him you need to gradualy get his paws tough or walk him in the grass good luck don't walk him too far his little legs are short and it takes many steps to your one Dog training Shaggy dog story 1957 World Series Game show Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Reservoir Dogs New York Giants Luck Diving Professional wrestling slang Humphrey Bogart Sydney Riot of 1879 Tennis Equine conformation Obedience training Dog agility Horseshoe Aerial (dance move) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Shit AFI 100 Years series Don Budge Memorial Stadium, Clemson Rod Stewart Cat Billboard Hot 100 Horse gait Futurama (TV series - season 5) Detroit Tigers $ale of the Century Houston Astros Blonde on Blonde The Contender (television series) Dog Teen Girl Squad Guadalupe Mountains National Park Samuel Goldwyn Piccolo Junior Saga Planet Waves Investigation into the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 Professional wrestling holds Sheepshead American Black Bear 1986 World Series Cricket Poker jargon Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Lisa the Vegetarian Association of Tennis Professionals Social rule Iditarod Pittsburgh Steelers Tom Waits Lake District Foot U.S. presidential election, 2008 Yorkshire Terrier Theory of conduct National Football League Lore Singlish Good Morning, Vietnam Britney Spears Scarlet's Walk Professional wrestling match types Freddy Fender Trapping Beavis and Butt-head Russian joke Whose Line Is It Anyway?
