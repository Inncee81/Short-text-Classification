child safety barriers does anyone know where to get child safety boards instead of the child safety gate see i've a problem i don't have a child at home but a little puppy who enjoys entering my father's work room where there are alot of dangerous tools all over the place i would like to purchase a simple board to place at the entrance of the room door to prevent my puppy from coming in but this should not be just any ordinary board it should function the way a child safety gate functions which means it can be opened both ways by adults who choose to walk in and out please recommend i would recommend getting a simple and inexpensive piece of plywood you can install hook and eyes on each side and end that way when someone needs to g through they can unlock the hook and walk through then put it back it would be agood idea since it is solid so the puppy can't try to climb it but light enough to use as a barrier that is easy to move hope that helps Sailing Diving Fischer Random Chess School bus Glossary of climbing terms Sento Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) Dog training Surveillance Hamster Aerial (dance move) Digital circuit The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time weapons and items Japanese tea ceremony Car safety Anchor Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Electrical wiring The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Fancy rat Taikyoku shogi Skateboarding trick Drill bit Safety engineering RuneScape quests Elevator Chinglish Chess strategy and tactics Seismic retrofit Paragliding Glossary of firefighting terms C plus plus Linux Skinny Puppy Road safety Airbag Tocopherol Climbing equipment The Time Machine STS-61 Golden Gate Bridge Radio controlled airplane Glossary of firefighting equipment Air safety Suplex Natural Selection (computer game) French Defence Bone fracture Changeroom Baroque chess MTR Kitesurfing Firefighter Jumpstart 3rd Grade Light pollution CPU design Objective-C IBM PC compatible Autogyro Strap-on dildo G-Man (Half-Life) Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Swingout Child safety lock Roof and tunnel hacking Welding RuneScape locations Kitchen Buckingham Palace Thermal power station Cyberspace Dog Tag Burglar alarm Journey (band) The Shining (film) Top-bar hive Traffic light Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Eye Level crossing Domestic rabbit Garbage collection (computer science) Shaggy dog story Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Memorial Stadium, Clemson AmigaOS Wood Chess Rules of the road Chess opening Menstrual cup Palace of Westminster Heat Shakers Table saw Kasparov versus The World Glass Richard Chase
