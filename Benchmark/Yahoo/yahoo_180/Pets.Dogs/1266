rottweilers are they hard to care or handle be for for a small woman because they are a big solid dog what about temperment around children not young children older children who do not pull on dogs ears and stuff are they good watch dogs around the house what are some bad things about rotts thank you i grew up with a rottweiler and a doberman when i bought i house there was no doubt the first thing i would get was a rottweiler my first one was a rescue we did tons of training and he turned out to be great except for bone cancer at yrs old but he was a therapy dog and i promised him that i would always have a rottweiler so people can experience what a great dog they are but in doing so this takes a lot of time and consistency if you have a good amount of time to work with this breed by all means go for it but like others have said they are for the strong willed and leader all the time type people if you are not a leader be one with this dog now that i have another rott wks and making me a little sleepless and crazy i know that all my dedication will make hime the best he can be do not buy from just anybody dogs can be bred for certain traits oscar's parents are both therapy dogs he also was raised by a family for his first weeks very important meet the mom and or dad of the pups find a good trainer i believe that if you want a dog that will be able to handle kids elderly basic everyday stuff go with one that believes in positive training oscar had been responding extremely well to food the trainer can be a invaluable source of information stick with the training be consistent even though i have experience training dogs i will always go to a class so that my dog learns to listen to me even with other dogs around also i take my ten year old neighbor with me to training so he is used to both of us training him in fact at years old she could easily walk my pound rottweiler as he was trained to walk on a leash i e no pulling socialize your rott everyday everyday for his her life males are easier i think in this respect especially when he is a puppy use food so that interaction with all types of situations and people is a fun rewarding thing this was my mistake from my first rott i thiught is was all about socialization but it is more about positive socialization and my postal carrier is the best he carries treats and makes dogs sit for him talk about positive socialization do not baby him or reward pet feed pick up him at all if he is afraid of anything huge mistake for mostly small dog owners but it can lead to serious problems be consistent if you do not want him on furniture never let him get on it if you do not want him to jump on people or things correct him even if he is a cute little puppy rotts are the cutest puppies ever oscar is super popular right now and so many people look at me when i say off and ask them not pet him because he jumped on them geez he is only pounds no big deal until he is pounds and in the newspaper for knocking a kid down trust him in five years i never saw zeke protect me there was just never any reason to until two incidents changed my mind one day as we were walking some teenager was behind as he had a parka on and was making a lot of noise zeke acted a little strange so i pulled him over to let the person pass well as soon as the teen got up to us he lunged at my dog and said boo very loud well reading therapy well trained dog who could be walked by an year old went ballistic he growled showed all his teeth and lunged back at the kid of course he was on a leash but it was so hard to pull him back wow what an idiot kid but i praised my dog for protecting me i never knew he had it in him he protected me again when a kid was walking towards us with a shovel on his shoulder he viewed that as a threat and i can't blame him it was a scary sight the bad things about rotts is that they have a bad rap and there will be people who look funny at you or cross the street when you are walking or the real idiots will ask if you are going to breed him or want to breed him the other bad thing is that they a guard breed and they do not show stress or pain very well you have to constantly aware of what is going on when zeke had bone cancer they only way you could tell by the lump on his leg he acted the same even though physiologically he was in a lot of pain it was a tough decision as to when to put him down this is just such a passion for me after i had put my first one down i had many people express condolences and tell me that zeke had changed their minds about rottweilers whatever choice you make if you do right by the dog you will have an awesome time i wish you the best of times Dog Dobermann Domestic rabbit Garfield Humphrey Bogart Obedience training Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Falconry Shaggy dog story Diving Rottweiler Babe Ruth Aerial (dance move) German Shepherd Dog Fancy rat Hearing impairment Vegeta Milton H.
