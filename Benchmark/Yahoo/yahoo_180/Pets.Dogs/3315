how do you stop animal cruelty when you cant the cops do any thing my neibors has pit bulls havent seen alduts in months but can hear them last time i saw them they where wormy and under fed now i have two little puppies coming up theres bellys are bloated and you can see ticks when i call cops im told to call human socitiey then told call cops you know run around i have already went to mayor and county judges except for this last two puppies i have been trying to get something done for years last years puppies stavred to death actually you may not be getting the runaround i live outside chicago thankfully it went out of business but there was a pet store near me that we absolutely horrible would do things like put a puppy pen up then put in a bunch of puppies and leave them outside without any water all day long in degree heat ironically our vet has his office right next door to this place it would drive them out of their minds at the same time there were no laws that covered this type of thing and nothing that the vets law enforcement humane societies could do the issue was getting the laws changed once you get that done you can get something done the first thing you need to do is to make a list of what you think are violations then go to the police department with your list and ask them if there are any laws that cover these types of things if there is then they can't push you off to anyone else if there aren't any laws then you need to see what you can do to get laws passed it appears that humane societies have different authority in different parts of the country in illinois they have little to no authority at the same time the horse people through their organizations have had laws passed and can step in you need to find out who is responsible for what first Sin City Dog Police Dog training Housebreaking Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Capital punishment Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Livestock Rabies Murder Sheriff Beltway sniper attacks Socialization Theory of conduct Skinny Puppy Fox hunting Classified information Clancy Wiggum Tag Dobermann COPS (TV series) Docking American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Daylight saving time Tooth enamel German Shepherd Dog Athenian democracy Gay rights The Dalek Invasion of Earth Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Three Laws of Robotics The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe State Animal testing Chicago Police Department Trademark The Pilgrim's Progress Doctor Who (Enemy Within) Law of the People's Republic of China Tick The Death Gate Cycle Terri Schiavo Tennessee State Constitution Microchip implant (animal) Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Grandview, U.S.A.
