downstairs to watch the children open their easter baskets you stop in utter disbelief when you see that your mischievous puppy spot has beaten everyone to the baskets and has eaten the first ounce chocolate rabbit and has just started on the second one you have heard that chocolate is poisonous to dogs but is it true what should you do next the truth is chocolate contains theobromine that is toxic to dogs in sufficient quantities it is a xanthine compound in the same family of caffeine toxic levels the good news is that it takes on average a fairly large amount of theobromine mg per pound of your animal to cause a toxic reaction although there are variables to consider like the individual sensitivity animal size and chocolate concentration white chocolate contains mg per ounce of theobromine the toxic dose is ounces of white chocolate per pound of body weight for example pounds of white chocolate will cause signs of nervous system poisoning in a pound dog pounds in a pound dog milk chocolate contains mg per ounce of theobromine the toxic dose is one ounce of milk chocolate per pound of body weight for example one pound of milk chocolate is poisonous to the nervous system of

dog of pound for a pound dog baking chocolate contains mg per ounce of theobromine the toxic dose is ounces of baking chocolate per pound of body weight two one ounce squares of bakers chocolate is toxic to a pound dog one ounce for a pound dog it would seem that it is all right to let your dog have a chocolate treat every now and then if it is the right kind and it is not very often the problem with feeding a dog chocolate as a treat is that it develops a liking for chocolate since dogs do not seem to be as sensitive to bitter tastes as humans they may then eat the more toxic baker's chocolate or they may consume a toxic amount of milk or semi sweet chocolate if it can get into an improperly stored supply what are the signs of toxicity signs are most commonly seen within hours or less of chocolate ingestion excitement nervousness trembling vomiting diarrhea excessive thirst sometimes excessive urination muscle spasms seizures coma rare death rare likely due to heart rhythm abnormalities how is chocolate toxicity treated if you suspect that your pet has eaten chocolate more than the stray chocolate chip that fell on the floor call your veterinarian for advice the toxicity of theobromine is dose dependent this means that the size of your pet the type of chocolate and quantity of chocolate determine if or how toxic it is for your pet there is no specific antidote for theobromine toxicity medical treatments are supportive and may include all or some of the following iv fluids to prevent dehydration from vomiting diarrhea and or increased urination and to flush the theobromine out of the system emetics medications that induce vomiting used when the ingestion of chocolate is within four hours up to eight hours post chocolate ingestion may be effective activated charcoal for ingestion greater than four hours prior to treatment or for patients that show continued signs of toxicity anti seizure medications for patients having seizures and or muscle tremors cardiac medications for patients exhibiting irregular heart rates or rhythms what is the prognosis for chocolate toxicosis the expected course of chocolate toxicosis is to hours depending on the dosage and effectiveness of treatment prognosis is good if the chocolate is removed within two to four hours of ingestion prognosis is guarded in animals with advanced signs such as
