how do i take my hyper dog to get groomed i just took him today and they didnt let him in because hes scared of water and stuff should i just groom him at home suggestions please and thank you if you are able to groom him at home you can try that i get my dogs professionally groomed every two months they were scared at first but then they got used to it they don't enjoy it but they don't flip out anymore my groomer allows me to stay with my dogs during the session that way if they would get scared i am there she even lets me pet them while they are being groomed look in your yellow pages and try to find a groomer that works out of their home they are much more easy going than the ones who work out of pet stores i once took my dog to a pet store to have her groomed and when i came back i found out that they drugged her so that they could trim her easier i was furious however if your dog is so flipped out that you absolutely can't get her groomed you may want to talk to your vet about a mild sedative alot of dogs need them but that should be your choice and not the groomer's my dog had been on medication and what if there had been a reaction as long as it is prescribed by a vet that could be an option your dog doesn't understand that you are just trying to help him but it is important for him to have good hygiene it keeps dogs healthier i hope my advice helps Dog training Hamster Tooth enamel Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pet skunk Aerial (dance move) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Asthma Fancy rat Cat Stomach cancer Guinea pig Shaggy dog story Traumatic incident reduction Kodocha Pekingese Tobacco smoking The McGuire Sisters Prostate cancer Domestic rabbit Pet Sounds Sin City The Pet Sounds Sessions Veterinarian American Eskimo Dog Kim Possible Portuguese Water Dog Stuttering Road Rovers Shetland Sheepdog Insomnia Keeshond Dog Psoriasis Avenue Q Havanese Clinical depression Etiquette Teacher's Pet (Disney) Obedience training The Subtle Knife Folic acid Blue Peter Richard Chase Toilet paper Labrador Retriever Rabies Urinary incontinence Ferret Neighbours Eczema Monty Hall problem Kitchen Dumb & Dumber Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Medieval hunting Humphrey Bogart Reservoir Dogs Social rule Lisa the Vegetarian Girls Aloud The Invisibles Garfield Time Out of Mind Housebreaking Dilbert Addiction Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Airedale Terrier Microchip implant (animal) Shot of Love Theory of conduct Working dog Breastfeeding Rich Mullins Pug RuneScape quests Ethics Natural Hygiene The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Plame affair Bart chalkboard gags The Realm of the Elderlings/Characters The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Pharmaceutical company Hearing impairment The Fairly OddParents Randomness Maison Ikkoku Supermarket Shit Chronic fatigue syndrome Docking The Star Wars Holiday Special Insulin Homeopathy Neopets Blonde on Blonde Pet Alcoholics Anonymous
