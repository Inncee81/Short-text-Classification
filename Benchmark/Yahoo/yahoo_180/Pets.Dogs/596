have a couple of year old cats now have a new puppy one cat will run from puppy other cat slaps puppy when the puppy messes with my tortie she will slap or hiss at him to let him know that she wants nothing to do with his foolishness but the manx would follow the puppy around the first few days as if to keep an eye on him to make sure he wasn't doing anything bad now the puppy chases the manx i've tried to focus his attention on other things or hit a newspaper on something to make a loud noise and startle him but he goes right back to chasing my cat how do i get him to stop i don't want my poor cats to be stressed out b c of the new addition they are about twice the size of the puppy right now the tortie just has her attitude the manx will be laying somewhere and the puppy will go running up to him and chase him off he's a big sweetheart and both cats have had front paws declawed first never punish your puppy by putting them in their kennel for a time out your dog puppy shouldn't have bad feelings towards their kennel or they will associate it with being in trouble any time you put them in there you should think of another type of punishment that will be clear and to the point i will put my dog behind a baby gate so he can still see me but i would ignore him for a little while after about half and hour he stops looking at me lays down falls asleep when that happenss i figure his punishment was long enough and take the baby gate down i wouldn't worry about your cat slapping the puppy soon your puppy will learn that tortie is not a cat to mess with sounds like she sticks up for herself just fine with your manx i'd do my best to keep the puppy at a distance from her maybe if you hold your puppy back on a leash let the manx come to him and check things out we had a new puppy and my old dog didn't enjoy him so we put up the baby gate so that my old dog could get used to the idea of the puppy we would let them hang out in the same room keeping the puppy on leash and making sure our old dog wasn't being harassed too much then when our older dog had had enough for the time we would let him go on the other side of the baby gate we tried really hard to make sure our old dog knew we still cared about him so take the extra effort to give your cats affection but keep up the good work your cats will get used to the new addition soon Dog training Housebreaking Cat Shaggy dog story Dog Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Characters in the Smurfs 2000 Australian Grand Prix Skinny Puppy Obedience training Humphrey Bogart Social rule Aerial (dance move) Friends Poker jargon Tag Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Dog show Theory of conduct One Tree Hill (TV series) Garfield Pitaten EastEnders Manx (cat) The Ashlee Simpson Show Fancy rat Time Out of Mind Equine conformation Scenes from a Memory Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Paranoia Agent Jon Secada Hey Jude Basset Hound 2005 Belgian Grand Prix Blonde on Blonde The Catcher in the Rye Kasparov versus The World Socialization The Death Gate Cycle Rugrats Extras (sitcom) Isle of Man Girly Sick Puppy Mixed-breed dog Traumatic incident reduction IBM PC compatible Professional wrestling holds Pet skunk Street-Legal Dean Koontz Static Shock Singlish USS Tunny (SS-282) Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse 101 Dalmatians: The Series Fox hunting 1957 World Series Scooby-Doo Marilyn Monroe Shetland Sheepdog Infantilism The Amber Spyglass Animal Farm Reservoir Dogs Labrador Retriever Hall & Oates Kyle Broflovski Domestic rabbit Daredevil AFI 100 Years series Schutzhund Border Collie Out-of-body experience Guinea pig Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Professional wrestling attacks Nintendogs The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Jennifer Lopez One (Voyager episode) Greyhound Taikyoku shogi A Series of Unfortunate Events Iditarod Pok__mon Abilities Oh My Goddess!
