this will sound sick but can dogs have wet farts or something i don't mean to be sick but if you didn't want to hear this question you shouldn't have clicked on it my yr old male part pug part shih tzu leaks or something he just had his anal sacks emptied about weeks ago however sometimes when he is laying on the couch on someone's lap or in the vehicle when we're going a long way he leaks and gets a circle of stuff on your pants or wherever his rear end is rested on it smells so bad like dead fish or something horrible what could be wrong with my dog i love him so much but i don't know what's wrong with him and ideas it is perfectly normal and all dogs have this the problem is some dogs have it more noticeably than others when my dog got nervous or angry i was able to smell that same fishy scent i questioned my vet and they told me it is a defense mechanism just like skunks have and there is nothing we can really do about it so if you think it is abnormal i would contact your vet but other than that sorry to say the fish smell comes with the dog Skunk Flatulence Pet skunk Cat Joke Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Futurama (TV series - season 5) Toilet humour Dog Shaggy dog story Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Sin City Plame affair Russian joke Urinary incontinence Garfield Theory of conduct Little Britain Social rule Bradley Nowell Philosophy of language Teen Girl Squad Tire The Shining (film) Neighbours W.
