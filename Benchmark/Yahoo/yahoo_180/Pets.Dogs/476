what is a good reason my choco lab is pukeing in the am and shedding alot my year old pure bred chocolate lab baby girl was just seen by a vet the begging of july and said she was haveing a false preg now a month later she is pukeing every morning and shedding alot also our male pees on her alot when outside just terrioty i assume yes i want to bred her she is and being bred with a yearold male poodle for labordoodles that many close friends have said they would love to own i know its not cheap and i have done my research i am just wondering what the shedding and pukeing is about well i am feeding her beniful and the male dog isn't getting sick off of it she has been eating this brand of dog food for atleast years and she likes it as for the shedding thank you to you all i wasnt sure if it was seasonal or linked to something eles becuase it just seems like so much more than usual labordoodles are adorable and i am a responisible pet owner and my dogs have been approved by the vet as for makeing sure friends still want the puppies i know that out of the many we have spoken to they aren't acctually looking for a puppy but becuase they know baby and bear and think a mix would be adorable they would take one you all have such issues with allowing a litter of puppies but it is my understanding that many female dogs are unsettled and long to be mothers as much as u and i do why must i deny my dog that privilage becuase of some people online complaining as for grammer and spelling i am human don't read it if you don't approve i know people like the labordoodles and all the other 'strange breeds' they're coming up with now in which i can't think of any others right now make sure you spend time each day brushing her really good both with the growth of her hair and against it to get all the loose hair possible sometimes you can simply pull out clumps with your hands if you can tell where a bunch of loose hair is at i think you should have her checked by the vet to get the ok that she is and the boy is healthy and will be fine to reproduce with each other good luck i hope you do have people who will buy them from you so they don't end up at the humane society as pups that people don't can't have so perhaps you could get a deposit down on them to ensure they will have homes just a thought Dog Guinea pig Labrador Retriever Kodocha Dog training Keeshond Pet skunk Fancy rat Hamster Gray Wolf Toilet humour Ron and Fez Havanese Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Domestic rabbit Housebreaking House Mouse Humphrey Bogart Siberian Husky Ferret Garfield Phoebe Buffay's songs Mixed-breed dog Shaggy dog story Basset Hound Time Out of Mind Sharon Tate Friends Kim Possible AFI 100 Years series Poodle Golden Retriever Brian Griffin Animal testing Livestock Characters in the Smurfs Dobermann Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Negima Kakapo Socialization RuneScape quests Sin City Dairy One Piece minor characters Avenue Q Eucharist The Amber Spyglass Mnemonic The Ashlee Simpson Show Mountain Gorilla EastEnders Customs and etiquette of Japan Dog breed Milton H.
