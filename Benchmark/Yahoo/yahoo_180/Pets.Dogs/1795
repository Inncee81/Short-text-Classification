pregnant dog help we adopted a dog from the humane society about a month and a half ago we found out upon taking her to the vet that she was pregnant and they h s didn't tell us our vet estimated that she would be ready to have her puppies any day now we had her x rayed and she is having puppies my concern is that her temperature has been below for the past two days ranging from currently its when can i be expecting puppies the vet thought she would have them yesterday and i just want to make sure she is ok boy that's a surprise i bet you weren't expecting you know sometime the temp dropping is a indicator but not always you will find that she will go off her food and become very restless she will start to look for a dark hiding place to have her pups she will also follow you everywhere you can for now just keep a very close eye on her and she will let you know when it's time she will start to pant and dig in a spot like crazy if you don't already have a whelping box set up or a place for her to have the pups than your should get on that right away also she will drink plenty so when you take her outside to potty have her on a leash and do not leave her alone you may want to bring a towel with you too just in case she decides to drop a pup out there too i wish your the very best of luck Housebreaking Dog Dog training Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Guinea pig Scooby-Doo Gray Wolf Shaggy dog story Ron and Fez Shark Kodocha Socialization Poker jargon Nerpa One Tree Hill (TV series) Taikyoku shogi Social rule RuneScape quests Neighbours Pregnancy Skinny Puppy 2005 Iditarod 101 Dalmatians: The Series Craps Pete the Pup Friends Dog agility Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Betting (poker) Eddie Guerrero Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Ocean's Twelve Futurama (TV series - season 5) I Want to Hold Your Hand Fancy rat Sharon Tate The Dalek Invasion of Earth 2000 Australian Grand Prix The Contender (television series) Feral child Tag Hamster EastEnders Steven Wright Kill Bill Sea level rise Tenshinhan The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Knots Landing Fox hunting Beethoven (film) Boom Town (Doctor Who) Breath of Fire III About a Boy Abortion debate Draw poker The Inside Care Bears Obedience training Kakapo Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Nintendogs The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy The Lovely Bones Jon Secada Invader Zim Golden Retriever The Death Gate Cycle RuneScape locations Chocolate Thermoregulation Characters in the Smurfs Theory of conduct Rabbit Rais massacre Docking Hey Jude Squirrel Vampire The Shining (film) Marriage African American Vernacular English Plame affair The Apprentice 2 Time Out of Mind Elephant Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Quarashi Customs and etiquette of Japan Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Humphrey Bogart Sin City Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Past teachings of Prem Rawat Traumatic incident reduction Earless seal Climate of the United Kingdom Philip J.
