for people who know about dog behavior my puppy is digging in her water bowl she's an week old puppy not a specific breed i don't know what her parents where i have her bowl in my room on top of some newspaper she had been drinking politely but she started pawing at it and taking all the water out i told her no and seeing that she didn't stop i removed the plate and only offered it to her from time to time so she could drink but holding it and not putting it directly on the floor so she doesn't get a chance to 'dig' in it why is she digging in it how can i stop her from doing that i would like to have her bowl accesible to her all the time without getting my hardwood floor all wet she is the only dog the only other animal is a turtle but it's in the back yard first off stop holding it it just gives her attention and gets you involved in the drinking activity if she acts up take the dish away when she does it give it back and let her drink later as soon as she starts splashing take it away again she'll get the point pretty quickly just make sure its offered very frequently so that she doesnt go without water the elevated bowls are also a good idea it makes eating and drinking easier for most dogs and as a bonus should solve this problem Dog training Domestic rabbit Housebreaking Dog Volleyball Cat Theory of conduct Socialization Shaggy dog story Milton H.
