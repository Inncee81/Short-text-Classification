my dogs temperature has dropped to her temperature has dropped to and she has been doing dead soft wimpers is restless and cleaning herself she has been panting since am she is evidently very near to having her puppies i assume she is in whelp she should soon start to have stronger contractions just be there for her to reassure her she will start pushing and give little grunts each time she pushes when the first puppy appears hand it to her after you have carefully broken the membrane from around its face and she should do the rest when she has finished licking her puppy and cleaning it some dams will toss them around to clear the mucous from their mouths so don't be alarmed at this put the puppy to the teats and encourage it to latch on and suckle the mother i like to clear the mouths myself before handing the puppy over if you do this make sure you are wearing surgical gloves do this with each consecutive puppy that is born let your vet know she is about to produce her pups he will be able to talk you through it if you are in any way worried or anxious about anything don't let the dam push for more than two hours there may be a large puppy stuck in the birth canal sometimes a walk outside in the garden on a leash will help the puppy to pass through but be sure to take a clean cloth out with you if you take the mother outside in case she gives birth in your gaden it has happened to me get her straight indoors again back to her puppies and let her deal with them all puppies have an amazing sense of smell and will normally find the 'milk bar' on their own without any assistance good luck i hope all works well for you Breastfeeding Dog Dog training Skinny Puppy Shaggy dog story RuneScape quests Dairy Social rule New York Giants Poker jargon Guinea pig Escape from New York Housebreaking Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Drill bit Labrador Retriever Oral sex Toilet humour Dialysis Knife Professional wrestling throws The Lovely Bones Elephant Fire fighting Brewery Characters in the Smurfs Obedience training Vegeta Japanese tea ceremony Archery Textile manufacturing Volleyball Domestic goat Cleveland Browns Teen Girl Squad Scooby-Doo Bong 1957 World Series Cat Sin City Fecal incontinence Milton H.
