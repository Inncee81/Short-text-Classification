how do i introduce my new pup to my cat we just bought a month old cockapoo and she will be picked up two weeks from now has to get fixed and has one shot to go this gives us time to prepare my cat is a yr old orange tabby who is super spoiled he spends more time in my room than in my brother's and my parent's so we have decided to not let the dog come into my room since it is kinda the cat's room the only thing is i don't know how to introduce them my cat is very friendly he is just really picky when it comes to picking friends and is an indoor outdoor cat who mostly hangs w cats so i don't know how he will first react someone told me to have them greet outside and the dog should be in his crate so that the cat will get first sniff someone else said that i should not be carrying or be petting the pup when my cat is around the first two days so he doesn't get too jelous and seek revenge and to not force their meeting what worries me is the size of the pup compared to the size of my kitty kitty has claws p he doesn't have super sharp nails i trim them all the time i just leave some on because she spends time outside and i want him to be able to defend himself im pretty sure he won't do sumthing to the pup but im afraid the pup will jump on him but then again the cat should practice his agility month or week a month old cockapoo is likely to be almost full grown just kind of skinny so it shouldn't be that much smaller than your cat just let the dog into the house and let it explore it's likely that the cat will run and hide for the first few days cats are just like that let the cat do its thing and let the dog adjust to a new home just be wary of a curious puppy and any rough playing when i brought my bichon home he loved to play with the cats but didn't know the signs of okay i've had enough leave me alone and he ended up with a scratch on his eye luckily i was able to bring him to the vet the following morning and get some antibiotic ointment and all was fine but it was certainly scary the moral is supervise the interactions in the beginning but don't do any setup meeting it won't work the cat will freak out and the dog will want to play Cat Guinea pig Shaggy dog story Dog Garfield Hamster Housebreaking Dog training RuneScape quests Our Gang Taikyoku shogi Humphrey Bogart Domestic rabbit Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Kodocha Dog agility Pet skunk Piccolo Junior Saga Scooby-Doo One Tree Hill (TV series) The Smoking Room Ron Weasley Spidey Super Stories Sin City Care Bears The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Ben Johnson (athlete) Havanese Kim Possible Nine Inch Nails Monster Rancher monsters 101 Dalmatians: The Series Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Lovely Bones Poker jargon Mark Calaway Skinny Puppy Weebl and Bob Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Friends Negima Vegeta Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Blonde on Blonde Mixed-breed dog Ferret The Death Gate Cycle Eddie Guerrero Phoebe Buffay's songs Teacher's Pet (Disney) Dead Like Me Reservoir Dogs Ed, Edd n Eddy The Fairly OddParents Ren and Stimpy W.I.T.C.H.
