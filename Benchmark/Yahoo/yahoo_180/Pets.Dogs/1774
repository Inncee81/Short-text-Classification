i just sold my dog i had a year old pit bull male that i just sold he was a great dog but we had to sell him i decided to sell him for a couple reasons one we have other dogs total and it was becoming to much work the other reason was because he was aggressive with my other dogs if i would have kept him he would have spent every other day in a kennel and i hate to kennel my dogs he went to great family he will be there only dog and have acres to roam but i feel bad i miss my dog but i know this is what was best for him any one that has adopted an older dog how long did it take them to bond with your family did they miss there previous owners don't worry about him he's now in a good home with a nice family but i'm sure he misses you too German Shepherd Dog American Pit Bull Terrier Staffordshire Bull Terrier Dog agility United Kennel Club Jack Russell Terrier Crufts Dog show Dog Shaggy dog story Korea Jindo Dog Tina Turner Obedience training Breed-specific legislation Labrador Retriever Dog training Golden Retriever Breed registry Docking Billboard Hot 100 Greyhound racing Newfoundland (dog) Babe Ruth Havanese Nintendogs Breed club American Kennel Club Schutzhund Alaskan husky Rottweiler The Apprentice 2 Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show Belgian Shepherd Dog Weimaraner Los Angeles Clippers USS Sea Dog (SS-401) Kodocha Neighbours Toy dog Rocko's Modern Life Bon Jovi USA Network William Powell Terrier Scrooge McDuck American Eskimo Dog Dog fighting Working dog Housebreaking AFI 100 Years series Deflation (economics) Chicago Bulls The Family from One End Street Whippet Basset Hound Avenue Q Keeshond Beagle Philip J.
