my dog hacks and then nearly throws up the vet has him on antibiotics could it be kennel cough its more of a gag than a cough any ideas unfortunately you didn't give much info apparently the vet has him on antibiotics for some reason didn't he tell you what he thought the problem was i am assuming that the hacking was the reason the vet put him on medication and not that the medication made him start hacking i hope i'm correct kennel cough happens when dogs come into contact with other dogs who have kennel cough if your dog is around alot of other dogs then kennel cough is a possibility gagging however sounds different than a cough if your dog is not getting any better i would suggest giving the vet another call apparently your dog is not feeling well and i would hate for this to get worse have you checked the dog's throat to see if there is something stuck i am going to be worrying about your dog all night if it were my dog i would be calling the vet back or going to an emergency vet clinic hope you are able to help your dog out Pneumonia Garfield Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Dog Common cold Shaggy dog story Docking Asthma Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Greyhound racing Cancer of the larynx Microchip implant (animal) Chronic fatigue syndrome The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Crate training Pertussis Pet skunk Tuberculosis Traumatic incident reduction Milton H.
