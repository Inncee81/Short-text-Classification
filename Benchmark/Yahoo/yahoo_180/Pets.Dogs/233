whats the best whats the best way of dealing with a dog out on walks that doesnt like other dogs when a other dog is approaching should i put her put her on the lead and put her in sit stay or put her on the lead and march on past the other dog without saying a word we are starting agility at the end of this month and i need to tackle this problem fast thanks guys you absolutely do have to get her over her dog aggression before putting her in agility classes she won't be allowed to stay it's really hard to answer this without knowing exactly how bad your dog is what she does why she's doing it her history etc but try this go for a walk with a pocket full of treats she really likes when you see another dog approaching before she growls or lunges or whatever it is she does start giving her treats you also need to be sure you're not tensing up tightening the leash or anything like that beccause your tension travels down the leash to your dog and she thinks she's right to be aggressive or afraid whatever her problem is keep talking to her in an upbeat voice give her lots and lots of treats if you're very consistent pretty soon she's going to associate the appearance of another dog with her getting treats and she'll ignore the dog at some point you have to slowly wean her off the treats giving them only occasionally you might want to consider clicker training depending on her temperament an aggressive dog should absolutely never be off lead she's likely not reliable on recall either you'll be in a world of trouble if your off leash dog attacks another dog Dog training Dog agility Obedience training Theory of conduct Dog Poker jargon Aerial (dance move) Social rule English grammar Leash Unreal Milton H.
