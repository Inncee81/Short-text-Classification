what are some fun things to do with my yorkie well hes always just playing with my other dog or sleeping i need some fun things to do with him to increase our bond and be fun for both of us i am and my pupy is weeks old hes obviously a yorkie but we swim together and i brush him and he seems to like that just please give me some things to do with him so neether of us r bored kthankyouu hey kid i was found that making alot of body contact with my dogs was the best way to bond and if you watch dogs the first they do is try to sleep together now i know you sleep with the puppy but i mean when you are on the computer reading watching tv just keep in physical contact but then start talking to him then touch and get him to smell the things that you are referring to i teach all of my dogs contact touch commands to use their noses or paws to touch an object i pick it up and show it to them dogs are scent oriented so smelling the object is always part of the teaching then i say the object's name so in time he came to now many words bowl brush leash door etc dogs have lived with us for millions of years they have been very close observers of our culture they know us imitately use that history and their own hardwired ability to remember experiences and smells vividly see how far you can push the theory about how muc they can learn i had really big dogs so i was able to encourage them to lay on my feet or sit next to me when i was online i used to talk yeah that's right to my std poodle about what i was doing he actually seemed interested in what i was doing i let him smell the keyboard and i tapped the screen to get him to look at the images he was really good about sitting and watching and in fact as he got older took to watching tv with me cocking his head alot at the sounds and what images he could discern we spent quiet time together alot when i was doing even mundane things i would call him over and point to stuff and say the name of the objects he would sit and look and you could see him making the connection i was trying to see how far i could take his ability to learn human speech and understand english scientists that highly trained dogs can reach the cognition level of a year old child and i found that to be really true by the time he was y o arliss could understand many words and phrases so i could really just talk to him and he would do what i asked he seemed to be more fulfilled with these challenges i gave him and less bored friends and family would be weirded out at how aware he seemed it wasnt weird though i spent alot of time teaching him that stuff he's been dead for a while and still i miss him everyday all these years later good luck kid Dog training Shaggy dog story Dog Cognitive science Autism Philosophy of language Dog agility Social rule Obedience training Traumatic brain injury Milton H.
