has anyone spayed their female yorkie can you tell me around how old when you spayed you yorkie what is the size of your yorkie how may pounds how did she act the first few days after the spay i am asking the people already spayed their dog not ask should i do it or not i want to know their experiences yes i am doing to she is months still under lbs my vet told me to wait a little bit as i said i want experience from other people i am not to breed my stepmother has yorkies brother and sister from the same litter they're now almost years old she had the male neutered at months and the female at months because the vet wasn't quite satisfied with the female puppy's weight both surgeries went completely fine spay neuters are some of the simplest operations around and usually take under hour the dogs were sent home with painkiller and the only advice the vet gave was to make sure they didn't lick the stitches excessively or try to pull them out if your dog won't let the incision heal you may need to get one of the elizabethan collars to put around her neck for a few days until the stitches heal up but it's not pain that causes them to bother incisions it itches like a bad mosquito bite as the tissue heals so i would say consult your vet at months old if your pup is growing normally and is healthy they'll probably want to do it then thank you for spaying your dog and helping us to control the pet overpopulation problem soooooo many little dogs are abandoned these days when the 'it's a toy' part wears off and they discover it's really a dog Dog Domestic rabbit Cat Housebreaking Ferret Pet skunk Yorkshire Terrier Great Dane Pit bull Docking Feral cat Hamster Fancy rat Dobermann Prostate cancer Manx (cat) Sterilization (surgical procedure) Animal shelter Dog collar Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Breastfeeding Kitten Garfield Kodocha Gray Wolf Equine conformation Dog breed Cancer Adjustable gastric band Stomach cancer The Price Is Right Rabies Golden Retriever Castration Hip dysplasia Shaggy dog story Havanese Shrek 2 Blood on the Tracks Greyhound Milton H.
