why do dogs why do dogs hate it when you blow in their faces but love to stick their heads out of the car window while your driving my last two dogs have posed the same dilemma to me the reason seems to be that when you blow on their face it's a much more concentrated area ie the area of your compressed lips blowing air then when they stick their face out the car window in addition usually in cars its very hot especially to dogs so to them the breeze is very cooling to their entire face thus cooling their whole body Manual transmission Air conditioning Glass Turbocharger Hip hop collaborations Monsoon Fire fighting Sin City Oral sex Wind Sesshomaru The Amber Spyglass Dodge Neon Automobile Shaggy dog story Jet engine Solar power Fan (implement) Axial compressor Supercharger Excel Saga Ice hockey Weather lore Paul Is Dead Welding Engine cooling Severe weather terminology (United States) Car handling Fossil fuel power plant Internal combustion engine Chevrolet Corvair Trumpet Anemometer Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Station wagon Garfield Indianapolis 500 Volkswagen Type 2 Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Diesel engine Full Metal Panic?
