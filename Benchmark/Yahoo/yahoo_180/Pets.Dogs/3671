what is wrong with my dog i have a jack russell terrier about years old and she recently had an illness involving digestive problems a few days after she was noticed to be sick a bump appeared on her back about a centimeter diameter it sort of seemed like a puncture wound and it turned into a scab she kept picking at it and scratching it as it tried to heal and it became about inch wide and long and we put a cone shaped collar on her the one that looks like a lampshade she seemed to stop scratching it but when we weren't looking she would roll around and scratch it on the floor it is looking a little better than it used to but it still is a big scab looking object that she won't let heal any ideas has she had any shot recently my dog got a big bump after a vaccination at the injection site allergic reaction slight infection at the injection site he got big bump about a two weeks after the shot after another week it started oozing and scabbed over after it scabbed over it all went away and the pup is back to normal it took about weeks after it scabbed over sounds like your dog may have gotting a bug bite bee sting thorn from a bush i don't think it's related to her digestive problems however take her to the vet to be absolutely sure they can also give her any meds needed to heal the wound Guinea pig Allergy Dog Rabies Insulin Wound healing phases Tattoo Equine conformation Dog training Ferret Mast cell Chagas disease Tarantula Aerial (dance move) Group A streptococcal infection Tsetse fly Tire Spider Smallpox Cat Urinary incontinence Compact disc Multiple sclerosis Internal ballistics Ebola Wound Strap-on dildo Jackass: The Movie Scar Shot of Love The Invisibles Gramophone record Jack Russell Terrier Snake Mosquito Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Professional wrestling throws Leon White Tuberculosis Items in the Metroid series Billiards Professional wrestling slang Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Mantoux test Dog agility The Contender (television series) B-47 Stratojet Saturday Night Live 2000 Australian Grand Prix Winning Streak Apple Homeopathy Coeliac disease Hamster Scooby-Doo Fancy rat Volleyball Adjustable gastric band RuneScape quests Poker jargon Double bass Common cold Drill bit Spidey Super Stories Epistemology Shaggy dog story Iditarod Acne Body piercing First aid Philosophy of language Pneumonia Peanut World Championship Wrestling Vaccine Border Terrier Codename: Kids Next Door HIV The Parting of the Ways The Jazz Singer Influenza Days of our Lives Terminal ballistics Trade union Our Gang Textile manufacturing Carbon dioxide Malaria Kodocha Antiviral drug Eczema Spirit rover timeline for 2004 February Heinkel He 112 Dialysis The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Extreme Programming Swimming Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS
