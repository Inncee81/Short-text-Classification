advantage flea control didn't work at all about days ago i opened a new package and applied the recomended dosage to my month old border collie puppies and to my year old border collie hours later the dogs were going nuts with fleas the next day we redosed them things were quiet for a while but now the fleas are back in less then weeks anyone eles have this problem i think i got a bad batch the company where i ordered it said that the dogs have built up an immunity to the product i said they are only months old and have not been dosed that much i am in fla and it is terrible hot and i know the fleas are probably breeding like mad but i would think once they jump on dog they would be killed at least that was the plan wonderd if anyone had a bad batch theroy too ok i guess i should have been more specific they are not months old there are two puppies and they are now months old i don't know why i said m that's wrong vet said they really can't be overdosed and vet also said when the flea even jumps on the dog they are killed by advantage the problem was they were not that uncomfortable before treatment but hours later the dogs were going nuts also as per advantage product can be used weeks an older thanks to all that have responded and tried to assist we had a bad batch our dogs my mom applied it and just and the fleas never went away but the way advantage works all flea meds is the flea can only bite once then they die what we did was order it from a mag instead of outta the store and we sent it back for a new box because it never even attempted to work it's hot where we live so what we did was use flea dip on all the dog we should've done the retarted cat cause she gave my dog fleas again grrr lol ok n e way then we waited until the dogs dried off then put frontline we use that it has worked so far and we put some on the cat too lol hope you can help your puppies more tip you may wanna switch products and you could even get the next size up and put it on there because we have smaller dogs but we use the lb thing for them it actually does them some good Dog Flea Rabies Red Hot Chili Peppers Dog training Housebreaking Skinny Puppy Shaggy dog story Social rule Mixed-breed dog Billboard Hot 100 Socialization Heartworm Animal testing Hip hop collaborations Cat 2000 Australian Grand Prix Garfield Livestock Shetland Sheepdog Spidey Super Stories Border Collie Hamster John Frusciante Futurama (TV series - season 5) Border Terrier Theory of conduct Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Kakapo Insulin Donald Rumsfeld RuneScape quests Ferret Diabetes mellitus AFI 100 Years series Chocolate CPU cache Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Cure Ron and Fez Battle of the Bulge Caffeine 101 Dalmatians: The Series Hall & Oates Breed registry Reservoir Dogs Tina Turner Kurt Cobain Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Paracetamol Obedience training Chronic fatigue syndrome Firefighter Migraine LSD Dairy Jackass: The Movie Palindrome Dog show Piccolo Junior Saga Dog agility Poker jargon Tobacco Pet skunk Condom Sick Puppy Equine conformation 1957 World Series Hip hop rivalries Smooth Collie Greyhound The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Chess strategy and tactics Jennifer Lopez BattleTech technology The Inside Ashton-Tate Docking Polish September Campaign Steven Wright Dobermann Puppy mill USS Vestal (AR-4) I Want to Hold Your Hand Conker's Bad Fur Day EastEnders Management information system Extreme Programming Central processing unit Psoriasis Heinkel He 112 Nestl__ The Ashlee Simpson Show Red Hot Chili Peppers (album) Chemotherapy
