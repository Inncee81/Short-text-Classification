whats the right way to scold a puppy after he pees in the house we have a potty trained puppy the past week or so hes peed in the house a few times and its frustrating i knwo you dont rub their noses in it but what is the right way to scold him when he pees where hes not supposed to thanks oh and hes neutered so hes not marking mos old and he doesnt have an infection thanks again i have learned that you basically don't do anything unless you catch them in the act negative reinforcement is still reinforcement and a bad idea if you catch them you say no and take them directly outside when you are outside you tell them potty or whatever word you are using to get that point across Housebreaking Dog training Singlish Socialization Tattoo Dog Atomic Kitten Teen Girl Squad Reinforcement Fancy rat Stuttering Brian Griffin Cat Relative clause Toilet humour 101 Dalmatians: The Series Toilet Skinny Puppy Latin grammar German grammar Gerald Durrell Ron and Fez Domestic rabbit Milton H.
