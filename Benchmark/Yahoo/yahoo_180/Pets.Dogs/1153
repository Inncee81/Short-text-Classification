she is not eating well my pit is not eating much she just gave birth days ago and she is not eating near the amount i think she should she drinks alot she seems depressed one of the pups is dieing but he keeps holding on he wont eat even when we tried bottle feeding what should i do freaking out please help get some puppy formula from a pet store give the mother dog a puppy food version of the brand she is eating now and you can add a bit of the puppy formula to it too if she likes it or mix in a bit of cottage cheese or yogurt since hte puppy formula is expensive the pups need to be kept warm and you can feed them with an eyedropper to start or get a newborn nurser from your vet you will have to help the pups go potty after each feeding every two to three hrs this is very important keep them warm you can get a box that isn't too big and put the weak pup in it and get a hot water bottle putting it between and under a thick towel that has for the pup to lay on petsmart and petco sell these discs that you can heat up in the microwave and put between the towel like the hotwater bottle much more convenient and stores heat for hrs get two because you cannot reheat before it gets cool this works really good for keeping pups or kittens warm take the mom to the vet's for a vet check to see if there is a complication causing her to feel like she does you can take the weak pup when you go too but keep it warm i have raised orphaned pups from newborn so it is possible to save the weak one gl and please update to help potty take a warm soft cloth or large cotton ball with luke warm water on it and massage where the pup goes pee next to nothing may come out on the first few tries but if you are doing this every few hrs when feeding the pup will start peeing a lot soon you can then take another cotton ball and massage where the pup would go poo but it might not go the first few times don't be alarmed if the pup does not seem to be getting it with eating on the first few feeding attempts put the pup in a position like it would be if it was feeding from the mom not on it's back use the eyedropper or vet newborn bottle to start because the formula comes out easier don't try and squeeze it in the mouth just let a few drops come out because you don't want it getting in the lungs and nose after a few days of feeding the pup will start to latch on and suck out the formula you can sort of tickle its cheek area to stimulate sucking another possiblity if this is too much for you to do is to leave it with a vet tech to feed best chance to live though is someone who can feed it round the clock at home and then potty it every time during this time keep trying to re introduce it to the mother and hold it up to her to clean off when she does it good licking to help it potty then you can skip the cotton ball massaging ideal is to get it back on to her Hamster Guinea pig Dairy Ron and Fez Toilet humour Chocolate Sento Bong Dog training Scooby-Doo Cat Mattress Fire fighting Japanese toilet Plastic Domestic rabbit Fancy rat Massage Milk Pet skunk Dog Baby bottle Tofu Kodocha Poker jargon Fountain pen Tick Livestock Shark Elephant Chicken Fecal incontinence Drowning Tag Social rule Carburetor Menstrual cup RuneScape quests Characters in the Smurfs Shaggy dog story Aerial (dance move) Ferret Gramophone record Sauna Eric Cartman Knots Landing Cheese The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Mnemonic Strap-on dildo Kakapo Earless seal Soft drink Brewery Vampire Gray Wolf Kangaroo Happy Tree Friends First aid Nerpa The Marshall Mathers LP Yoghurt Breakfast Tea Conker's Bad Fur Day Pizza Housebreaking Infant Stomach cancer Microwave oven Manicure Hypothermia Aquemini Bread IPod Skinny Puppy Beer Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist The Amazing Race McDonald's Indianapolis 500 YuYu Hakusho Hyperthermia Caving Kitchen Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder M60 machine gun Taikyoku shogi Hypoglycemia Internal ballistics
