wtf whats the difference between a watch dog and guard dog some people are like watch dog high guard dog low yea i get it my shih tzu is crazy barking when some comes but wags its tail and going to the door happpily i'm not sure but i think a watch dog is a dog that barks or yaps when it hears something i think a guard dog would have more training and would growl and maybe attack the intruder i guess our dogs are watch dogs they yap yap yap they would probably run and hide if anyone came in so maybe what they're doing is yelling help help intruder approaching save me Dog Gray Wolf Bark (dog) USS Sea Dog (SS-401) Taekwondo Shih Tzu Nintendogs Wag the Dog Dog training Keeshond Montgomery Burns Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Dobermann Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Police dog Into the West (miniseries) G-Man (Half-Life) Teen Girl Squad Housebreaking The Star Wars Holiday Special Jersey Devil Bullmastiff One Minute Silence Resident Evil (film) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) USS Ammen (DD-527) Shetland Sheepdog Notable lines in the Star Wars series RuneScape quests Growlithe Rottweiler German Shepherd Dog Working dog 2005 Pacific typhoon season Akira Kurosawa Nova Scotia Duck-Tolling Retriever Luminoth Coyote Wishbone (television show) StarCraft Secret Missions Sonic the Hedgehog A-6 Intruder Escape from New York USS Wickes (DD-578) Jack Russell Terrier Gospel of Peter USS Mobile (CL-63) Angels in America USS Thatcher (DD-514) Toy dog USS Albacore (SS-218) Invader Zim The Champions The Dalek Invasion of Earth Spitz Pok__mon Abilities Crazy Horse Silent Night, Deadly Night USS Alabama (BB-60) USS Patterson (DD-392) Vegeta Beethoven (film) Dog show Futurama (TV series - season 5) StarCraft: Uprising Imperial guardian lions Texas A&M University The Brady Bunch The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Toilet humour Donald Neilson Late Night with Conan O'Brien USS The Sullivans (DD-537) Finnish Spitz Characters of Naruto Corneil and Bernie Kuala Lumpur Dog agility Yap The Inside The Tracey Ullman Show shorts USS Uhlmann (DD-687) Crate training Super Smash Bros.
