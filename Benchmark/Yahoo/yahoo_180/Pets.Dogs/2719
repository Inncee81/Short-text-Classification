beagle games hi what games do beagles like besides hunting my new beagle doesn't seem interested in fetching balls or frisbee she mostly likes to chew and dig any suggestions what i can do to make her happier with playing thanks i used to play find it with my beagle otis i would let him smell things toys treats kids lol and then hide them all over the yard or house then tell him to find it he would go sniffing across the yard or through the house and find evertything i had hidden and find my niece and nephew who had hidden then i would praise him and give him a treat once i thought one of my box turtles had goten out of it's pen and disappeared but otis came outside and i told him to find the turtle and put him in the turtle pen so he could get it's scent well he went over to a corner of the pen that i had already searched and started digging and pretty soon he had found the turtle which had buried itself about inches under the soil because beagles are scent hounds if they don't hunt these kind of games are ideal for them and help them to work off excess energy Beagle Scent hound Tag Dog Episodes of Lost (Season 1) EastEnders RuneScape quests Bart chalkboard gags Humphrey Bogart Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Beagle Boys Beagle 2 The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Friends Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Hamster The Star Wars Holiday Special Vegeta Carl Barks Fancy rat Table tennis The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask The Critic Theory of conduct The Voyage of the Beagle Olfaction Son Goten Franklin (television series) Nine Inch Nails Housebreaking Hunting Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Kurt Cobain Fox hunting The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show Inception of Darwin's theory Dr. Seuss The Legend of Zelda series enemies W.I.T.C.H.
