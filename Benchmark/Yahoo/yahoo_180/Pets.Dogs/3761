long trip with puppy i am getting a new puppy from my friend next week even though he's a rescue he's only two months old i know that puppy's don't gain bladder control for about four months of age so i know that i have to stop about once an hour but this trip is about hours how can this trip be more comfortable for the both of us my best advice is to crate puppy and use paper on bottom of crate to allow puppy to urinate i would take frequent stops to allow puppy to void as well as let him ware himself out and sleep put in some toys to occupy him as well he is likely to bark in the crate with you driving and his wanting to be with you kudos for you rescuing a puppy we need more people like you Dog training Crate training Socialization Nintendogs Dog Skinny Puppy American Eskimo Dog Havanese Ron and Fez Hush Puppies Guinea pig Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Public transport The Amber Spyglass 101 Dalmatians: The Series Gerald Durrell One Hundred and One Dalmatians Skinny Dip The Daily Show Urinary system Sick Puppy Puppy Linux Dobermann Basset Hound Oasis (band) Fancy rat Marilyn Monroe One Tree Hill (TV series) Case Closed Border Terrier Eddie Guerrero The Untouchables Stitch (Lilo & Stitch) Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Maltese (dog) Snoopy Transformers: Energon Toilet humour Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Vegeta Weekly World News HMS Electra (H27) Publication of Darwin's theory Battles of Lexington and Concord Napoleon B.
