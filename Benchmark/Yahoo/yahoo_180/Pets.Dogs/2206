switching my yorkie to a collar from a harness o k my lb yorkie mo hates his harness plus it is a pain when it gets wet etc he is a wonderful dog and trained to walk in heel he actually prances now when i walk him in his collar listens better more focused and need less of a tug to get him back in heel does anyone else out there walk their yorkie on a collar i am aware of collapsing trachea if he doesn't have it or show signs of it isn't this o k to do my vet says not to because of the breed history of c t the harness just isn't working i guess i want reassurance that i'm not harming my dog which is my and what signs will he give me if i am i do not pull on the collar he walks side by side with me i don't feel he's been hurt on the collar in fact the contrary the minute he sees the harness he will not approach me at all i have to tug on him to walk w me frequently on the harness i feel he is more comfortable with the collar just to let you all know i am seriously taking care not to injure my dog that being said phew had to let my defensiveness go i think i need to be open and really talk to more professionals about this matter has anyone actually caused harm to their dog the trouble with collapsing tracheas is that by the time your dog starts to show symptoms it can be too late to do much once your dog is affected by this there is no cure only ways to manage it the symptoms of this syndrome depend on the severity of the deterioration usually the dog will have difficulty breathing especially during exercise the deeper the pet tries to inhale the more the trachea collapses further restricting air flow similar to sucking on a straw too hard dogs with a collapsing trachea will generally cough as if trying to clear the airways and occasionally this cough will sound like a goose honk in very severe cases the tongue and gums will appear blue as breathing becomes restricted the treatment for a collapsed trachea can be costly and heartbreaking examination and radiographs x rays will generally be needed to confirm the diagnosis depending upon the severity of the condition medications will help veterinarians usually prescribe drugs to help dilate the airways the coughing is controlled by cough suppressants such as torbutrol if the pet is obese a stricter diet finally activity should be restricted and not encouraged with the help of medication and modification of lifestyle the collapsing trachea can be controlled in severe cases surgery to help open the airways may be beneficial but most cases are managed medically not surgically i know it may be easier to to control and manage your pup when on a collar but the question you have to ask is that enough of a reason to put your dog at risk to this condition especially considering the breed is already prone to it keep in mind that at months your dog is still a baby and with time and training he will likely get used to the harness good luck Asthma Urinary incontinence Equine conformation Pneumonia Prostate cancer Hypoglycemia Sleep apnea Breastfeeding Epilepsy Lung cancer Childbirth Dog Medicine Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma First aid Chronic fatigue syndrome Stomach cancer Dog training Autism Stroke Drowning Domestic rabbit Diabetes mellitus Traumatic brain injury Ferret Obesity Intracranial pressure Tobacco smoking Aortic dissection Migraine Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Osteoarthritis Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Hypertension Bipolar disorder Addiction Tuberculosis Clinical depression Stuttering Anorexia nervosa Carpal tunnel syndrome Guinea pig Cat Esophageal cancer Gastroesophageal reflux disease Endometriosis Methamphetamine Theory of conduct Insulin Crohn's disease Meditation Ulcerative colitis Iditarod Yorkshire Terrier Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Acute respiratory distress syndrome Cannabis (drug) Multiple sclerosis Abortion Convention on Psychotropic Substances Gout Hypnosis Fancy rat Myocardial infarction Atrial septal defect Parkinson's disease Cystic fibrosis AIDS Cephalic disorder Triage Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Emphysema Herpes simplex virus Pet skunk Coeliac disease Schizophrenia Growth hormone treatment Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Duchenne muscular dystrophy Aphasia Mechanical ventilation Pneumothorax Post Polio syndrome Animal testing Gray Wolf Kitesurfing Milton H.
