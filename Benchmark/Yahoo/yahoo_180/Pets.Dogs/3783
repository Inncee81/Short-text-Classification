rescuing a yr old female lab i have small kids months old and yrs old and am trying to find a good furry kid to add to the brood the local lab rescue called and has a yr old female yellow lab who they say is very laid back and shows no signs of aggressions what do you think what are our chances of bringing her into our home and all of the kids skin and furry getting along well together just curious since we're adoping an adult and not a pup what are people's experience with adult dogs and children any reputable rescue group will have tested the dog with kids prior to contacting you they'll also want to have a meeting between your family and the dog to see how it goes don t be taken in by the thinking that you have to have a puppy so that it will bond to you once a rescue dog knows that it s staying it will bond to you just as strongly as a puppy if not more so just a few reasons for adopting an adult dog instead of a puppy include a puppy could grow to be larger than expected with an adult you already know how big the dog is and whether it s too big for your home a puppy will need to be housebroken an adult is often already housebroken and crate trained a puppy will go through that destructive stage an adult will have already outgrown those destructive tendencies having a puppy is a lot of work an adult dog is often much easier to integrate into the household most of our dogs lived in a home before they ended up in rescue so they can easily adapt to the hustle and bustle of a home and pick up on the household routine quickly Dog training Dog Housebreaking Fancy rat Socialization American Pit Bull Terrier Vegeta Crate training Golden Retriever Scooby-Doo Hamster German Shepherd Dog Shetland Sheepdog Gray Wolf Puppy mill Zoophilia Beethoven (film) Diseases of the honeybee People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Stitch (Lilo & Stitch) The Fairly OddParents Komondor Havanese Kender Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier Sheryl Crow Obedience training Perfect Dark Mixed-breed dog Domestic rabbit Guinea pig Animal testing Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Younger versions of cartoon characters Care Bears Asperger syndrome Skinny Puppy American Eskimo Dog One Tree Hill (TV series) Docking Plame affair Border Terrier Dog agility Syphon Filter Social rule Working dog Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Adult attention-deficit disorder Nintendogs USS Sea Dog (SS-401) Korean adoptee Great Dane The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Rottweiler Scouting Kakapo Treecat Daria Extreme Programming Pharmacopoeia Kodocha The Critic Snoopy Contract Tick Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers Paranoia Agent RuneScape quests Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Puberty Breed registry Equilibrium (2002 film) Schutzhund Kid Buu Saga Homeschooling Unreal Spot the Dog Stem cell Second language acquisition Pit bull Third Culture Kid Pluto (Disney) The Brady Bunch Tooth enamel The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Autism Clancy Wiggum Gun dog Norway national football team Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Peanuts The Wiggles Australian Cattle Dog GoldenEye 007 Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder
