is my maltese actually a purebred every maltese i see is about the size of my puppy she is months old and weighs a little over lbs she is not fat just kind of big i know the most a maltese should weigh is about lbs or so and she is still growing i don't really care what size she is but i paid for a dog the store claimed was purebred i have her birth certifcate and she is registered is it ok for her to be this big she is almost the size of my male bichon who is lbs at years old so you bought this pup at a pet store that means it's from a puppy mill and is poorly bred and there is a good chance it's not purebred puppy mills don't really take much care in who breeds who they also breed brother sister and other inbreedings they are only about profit it's too bad because for you could have gotten a well breed akc registered maltese from a responsible breeder i know most the dogs i see from pet stores don't look much like the 'breed' they are supposed to be you are also probably facing a lot of genectic health problems with your puppy something else you would have less likely happen if the pup was from a responsible breeder oh and what is the registration on your dog ckc aca these are fake registries the pet stores use to fool you into thinking you are getting a quality dog of course many are also akc registered but akc registration does not mean the dog is quality or healthy and in the case of puppy mills it really does not even mean they are purebred yes you can have dna done to be sure but what is really the point spay her love her and hope her health problems are not too bad American Kennel Club Mixed-breed dog Dog Labrador Retriever Dog breed Puppy mill Golden Retriever Dog breeding Havanese Breed registry Docking Guinea pig Dog show Border Collie Dobermann Selective breeding Toy dog Hamster United Kennel Club Domestic rabbit Humphrey Bogart German Shepherd Dog American Pit Bull Terrier Keeshond Jack Russell Terrier Whippet Pet store Maltese (dog) Cat Greyhound Horse Smooth Collie Obedience training Housebreaking Siberian Husky Chihuahua (dog) Dog agility Health insurance Boston Terrier American Cocker Spaniel Rat Terrier Australian Shepherd Yorkshire Terrier Pekingese Border Terrier Miniature Schnauzer Chinook (dog) Great Dane Belgian Shepherd Dog Australian Kelpie Liger Ferret Manx (cat) English Cocker Spaniel Terrier Discus (fish) Poodle Alaskan husky Korea Jindo Dog West Highland White Terrier Fancy rat Shetland Sheepdog Afghan Hound Cheetah Pomeranian (dog) 101 Dalmatians: The Series Dog hybrids and crossbreeds German Shorthaired Pointer Icelandic Sheepdog Pit bull Toy Fox Terrier Domestic goat Show cat Pet skunk Bulldog Bichon Fris__ Pyrenean Shepherd Cavalier King Charles Spaniel English Springer Spaniel Best of Breed Hip dysplasia Scooby-Doo Gray Wolf Trademark Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show Irish Wolfhound Neopets Socialization Shaggy dog story American Eskimo Dog Dog training Tibetan Spaniel Our Gang Basset Hound Canary Dogue de Bordeaux
