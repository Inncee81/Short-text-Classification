my dogs water problems ok this summer we my family went to texas we took my dog to so anyways we stayed in my cosins house they have a undergroung pool very big i was trying to make my dog go in but he like wants to but dose not have the guts to jump in is there anyway i can get him into getting in we have a lab that is the same way he loves the water once he gets in but will stand at the edge of the water pawing and whining we just encourage him until he decides it's sage i would never recommend just throwing a dog in that could make them fearful of the water if you hunt and your dog is a retriever you really don't want them to just jump into the water because they could impale themselves on sticks but if you just want them to play around in a pool with clear water then that isn't a problem Dog Poker jargon Diving Obedience training Dog agility Shaggy dog story Gray Wolf Swimming pool Futurama (TV series - season 5) Tag Labrador Retriever Dog (Half-Life 2) Into the West (miniseries) Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man Professional wrestling match types Dog training Golden Retriever Billiards Happy Tree Friends The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Taikyoku shogi The O.C.
