inside vs outside dog my first dog i had was mainly an outside dog because my dad didn't want to deal with the dog having accidents all over the house the only time he was allowed in the house is when my aunt would sneak him in while my dad wasn't there however i'm getting a new dog very soon and with the weather being so hot my dad thinks it's abuse to leave the dog outside all the time which do you prefer i have heard people say it's abuse and heard people say if you bring them in the house you're treating them like people instead of dogs i think the dog should stay inside for the most part at least am i basically the only one who thinks this way i definitely adore dogs i think they should be a part of the family definitely agree with that and i take full responsibility for my dog since i'm the one who's getting him and going to be taking care of him i will train him myself and not mind having to deal with an accident or two i just wanted to hear other opinions i agree with your answers thanks no you're in the majority in thinking the dog should be inside leaving a dog outside is definitely abuse treat your dog like a companion as he or she will treat you so what if the dog has a accidents at first when you're training him don't let him on the carpet if you're worried about it getting stained keep him in the bathroom or kitchen or laundry room etc if you train the dog correctly and are at least a little bit attentive to it it will never make an accident in the house dogs aim to please you and if they know that they're not supposed to potty in the house they won't in fear of displeasing you dogs want to do the right thing the right thing being the thing you have properly trained it to do not only is it often too hot outside for dogs but there are also critters in certain parts of the country that can pose danger to dogs there are bushes trees plants etc that dogs will eat that can actually be poison to them just throwing them outside cause eff em they're just dogs is cruel a dog will be your best friend if you let him would you lock your best friend out of the house all the time just my opinion hope it helps Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Spidey Super Stories The Death Gate Cycle Dog training Social rule Theory of conduct One Tree Hill (TV series) Elvis Presley The Shining (film) Piccolo Junior Saga Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Game show The Fairly OddParents EastEnders Fathers' rights Lisa the Vegetarian Infantilism Billboard Hot 100 Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Inside Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse 2005 trial of Michael Jackson The Life and Times of Juniper Lee StarCraft: Uprising The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Doug Philip J.
