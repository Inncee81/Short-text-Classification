potty training my new dog years old is potty trained and never well can't say never but hardly goes in the house when i take her outside in the afternoons and evening she will go ususally after two minutes of walking her around the yard however in the morning before our walk she will not use the restroom in the yard i walk her around the yard for about ten minutes trying to get her to use the restroom before we start walking i then give up and we start for our walk which of course she goes just about the time we pass the neighbor's yard it's as if she knows we're walking and thinks why go in my yard when there are other yards i'd like to make it routine that we don't walk until she goes how do i relate this to her thanks what you need to do is take her back in the house when she doesn't go wait ten minutes and try again when she finally does go she can't hold it in forever give her a treat and praise praise praise then you can proceed with her walk she will pick up on the message you are trying to send her very quickly good luck Dog training USS Tunny (SS-282) Pittsburgh Steelers USS The Sullivans (DD-537) USS Whale (SS-239) USS Yorktown (CV-10) USS Sea Devil (SS-400) New York Giants USS Thresher (SS-200) USS Uhlmann (DD-687) Cleveland Browns USS Walke (DD-416) 1957 World Series USS Wichita (CA-45) Super Bowl XXVII USS Waters (DD-115) New York Jets USS Aylwin (DD-355) Super Bowl XIX United Airlines Flight 93 Toilet humour New England Patriots Shaggy dog story Oh My Goddess!
