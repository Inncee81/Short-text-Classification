pitbull staffbull mix hey wats up i have a weeks pitbull and staffordshire bull terrier mix is it ok to take him to a doctor to crop ears beacuse i never see a stafforshire bull terrier with ears cropped but american staffordshire yeah so what u think pitbull and staffordshire i mean its part of pitbull right is it cool and noooo of coruse not i will not fight them i love dogs i have pitbulls i've been have them years i love them i don't know about staffordshire i never seen them with ears cropped so thanks everyone for answer much love cropping a dog's ears is a lot like human babies getting circumcised it isn't necessary but if you do it at the proper age and do it properly it does no harm if you are into cropped ears go right ahead personally i prefer all of my pits to have natural ears this is only because if they ever do get loose people will be less likely to recognize them as pit bulls and shoot them also there are some ignorant people in the world who really think you must be fighting your dogs if you crop there ears this is not true but people do think it is thankfully none of my dogs have gotten loose and even if they did i won't allow a people mean pit to live even if it is mine however cropping a pit bull's ears is much different than what is done with dobermans and great danes make sure you go to a vet that has experience with cropping the ears of pits you don't care about how many other breeds he or she has cropped if it's done wrong probably the worst that will happen is that your dog will look goofy but it will look goofy for life make sure you get someone who knows what they are doing el chistoso American Pit Bull Terrier Pit bull Dog Staffordshire Bull Terrier Dobermann Terrier Docking Boston Terrier Dog show Bull Terrier Mange Miniature Pinscher Great Dane Skye Terrier Mixed-breed dog Argentine Dogo Humphrey Bogart German Shepherd Dog Breastfeeding Keeshond The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Griffon Bruxellois Breed-specific legislation Breed standard Kyle Broflovski Hemp AFI 100 Years series Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an American Bulldog Ferret Fox hunting Jennifer Lopez Veterinarian Billboard Hot 100 Welsh Terrier Social rule Fancy rat Insane Clown Posse Zoophilia Hip hop collaborations Livestock ECW One Night Stand Tenterfield Terrier Singlish Toy Fox Terrier Goofy Tibetan Terrier Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 Bullfighting Elephant Artificial selection Fox Terrier (Smooth) Radio Yerevan Human sexual behavior Dog fighting Futurama (TV series - season 3) Shaggy dog story Hiberno-English Shetland Sheepdog Conan the Barbarian Basset Hound Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius Factory farming YuYu Hakusho Dog breed She Loves You Jon Secada Cliff Richard EastEnders Chicago Bulls Miniature Fox Terrier Futurama (TV series - season 5) Ex-gay Garfield Cat Domestication Time Out of Mind Domestic rabbit Abortion debate Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Shot of Love Monster Rancher monsters Infantilism Pete the Pup Hearing impairment Scooby-Doo Gamera vs. Jiger Maltese (dog) Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Rat Terrier Capital punishment Gray Wolf Doug Theodicy
