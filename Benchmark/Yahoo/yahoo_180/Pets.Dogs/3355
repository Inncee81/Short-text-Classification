humans better than animals well thank you i'm glad to find out that i'm talking with real animal lovers i realy enjoyed your answers to your dog is just for your own benefit question sorry for that test but i felt i can't find any interesting topics to discuss so this is my next chalenge no i think animals are better than humans because they are not phoney they love you despite your deficiencies they greet you like a long lost friend when you've only been gone minutes dogs do anyway wait outside the garage door patiently while you unload the car and bring the shopping in my cat does anyway and if they are annoyed they let you or another animal know about it right away they don't go away and fester grievences and plot how to get you back or make b mbs to destroy thousands of people who had nothing to do with the hurt that happened to them and unless you brutally abuse them which some weak pathetic creatures do they are very loving and forgiving i hope no one on this group would hurt an animal but sadly there are a lot of people who do and it's not fair because they are the living beings who probably love us better than we've been loved since we were babies and they are so easy to love too ps they don't make other animals extinct on a grand scale either Pitaten Shaggy dog story Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an EastEnders Social rule God Emperor of Dune Jon Secada Neighbours Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Theory of conduct Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Friends RuneScape quests The Amber Spyglass Jam (TV series) Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Jennifer Lopez Zoophilia Columbine High School massacre Zagreus (Doctor Who audio) Animal rights Little Britain Alignment (role-playing games) Inception of Darwin's theory The Jazz Singer Knots Landing Tidus Time Out of Mind The Death Gate Cycle Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Ecco the Dolphin Theodicy Sesshomaru One Tree Hill (TV series) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Champions Code: Lyoko Innocence: Ghost in the Shell Kangaroo Muslim ibn Aqeel Methos Abduction Phenomenon Ayyavazhi mythology InuYasha (character) The Smoking Room Prostate cancer The Life and Times of Juniper Lee A Course In Miracles The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex The Inside Mississippi John Hurt Jean Grey The Subtle Knife Garfield AFI 100 Years series Hide and Q (TNG episode) Sheikh Abdullah Cliff Richard The Suffering (game) Infantilism Lycanthropy Father's Day (Doctor Who) Dogville W.I.T.C.H.
