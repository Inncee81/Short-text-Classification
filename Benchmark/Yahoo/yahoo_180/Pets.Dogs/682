puppy help my puppy is a very good dog she is weeks old and is a very well behaved puppy she is extremely calm and very quiet we have trained her to stay in her kennel over night but lately we have been woken up by her multiple times during the night she barks like crazy so she can go outside and pee but she barks at and we let her out without speaking to her then she goes then we put her back in her kennel and go to bed at she does the same thing same as and then what can we do to stop this how do we scold her please help every time she goes out she pees i take her out a ton during the day and she always pees poops i make sure she goes before we put her up for the night first of all make sure every day you take her out at least times morining evening and before bed then if she still needs to go in beetween take her no more than once if she still has to go at night tell her firmly no and go back to bed if you have a door to your yard i suggest buying a doggy door so that she can go buy herself if none of that works for you then you just need to take her out more during the day and she won't wake yo up at night good luck Dog training Dog Housebreaking Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story Nintendogs Crate training American Eskimo Dog Labrador Retriever Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Dog show Toilet humour Skinny Puppy 101 Dalmatians: The Series USS Yorktown (CV-10) Basset Hound Shetland Sheepdog Pitaten The Shining (film) American Kennel Club Little Girl Lost (The Twilight Zone) Social rule Humphrey Bogart Obedience training Ron and Fez Breed registry Sick Puppy Insomnia Belgian Shepherd Dog The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Golden Retriever Alaskan husky Eddie Guerrero Dean Koontz Customs and etiquette of Japan Daz Dillinger German Shepherd Dog Keeshond Meat Loaf USS America (CV-66) Crufts Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) USS Thompson (DD-627) Futurama (TV series - season 5) Socialization Tag 2005 Belgian Grand Prix USS Tunny (SS-282) USS Ticonderoga (CV-14) Strap-on dildo Sin City The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe United Kennel Club Dog breeding Snoop Dogg Barque USS Seadragon (SS-194) USS Wichita (CA-45) USS Taylor (DD-468) Slow Train Coming Carl Barks Charles Bukowski Mattress Kill Bill USS Trigger (SS-237) Rottweiler Trapped in the Closet USS Allen M.
