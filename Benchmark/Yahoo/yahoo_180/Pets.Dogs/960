i was sold a sick dog what should i do i bought a m o great dane puppy july from a lady in the classifieds tx we brought her home but a couple things i noticed were strange her temp was high all she did was sleep didn't eat i just thought it was because she needed to get used to her new home august i had to take her to the vet b c she was extremely skinny she was not coming out of the closet all she wanted to do was lie in a place where no one could find her i called the lady she was very rude to me after i told her about the situation i took her to the vet he said he would keep her til friday and run some tests on her went to the vet yesterday to find out that my puppy had died from parvo an extreme case of hook worms i am still really sad but at the same time angry that someone would sell me a sick dog what should i do i have called the lady more times now but she ignores my calls my dad told me to take her to small claims court but what kind of proof do i need please help first of all i am very sorry for the loss of your puppy even in a week's time she was becoming your buddy she was just too sick too make her suffering of worms temperature and parvo not happen to another one of this woman's dogs if she has parvo in the house it is still there the pups did not get vaccinations against it because she was already months old i am betting the woman knew the pup was sick was she the only puppy for sale she might have wanted to keep her as a puppy miller and then dumped her on you when the pup got sick i am surprised you and your dad did not react sooner to her not eating days is enough without food a great dane pup loves to eat did you get a contract did you have the puppy health checked within the first week did you call the vet as soon as you noted her temp was high record the temperatures now on the calendar as you took them as record did you write down the day she became sick i am not sure how the law covers hookworms but if the woman does not have a veterinarian record of worming the litter identifying the age and breed of puppy then she is also selling you an unhealthy dog the infestation took a while to get that heavy before you bought the pup seek a consultation with an attorney the dog will be considered property or a 'product ' this way the law will upon the price and keep of the dog if you traveled far and incurred expenses add that on did you have her buried or have a bill from her burial you may get punitive or compensatory damages from emotional distress call up local tv stations that have investigators for citizens complaints try several time to get them to cover your story because the other puppies and dam are probably sick too contact the akc even if you did not send in the registration papers if they are ukc same thing i doubt ckc continental kennel club or any of the other useless registries will do anything ask akc or ukc to have the woman's kennel inspected and the records inspected did the woman tell you if she belonged to a club did the woman give you the health record of the pup and give you the name of your vet if not get someone maybe a man using a different phone number to call about her pups if she has anymore there are ways to get at this either the attorney or the person can try to buy a pup and say they live in the same area and want to continue to use the same vet because they don't have one who do you use report the person immediately to the great dane clubs so they can put this person on the black lists do not buy from breeders do not sale to and do not adopt to http www gdca
