is it someone's fault please don't view this as an ignorant question i've done so much reflection on the matter and have yet to come to a conclusion i am a professional pet sitter so i come in contact with a wide variety of dogs i also have two dogs of my own this is what causes me to ponder this question my dogs are for the most part very well behaved and extremely easy to care for even the month old puppy he hasn't given us one problem since we got him months ago i see so many dogs who have way too much energy that's not the real problem though it's that they don't know how to appropriately release it some are absolutely impossible to control because they completely ignore the few commands that they actually do know in your experience and opinion is this the owner's fault or do some dogs just have a lot more energy to exert than others it's hard for me to understand why so many dogs are so difficult to manage when mine give me almost no trouble at all some dogs some breeds are hyper and high energy sometimes it is just that the owner isn't giving them enough exercise or attention a hyper sheltie or a hyper boston aren't unusual if you see a hyper basset you can almost be sure it is the owner's fault i guess it would depend on the circumstances and breed in each case not all dogs are for all people i know i would never do well with a really hyper breed i just don't have the speed or energy for it some people would never enjoy a clumber spaniel they sleep almost all the time it's important for people to match their dog choice to their lifestyle it will turn out better for all of them that way Dog Mixed-breed dog Dog training Housebreaking Shetland Sheepdog Basset Hound Dog agility Philosophical skepticism Obedience training American Pit Bull Terrier Alaskan husky Equine conformation Quantum mechanics Electrophysiology The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Zoophilia Golden Retriever Sexual orientation Philosophy of language Fancy rat The nature of God in Western theology Social rule Determinism Nintendogs Dobermann English Springer Spaniel Domestication Border Collie Labrador Retriever Badminton Species German Shepherd Dog Abortion debate Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Livestock Whippet Dog show Crate training Faster-than-light Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Beatmania IIDX Ferret Puppy mill Cat Entropy Pug Ontological argument Password Havanese Abduction Phenomenon Shadow the Hedgehog Dog breed Nuclear fission Border Terrier Plame affair Docking Mass Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Aikido Randomness Belgian Shepherd Dog Nuclear fusion Dog breeding Humphrey Bogart Software engineering Debugging Chronic fatigue syndrome Daria Science Shaggy dog story Human Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Cultural relativism English Cocker Spaniel Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Guinea pig Fast bowling Probability Aphasia Australian Cattle Dog Exact solutions in general relativity Measurement in quantum mechanics Particle physics Working dog Fox hunting Phase (matter) Extreme Programming Maltese (dog) Dachshund American Cocker Spaniel Fermi paradox Toy dog Microeconomics Law of value Software testing Spaniel
