my very cute puppy is months old and i'm thinking it's time to spay her i want to know how long after her operation can i take her home will i have to feed her and carry her to her newspapers or will she be able to walk when can i take her for a walk can i bathe her a week later or i have to wait longer will she seem in pain when she's awake will her personality change less play and less cuteness i'm stressed about it so please let me know what to expect i know exactly how you feel i am such a worry wort when it comes to my dogs it is the perfect time to spay your puppy they usually keep females over night then you pick them up the next morning she might be a little tired an out of it when you take her home she should be able to walk fine she may not eat as much as she use to the first day or two my little guy didn't drink that much either so i gave him ice every so often you'll just need to be careful not to give her too much to eat remember that she is going about a day with no food so if she eats too much she may get sick and that may cause bleeding where the cut is i have seen some vets use dissolvable stitches and some use glue either way if this gets wet it will disappear quicker than it is supposed to so it will probably be a week or two before you can get her wet my guy had stitches so it was two weeks she should be able to walk to her newspapers or outside to go to the bathroom she will probably just be tired for a day or two i don't think her personality will change that mostly happens in males making them usually less aggressive good luck Social rule Housebreaking Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dog training Cat Breastfeeding Garfield Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Socialization Humphrey Bogart Customs and etiquette of Japan Fecal incontinence Stomach cancer Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Fasting The Shining (film) Piccolo Junior Saga Time Out of Mind Shaggy dog story Docking The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie 1957 World Series Richard Chase Kodocha Brian Griffin Skinny Dip Pet skunk Ron and Fez Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Urinary incontinence Spidey Super Stories Kitten Saga (band) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Characters in the Smurfs Journey (band) Pregnancy Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Sandy Koufax Jon Secada The Marshall Mathers LP Chicken Grammatical aspect Night (book) Childbirth Spider Brewery Mattress Clinical depression Futurama (TV series - season 2) Steven Wright Avenue Q Common cold The Ashlee Simpson Show Drowning Game show Tire Sydney Riot of 1879 Philosophical skepticism Little Britain The X-Files (season 1) New Morning Stitch (Lilo & Stitch) Rosa Parks Comanche Bart Sells His Soul 101 Dalmatians: The Series The Death Gate Cycle Ferret Philip J.
