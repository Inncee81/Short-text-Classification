can you ever really trust your pet with your children i asked the question can you trust a dog that is previously mild mannered that suddenly lunges at your son while growling i left out some details that seemed to have been important the dog is yrs old no she did not have sores on her i know because i bathed her thouroghly and no my son did not pull her skin when he reached over her he placed his hands under her to lift her he my son is very gentle and loving with animals my concern is that dogs do turn and her being a lab she is a large dog who if wanted to could easily kill my son or me for that matter okay maybe with her age she is a little geriatric but i do not allow my son to hurt or aggrivate her he gets repremanded when he does which is rare but so does my dog if she responds in a bad way i try very hard to make sure that he respects the dog but she needs to know her bounderies too i love my dog but shouldn't my sons safety come above all else including my dogs ill behavior for whatever reason no child should ever be left with a pet unsupervised no matter how wonderful that pet is to many things can happen Dog training Shaggy dog story Theory of conduct Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Social rule Dog The Shining (film) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Cat Domestic rabbit Traumatic brain injury Salad Fingers Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Kim Possible Goldfinger Sonic the Hedgehog Hamster Drowning First aid Fancy rat Humphrey Bogart Jam (TV series) Puma Coming of Age (TNG episode) Beavis and Butt-head The Death Gate Cycle Kodocha The Apprentice 2 Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters Garfield The Fairly OddParents Spidey Super Stories Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Diving Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Gray Wolf Animal rights Sin City Pitaten Pet skunk Ranma __ characters Labrador Retriever Philip J.
