how do i comvinse my dad to buy a expensive yorkie puppy my mom fell in love with this yorkshire terrier puppy at the pet store this is the st time we have even thought about getting a little dogit is the best yorkie compared to the others and i am completely in love with it my mom already named him too his name is gus haha well the thing is it is bucks and that is a lota dough soo my dad completely flipped out when he heard the price so we started making calls to breeders to see if we can find one that is just as good only less expensive we havnt found good ones we went back again to see how my great dane would act around a little rat they did good and my mom fell in love wit the puppy again aand she started talking to one of the employees and they know how much we want the dog soo they dropped it down too which is better but still expensive i need a way to encourage my dad to get the cute lil pup i would really like some help cause i really want this puppy alot enough that im asking you ppl please help thanks yeah i know it seems like a grand idea but for a pet store dog no pet store animals run the gamut from quality animals from respectable breeders to the bottom of the barrel puppy mill run off and believe me no pet store is going to admit to the latter they make their sales with picture windows of adorable little balls of fur dancing and barking and it is irrestible but not a good idea even if they are bred up to standard the conditions a pet store puppy lives in puts it at substantially more risk of infections that can create a very expensive problem all in all if you want a yorkie find a yorkie breeder don't go with the impulse pet store buy the chances of heartache and massive expense are way too high and if you are willing to take a risk like the one you'd be taking at the pet shop you'd do a lot more good adopting a dog from a shelter that needs a home rather than perpetuating a pet store's business that usually doesn't have the animal's best interest at heart Dog Pet store Puppy mill Garfield Guinea pig Dobermann Hamster Mixed-breed dog Border Terrier Pet skunk Labrador Retriever Domestic rabbit Dog training Housebreaking Golden Retriever American Pit Bull Terrier Docking Nintendogs Fancy rat Our Gang Havanese Shaggy dog story Dog breeding Kodocha Dennis the Menace (UK) Aladdin (1992 film) Extreme Programming 101 Dalmatians: The Series Friends Great Dane Dog breed Lady and the Tramp American Eskimo Dog Border Collie Alaskan husky Jack Russell Terrier Rabbit German Shepherd Dog Hip hop collaborations Beethoven (film) My Little Pony Animal euthanasia Skinny Puppy Breed registry Brian Griffin Zoophilia The Adventures of Pete & Pete The Pet Sounds Sessions Lisa the Vegetarian Intellectual property Mr. and Mrs. Turner Equine conformation Kim Possible MapleStory Gross domestic product The Fairly OddParents Ferret Kim Possible: So the Drama The Tracey Ullman Show shorts Neighbours Pet Tag Gray Wolf Grandview, U.S.A.
