my dog is being accused of barking when she isnt i constantly have animal control coming here saying my dog has been barking i have a bark collar on her and have not heard her bark at all its upsetting because there is a dog next door to us that constantly barks and i think they think its my dog i even told the animal control officer that its not my dog but they tell me im lying she said she sat in her van and heard my dog barking but my roommate was home and she said she diddnt hear my dog bark at all i even showed the officer my dog and that she has a bark collar on i dont know what else to do im going to end up with tickets because they wont listen to me i dont know how to prove its not my dog any ideas it always happens on the weekends around too which is weird im going to see if i can keep my dog inside and take her out next weekend so if they come i can be like my dogs not even here thanks for all the suggestions i need to get my video camera back from my boyfriends mom then im definately going to try the videotaping thing i had the same problem with my neighbour her benny comes barrelling out of their house to bark at my dogs through the fence i have three min pins and they were not barking and sometimes don't even barks still even though her precious benny is trying to pick a fight with them but the neighbours were irritated by the barking and called the cops i look guilty because i have three she only has one not only that but we weren't home when the neighbours called the cops so the policeman left a note on the door stating when he showed up he heard no dogs barking yeah because she took her dog inside due to the cops or what ever later we figured out when talking to bennys owner that it was her who called the cops because she was irritated at the barking here it was her dog the whole time who was the instigator and the trouble maker of it but she was irrited by it beacause she likes to keep her dog outside and can't know that we moved in with our three i was so mad about that because not only does she have benny but she has ten cats and all the ppl in the area have to listen to them fight every night it sounds terrible like a baby crying it is kind of scarry sounding and i never complained not even when the area neighbour down the road asked me to call the humaine society on her because of all her cats i think she has some nerve any way it was dollars for the ticket and so far to get two of my three debarked which i did not want to have to do but now when the police comes i will send them next door because my dogs whisper they don't bark Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Rent (musical) Reservoir Dogs Garfield RuneScape quests Friends Dog training Dog The Smoking Room The Shining (film) Joke Pitaten The Inside Jam (TV series) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sin City Doug Trapped in the Closet The Flintstones Ocean's Twelve The Contender (television series) Grandview, U.S.A.
