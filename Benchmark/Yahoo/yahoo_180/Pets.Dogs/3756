okay now im confused okay my dog will sit stay laydown rollover jump threw hoops and a gazillian other tricks she takes regular walks with me next to my side and rides next to my bike everyday she just won't respect me i've watched the dog whisperer constantly i've practically memorized how he does everything i try it myself but no matter what i do she will listen to my dad over me she won't come if she's busy sniffing something she won't sit when i tell her to if she is fixated on something else so she reallys gets on my nerves and i've become obsessive over being her alpha ive tried to be nice and award her for the good things she does and correct her for the bad no matter what i do she won't listen i wonder if im doing something wrong i walk threw doorways first i make her sit and stay for her food i do everything right but she still won't listen i think she hates me now because im always telling her to do things and i get frusterated and yell and sometimes smack her help plz the reason i feel like she hates me too is because she use to follow me around everywhere like a duckling lay and sleep on my lap come over to me and never let me out of her sight now she wants nothing to do with me really and i miss my best friend i know she is my friend but i dont know the right times to give her affection she is a year old a german shepard she wont listen to me when people come over or when i ask her to come when the neighbor has his dog outside she runs away from me and plays a game out of it which gets me really mad because i know she is mocking me and saying na na na you cant catch me that would make anyone mad people are telling me to use pet agree it is a controller that gives off a ultra sonic sound that only dogs can hear i would buy it if i knew more about it so then i wouldnt have to yell anotehr thing is that my dad and i always argue he lets her get away with things and isnt even alpha material once i teach her one thing he untrains it not purposly but he does by joking and fighting and making the dog do things i tell him to stop because i want to train my dog and he tells me to chill out and that he will do what he wants so if i took the dog to a obidiance class my dad would just mess things up she doesn't hate you dogs don't have those type of emotions but she is obviously wary of you if you are smacking her never smack the dog correct only if you are following cesar's advice then there must be something that you're not doing if you're being alpha dog but you're screaming at your dog or using a high pitched squeeky excited voice then that might be a problem i'm not sure it's hard to tell from the information dogs are pack animals and they have a tendency to follow their pack you some dogs attach themselves to one member more than the others which might have happened to your dog a dog won't hate you because you're always telling her to do things it doesn't work like that but if you're always yelling then she will probably avoid you it all depends on how you are correcting her behavior while cesar is good you might not have earned your dogs respect as a pack leader and that can be earned back try reading the loved dog by tamar geller she's all about training using only positive methods rather than harsh methods often used by cesar for dominance you might get a better reaction from your dog if cesar's methods are not working for you when a dog is outside and there are distractions going on no dog no matter how well trained ever listens try doing something different when you're trying to get your dog to come to you reward w a treat when you get her to come to you when your dog won't come make a high pitched sound raise your arms and walk or run in the opposite direction to your dog they think it's a game and they'll chase you when she catches up to you reward with a treat some dogs cannot resist playing chase and i can get my dog to come every time she refuses to listen remember some dogs are stubborn i know mine is and i've practiced alpha dog since she was a puppy and she will refuse to listen also i find rewarding with a treat goes a long way when you get a chance watch animal planet it's me or the dog with victoria stillwell she has different methods from cesar millan that you might want to try don't give up you haven't lost your best friend you need to reestablish your place in the pack good luck Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Social rule Dog Obedience training Friends Housebreaking Theory of conduct Garfield Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Death Gate Cycle Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Tag Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Avenue Q Humphrey Bogart Milton H.
