how can i stop my english setter from nipping people when they reach out to pet her neighbor kids poked a stick at her when she was yrs old and then she started to bite people if they reach to pet her it has happened more as she gets older she is now yr old english setters are wonderful dogs but they tend to be very emotionally fragile they get hurt feelings very easily and being teased hit poked yelled at makes them avoid interaction this breed is extremely docile and biting from a dog like this is definitely an issue i'd say that your dog needs behavior modification training and that you'll probably need an expert for this she is biting to protect herself something is frightening about people reaching to her my english setter months has never been hit or physically punished in any way and still tends to duck when strangers reach to pat his head we wait until the dog is calm and start at the back of his head petting him working our way up to being able to run our hand up from his nose to the back of the head giving treats and talking in a soothing voice he's really come around to being petted on the head i would suggest telling those kids to stay away from the dog for a while and only allow them to approach your dog after asking your permission i have noticed that english setter breeders tend to be more experts on their breed than the average breeder and if you can find one in your area to contact they'll probably be willing to help you whether you purchased your puppy from them or not why not try calling a respected breeder and asking for some advice on how to bring your dog out of this fearful state i think that with some expert advice and a little work your dog can gain some confidence good luck Dog training Housebreaking Volleyball Pet skunk Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Cat Domestic rabbit Social rule Mixed-breed dog Vegeta Kim Possible Labrador Retriever The Inside Dobermann Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Piccolo Junior Saga Tobacco smoking Hamster Socialization Milton H.
