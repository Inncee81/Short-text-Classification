what is too much too pay for a pure breed miniature schnauzer puppy i think that is really a question of individual preference i am seeing them ranging from about to but if it were me and i saw a puppy with exceptional lineage and or exceptional or rare colors or markings i would not be afraid to pay more keep in mind that even if you buy a really expensive puppy the cost of the puppy will be a small portion of the total cost of the pet and if you divide the cost of the puppy by the expected life span you will find that even an expensive puppy is cheap in terms of per love year so if you can afford an expensive puppy and the vet bills that go with it then follow your heart get the kind of puppy you want from a good breeder who does health checks don't let anyone make you feel guilty about not getting it from the pound someone who pays for a good quality puppy from a reputable breeder and gives the puppy of lifetime of quality care is a responsible pet owner and will receive tremendous joy the cost per smile will be negligible good luck Mixed-breed dog Puppy mill Docking Labrador Retriever Dog breeding Dobermann Insurance Nintendogs Pet store Miniature Schnauzer Housebreaking Golden Retriever Life insurance Health insurance Fancy rat Publicly funded medicine Whippet Ferret Guinea pig Dog show Skinny Puppy Australian Cattle Dog Illegal drug trade Shetland Sheepdog Domestic rabbit Cavalier King Charles Spaniel American Pit Bull Terrier Pet skunk English Springer Spaniel Chihuahua (dog) Medical malpractice Havanese Border Terrier Current teachings of Prem Rawat Breed registry Care Bears Cat Graduate school German Shepherd Dog Nintendo Corporation Past teachings of Prem Rawat Organic farming Open access Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Microeconomics Book collecting Gross domestic product Solar cell Dog training Zoophilia Inflation Hamster Tenterfield Terrier Growth hormone treatment Poker jargon Deflation (economics) Mutual fund Rabies Monster Rancher monsters Social Security (United States) Jon Secada Shaggy dog story Smooth Collie Dog breed Murder Economics Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Diamond Canadian and American health care systems compared Trademark Education in Germany Nuclear power Software patent debate Rottweiler Plastic Episodes of Lost (Season 1) San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Microchip implant (animal) High fidelity Neopets Quarantine Happiness Supply and demand Livestock Bond Basset Hound Outsourcing Drug test Species One Hundred and One Dalmatians Love Bulk vending FairTax Tip Shit Adoption
