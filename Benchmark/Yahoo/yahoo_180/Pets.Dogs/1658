what is quilt piping and where is a good website to read about it im going to make a pet bed for my small dog and i got a pattern online but it mentions piping and i have no idea what that is piping is the edging around the quilt but you need to search in a different area even though you are making a pet bed it is usually fabric folded with some stuffing in it and feed through a pipper that stiches it together and then you sew it to the quilt if you are making a homemade bed and don't have access to the machine than you should be okay but you probablly can't get the pipping right good luck Quilt Mattress Quilting Sewing Textile manufacturing terminology Knitting NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt Sewing machine Patchwork Applique Upholstery Kilt Irrigation Clothing Bed (furniture) Bong Aloha shirt Perl L4 microkernel family Bedbug The Fairly OddParents Neopets Knife Monopoly (game) Legal research Comanche Open access Shaggy dog story Undergarment Commodore 64 Cat Floppy disk Fancy rat Gladys Knight Ferret Dog Starfleet ranks and insignia Calvin and Hobbes Dairy Carpet CPU design The Pet Sounds Sessions Kimono Pets.com Internet phenomenon William Murdoch Symmetry Compiler optimization Toilet paper Door Everything2 Ren and Stimpy Max Payne RISC Drainage Daniel Pipes Bookbinding They Might Be Giants Wool Stuffed animal Christmas tree Apple pie Dog agility Cheating in poker CP/M Cray-1 Hanshan Password Ross and Cromarty University of Texas at Arlington RuneScape quests Church of the SubGenius Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Academic dress of Oxford University Vacuum cleaner Polyethylene terephthalate Chair Garfield Lisa the Vegetarian Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers Milton H.
