how long to potty train a husky puppy about mnths old that has been in a cage almost all her life there is a gorgeous husky puppy that i fell in love with at a pet shop and it literally lives in a cage where i am there are no animal rights laws so animals are treated like crap and i can't do anything about it i am thinking of getting the husky by talking to the manager of the place i want to try and adopt her instead of buying because i do not want to support puppy mills but i don't want the husky to suffer anymore my point is that she is never taken out of the cage to go to the bathroom she just goes in the cage then the worker just cleans it up so i am guessing that if i do get her she will be making a mess at home how long will it take to potty train her and what is the best way to do it i live in an apartment btw but it is big and roomy i understand your concern yes she likely is the product of a puppy mill and your decision whether or not to get her will involve that however dogs are individuals and if something between the two of you has sparked a desire for a relationship well that's up to you my husband bought me a purebred show qulaity pom with show ribbons and trophies and all to me all that meant squat what touched my heart and sealed the pact was the look in her eyes when we met i fell instantly in love it didnt take long to discover that land's sparkling christmas joy had lived for all years of her life in a basement kennel had never been potty trained and didnt have a clue about playing with humans she has never chased a ball in her life she was enormously love starved and did the excited peeing thing every time someone but me or my sister in law picked her up potty training however was easy i just watched her like a hawk every minute that she was awake as soon as she made signs of wanting to go potty sniffing circling squating i gently took her outside and waited for her to go potty sometimes it took her a long time because she had barely been outside except to go in a crate to the car to get to a dog show but when she did go potty i praised her and loved her up something outrageous i mean you would think i had just refound my little darling after months and months so there was no doubt in her mind about what was a good thing to do it took only about weeks and she was asking me to go outside hoppin and skipping and scratching her feet across the floor so i would say that you should have few problems just watch closely for the first weeks or so and take her every time she shows signs she will get the idea pretty quickly dont fuss over accidents it only confuses them and reprimanding causes its own problems potty training is really easy it does take a definite amount of watchfulness for the first weeks or so but once its done right its done dogs live to please and your positive reinforcements will add wonders to your bonding loving relationship as for puppy mills all i am sayin is that they come in different shapes in sizes given my dogs experiences the home where we got her is festooned with ribbons and trophies and not a single dog upstairs all of them locked in basement kennels this from a reputable breeder Housebreaking Dog Dog training EastEnders Crate training Dog agility Mixed-breed dog Ron and Fez RuneScape quests Shaggy dog story Alaskan husky Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Domestic rabbit One Tree Hill (TV series) The Ashlee Simpson Show Obedience training Guinea pig Puppy mill Garfield Knots Landing Friends Japanese toilet Skinny Puppy Toilet humour Negima Happiness Pet skunk Havanese Fancy rat Jon Secada Theory of conduct Animal rights About a Boy Blood on the Tracks German Shepherd Dog The Brady Bunch Milton H.
