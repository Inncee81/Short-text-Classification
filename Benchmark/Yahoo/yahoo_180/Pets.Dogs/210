which color lab should i buy silver chocolate black yellow anyone know traits to the different colors i think unlike some breeds all three colors of lab have pretty much the same personality the three colors are chocolate black and yellow i'm not sure about silver but i'd guess it's a variety of yellow that's very light and looks silver i know the standard says that yellow can be from fox red to a very pale yellow nevermind i just looked that up certainly not yellow well it's not an akc recognized color although you can get dogs akc registered in this color so i wouldn't advise getting this color if you buy from a breeder most good breeders don't breed colors not allowed by the standard if you don't have a favorite color i guess i'd suggest you look at your furniture and clothes and carpet and see which color would blend in better they do shed quite a bit or just pick a good dog whatever the color my favorite is chocolate Mixed-breed dog American Kennel Club Dog Border Collie Dog breed Australian Shepherd German Shepherd Dog Australian Kelpie Keeshond Golden Retriever Dog show Dog agility Potato American Pit Bull Terrier Miniature Schnauzer Fancy rat American Cocker Spaniel Havanese Cat Cat coat genetics Smooth Collie Docking Toy Fox Terrier Power Rangers Jack Russell Terrier Rat Terrier Horse Chihuahua (dog) Pet skunk Dog breeding Belgian Shepherd Dog Light-emitting diode Chocobo Meriones unguiculatus Yellow Gold Pekingese Leopard Guinea pig Black panther Dachshund Nintendo GameCube Fox Terrier Airedale Terrier Oreo Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show Color theory Siberian Husky Pug Kurt Cobain Chocolate Color Beagle In-N-Out Burger German Shorthaired Pointer Selective breeding Traffic light Dobermann Timeline of alternative rock Red Fox M&M's Rose Theory of conduct Obedience training Breed registry Ferret Geologic time scale Domestic rabbit Poodle Toy dog Technicolor Catahoula Leopard Dog Color blindness Hamster Chinese Crested Dog Papillon (dog) Blue Roan (color) Boston Terrier Shetland Sheepdog Diamond CMYK color model Chinook (dog) The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Berkshire Hathaway Maine Coon Chaos Emerald Siamese (cat) Marilyn Monroe RGB color model Cuisine of Denmark Griffon Bruxellois Dalmatian Turkish Van Black Upholstery
