my year old cocker spaniel isn't entirely house broken yet i'm moving into an apt and need some tips my dog is a wonderfully natured cocker spaniel but still occasionally pees in the house as well as chew still i have tried everything and the only thing that works is if i'm at the house all the time but i have to go to work i am moving from a house to an apartment in weeks any pointers would be greatly appreciated thanks the best way to train dogs to not do bad things is to ignore them the reason most dogs do bad things is because they know that they will probably get attention from it even yelling and hitting is good attention to them in your dogs case he she probably gets attention out of peeing in the house if you are yelling or hitting or anything like that its attention so the dog will keep peeing in the house but next he she does just don't even make eye contact with the dog Dog English Cocker Spaniel English Springer Spaniel Lady and the Tramp Dog training Spaniel American Cocker Spaniel Joe Cocker Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Jennifer Lopez Welsh Springer Spaniel Procrastination El Chavo del Ocho Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show Philosophical skepticism Billboard Hot 100 Social rule The Inside Bon Jovi Piccolo Junior Saga Dog agility Toilet humour Golden Retriever Shetland Sheepdog Brittany (dog) Garfield Bryan Adams Mixed-breed dog Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story FLCL Hall & Oates USS Sea Dog (SS-401) They Might Be Giants Pulp (band) Humphrey Bogart Joy (novel) Spidey Super Stories Ron and Fez Traumatic incident reduction Something Roan (color) The Fairly OddParents Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Paintball Iditarod Companion dog Invader Zim The Evil Queen/Christine Slevil-Lewis-White (The 10th Kingdom) Los Angeles Dodgers Babe Ruth Ranma __ characters Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Border Terrier Columbo Poker jargon Reservoir Dogs Hamster Dog hybrids and crossbreeds Black Cockapoo Avenue Q Tibetan Spaniel The Body (Short Story) The Apprentice 2 Griffon Bruxellois Kender Dobermann Music video Fast bowling Fancy rat Richard Nixon Tenchi Muyo!
