who is responsible for dogbite the rottweiler owner say that my dog bit me and she still haven't asked how i feel i live in a condo which i rent from the owner where i live in and the building allow dogs i have an english bulldog the other day when i was walking him on the open spot outside of the building but the spot still belongs to the building and another resident who has an rottweiler is walking her dog but she walks towards me and my dog and tell me he is friendly so i let my dog sniff him and all in a sudden my dog is under the rottweiler and they are fighting which i pull him off and try to drag him away since i am afraid that he might get killed at the same time i get bit in my leg which i don't feel until my dog is in a safe place and i see that it's pouring blood from my leg i am in shock and walk inside the building where another resident helps me up to my place i try to find out if the other dog has rabies shots but no one helps me hours lateri go to theer b c my leg is double the size and hurts doctor wants to keep me for days i leave b c no insurance the doctor at the er called the police as required by law and they took down what i said i am just suprised that she the owner hasn't even notified me or fallowed up on anything she is just telling everybody in the building that my dog bit me which is plain wrong and the fact that i didn't get to find out if he had his shots or not until over hours later and that was by begging the management office to investigate and i had to threaten to sue the building my dog has never ever bit anyone and would never ever bite me at all but you should never say never but looking at the bitemarks no way i am just happy that my dog is still alive and well yeah the doctor wanted to admit me for atleast days b c it was so bad but i couldn't since i am poor and was about to move out of my apartment which i couldn't let the landlord walk in and find the moving boxes and my dog and no me it is still really badly infected but i don't know what to do atleast the dog had his vaccinations it sounds as if the rot owner is responsible in this case you need to contact animal control authorities Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Shining (film) Shaggy dog story Pet skunk Rottweiler The Inside Milton H.
