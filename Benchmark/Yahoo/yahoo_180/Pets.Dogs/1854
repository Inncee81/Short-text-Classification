how do i train my lab i don't seem to get anywhere following great simple training tips like the following from vivian bregman for most dog owners the following three things are the most important for the dog to learn housebreaking coming when called and walking on a leash without pulling everything else varies from owner to owner the following are the most important things to remember when you start out to civilize your dog never tell your dog to do anything that he can evade reward whatever you want the dog to continue doing while not rewarding or penalizing whatever you want the dog to stop doing these two statements will help you train the dog for the rest of his life remember that rewards are not what you consider a reward but rather what the dog considers a reward for example if your dog runs out the front door he is being rewarded with freedom when you call him and he comes and you put him back in the house he is being penalized for coming to you by being put back in the house for training purposes a reward can be verbal praise petting food a ball or whatever motivates your dog you know your own dog you know if he would sell his soul for food or for a tennis ball make his reward whatever turns him on and the time spent finding out what really turns him on will be well worth the effort please notice that i said penalize and not punish punishment makes people think of hitting the dog which is rarely necessary the only reason to hit a dog is for anti social behavior anti social is not only biting a puppy that growls when you go near his bone is threatening you definitely anti social behavior if not stopped it will probably become a bite a penalty can be anything that the dog does not like it may be a leash jerk not moving when he's a on leash so there's no walk or just ignoring him if you think that your dog can't or won't learn think about the things that he has already learned if you dog has been with you for a few weeks the chances are that he has learned when food is going to be available the sounds of the can opener or the opening of the closet door where his food is kept or even if he is fed from the table to beg at dinner time he has learned that a leash means a walk that if the front door is left open a crack he can dash out and run for a few hours and that when he is left alone he can destroy things in the house because he has never been caught in the act one of the most important things for you to learn is that it is possible to teach the dog what you want him to learn the dog is always learning you have to learn how to reward the dog so that it is in his best interests to do what you want him to do if your dog is destructive when left alone it is because he has not been caught in the act of doing wrong see the chapter on crates if your dog dashes out the front door it is because he has been given the opportunity to escape and then is being rewarded by the freedom to roam the neighborhood if this is your problem put a ten foot rope on the dog and let him drag it around the house called a house line just before you open the door step on the rope or for a big dog leave a loop in the end and loop it over the inside door handle when the dog dashes out the front door you have a handle with which to jerk him back in after a few times or a few dozen times depending on the dog he will catch on that it is painful to dash out the door and he will stop congratulations you have just taught your dog a lesson that may save his life and will l save your hours of chasing as long as he is dragging this rope around the house if you have a problem with him jumping on people you can solve that too all you have to do is to step on the rope where it hits the floor if he jumps up the rope tightens giving him an automatic correction if he doesn't jump up nothing happens every dog should have two names one for talking to him and one for talking about him or for giving him a command if you use his name when you are talking about him you will desensitize him to the use of his name every time you say his name make it a happy occasion for him use his name when you feed him if you want to give him a snack instead of saying snack say his name every time i say my dog's name she thinks that i am saying snack and she comes running much better than yelling snack or cookie whenever i want her to come much more dignified most people have a life aside from training the dog so that i'm not going to tell you to train the dog for one hour a day also if you have a very young puppy one hour will be much too much for him five or ten minutes at a time two or three times a day will be far better to get the training into the dog's mind the purpose of obedience training is to teach your dog to be a well mannered companion who is responsive to your commands and who looks to you for leadership the process of training should be enjoyable for you both and enhance the bond between you as well how dogs learn dogs learn by associating an action with a consequence if the consequence is pleasurable the dog will tend to repeat the behavior if the consequence is unpleasant he will tend not to repeat the behavior in training you show your dog the action you wish helping him to perform it by luring him with food or a toy or by collar pressures when he performs the action you immediately provide a pleasant consequence by rewarding him with a special praise word and giving him a small treat this is called positive reinforcement and will cause your dog after several repetitions to repeat the action if you give your dog a command word at the same time that he performs the behavior he will learn to associate the behavior with the command for example in order to teach your dog to sit say the command sit as you help him to do it this can be done by luring his head up with food or a toy held in your hand which will cause his rear to sink into a sit or by use of collar pressure coupled with the pressure of your hand on his rump the instant he sits say his special praise word and give him a tiny treat after many repetitions of this he will make the association between the command word sit and the act of sitting he will learn to obey the command by being positively reinforced by your praise word and a treat using a special word to speed learning you can speed up your dog's learning a lot by using a very special praise word reserved for the purpose of telling him that the action he is performing is correct and that he will be reinforced for it you can also use a clicker instead of a special word dolphin and killer whale trainers use a whistle for this purpose you've probably seen this at dolphin shows or on tv the whistle tells the dolphin that what he did was correct and he can get a fish to eat we suggest using a single word such as great or yes or wow that is different from general praise words like good boy you dog will first need to learn that this special sound called a conditioned reinforcer means something teach this at home by saying the word or clicking your clicker if you are using one and immediately giving the dog a tiny succulent food treat the order is very important first you say the word then you give the treat your dog shouldn't be doing anything special just say the word and toss the treat after several repetitions of this you will see your dog startle and look at you when you say the word that means that he has learned that it means a goodie is coming now you can use your conditioned reinforcer to clearly tell him he has performed an action correctly and will be reinforced for it with food a toy praise play or all three in order for this to work you must find something your dog likes and will work for that you can couple with your conditioned reinforcer for most dogs tiny pieces of soft tasty food work best we suggest tiny pieces of hot dog cheese soft moist cat food or lunch meat buy a cheap belt pack to carry the food in when you are training and at class once your dog has learned commands you will not need to carry food and can reinforce with praise petting and play but using food initially will help him learn much faster remember that your conditioned reinforcer must be given the instant the dog obeys your command and while he is still performing the behavior and not several seconds later you will need to train him daily in order for commands to become part of his long term memory he needs to be quiet and controlled while you are teaching him he can't learn if he is wildly excited or not paying attention to you therefore begin his training in quiet familiar places and add distractions later as he becomes proficient in his commands as you start this obedience course it will seem like there is a huge amount of things you need to learn and remember new words new ways of handling your dog and new ways of relating to him don't worry about trying to learn it all at once it will all be repeated over the weeks of the course and you'll find it becomes second nature as you gradually train your dog just relax and have fun and remember these three things that form the cornerstone of dog training patience practice perseverance it should take a while to teach the dog all this stuff i am being vague on purpose don't panic if the dog doesn't seem to be catching on in one week training takes time if you doubt that the dog is making any progress keep a training diary this will help you see just how often you are training once a week won't work and you will be able to see that you are getting somewhere best of luck with your lab they are very smart dogs and will be able to learn just about anything you have the patience for The Inside Futurama (TV series - season 5) Tag Horse Dilbert God Emperor of Dune
