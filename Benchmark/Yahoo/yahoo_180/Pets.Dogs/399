lazy bulldog i have an english bulldog cooper and he's a really great dog he loves to lay on the couch all day and sleep he's a year old and he doesn't have any major health issues that would be stopping him from walking playing he is overweight though so his legs do get sore but he's not that overweight to cause that much pain that he cannot go for a walk ever since he was a puppy cooper has been stubborn and lazy making walks very difficult i can never get him to move we took him training at petsmart and we asked the trainer about his not wanting to walk she suggested to use treats to reward him which does work except that it defeats the purpose of taking him for a walk to lose weight he's also no dummy no treats no walking but when i take out the treats he will gladly walk i can't get him to go on a decent walk without giving him a ton of treats he loves the dog park but i can't take him there everyday and he rarely will play in yard how can i get him to walk we are cutting back on his food which helped at first but he needs more excersize to lose that weight which i would like to do throuhg walks maybe try the treats that are for health issues or for slimming dogs they have very many types if treats that you can give him that are healthy for him and he also loves and also you can maybe cut back on the treats and see if cooper will respond as nicely to a squeeky toy if those dont work then maybe you could try getting him into the car and driving him to the park and then walking him around there because then he thinks he is going somewhere and he gets to be lazy and drive in the car a little bit so you both can win hope this helps Dog training Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dog Basset Hound Kodocha Weight training Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Garfield Addiction Super Size Me Fecal incontinence Obesity The Shining (film) Obedience training Fancy rat The Contender (television series) Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Sin City Breastfeeding Bon Jovi Equine conformation Domestic rabbit Time Out of Mind Bulldog Urinary incontinence Housebreaking The Death Gate Cycle Stomach cancer Homer Simpson Greg Valentine Crate training Skinny Puppy Textile manufacturing Mixed-breed dog Psychoanalysis The Invisibles Clinical depression Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Le Malade imaginaire Ranma __ characters Goodness and value theory Eddie Guerrero Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Shaggy dog story Havanese Boxing Childbirth Russian joke Seabiscuit Angel (vampire) The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time characters Escape from New York Chronic fatigue syndrome Pok__mon Live!
