i took my pup for his first big walk and he was scared of everything he is a month old golden pup had his second vaccination already so i decided to take him out for his walk around the block he was basically scared of everything passing cars people signs letterboxes sounds fences children etc during the walk we saw other people walking their dogs on leashes my pup would just stand still and let out barks while the other dog might be looking at my pup quietly with his her tale wagging when we walked pass houses with big dogs barking my pup would hop around looking really scared trying to run away then when the walk was almost up he started charging forward in a very and i can hear him choke on the collar desperate behavior i stopped and tried to calm him but it didn't work he would just keep on trying to charge i ended up carrying him back in my arms i have taken him out before on very small walks in very quiet places we live on a quiet street and it usually be ok but they weren t very long walks like a few mins ma some reason by whole question didn't get posted lol here's the second half i have taken him out before on very small walks in very quiet places we live on a quiet street and it usually be ok but they weren t very long walks like a few mins max also when i took him to his first puppy school session he was scared of pretty much every single dog let it be small to big while every dog just sat still quietly he was consistently barking why is this so the problem is it's life is too sheltered with not enough interaction with outside stimulus be a kind and considerate owner continue to take it on long walks let it get the hang of things on its own terms let it off the leash when you can dogs are very good at working things out when given the opportunity Dog training Dog Shaggy dog story Obedience training Milton H.
