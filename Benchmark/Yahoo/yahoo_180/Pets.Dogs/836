my girlfriends dog is pooping alot and its very yellow and runny like mustard what should we do the dog is a black lab thats about years old and she just stayed at a kennel for days not the smartest idea i know in all likelihood she picked something up at the kennel while it isn't a good idea for them to stay at kennels i understand that sometimes it's the only way if you have to go away and nobody can watch her you should take her to the vets as soon as you can until then try to give her more solid food and make sure she doesn't get dehydrated get her to the vet's as soon as possible you can usually check to see if a dog's dehydrated by pinching a little bit of their skin not hard and see how long it takes for the skin to lay flat again if it doesn't take a while then she isn't dehydrated yet good luck Dog training Obedience training Kodocha Dehydration Labrador Retriever Kim Possible Hiking Pitaten Theory of conduct Equine conformation Iditarod Randomness Garfield Pet skunk Fecal incontinence Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hyperthermia Dog agility Prostate cancer Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Keeshond Social rule Surveillance Hamster Fancy rat Poker jargon Mixed-breed dog Guinea pig Sin City American Kennel Club Dog show Basset Hound Knife The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Housebreaking Microchip implant (animal) The Catcher in the Rye German Shorthaired Pointer Crate training Shit Common cold Airedale Terrier Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Baroque chess Dog breed Dog Clown Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Cuisine of Denmark Hot dog Pekingese Piccolo Junior Saga Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) The Price Is Right Sulfuric acid United Kennel Club Extreme Programming Teacher's Pet (Disney) Zinc Kimi Finster Sonic the Hedgehog Australian Kelpie Computer virus Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Docking The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Kommissar Rex Invader Zim Shar Pei Schutzhund Ron Weasley Conspiracy (TNG episode) Flat tax Phoebe Buffay's songs Futurama (TV series - season 5) Toilet humour Black Ferret Beagle Ed, Edd n Eddy Sample chess game President (game) Newfoundland (dog) Haven (TNG episode) Flea The Strangerhood American Cocker Spaniel Whippet Golden Retriever Karma The Critic Manos: The Hands of Fate Ruy Lopez Drill bit Rodney McKay Domestic rabbit USA Network Nashville Skyline Reservoir Dogs
