how can you protect yourself while walking your dog from other people ok last night my mom and i were walking my dog on his leash and it has a chain collar thing these people in a truck said they could take him away but they didn't if they did they would be charged this guy almost got out of the truck there were other people in this truck too they were mad because we were using the chain collar on my dog while walking we only use it to make my dog not pull it doesn't hurt him if it did i wouldn't use it so my question would be how to keep safe from people like that while on walks with my dog if it were my other dog and they guy were to have approached he would of been bitten cause she protects us this guy was cursing at us too i said to my mom obviously this person is not a dog owner yes im a girl i will walk with both from now on my mom said next time we would carry the cellphone but i have no minutes on my cellphone so if that guy was there again it wouldn't help unless i had my dog and a big stick to beat the guy up and protect myself the guy was a white guy but when we were walking the truck which was red had stopped at a house helpin some other people thats when they guy said something to my mom and my mom yelled back the guy called a b and the went around the corner i watched them go down the road slowly and then they went on we were going to walk that way but we turned around and went back home usually we don't walk that to that corner we usually go down the street that is behind our house but yesterday we went to the street up one before that guy my dog had sniffed and met golden retrievers who were playing outside that had ran over to where my dog duke was i think next time we'll walk a different way so we be safer and not pass that house just incase that truck is ever there again it was still daylight when we were walking the time was about they were all good answers i have used chain and prong collars in my training most top dog trainers do i would make sure you carry your phone and if it happens again take a picture of the plate and call you were doing nothing wrong but they were what do you think k offices use so don't let they make you feel like your doing something wrong Dog training Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Humphrey Bogart Reservoir Dogs Shaggy dog story Aerial (dance move) Time Out of Mind Jackass: The Movie RuneScape quests Obedience training Steven Wright The Inside Professional wrestling match types Garfield Social rule Theory of conduct Dog agility Kyle Broflovski Grandview, U.S.A.
