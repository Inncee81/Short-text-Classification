are pomeranian's friendly i have heard that pomeranians are friendly and i have heard that they aren't which is true and if they aren't friendly the can you train them to be nice thx absolutely the pomeranian is a natural extrovert enjoying the company of human or canine companionship making them one of the most popular toy breeds the pomeranian adores being pampered and petted but also loves to be active and playful the pomeranian is affectionate and faithful little dog who make an excellent companion they are also highly intelligent eager to learn and love to work pomeranians are happy and a relatively friendly breed but they are known to be tempermental at times like many of the toy breeds pomeranians have plenty of energy and are not afraid to use it they are not the type of dog to laze around and enjoy staying active whenever they can therefore regardless of where you live pomeranians will find ways to get the exercise they need as they are extremely active indoors thus even if you live in an apartment or are unable to provide the dog with plenty of outside exercise the dog will not suffer from this furthermore they are great with children and can be trained easily at a young age i mean some people may not like pomeranians because of their temper but that's their opinion i personally love pomeranians and i'm getting one in september if you're looking forward into a lap dog pomeranians love to bark which makes them excellent watchdogs on the other hand if you let the barking get out of control it won t be long before the barking wears your patience but overall they're absolutely amazing dogs and even if people say they're not your opinion is what matters not what anyone else says i'm just telling you what i've experienced in my shelter and what i know and i wouldn't make this stuff up dogs are wonderful creatures especially of any breed it doesn't matter by breed or size all dogs are friendly if you treat them correctly oh my gosh thinking about pomeranians is making me excited i'm getting one and if you experience my amusement of excitement you might consider getting one as well if you want Dog Pomeranian (dog) Cat Working dog Companion dog Mixed-breed dog Obedience training Dog training Domestic rabbit Golden Retriever Theory of conduct American Eskimo Dog Shetland Sheepdog Shaggy dog story Spitz Housebreaking Kodocha Italian Greyhound Ferret Theodicy Fancy rat German Shepherd Dog Avenue Q The Death Gate Cycle The Smoking Room Toy dog Meaning of life Pet skunk Australian Cattle Dog Pekingese Kender Social rule Kim Possible Vegeta Pit bull Chinchilla Alaskan husky Border Terrier Finnish Spitz Excel Saga W.
