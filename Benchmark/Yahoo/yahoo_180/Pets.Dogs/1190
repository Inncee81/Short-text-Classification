my yr old dog is having trouble hearing how can i call him he is wonderful and still pretty active and still attempts to catch rabbits and squirrels in the yard by smell he has well over two acres of chain link fenced yard that is landscaped pet friendly and has many trees bushes and quiet places to lay and enjoy his old age i hope he lives to but i am not a spring chicken either and it is difficult to hunt him to tell him his supper is ready and to check to see if he is ok i check on him at least or more times a day he can not stay in the house due to family member with extreme allergies i tried the dog wistle but he can not hear it any better than my own whistle he hears my shouting voice at a distance of maybe ft but if asleep he does not wake up does anyone have an inventive or original way to get him to show himself so i know he is alright the vet said his hearing will never improve he also has cateracts and i can not afford to have them removed i don't know if it would be an affordable alternative for you but many owners of deaf dogs use electronic collars set to vibrate rather than electric shock to get their dog's attention when they are off leash it would take a little training on your part to teach your dog that the vibrations mean come find me but it seems to work well for a lot of non hearing dogs or maybe you could search around for an old pager that no one is using to attach to the dog's collar somehow a pager set to vibrate would probably have the same effect and would probably be cheaper although unlike an electronic collar it wouldn't be waterproof Dog training Dog Cat Garfield Ferret Obedience training Dog agility Housebreaking The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Fox hunting Plastic Joke Timpani Fancy rat Microchip implant (animal) Poker jargon Equine conformation Pet Sounds Dog collar Trapping Snake Falconry Transformer Professional wrestling match types Whippet Working dog Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Avalanche Naval mine Microphone USS Tunny (SS-282) Hash table Milton H.
