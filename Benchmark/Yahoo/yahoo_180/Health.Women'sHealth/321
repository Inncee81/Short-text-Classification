i'm confused about bra sizing i am now but i started wearing bras like a few years ago and i started out wearing a a then as time went on i guess i got bigger in size and then i started wearing a and i was wearing that ever since but the thing is i was always coming out of my shirts and i always showed a lot of cleavage and then people kept making rude comments me and saying that i had a really big chest so i was getting sick of it so today i went to a victoria's secret and they measured me and told me that i was actually a c so i guess i was coming out of my shirts because my bras were too small but i don't know i bought a few bras and i am still coming out of my shirts not that much though it got a lot better and the bras fit well but i don't know if they are still my size for sure my question is how do you know what bras are best you and how can you tell your exact size thanks so much your help i appreciate it oh and i have another question can a woman have two different bra sizes or is there only one that fits you perfectly because some as fit me some bs fit me and some cs fit me i don't know what my specific cup size would be thanks again oh and my shirts aren't the problem they aren't too small or slim on me i have bought bigger sizes and i'm still sticking out well they are pretty good vs about measuring you so you probably are a c but you also need to think about the style of bra you are getting some are meant to enhance cleavage so if you don't wanna show off what you got don't get those also if you wanna take it a step further i know for sure dept stores like dillard's sells minimizer bras that well minimize you so just shop around and remember always check out the style good luck shopping Brassiere Undergarment Social aspects of clothing Social rule Theory of conduct Piccolo Junior Saga Bra (Dragon Ball) Computer numbering formats U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Skinhead The Ashlee Simpson Show Cleavage (breasts) Whose Line Is It Anyway?
