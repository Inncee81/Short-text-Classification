kinda embarrasing girls only please ok well for my period i use towels but the thing is they make me feel really self consious i've heard about tampons but ive stayed clear for a long time because ive heard that sometimes the string snaps and its hard to get out i also have no idea to insert it can someone help me please by towels i mean pads i just use a different word i had the same problem when i was younger and eventually sucked it up and started using tampons i've been using them for years now and i'm much more comfortable the chance of the string snapping is highly unlikely and if it does all you have to do is insert your fingers into your vagina and pull it out there is no chance of it getting lost when you buy a box of tampons there are instructions on how to use them inside you might also try going to beinggirl com there is a video there that shows you how to use a tampon it will probably take some practice but you'll feel so muc cleaner good luck sweetie Menstrual cup Tampon Sanitary towel Menstrual cycle Kenny McCormick Blood on the Tracks Towelie The Amazing Race Condom Urinary incontinence Drill bit Salad Fingers Anal sex Charles Ives Magic (illusion) Knife Mattress Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Not The Nine O'Clock News Public-key cryptography Milton H.
