embarassing please help a confused girl has anyone asked their doctors about using tampons before they started trying to use them if so how did you ask and what was their response also was it really uncomfortable and how did you come up with the courage to ask i'm nervous to ask my pediatrician and trying to come up with idea on how to ask the easiest way to ask is just by saying i wasn't sure if i could start using tampons yet if you have a good doctor then that will lead to a conversation that is comfrtable for you the doctor should be asking you the questions at that point all you will have to do is answer them it can be a little uncomfortable in the begining but once you get the hang of it you wont even feel them if there is any pain then you it is not in correctly also be careful in taking it out to early because that hurts not a dramatic hurt but it is really uncomfortable good luck sweetie Menstrual cup Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Theory of conduct Breastfeeding Social rule Milton H.
