not sure if it belongs here but anyways me and my fiance are getting married next friday we are very young and but i have a good job and we make enough money to support us and spend some on ourselves anyways she got her period yesterday and was crying cause she wanted to have a baby we always use protection i don't want to have a baby yet and we talked before about this and agreed not to have it till later she however all the sudden wants it and refuses to get on birth control i am not ready to have a baby because i would like to have a better job more money and be a little older to have a baby i love her to death but now she is acting weird and seems like she will be mad at me if we don't have a baby asap i tried to explain it to her that we should wait so we can be more ready but she doesn't listen any tips on how i can convince her she is really really stubborn so please help yeah well i hope it is just a phase we are young i know but we do have a lot going for us i just hope it is well she seemed to be really mad because she really wants a baby i want one eventually but maybe when i am like thank you guys for your help anyone else and no this is not stephen lol as weird as it sounds and i have many friends who agree with this you have a time in your life when you definitely don't want a baby and then you have some kind of a scare and you think you might be pregnant you sit there dreading the test saying your positive but when it says negative you actually feel huge disappointment that then starts you wondering if you really did want a baby a few weeks later you can't believe you thought that way and get on with things i think your gf is just feeling the twangs of mother nature calling as most women do at some point i wouldn't go on about it saying she can't have a baby yet will make her more determined to have one just make sure you're in charge of the protection and give her lots of reassurance that you'd eventually like to start a family before you walk down the aisle tho just ask yourself what would you do if an accident happened and she got pregnant and wanted to keep it i'm married and i would always put my husbands feelings first cos i believe he will put mine first too and somewhere in it all a compromise will be met marriage takes work whether you're or so i don't believe age comes into it but i do think you should be talking to her about all this and have some idea on how your relationship works before you marry it's never too late for a heart to heart with her and remember that nerves may play a part in any issues you have good luck hun xx Friends EastEnders Jon Secada Knots Landing Time Out of Mind Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Charmed Avenue Q Pitaten Humphrey Bogart Blood on the Tracks Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Cliff Richard Sharon Tate Tupac Shakur Theory of conduct AFI 100 Years series Ocean's Twelve Characters in the Smurfs Incarnations of Immortality Kodocha The Amber Spyglass Fiddler on the Roof Phoebe Halliwell Le Malade imaginaire Days of our Lives Jam (TV series) Sex and the City Melanie Wilkes Frankie Laine Pregnancy Piccolo Junior Saga The Death Gate Cycle Leo Wyatt Maison Ikkoku Marie Antoinette God Emperor of Dune The Emancipation of Mimi Honey and Clover Married... with Children Paul Is Dead Grandview, U.S.A.
