could i be pregnant ok this seems crazy to me but i'm in my twenties and i've never had sex and i've always had a slightly irregular period especially around the summer months however i've never had cause for alarm before either but my boyriend and i both of us are virgins have been fooling around having dry sex when he wears his shorts and underwear and i wear my shorts and underwear he swears he hasn't ever finished but i haven't had a period for almost weeks now this has happened before but not for awhile and i have some cramps though i don't normally get cramps and i have gained about pounds in the last months i'm terrified i might be pregnant because i read somewhere that there is a chance of getting pregnant just from having dry sex because semen can soak through clothes i don't ever remember my clothing being completely saturated or damp but it might have been something i didn't think about if it wasn't real wet what are the chances i'm pg if your clothing wasn't wet from his semen than you are not pregnant but your body is gaining weight to prepare for a baby meaning that you are simply ovulating you are gaining bloating because your period is on it's way you will be fine try not to have sex before your married you've waited this long and your special enought to wait on god bless you Menstrual cycle Pregnancy Undergarment Sexual abstinence Sharon Tate Marilyn Monroe Fertility awareness Urinary incontinence Phoebe Buffay's songs 613 mitzvot Niddah Social aspects of clothing Cross-dressing Horus Diaper Oral sex Recurring South Park characters Neighbours Swimsuit Heracles Sex Pistols Diving suit Linen Stomach cancer Human sexual behavior Social rule Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Sauna Menstrual cup Oral contraceptive Shaggy dog story Textile manufacturing Jon Secada EastEnders Kimberly-Clark Corporation Skirt and dress Akuma (Street Fighter) Gwen Stefani Charmed Knots Landing Ocean's Twelve 2005 Atlantic hurricane season Puberty Jennifer Lopez Clothing Piccolo Junior Saga Ben Johnson (athlete) Slow Train Coming The Smoking Room Ayyavazhi mythology Fecal incontinence Humphrey Bogart Prostate cancer Diana Ross Psoriasis Tanning Pornographic movie Hazing Hair Tofu Richard Chase Oasis (band) Birth control The Death Gate Cycle Wet and messy fetishism Time Out of Mind Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Beachwear Professional wrestling match types One Tree Hill (TV series) Game show The Catcher in the Rye Sex and the City Abortion debate In vitro fertilisation Madonna (entertainer) Hypothermia Trousers Mattress Second Battle of the Atlantic Alois Hitler Survivor (novel) Ron and Fez Milk The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie A Canticle for Leibowitz Futurama (TV series - season 5) Year of the Spider Christo and Jeanne-Claude Little Britain Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Car handling E.
