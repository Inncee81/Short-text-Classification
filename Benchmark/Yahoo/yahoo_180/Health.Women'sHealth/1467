grown up but still look like a child i m yrs old the problem with me is that nobody believes that i m older than or infact when i go to park or elsewhere the children aged approach me considering me of their age the boys of my age dont even look at me even i have recieved face of the year award in my school last year is it bcoz of my height i m but on heels i look like even in the phone by my voice ppl think as if a kid is talking n ask me give phone to some elderly person hmmmm my parents dont mind at all but i feel really very irritated when classfellows ask me when'll u grow up i dont have ne boyfrnd while all my cousins have n what will happen when i will go to college next week omg plz tell me nething that i can do i am and most people who don' t know me or go to school to me are surprised to find out my age i'm gonna be in two weeks actually i'm ' but i've always been thin i'm pounds but look thinner i guess i feel your pain it is definitely annoying to look younger than you are people don't take you seriously but it will definitely be a good thing when you reach an age where you actually want to look younger also my roommate last year was also about your height and had a childish voice although she had womanly curves i think the media just screws up people's conceptions of what a year old looks like these actors who play high school kids on tv are usually in their early to late s it sounds like you are just short and there's nothing wrong with that and as far as going to college i've been in college for yrs and i have seen lots of girls that are even skinner and have more child like bodies than me people in college generally have the sense not to make rude comments about it don't worry and lots of guys like petite girls Social rule Pitaten The Catcher in the Rye The Fairly OddParents EastEnders Shawn Michaels Theory of conduct Avenue Q Jon Secada Friends Rush Limbaugh Treehouse of Horror V Time Out of Mind Diving Garfield Humphrey Bogart About a Boy AFI 100 Years series Kender Equine conformation Milton H.
