my hips are acting weird please suggestions would be nice when i was pregnant i was making too much progesterone it was causing the ligaments around my hips and pevis to soften and they streached so when i slept on my sides my hips would pop and crack and snap horribly it sometimes was very painful like they were almost dislocated the doctor told me it was normal because of the hormonal imbalance now after she is born they were good for about months now they are back to popping and cracking when i move from side to side during sleeping it doesnt do that when i am sitting or walking only when i lay on my side i wonder if a chiropracter can help me i talked again with the doctor and he said he wouldnt worry about it unless they continue or if i actually dislocate one i find that kinda stupid why should i wait till that happens i have had a dislocated shoulder and that was one of the most painful things in my life i dont want to do that to my hips any suggestions or simular stories i'm sorry you're not feeling well i think the best thing is to go to a chiropractor because i think a second opinion would be best if he says it is okay then i wouldn't worry about it too much i don't have any similiar stories sorry i hope this answer helps though Chiropractic Prostate cancer Shaggy dog story Carpal tunnel syndrome Menstrual cycle Osteopathy Equine conformation Puberty Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Phoebe Halliwell Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Breastfeeding Kodocha The Shining (film) Professional wrestling holds Atomic Kitten Humphrey Bogart Subluxation Avenue Q Le Malade imaginaire Fibromyalgia The Pet Sounds Sessions Endometriosis Chronic fatigue syndrome Father's Day (Doctor Who) Ben Johnson (athlete) Theory of conduct Social rule Friends Aerial (dance move) Swingout Mattress Milton H.
