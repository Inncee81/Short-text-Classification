camping with a period i started my period today sunday and on wednesday im going camping with my dad and my brother i already went camping once with them when i had my period but it didnt go too well my crappy brother went through my stuff and found the bag of pads that i had with me dont tell me just to tell my brother not to look at my stuff because he will anyway anyway this time there will be no outhouse even though the other one was disgusting no facilities whatsoever we are hiking miles to a lean to where we are going to stay for days or so im already bringing with me a small bag with a bunch of pads extra underwear baby wipes and tylenol but im going to need more than whats in there my question to you is how can i pack more pads i cant wear tampons they make me uncomfortable and i dont have any into a backpack that i have to carry i dont know how big the bag is i might also go swimming and what am i going to do about that i couldnt fit this into the above and we are going to go an a really long hike up a mountain where am i going to go to change my pad on a mountain help thanks to the people who answered already this hasent even been on here for minutes yet ok bu wednesday it should be getting lighter but if it isnt exersize will help a lot exersizing and walking are really good ways to keep cramping to a minimum i would put a whole package of pads in a plastic bag along with the wipes and underware also bring an empty plastic bag like one from the grocery store and leave it in your bag for the dirty pads instead of tylenol maybe try midol if you havent already that seems to clear up all symptoms when you have to pee just take off the dirty pad and roll it up in a tissue also a good thing to carry then put it in the bag then pee and change i think thats the best way to do it good luck and have a great trip Menstrual cup Tampon Philmont Scout Ranch Hiking Menstrual cycle Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dialysis Sanitary towel Shoe Toilet humour Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Social rule Plastic bag Teen Girl Squad Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Mattress 21 July 2005 London bombings Strap-on dildo EastEnders Genericized trademark Sleeping bag Boy Scouts of America Shotgun The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Stomach cancer Caving Joke Pump It Up Altitude sickness The Adventures of Pete & Pete Bong Little Britain Customs and etiquette of Japan Aerial (dance move) Dairy Slide Mountain (New York) Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Bicycle Swimming pool American Black Bear Toilet Shaggy dog story Atomic Kitten Paragliding Long Path Textile manufacturing STS-59 Skateboarding trick Backpack Handloading The Amazing Race Urinary incontinence AFI 100 Years series Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Milk Yosemite National Park Guadalupe Mountains National Park Climbing equipment Frogman Australian words Columbine High School massacre RuneScape quests Coffee 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Glossary of climbing terms Undergarment Rocko's Modern Life Cruising (maritime) Trail Sailing Ice cream Fecal incontinence Jennifer Lopez Jackass: The Movie Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Norway national football team Kenny McCormick Humphrey Bogart Time Out of Mind Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Major League Baseball television contracts The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Kyle Broflovski M16 (rifle) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Mercury Atlas 6 First aid Captain Thunderbolt Ice hockey Mouse (computing) Campfire Animal Crossing Beverage can stove Comanche Sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway Caddy Second Battle of the Atlantic
