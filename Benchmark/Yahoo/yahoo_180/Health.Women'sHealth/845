about plan b please help this is my situation last thursday i had sex my boyfriend was on his back and after i got off his sperm was dripping out of the end of the condom because he was on his back we were afraid it could have gotten me pregnant but we didn't bother to do anything because we didn't think it got into the vagina i'm not sure if i could of got pregnant before i took the pill then today monday we had sex the condom broke of course we went straight to plan b approximately after hours i'm just wondering if the plan b will work with what happened also i want to know when do you think i will be getting my period after i have taken the pill my period was suppose to come within this week and this had to happen today so i'm not sure if it will be effective i just want to know if my period will come soon thank you for taking your time in reading this i know that plan b is most effective if taken within days but is effective up to days after the incident so it's close but we can hope it will work if indeed sperm did get into your vagina you'll probably get your period within a few days good for you for using condoms and getting plan b but if you are planning on having more sex you should consider getting another form of birthcontrol it never hurts to be extra careful plus it may take some stress off of you because you are less likely to get pregnant just a thought Fertility awareness Birth control Menstrual cycle Oral contraceptive Emergency contraception Condom Safe sex Pornographic movie EastEnders Pregnancy Herpes simplex virus Oral sex Anal sex Alanis Morissette George Costanza Androgen insensitivity syndrome Social rule Neighbours Abortion debate Urinary incontinence Psoriasis Sexual intercourse Boston Public Niddah Sexual reproduction Menstrual cup Endometriosis In vitro fertilisation Drawn Together Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina About a Boy Diaphragm (contraceptive) Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Sex and the City Operation Market Garden Puberty Rape Sexual revolution Masturbation Oasis (band) Paranoia Agent Katelyn Faber Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Strap-on dildo Ocean's Twelve Coronation Street Gregorian calendar Friends Orgasm Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Will & Grace Tocopherol The Ashlee Simpson Show Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Jam (TV series) Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Prostitution Fertilisation One Tree Hill (TV series) Sydney Riot of 1879 Caffeine Sex toy Avenue Q Eddie Guerrero Sexual abstinence The League of Gentlemen (comedy) The Inside Premature ejaculation Hebrew calendar Tampon Phoebe Halliwell Cervical cap Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 March Knots Landing Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Gonorrhoea Yom Kippur War Harm reduction Have I Got News For You Intrauterine device Recurring South Park characters Milton H.
