girl only girls i need your help please read and answer i have a few questions that i have been wondering about lately i was wondering if anyone here has asked their doctors about using tampons before they started using them i was also wondering how you asked if you did and what their response was also did the doctor try to make it as comfortable as they could and how embarrassing was it after you said it also how did you bring yourself to ask if you haven't asked what are some ways that i could ask my pediatrician i have a female doctor i trust her and all but i am just to nervous to ask about tampons but i want to hear what she has to say i have no one else to talk to about this and i do not want to just try them before i talk to my doctor i have tried several time to ask but i chicken out i know that every girl has to deal with period but i still find it so embarrassing what can i do i play a lot of sports and i'm very active so i think it would be better to use tampons it's going to be embarrassing at first but i assure you once you do ask and she starts talking and you see how comfortable she is you'll be fine she deals with stuff so much worse than this that she'll be glad for a break say something along the lines of i'm about to get my period again and this time i was thinking about trying tampons do you have any tips or are there any concerns i should know about i feel silly asking but i'm not really sure what i'm doing she'll be more than happy to talk to you about it and will make you feel right at home i didn't talk to my doctor but you should be perfectly fine good luck Menstrual cup The Ashlee Simpson Show Little Britain Avenue Q Theory of conduct Social rule The Shining (film) Haven (TNG episode) Milton H.
