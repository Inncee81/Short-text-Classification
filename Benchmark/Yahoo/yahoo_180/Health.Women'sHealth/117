getting i might have to get a physical and im nervous what do they do ive heard guys have to take theyre pants ad underwear off and tht would make me very uncomfortable so i guess my question is what do they do for girls thx in advance kristen this is how mine went but every doctor is different first they will make you sit in an extremly boring waiting room for about minutes then a nurse will come out of a door and say your last name you can choose to have your mother come in with you or not if you choose to have her come in the nurse will take you both in and then give you one of thse flimsly gowns that leaves you hanging out and hopefully a sheet she will tell you to leave on your bra and underwear wear a bra but take off everything else and then she will leave and make u wait a while longer then the doctor will come in and introduce himself herself and start off by asking you alot of questions do you exercise how often bla bla bla then he will tell you to sit down on the table and will take your blood pressure and look in your mouth ears check your eyes and listen to your heart and lungs they will listen in the front and listen in the back they will ask you to cough and then he will ask you to lay down he will lift up your gown oh and dont wear a thong if you wear them wear real underwear and cover up your waist down if they gave you the sheet he will firmly press your stomach to check your organs then he will touch your arms from your shoulder to your hands this doesnt always happen then he will possible touch your boobs or just check them with the eyes then he writes something down then he moves down to your personal region sometimes they skip this part r just look down thier but not always and yes this is the most embarrasing part he will ask your mom to leave if she came in and if you want you can have a girl nurse come in with you if its a guy doctor just ask he will ask you to spread your legs and either take off your underwear or just move it aside then they will ask if your sexually active and if youve started your period they will start poking around down there and sometimes insert a finger if you say your sexually active sometimes if you said your sexually active they will ask if you use condoms and if you said no then they will possibly squedule u for a pap smear with ur consent and maybe give ya a few condoms lol if you want to completely bypass tell he your on your period before they take off your underwear usually they will just completely skip this part then he will check your anus ig hgh i know it sucks and put your underwear back on then he will touch your legs and all the way down to your feet he will ask you to sit up and will do the hit your knee thing then he will ask you to stand up and bend over and he will touch your spine from your neck all the way down to your crack then he will listen to you breath one more time and will feel around back thier too then he will have you sit down and ask you if you have any questions if you want birth control and all that stuff he will then ask you to get dressed and tell ur mom she can come back in while hes telling her she can come back in hes really talking to her about you and answering her questions then if you need any shots the nurse will come back in and give them to you and if you have to have blood taken they will have u go down to the lab and then your done and can leave goodluck Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling holds Professional wrestling throws Undergarment Prostate cancer Suplex Shaggy dog story Professional wrestling match types Equine conformation Breastfeeding Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Condom The Shining (film) Brassiere Recurring South Park characters Swingout Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Triage Corset Powerbomb Volleyball Menstrual cup Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Diving Breaststroke Drowning Tag Strap-on dildo Piledriver (professional wrestling) Human sexual behavior Oral sex Salad Fingers Milton H.
