i had a baby weeks ago i finally stopped spotting weeks ago but could i be on my period now i am breastfeeding so i thought i wouldnt have a period for months to come im also on nuva ring and ive only had it in for a week so if i was going to have a period wouldnt it be the th week its not spotting anymore its heavier and bright red and if it is my period can i use tampons this soon and with the ring crikey it's all so complicated i bet you're confused i know nothing about the nuva ring so i can't say alot about it my own experiences are that i bled till weeks and then didn't have a period till baby was months old and i breastfed till months i used condoms initially too and gave myself a few months to get my body back to normal i also found my husband wasn't as keen on sex with condoms which helped in the early days of night feeds etc and being tired can it be your periods returning yes it is possible breastfeeding often delays it so maybe the nuva ring has had an effect does it have hormones in it perhaps it doesn't mean you're back to having regular periods tho so fingers crossed can you use tampons it's up to you i waited a few months out of my own preference they do irritate stitches which if you've had should be all healed up by now so just make sure you change them regularly and stuff and you should be fine Breastfeeding Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Childbirth Pregnancy Menstrual cup Prostate cancer Jaundice Leon White Puberty Neighbours AIDS Hormone replacement therapy (trans) EastEnders Shaggy dog story Piccolo Junior Saga Traumatic brain injury Tampon Kenny McCormick Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Urinary incontinence Collectibles in Bionicle Toa Birth control Miscarriage The Subtle Knife Group A streptococcal infection Characters in the Smurfs Prolactinoma Herpes simplex virus Stuttering Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma The Contender (television series) Medical analysis of circumcision Kodocha Safe sex Breast Emergency contraception Coeliac disease Stomach cancer Textile manufacturing Eye Methamphetamine Milton H.
