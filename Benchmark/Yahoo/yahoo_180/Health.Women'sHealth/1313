ovarian cyst i am yrs old i was recently told that i have a ruptured cyst on my right ovary i am not on birth control my gyno suggested i start a progesterin only birth control to reduce ovulation b c apparently i could risk getting a cyst each month in any event i have yet to start the birth control b c i was not told much about it and it could have many side effects i was told to 'rest and take it easy' to reduce the risk of the cyst bursting in my abdomen i guess i am just looking for more information about this 'ruptured cyst' business i am still getting cramping now and then what can i expect and any advice guidance thanks hi i have polycystic ovary syndrome at one stage i had cysts in my right ovary and in my left i was in a lot of pain very sharp burning pain when they became infected the best solution was to go on the pill you mentioned and skip as many periods as possible everytime i had a period the cysts became more inflammed skipping them gave them the chance to settle down i had my appendix out last year and the doctor checked out my right ovary while i was under and it was clear of cysts my doctors instructions have helped me alot and i have settled down the problem it is genetic so it is not something you can get rid of but just learn to deal with the danger is that if you allow them to become more and more irritated and they burst then it can cause burning and scarring and possibly endometriosis this can cause difficulties in getting pregnant down the track however if you stick with the pill and skipping periods i have one for days every four months then you can manage the problem and should not have great difficulty with getting pregnant down the track good exercise and diet will help too because those tendant to get cysts are also tendant towards insulan resistance and eventual diebetes so just look after yourself i hope this has been helpful Endometriosis Polycystic ovary syndrome Ovarian cyst Menstrual cycle Oral contraceptive Acne Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Breastfeeding Psoriasis Ovary Stomach cancer Prostate cancer Ovarian cancer Androgen insensitivity syndrome Folic acid Puberty Infertility Guinea pig Childbirth In vitro fertilisation Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cancer Chronic fatigue syndrome Appendicitis Apollo 8 Ectopic pregnancy Diabetes mellitus Ovulation Bipolar disorder Premature birth Dysmenorrhea Turner syndrome Miscarriage Coeliac disease Toxoplasmosis Crohn's disease Obesity Obstetrics Birth control Cephalic disorder Malaria Abortion Stroke Gonorrhoea Bloating Tocopherol Intersex surgery Multiple sclerosis Pregnancy Polycystic kidney disease Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome Migraine Colorectal cancer Depo Provera Cat Amenorrhoea Syringomyelia Abdominal pain Diving Pneumonia Nutrition Emergency contraception Tobacco smoking Fecal incontinence Cirrhosis Coronary heart disease Traumatic brain injury Hypertension Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Cryptorchidism Herpes simplex virus Asthma Equine conformation Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency Parkinson's disease Medical analysis of circumcision Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Breast cancer History of intersex surgery Condom Alternative medicine Cannabis (drug) Sexual reproduction Insulin resistance Fibromyalgia Clinical depression Extreme Programming Autism Prenatal diagnosis Abortion debate Penis enlargement Entamoeba histolytica
