extremelt excessive white discharge i had sex the other night with my boyfreind for the first time we used a condom and it came off the next day i was slightly irritated down there as i often am after using a condom a couple days later i noticed alot of discharge when i was urinating there is no itching redness noticeable odor at this point just alot of discharge and it is not thick like i have heard about a yeast infection usually i go to the dr when i notice something different but they always tell me its a yeast infection or nothing i had a fluconazole i took days ago and have not noticed a decrease in discharge any idea what would cause so much discharge and only discharge also i take doxicycline for my acne i know that is something they use to treat stds such as chlamydia and maybe a couple others i also know antibiotics may increase likliness of yeast infections if i did contract clamydia would the doxi clear it up or would it have little effect since my body is used to it any suggestions i also did a ph test to see if it was something like bv or trich and my ph was normal so it not likely to be either of those just in case you should go get std tested as should your boyfriend then he should probably buy smaller condoms that won't slip off the correct size condom will not come off easily and will have less chance of breaking you may be on a drug that would be used for treating chlamydia in my experience as this is the only std i've had they didn't use doxy they used a one time powder that you mix with water but the dosage may be different than what they would use or there could be other variables stds are not something you want to be at all unsure about get tested so you know the discharge doesn't sound like a yeast infection to me but only a doctor can tell you for sure Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Gonorrhoea Sexually-transmitted infection Psoriasis Urinary incontinence Conjunctivitis Herpes simplex virus Medical analysis of circumcision Chronic fatigue syndrome Acne Safe sex Condom Lymphogranuloma venereum Oral sex Chlamydia Ketoconazole Diarrhea Eczema Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Dandruff Birth control Fertility awareness Folic acid Vitamin C Pneumonia Trichomoniasis Methamphetamine Brewery Rosacea AIDS Insulin Athlete's foot Androgen insensitivity syndrome Sexual abstinence Isotretinoin Oral contraceptive Chemotherapy Cirrhosis Vulvovaginal health Cancer Hepatitis C Cephalexin Traumatic brain injury Aspergillosis Chlorpromazine Cocaine Gout Human penis size Bread Asthma Group A streptococcal infection Coeliac disease Crystal methamphetamine and sex Quicksort Guinea pig Non-gonococcal urethritis Hepatitis Menstrual cycle Episodes of Lost (Season 1) AIDS pandemic Tobacco smoking Common cold Carbon dioxide Harm reduction Alcoholic beverage Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Sewage treatment Action potential Bipolar disorder Equine conformation Urine Rabies Protein-energy malnutrition Ciprofloxacin Jet engine Endocarditis Lupus erythematosus Hyperglycemia Multiple sclerosis Homeopathy Sickle-cell disease Helicobacter pylori Little Britain Prostitution Computer virus Anthrax Psittacosis Duesberg hypothesis Beer Intravenous therapy
