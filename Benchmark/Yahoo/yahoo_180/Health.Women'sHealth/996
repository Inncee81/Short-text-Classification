will local or general anesthesia harm a fetus i'm pretty sure that local anesthesia wouldn't harm a fetus but would general anesthesia im suppose to have surgery on my carpal tunnel and cubital tunnel within the next months we have been ttc therefore i really need to know if i am currently pregnant i would be about weeks im late with period with negative tests but we are still trying to conceive in the meantime this would be a really bad time to have surgery first of all the symptoms you are having will likely get worse with pregnancy because everything swells unless you have nerve compression that is causing severe symptoms i'd suggest you wait until you are no longer pregnant why the next months deadline you'll still be in the first trimester which is the riskiest time for any pregnancy it's your call but if it were me i'd do everything possible to struggle through without any surgery whilst pregnant if you insist on going through with it the anesthesia itself will not harm the baby but the mere stress of having surgery will make it more likely that you will miscarry that early in a pregnancy there is little that can be done to prevent it you just have to take your chances you can also have the procedures done under straight local no sedation no general just numbing medicine that won't get to the baby in appreciable amounts and is perfectly safe the stress of surgery thing still applies though think long and hard about this before going through with it the chance of losing the pregnancy is small but why take any chance at all Pregnancy Obstetrics Carpal tunnel syndrome Abortion Abortion debate Miscarriage Breastfeeding Urinary incontinence Childbirth Cephalic disorder Diabetic retinopathy Local anesthesia Cancer Stomach cancer Intact dilation and extraction Spina bifida Anesthesia Stroke Medicine Prostate cancer Premature birth Menstrual cycle Clinical depression Electroconvulsive therapy Repetitive strain injury Brachial plexus Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Breech birth Twin Endometriosis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Chronic fatigue syndrome Epidural Prenatal diagnosis Roe v.
