painful urination okay about a week and a half ago i got a bladder infection i was out of state but the people i stayed with were pharmacists so they gave me three days worth of antibiotics along with some over the counter and prescription pain meds it cleared up but came back not as strong a couple days later i was back home so i found some antibiotics two days worth and took them that was like days ago i went to my docter and she said my urine looked perfect meaning the infection had cleared however i still have pain when urinating i am allergic to some families of antibiotics they give me yeast infections and i'm not sure if the antibiotic the people i stayed with was in those families or not is it possible that i have a yeast infection from the antibiotics and that's why the pain hasn't gone away also it's not an std i've been checked i have protected sex a long term monogamous relationship i'm not sure if the antibiotic the people i stayed with gave me was in those families sorry i forgot half that sentence it is probably a yeast infection this could cause pain while urinating if it has gotten to your urethra it is not wise to take antibiotics when they are not prescribed because not all antibiotics work on all bacteria this is why they say that many diseases are now harder to cure because they gain resistance to the antibiotics it could be bad if this happens because then the doctor would have to give you stronger doses of antibiotics go and have your doctor check for a yeast infection i have a feeling that is what it is from your description Gonorrhoea Psoriasis Common cold Cystoscopy Cephalexin Antibiotic Sexually-transmitted infection Chronic fatigue syndrome Pneumonia Urinary incontinence Candidiasis Medical analysis of circumcision Penicillin Medical prescription Group A streptococcal infection Urinary tract infection Endocarditis Helicobacter pylori Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Acne Hepatitis Urine Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Tuberculosis Antibiotic resistance Medicine Legionellosis Herpes simplex virus Prostatitis Conjunctivitis Lymphogranuloma venereum Folic acid Clostridium difficile Pelvic inflammatory disease Schistosomiasis Aspergillosis Guinea pig Reiter's syndrome Infectious disease Eczema Vulvovaginal health Iatrogenic Anthrax Cellulitis Stomach cancer Ciprofloxacin Oral sex Methamphetamine Urethra Leptospirosis AIDS Dialysis HIV vaccine Allergy Traumatic brain injury Bubonic plague Streptococcus pneumoniae Urinary system Syphilis Mouth ulcer Rabies Upper respiratory tract infection Vancomycin Menstrual cycle Athlete's foot Chlorpromazine Miscarriage Lupus erythematosus Chlamydia Epididymitis IgA nephropathy Phage Oral contraceptive Homeopathy Pharmacist History of cancer chemotherapy Hepatitis C Paracetamol Fecal incontinence Peptic ulcer First aid Isotretinoin Otitis media Traditional Chinese medicine Clomipramine Cystic fibrosis
