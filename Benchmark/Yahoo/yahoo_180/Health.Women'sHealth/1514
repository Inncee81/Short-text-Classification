women only what's your fav way to masterbate what works for you serious answers only please i'm not really 'into it but i have religious guilt i need to hear that it's ok it's like i know it but i just can't shake it but i also feel that it's selfish when your in a relationship i wouldn't feel comfortable doing it in front my guy what do you think the first thing you have to do is get over you guilt i know this can be difficult because it has been planted for years i don't know for sure but i think the catholic is about the only religion that tells you it is a sin so i assume you are a catholic i was also at one time so i can relate to what you are going through the first time i masturbated i could not quit shaking for about an hour i was so scared of what i had done after that i began to question everything about it like how can something so good be so bad then i found that virtually everyone masturbates although many will not admit to it now research has shown that not only is it natural and normal but it also has numerous health benefits so yes it is ok you can put the guilt behind you it may take a little while but you have already started when you say you know it is ok believe it or not masturbation in a relationship is not selfish i think it is an important part of any relationship partners can enjoy it as part of their sex play you can show your partner how to better satisfy and your partner can do the same you can use it as a change in your everyday love making routines i think it is also important for most women as very few of us orgasm from penetration alone so a little manual stimulation will get you over that last hump it is also useful at times when your partner is not in the mood for whatever reason so clear your mind put your fingers to work or get some kind of toy and enjoy yourself along with all the rest of us Human sexual behavior Strap-on dildo Anal sex Oral sex Child sexuality Sexual orientation Sexual abstinence Bondage (BDSM) Zoophilia Orgasm Sex toy Mutual masturbation Sexual intercourse Infantilism Birth control Religion Sant Thakar Singh Prostate cancer Sin Time Out of Mind History of sex Milton H.
