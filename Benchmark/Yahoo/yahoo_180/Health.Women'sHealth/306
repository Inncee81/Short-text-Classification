i just posted a questions but your opinion and experience i just thought of a few more questions so i decided to post another question has anyone asked their doctors about using tampons before they started if so how did you ask and what was their response also was it really uncomfortable and how did you come up with the courage to ask i didn't ask my doctor when i started using in my 's i didn't think i needed to because all that i needed to know was on the back of the box its a little scary because you hear about all these horror stories like forgetting about them untill an infections starts or getting it lost up there etc it's not really scarry if you take the precautions like changing them every hours a must because of the toxic syndrome risk i personally change every time i go to the bathroom some wemen don't do it even if they urinate i think that you should because the urine gets inside the tampon and that must not be good and i'v done the test myself and it does absorb the urine and another thing i don't do is leave it on over night but if it makes you feel more comfortable consulting with your doctor i would give him or her a call and ask if you need to make an appointment to ask a question about tampons or could you ask over the phone another think you could do is when you go for your papsmear check or physical ask about tampons good luck Menstrual cup Tampon Prostate cancer Toxic shock syndrome Menstrual cycle Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Social rule The Shining (film) Milton H.
