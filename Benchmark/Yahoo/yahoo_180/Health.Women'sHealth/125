what might cause cloudy urine it's been that way for a few weeks btw i'm pregnant on prenatal vitamins i was thinking it might be a uti but i don't have any other symptoms well i have to urinate frequently but that's pregnancy what could it be i have an appointment in a week is that too long to wait i've also been drinking more fluids got cranberry juice i was a bit dehydrated for a while morning sickness and it was worse then it could be contributed to the prenatal vitamins there are several possible causes leading to cloudy urine certain types of food or drink can affect urine consistency and coloration including certain vitamins normal vaginal secretions can cause the urine to appear cloudy dehydration bladder infection or cystitis but if you are experiencing no symptoms i would rule out this possibility uti sometimes there can be no symptoms its very important to make sure when you are pregnant that you do not have a uti or developing one there are home tests you buy at the pharmacy blood in urine any blood in the urine may lead to cloudy urine which can be linked to a uti proteinuria condition in which urine contains an abnormal amount of protein usually caused by a kidney disease i do not believe you are experiencing this problem in my opinion i would make sure you are do not have a developing uti and talk to your doctor in the mean time drink some cranberry juice just to be on the safe side cranberry juice produces a hippuric acid in your urine which acidifies the urine and prevents bacteria from sticking to the walls of the bladder make sure its cran juice and not a juice cocktail i hope this helps Prostate cancer Obstetrics Urine Urinary tract infection Pneumonia Vitamin C Diabetes mellitus Kidney stone Dehydration Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Stomach cancer Nutrition Pregnancy Hypoglycemia Lupus erythematosus Guinea pig Psoriasis Gout Chronic fatigue syndrome Anemia Cancer Hyperglycemia Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Diabetic nephropathy Medical analysis of circumcision Cytomegalovirus Cirrhosis Folic acid HIV test Malaria Tocopherol Fecal incontinence Escherichia coli O157:H7 Diabetic ketoacidosis Diarrhea Acne Blood Nephrology Tooth enamel Cystic fibrosis Coeliac disease Aspartame AIDS Diabetes insipidus Turner syndrome Alzheimer's disease Menstrual cycle Warfarin Gonorrhoea Dementia Herpes simplex virus Common cold IgA nephropathy Autoimmune diseases Stroke Bearberry Nephrotic syndrome Domestic rabbit Sickle-cell disease Hepatitis Multiple myeloma Vitamin Rabies Cephalic disorder Endometriosis Breastfeeding Prenatal diagnosis Protein-energy malnutrition Fibromyalgia Tooth Cystoscopy Schistosomiasis Medicine Androgen insensitivity syndrome Diabetic neuropathy Spina bifida Coagulation Diuretic Vitamin D Ebola Crohn's disease Prenatal care Mesothelioma Alcoholism Cocaine Hypertension Decompression sickness Inborn error of metabolism Cholera Leptospirosis
