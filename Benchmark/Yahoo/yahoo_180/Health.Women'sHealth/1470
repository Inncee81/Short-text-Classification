is my vagina normal my vagina sometimes dry out when i'm having sex is it normal or i'm not ready yet how to make my vagina wet coz my husband always complain about the dry vagina plz i need help yes your vagina is perfectly normal some women's vagina's produce more natural lubricant than other women's and you are one of the women who simply has a less wet vagina no worries though that's how i am as for making your vagina wetter there are really two options make sure that your husband is giving you enough foreplay before the intercourse begins otherwise sex is likely to be uncomfortable for both of you or if your husband is giving you foreplay and taking things slowly before the intercourse begins and he still complains that you are too dry then it is probably time to buy a lubricant from the store some people feel ashamed of this but you don't need to be embarrassed because the sex will be a whole lot more pleasurable for both of you if you are wet whether or not it is natural i hope this helps best of luck Sexual intercourse Condom Oral sex Human sexual behavior Strap-on dildo Menstrual cup Vagina Urinary incontinence Anal sex Rape Sex toy Fertility awareness Personal lubricant Dyspareunia Masturbation Vaginal lubrication Social rule Sexual arousal Jam (TV series) Human sexual response cycle Diaphragm (contraceptive) Child sexuality Sexual dysfunction Vulvovaginal health Vulva Niddah Menstrual cycle Intersex surgery Human sexuality Katelyn Faber Fecal incontinence Fisting Orgasm Gliding action Sauna Infantilism Anorgasmia Safe sex Sento Mutual masturbation Mucus Masters and Johnson Anus Yoko Ono Hemp Puberty Prostate cancer Homosexuality and transgender Sexual reproduction Old wives' tale History of sex Sexuality in Christian demonology Douche Female genital cutting Sex reassignment surgery male-to-female Physical intimacy Gay slang Orgy Anal masturbation Group sex Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina Sexual abstinence Euphemism Dildo Marriage Mojave people Vaginismus Bondage (BDSM) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Herbert Garrison History of intersex surgery Breastfeeding Vagina dentata Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pornography in Japan Marie Antoinette Sanitary towel Textile manufacturing Thermal power station Proper Condom Use Penis Alanis Morissette Phone sex Binge eating disorder Richard Feynman Childbirth Religion and sexuality Zoophilia Pregnancy Sexual differentiation Hymen Coitus interruptus Domestic violence Theory of conduct Erogenous zone Sex doll Virgin Gramophone record
