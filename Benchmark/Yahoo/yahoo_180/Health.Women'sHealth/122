periods and lifelong warfarin hi i am and since having my frst child yrs ago i have been on the depo provera contraceptive and have only had the normal bleed after each of my subsequent pregnancies before returning to the depo however having never had periods and thinking of having another baby the depo will have to be stopped so i guess my question is as i am on life long warfarin treatment for recurrent pe how am i going to know if my monthly bleeds are normal or heavier than someone not on warfarin and are my periods going to be heavier i am also very aware that i do have do discuss continuing warfain treatment with my gp when i wish to become pregnant i don't know the specific answers to your questions however i would like to point out that when i was on depo for only months when i quit taking it it took me a year and a half to finally get my first period after stopping so don't expect to get pregnant right away i would assume it may be quite a while until you even get a period after using depo for years it is one of the normal side effects check with your obgyn good luck though hope all goes well with your conception efforts Depo Provera Miscarriage Abortion debate Oral contraceptive Menstrual cycle Amiodarone Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Fertility awareness Maprotiline Endometriosis Pulmonary embolism Childbirth Stomach cancer Friends Breast cancer Obstetrics Pelvic inflammatory disease Charmed Coagulation Chlorpromazine Maya calendar Autism Polycystic ovary syndrome Antiphospholipid syndrome Abortion in the United States Breastfeeding Psoriasis Cephalic disorder Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sharon Tate Normal distribution Gynecologic hemorrhage Growth hormone treatment Abortion Emergency contraception Social rule Knots Landing EastEnders In vitro fertilisation Progesterone Paroxetine Capecitabine Prostate cancer Atrial fibrillation Gonorrhoea Teenage pregnancy Controversies in autism Traumatic brain injury Ovarian cyst Stuttering Alcoholism Tocopherol Cancer Kurt Cobain Premature birth Neighbours Ectopic pregnancy Infertility Eugenics Prenatal diagnosis Folic acid Ulcerative colitis Glycogen storage disease type I Tobacco smoking Melanie Wilkes Scientology beliefs and practices Vitamin C The Joker's Wild Cytomegalovirus Laura Schlessinger The Amazing Race Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Abortion in Canada Migraine Crohn's disease Infantilism Coeliac disease Annuity Baldness treatments Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Malignant melanoma Bipolar disorder Sex education Ovarian cancer Hypoglycemia COX-2 inhibitor Condom First aid Ximelagatran Reservoir Dogs Malaria Turner syndrome Hypnosis
