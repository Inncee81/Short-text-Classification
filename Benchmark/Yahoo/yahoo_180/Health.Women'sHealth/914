why shouldn't abortion be an option for me i do not plan on getting married i do not wish to be carry a pregnancy to term and i do not wish to be a mother birth control is not why should i be forced in to abstinence i'm and my cousin thinks i should have it i don't and have no plans on spending my life with my bed buddy why does my cousin tell me abortion is not an option when i know this is the best thing for me why should i feel ashamed for doing what's right regarding my body and how i want to live it i only get one why should i spend the rest of it feeding something that will be noisy and rebellious i'm looking for answers especially from women that understand me i'm sorry i'm not religious so please no christians or spiritual reasoning short answer do what you're comfortable doing and ignore people as well as their opinions my grandmother used to say that people's opinions were just like their anuses is that even the proper plural you don't want to see it and you surely don't want to hear it long answer abortion shouldn't be an option for you because your cousin believes she wouldn't do that and she's applying her belief system to you and your situation people do this all the time on many different topics example i am childfree have chosen to have no children and am thrilled about it and i get opinions all the time about why i should have children regardless of my lack of desire or ability to parent it's generally stupid to try to change someone's life in five minutes of lip flapping and it doesn't really apply to my belief system so i've learned to avoid the subject or tune them out at the end of the day do i listen no should you listen no instead listen to yourself and listen to your heart do what you are comfortable doing read a lot a good pro abortion site to visit is i'm not sorry do a google and you'll get a link to the site my story is there and many other's stories are too remember whatever you do you will look yourself in the mirror and live with it the rest of your life i live with my decisions quite well really for the record i had a late term abortion at the age of i can offhand think of seven i finally quit changing the number because it kept going up women i know to have had an abortion and not a single one of them regret it they considered it the best thing to do in light of the cicumstances personally speaking it was the best thing i ever did for me and i'm still married to the father of the baby i aborted i often picture it not as a negative event i have to regret but as an event that i learned from it did and didn't tattoo everything i had to learn what i resented about the situation my husband's attitude what i wouldn't do again wait so long and what was positive i didn't have a baby i'd have probably never really wanted but it all taught me to believe in myself some people will tell you that you are being selfish to heck with being selfish sometimes you have to go that route to preserve your sanity whether you carry the pregnancy to term and get married or become a single mother carry a pregnancy for nine months in the eye of your community with the intent of adopting it out and listen to all the comments you would be sure to get or have an abortion you have to do it for you because at the end of the day you are the person who will live with your decision do the thing that suits you and move on don't allow yourself to be convinced to do something that feels wrong just because someone else feels it is right and that goes for everything not just childbirthing you have to ask yourself if the people who are so into you having this baby you don't want are going to be sending you checks money for childrearing or if they are going to be paying for counseling on issues regarding carrying out the pregnancy and giving it up for adoption they won't you and i both know it the people who want you to blindly have this baby don't care about you once you've had it i'm not saying you'd end up there by default or anything like that that is also not to say you might not be in counseling because you had an abortion and now regret it or became infertile just like the forced birthers wouldn't pay for the stuff i mentioned earlier i wouldn't pay for your medical treatment because you had an abortion that's why i encourage you to follow your heart unfortunately you are on your own at the end of this game i'm not saying women don't regret abortions or become infertile because of it i've seen the regret firsthand i participated on a message board for a few years where some women regretted their abortions to the point of considering suicide to end their pain i've never personally seen or known someone who had an abortion that resulted in infertility unless i count the back alley abortions i've read about that resulted in infertility as a matter of fact my cousin who had an abortion went on to have a beautiful daughter when she was ready i'm not saying it doesn't happen because i don't know i really don't know if i'm infertile or not because i never tried to have children so perhaps you see what i mean my advice get thee to a clinic as soon as possible if you're going to have an abortion had i not been scared and waited so long i'd have saved roughly and quite a bit of discomfort and that was in think of what you'd spend now and with the new abortion laws you might not even be able to attain one in many states if you wait too long if you're not going to have an abortion you need to get into some prenatal care as soon as possible so you'll have a healthy baby that you can make available for adoption or keep to parent yourself regardless of how some decidely odd people feel about it this is a legal and safe option you have right now regardless of the moral implications some people believe go along with it the longer you wait the less time you'll have the option choose for yourself and what you really believe more advice when i was pregnant i told no one other than the father i didn't want everybody to know i had had an abortion because i didn't want to hear their mouths work if you ever find this yourself in this situation again you might think carefully about who you'll tell and what you think their reactions might be you might be able to tell your cousin and make her believe that you had a miscarriage that's all i've got i hope it helps good luck and my
