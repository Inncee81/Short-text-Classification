preggers or no ok i need help i had sex weeks ago took the plan b pill and i got my period nine days later i should have had it again a week ago is it possible that i can be pregnant or can the pill just screw up youy cycle if you have sex you can get pregnant if you have not had sex since your last period than you can't be pregnant but if you have of course you may be pregnant the plan b pill may or may not have affected your cycle my advice would be to get a pregnancy test at the store better yet get a pack of three if it is negative meaning you aren't pregnant and you still don't get your period within a few days take another test because pregnancies don't always show up the day you miss your period also pregnancy tests are most accurate if you pee on them first thing in the morning when any potential pregnancy related hormones are most concentrated in your urine if you are pregnant set up an appointment with a doctor if you aren't maybe it is time to approach sex responsibly use birth control or don't have sex babies cost more than birth control Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Birth control Oral contraceptive Urinary incontinence Obstetrics Emergency contraception Gonorrhoea Psoriasis In vitro fertilisation Abortion debate Cytomegalovirus Neighbours Breastfeeding Pregnancy test Hormone replacement therapy (trans) EastEnders Morning sickness Abortion Prostate cancer Teenage pregnancy Turner syndrome Sex education Folic acid Friends Sexual intercourse Human chorionic gonadotropin Depo Provera Sex assignment Guinea pig Progesterone Roe v.
