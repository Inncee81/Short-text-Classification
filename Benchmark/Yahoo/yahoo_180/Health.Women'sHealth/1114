embarrassing question i've been wanting to ask for years now with the anonmity of the internet i can ladies does your rectum hurt right around the time of menstration when you have a bm does it feel like it's swollen or something hurts when pushing this is how i know my period is coming when i get that pain any body else thanks i haven't had any children i don't think it's hemoroids doesn't burn or anything just sore been happening as long as i can remember and it's not just when i go it's off and on all day for a couple days i'm not worried about it like i said it's always happened i was just curious if other women had it too hey fizzygirl i've been told i have a tilted uterus too i wonder if that's it see i'm glad i asked wow me yikes i'll definatley mention it to my doctor thank for taking the time to answer dear kazy not only am i a doctor but a woman as well and i am was in the same position you are in let me briefly explain as you know the inner layer of our uterus called endometrium swells up every month in preparation of receiving a baby wether it comes or not this swelling is primarily made of a huge bunch of tiny blood vessels that permeate the area in the hope of nurturing the baby with the oxygen nutrients it may need when a baby doesn't come this lining is not needed anymore and is discarded as menstruation in some cases this lining is not completely pushed out through the vagina where does it go then as the uterus pushes or contracts to get it all out some of it may flow back and out through the fallopian tubes that's out of the uterus and into the abdominal cavity where our intestines lie the problem is that these tiny parts of endometrium are left floating around in our abdomen and may end up planting themselves to the sides of intestines ovaries and as you've been suspecting the rectum when menstruation approaches every month these tiny endometrium plantations are induced by hormones into sweeling up in the same way as the normal endometrium cells inside the uterus do this swelling may compress the rectum and cause a pain similar to the one you're feeling now some patients complain of not being able to sit comfortably or of needing to sit crossing a leg and supporting themselves on a side others nearly scream with pain during bowel movements in the bathroom i hope this is not your case and so forth the condition i am referring to is called endometriosis endo for short it is not clear why some women get this nor is it clear why some who are clearly covered with endometrium implants suffer no pain while some who have very few ones can't stand to get out of bed a definitive diagnosis is reached through direct visualization of the implants and treatment involves several factors wether you stand the pain or not and wether you wish to remain fertile or not both getting pregnant and reaching menopause stops your menses so that diminishes the swelling and stops the pain this is why some doctors treat the condition with hormones that resemble either of these states another more definitive option is surgery to get rid of the little implantations i truly recommend you talk to your doctor about this since in the long run endo may be a cause of infertility if ovaries or fallopian tubes are involved and or unbearable pain Endometrium Ectopic pregnancy Intersex surgery Radiation therapy Fecal incontinence Ovulation Sexual reproduction Cancer Intersexuality Menstrual cup Childbirth Uterus Breastfeeding Fertility awareness Gonorrhoea Coeliac disease Chronic fatigue syndrome Miscarriage Ovary Traumatic brain injury Colorectal cancer Gynaecology Mesothelioma Sexual intercourse Breech birth Abortion Fertilisation Autoimmune diseases Professional wrestling holds Cryptorchidism Birth control Medicine Diarrhea Acne Polycystic ovary syndrome Gynecologic hemorrhage Amenorrhoea Folic acid Stroke Peritoneum Multiple sclerosis Oral contraceptive Hypoglycemia Psoriasis Jam (TV series) Pneumonia Carpal tunnel syndrome Spina bifida Breast cancer Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Prenatal diagnosis Equine conformation Hemorrhoid Pelvic inflammatory disease Female reproductive system (human) Aortic dissection Gastroparesis Prolactinoma Kidney The Shining (film) Hip fracture Drowning Diabetes mellitus The Inside Anal sex Dialysis Sex assignment Sex reassignment surgery female-to-male Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Hirschsprung's disease Turner syndrome Adjustable gastric band Group A streptococcal infection Obesity Fistula Fetal development Atherosclerosis Syringomyelia Growth hormone treatment
