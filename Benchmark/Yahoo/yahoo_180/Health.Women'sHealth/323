jenny craig weight watchers i realize that i cant help myself to get the disipline i want to lose weight i tried atkins and a few others it worked but looking it now made no sense so i want to make a final decision about my health and i want to make me priority happy as well as my family and boyfriend he is very supportive and said that i really need to lose weight we love each other very much and we want the best for each other and we want to make the relationship to work when i think about my hard situation i am really depressed i want to do it and i am going to do it oh i want to lose lbs yup n e ways give me your opinion on the j c or w w and give me some motivational factors that i can look on while i want to reach my goal i do not want to hear n e thing do it by myself portion control blah blah i am willing to spend less than per month than doing gastric bypass that is waaaaay more expensive u know wink thanks in my personal experience weight watchers' points system was wonderful after sticking to the diet diligently for a week or so you have a whole new outlook on food so it really help you make better decisions about food plus i was never hungry the entire time i was on weight watchers the number of points they gave me to eat each day was a lot more food than i would normally eat weight watchers promotes learning a healthy lifestyle instead of depending on it for food and weight loss jenny craig you don't even have to go to the meetings except for the initial one where the explanation of the diet is given and you are given the information booklets in the first month that i used weight watchers i lost at least lbs and though i'm not following that diet anymore it's because i learned how to eat healthfully on my own after using weight watchers for just a few months this diet even adjusts how much you can eat each day by how active you are so if you exercise for just minutes a day you get more points to use and you're exercising more food is my kind of reward for exercising well for anything really op i really think that this diet works so if you're looking for a long term diet plan this is effective i'd also like to link you to this three day diet which will help you lose lbs of water weight which is an extremely positive and encouraging way to go into a long term diet plan just follow the menu exactly and drink hot green tea instead of black coffee it will be a difficult three days but there should be enough food to keep you from starving and it will be over in just three days with you about lbs lighter i'll tell you that i did this and cheated a few times and had a sweet or two and still lost lbs of water weight in that three days' time http www webmd com diet features the day diet src rss nafwa good luck Atkins Nutritional Approach Weight Watchers Obesity Adjustable gastric band Stomach cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Prostate cancer Super Size Me Breastfeeding Clinical depression Weight training Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Fecal incontinence Happiness One Tree Hill (TV series) Nutrition Healthy eating Fasting We Belong Together Social rule Consensus decision-making Soft drink Raw food diet Weight loss Economy of Africa Diabetes mellitus Chronic fatigue syndrome Terri Schiavo Tea Coeliac disease Microeconomics Hypoglycemia Urinary incontinence Alcoholic beverage Garfield Social psychology Meal Sharon Tate Chocolate Folic acid Dick Gregory Japanese tea ceremony Tooth Rape Fancy rat Simone Weil Breakfast Strategic management Foreign policy of Japan Principal-agent problem Inflation About a Boy Vegetarianism In-N-Out Burger Addiction Vegetarianism and religion Bread Blood on the Tracks Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Coffee Theory of conduct Gastric bypass surgery Hamster Arguments for and against drug prohibition Homer Simpson Utilitarianism Nicomachean Ethics Vegetarian nutrition Dead Like Me Food guide pyramid Cat South Beach diet Extreme Programming Eating disorder Dog Space Shuttle program Human height Tai Chi Chuan Pig (zodiac) Japan-United States relations Food Expert system Theodicy Ramen Survival skills Billboard Hot 100 Autism Discus (fish)
