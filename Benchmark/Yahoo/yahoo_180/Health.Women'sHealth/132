i'm scared okay so here is another question posted about possible pregnancy i know go buy a pregnancy test but i can't do that actually kind of hard to hide it from your mom hah but anyway let me explain what happened i did somethings got some stuff on my hand just a minor bit though and then as soon as it happened like i mean the second it happened i went to the bathroom and washed my hands throughly after that i went to go to the bathroom but before i wiped or even came within close contact with my vagina i washed my hands again and then once more after i used the bathroom and when i wiped i barely even touched it and i stayed right on top just incase i still had anything on my hand then afterwards i even changed my shorts i was wearing you know just incase i've still been worried about pregnacy for some reason i even called a health center and they said it was a in a million chance i could've gotten pregnant what do you guys think tell me this all happened a week and a few days ago ever since then i've felt awful but that is only because i've been sick with some sort of a stomach flu i think i'm just overreacting and the health center said they think i though about it to the point of getting my stomach so stressed out i can't relax my stomach is tight and in knots it feels like but i think the reason it's like that is because i can't go to the bathroom yes i'm constapated p but thismorning i woke up and one of my breats were sore i think that is also just because i've been sleeping with a bra off something i normally don't do and because i went camping over the weekend and worked many muscles in my body i know if your pregnant your breasts get sore but i thought that happened more into pregnancy and both of them would ache not just and it isn't continual pain it just hurts a little if i lay on it does anyone have any advice for me i'm not nauseated and i don't feel hungry like at all oh you poor thing you are getting yourself worked up for nothing it really is highly unlikely that you could be pregnant and your worry is making your body play tricks on you you did the right thing being careful and washing your hands i think you should be just fine relax worry like this can even cause your period to be delayed which will only compound the situation because you will be thinking you really are pregnant when you're not Breastfeeding Urinary incontinence Knots Landing EastEnders Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stomach cancer Fecal incontinence Fertility awareness Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Common cold Mattress Menstrual cup Social rule Abortion debate Milton H.
