irregular worried ok i had my last period on june th i have a day cycle so i should've gotten my period on like july rd or something but i didn't get it i know it could have just skipped it cuz i only got my period years ago but on the nd of july i had like really light brown spotting and it went away now in the past weeks i have been getting on and off very mild cramps lately i've been paying alot more attention to my body cuz for some strange reason i keep thinking im pregnant which is impossible cuz im a virgin could this have happened before and i just didn't notice it also my boobs are swollen like i'm about to have my period but it hasn't come yet i've heard that if you worry about your period it can be delayed and stuff if that is the case for me would i have cramps until i got it or should they have gone away if my period is late so what was the brown spoting why is my period late and why do i have cramps its really is not likely that im pregnant i've never even been in the same room with a naked guy unless there was like somehow sperm on my hand when i was masturbating it is impossible stress will cause your period to be late if your a virgin you really have nothing to worry about if this continues to happen for a few months and it is really spaced out if might be an issue really dont worry about it relax Menstrual cycle EastEnders Pregnancy Apollo 8 Jon Secada Charles Graner Shaggy dog story The Inside Time 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Social rule The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Milton H.
