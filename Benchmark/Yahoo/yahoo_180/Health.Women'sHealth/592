period pains feeling down what to do they are aching and i feel like i don't want to walk or move at all lol what helps aw i really hate period cramps well it may seem strange but one of the best things you can do is light exercise swimming is especially good as the water supports your body so it is a more relaxing way to exercise however you would have to wear a tampon for that so many girls don't feel comfortable doing so walking the dog or taking a light jog around the block can help too if you don't feel like exercising on your period you're not alone i hate it then take a hot bubbly bath the hot water will help to ease the cramps and the bath itself will help relax you and make you feel a lot better every girl has different ways of relieving her period pains and some may work better on some girls than on others everyone is different but some other suggestions are to drink a nice warm cup of milky tea sugary if you like it that way putting a hot water bottle on the place where it hurts like having a bath the heat will help to ease the pain taking some painkillers if your pains persist it's best to ask your mum about this because she will know how you're feeling and will be able to give you the best type of painkiller for the job hope you feel better x Menstrual cup Social rule Sauna Osteoarthritis Hyperthermia Swimming pool Tea Little Britain Sento Diving Cramp Menstrual cycle Mattress Breastfeeding Japanese tea ceremony Fecal incontinence Chronic fatigue syndrome Customs and etiquette of Japan First aid Urinary incontinence Brassiere Milk Prostate cancer Massage Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Shining (film) LSD Running Pain About a Boy Milton H.
