what type of tennis ball machine do you recommend i used to play a lot in college and now years later i need to get back in the game it would just be me using it i do have electricity at the local court but am willing to look at the battery operated ones out there too thanks for the input a few months ago i spent quite a lot of time researching the available ball machines decided on a battery operated two rotating wheel as opposed to pneumatic with verticle wheels not side by side side by side can't generate topspin then bought the silent partner sport on sale now at sptennis com for shipping didn't want to spend the extra for the pro it's excellent best purchase i have made in years i use it everyday my game has improved dramatically adjustable speed angle pitch speed topspin backspin oscillation etc it can pitch at mph with incredible topspin just like venus has two batteries is easily interchangeable so if you want to pick up an additional one off the net for you can swap them out i get about to hours out of one overnight charge of the two built in batteries some drawbacks although it does have wheels and a pull handle it's a bit awkward to lug around weighs about lbs you'll see what i mean but then all machines are and of course all machines have this problem the tennis balls the machine holds balls you must have a pickup hopper gamma makes one for about that holds balls not bad and the balls themselves i spent about buying heavy duty pressurized penn tennis balls they lasted about weeks then the ball placement on the court became inconsistent i then spent another buying pressureless balls they lasted about weeks hitting hours per day they are now bald they land consistently the court but they bounce odd my message to you is this silent partner sport or pro if you want the remote and be prepared to buy a whole lot of tennis balls i have spent about k total on machine and balls this year and expect to spend another before the snow sets in oh one other thing for the entrepreneur in you almost daily someone asks me if they can rent my machine Am__lie Mauresmo Elena Dementieva Kim Clijsters Serena Williams Steffi Graf Andre Agassi Martina Navratilova Pete Sampras John McEnroe Grand Slam (tennis) Chris Evert Bj__rn Borg Martina Hingis Nicole Vaidi__ov__ Mary Pierce The Championships, Wimbledon Piccolo Junior Saga Virginia Ruano Pascual Rod Laver June 2005 in sports Stefan Edberg 2005 US Open Women's Tennis Association Jimmy Connors Billie Jean King Mats Wilander Ai Sugiyama Sania Mirza Andy Roddick Roy Emerson Roger Federer July 2005 in sports Monica Seles Lindsay Davenport Tennis at the 2004 Summer Olympics Goran Ivani__evi__ Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Michael Chang Datalore (TNG episode) Tennis Gustavo Kuerten Lleyton Hewitt Boris Becker Venus Williams Anastasia Myskina The Shining (film) John Newcombe Arantxa S__nchez Vicario Australian English Ivan Lendl Paola Su__rez Conspiracy (TNG episode) Jennifer Capriati Patrick Rafter June 2004 in sports Social rule The Star Wars Holiday Special She Loves You Marat Safin Michael Stich Theory of conduct Whose Line Is It Anyway?
