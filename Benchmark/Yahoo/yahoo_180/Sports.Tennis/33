tennis serve american twist vs kick serve hello i was wondering if any of you have ever preformed an american twist serve or a kick serve my tennis teacher tells me that the american twist serve is a flat serve and is used as a first serve also he has told me that i have used a kick serve during practice is there a difference between the two and also on another note what kind of spin serve is best for your second serve i have performed a kick serve many times and is partly my nd serve the american twist is very hard to get used to but can be effective if the person doesn't know it's coming the american twist serve is not a flat serve it has spin on the ball that is the opposite of slice like a seam fastball in baseball the big difference between the kick serve and the american twist serve is that the kick serve bounces up whereas the american twist serve bounces like the opposite of slice but not that much my nd serve is more like a serve half slice and half kick and it varies depending on my ball toss hope this helps and good luck in your tennis game Tennis Table tennis Serve (tennis) Fast bowling Volleyball Grip (tennis) Aerial (dance move) Badminton Beer Pong Glossary of American football Baseball Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Seishun Academy Middle School Tennis shots Swingout Professional wrestling attacks Skateboarding trick Real tennis Cricket ball Slower ball Textile manufacturing Types of bowlers in cricket Cross-country skiing Knuckleball Suplex Four square Craps Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 American football Electrophysiology Koopa Troopa Canadian football Mario Comparison of Canadian and American football Professional wrestling throws Professional wrestling aerial techniques Rugby union New York Giants Sandy Koufax Racquetball GunBound Football (soccer) Rifle Limit Break Professional wrestling holds Coin flipping Laws of cricket Rugby union positions Spin bowling Manifold Basketball Super Bowl XXI The Prince of Tennis Ty Cobb Pitcher Australian rules football Football Cricket Leg spin Pete Sampras Tennis Bill Tilden Rugby league Onside kick Field hockey Laws of the Game Dropkick Super Bowl XXV Satchel Paige Magnus effect Super Bowl XXVII Piccolo Junior Saga Marching band Bowling strategy (cricket) American football strategy National Football League Lore St. Louis Cardinals Glossary of partner dance terms Major League Baseball television contracts Professional wrestling slang Tris Speaker Social rule Steffi Graf Water polo Tenshinhan ELO rating system Ball Kung Lao Sudden death Violin Drop kick Paintball Obi-Wan Kenobi Capoeira Winning Streak Football (soccer) positions Vin Scully E.L.E.C.T.I.O.N.S.
