do tennis pros's restring their racquet's every time after a match or use the same one the next day their tennis raqeuts always seem to be brand new and if they do restring them how come they still have the logo sing in them simple answer is some do and some don't pete sampras had a stringer that usually travelled with him and he would have all his rackets restrung for every match including the ones he never used you do that if you have the and he did but not until he was most restring for each tournament where there is a change in conditions and have the racket they played with that day restrung the logo is just a stencil and there is a large 'magic marker' they color the strings with some stringers in your area probably can do yours for about if they have your brand stencil like the wilson 'w' or prince 'p' etc you can buy the stencils also and do it yourself i think the tenniswarehouse has them and probably all the big tennis shops they used to sell a kit that had the entire alphabet so you could put your own initial on the racket if you want your own custom logo done google search custom tennis stencils and there is atleast one company who will make a custom stencil for you Volleyball Pete Sampras Tennis Professional wrestling aerial techniques 1957 World Series Kim Clijsters Bj__rn Borg Fielding (cricket) New York Giants Four square Pinball Roger Federer Badminton Association of Tennis Professionals Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Videocon Tri-Series 2005-06 Grand Slam (tennis) Andre Agassi Vin Scully Professional wrestling throws Snooker Lindsay Davenport The Championships, Wimbledon Toronto Raptors Women's Tennis Association Bill Tilden Shaggy dog story Fast bowling Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Martina Hingis Steffi Graf Kurt Angle Batting (cricket) Mark Philippoussis National Football League Lore Seishun Academy Middle School 2004 American League Championship Series Beer Pong Chris Evert Whitney Houston World Series Los Angeles Kings Golf Tag Pete Sampras Tennis Serena Williams John McEnroe Racquetball Sports timeline American football strategy Paintball Water polo Cleveland Browns Tenshinhan Laws of cricket Eddie Guerrero Andrew Murray (tennis player) Super Bowl XXVII The Ashes Martina Navratilova The Isley Brothers Real tennis San Francisco 49ers Justine Henin-Hardenne Ultimate (sport) Squash (sport) Gustavo Kuerten Sania Mirza English cricket team Rugby union positions 2005 World Series Rugby union Jimmy Connors Mary Pierce Super Bowl XIX Suzanne Lenglen Blood (computer game) Squash tennis Tennis at the 2004 Summer Olympics Extreme Dodgeball Britney Spears Serve (tennis) Cliff Richard Slam Dunk Contest History of Test cricket (to 1883) Robin Ventura Jennifer Capriati Indian Oil Cup 2005 Michael Chang Parachuting Stefan Edberg Michael Jordan Tennis shots Basketball Tennis Masters Cup Ken Rosewall Lleyton Hewitt Suplex ESPN25
