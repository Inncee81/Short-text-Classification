do you give your breast fed baby multivitamin supplements with iron my doctor recommended that i start giving my baby multivitamin supplements poli vi sol with iron as of months of age my baby is now almost months and i have actually only given the vitamins several times and discontinued to do so because i had read in my breastfeeding book the nursing mother's companion that it was not neccesary and that it could hinder some absorption of important nutrients that my breast milk is giving the baby i am a full time breastfeeding mommy and i have not started my baby on solids yet second question when i do start my baby on solids at months this is when i read he may need a vitamin supplement should i not give him the vitamins with iron because the cereal also has iron what is your experience with this thanks for all the responses i wanted to add some info i live in sunny california and because i live in a sunny climate i thought i did not need extra vit d i do take my baby on late afternoon walks daily where he receives indirect sunlight i dont think i have any defects in my milk supply i eat healthy and i have a seven year old who was also breast fed by me who is rarely ever sick and is an exceptional student i actually have a very healthy it seems little guy although on the larger side who was pounds ounces and in length at his month check up percentile for both it seems by most of your responses that it was good that i followed my instincts and choose not to give him the vitamins they seem so unnatural they stink and he made the worst face when he took it i actually plan to find a new pediatrician when my medical insurance changes i would love to hear more about people omitting cereal from their babies diets that is interesting thanks everyone the extra iron is not necessary though many doctors still don't know it because of their own lack of research your book was right when solids come just do foods rich in iron like leafy greens pureed steamed spinach unless your baby shows signs of some kind of deficiency no vitamins are necessary just a healthy varied diet for him and you are all that you need congrats good job and good luck Veganism Tocopherol Milk Omega-3 fatty acid Vitamin D Guinea pig Vitamin C Coeliac disease Childbirth Vitamin Anemia Cyanocobalamin Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Nutrition Retinol Infant formula Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Healthy eating Dieting Vegetarian nutrition Rickets Hypoglycemia Domestic rabbit Hamster Prostate cancer Protein-energy malnutrition Golden rice Multiple sclerosis Atkins Nutritional Approach Chronic fatigue syndrome Fertility awareness Food Breast milk Breast Dog Egg (food) Terri Schiavo Cat Health insurance Growth hormone treatment Nestl__ boycott Pet skunk Bodybuilding Dairy Infant Prolactinoma Nipple piercing Human skin color Little Britain Malnutrition Organic food EastEnders Scurvy Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Elephant Obesity Controversies in autism Obstetrics Vitamin poisoning Dietary fiber Puberty Alzheimer's disease Riboflavin Dietary supplement Brassiere Cystic fibrosis Polychlorinated biphenyl Spina bifida Anorexia nervosa Vitamin K Carpal tunnel syndrome Oily fish Urinary incontinence Antioxidant Newborn screening Clinical depression Koala Livestock Fancy rat Sharon Tate Insulin Nurse Ulcerative colitis Diarrhea Osteoporosis International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes Nestl__ Rice
