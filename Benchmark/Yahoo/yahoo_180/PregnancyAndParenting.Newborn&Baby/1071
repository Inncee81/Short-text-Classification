does anyone get gov't help other than wic what is it how does it work i'm sure it's diff in ever state but i'm just wondering about people's experiences or do you know someone that's on something well i'm on medicaid reason being we were in the process of getting medical insurance when i found out i was pregnant as a result no one would except me we had a hard time getting approved too but finally did its no different then any other insurance for us except right now we don't have to pay for it but i get to go to an actual doctor alot of people believe you can only go to the health department and the treatment is the same especially with the obgyn alot of people told me they would only give me one ultrasound being on medicaid but they were wrong you get as many as the ob thinks you need and i get to have my baby in a hospital there are alot of rumours that its at a birthing center which isn't true its basically the same as having medical insurance only difference is you are not paying for it and months after you have the baby your medicaid is cancelled my opinion is that maybe instead for someone like me who could afford to pay a little bit instead of paying nothing should have to pay something maybe not as much as regular insurance cost but not get it for free either for instance my daughter is on peachcare and its the same as any other insurance she goes for yearly checkups and to a real pediatrician but once she turned we started paying a monthly fee here in ga it doesn't work any differently other than the pay now i'm not on wic we could have qualified for it but we can afford food so there was no reason for us to try and get it as far as experience with it it has been great and they were very helpful Health insurance Health care in the United States Medicaid Medicare (United States) Insurance Life insurance Canadian and American health care systems compared Pregnancy Medical malpractice Annuity Medicare (Canada) Legal aspects of transsexualism Hillary Rodham Clinton Health maintenance organization Unemployment EastEnders Prenatal diagnosis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma US health reform under FDR Wal-Mart Flat tax Food and Drug Administration Childbirth Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Theory of conduct Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services National Kidney Foundation Singapore Abortion American Medical Association United States Postal Service Chiropractic Education in Germany Transsexuality Stomach cancer Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pharmaceutical company Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Economics Nursing home Hormone replacement therapy (trans) National Health Service Pet skunk Kodocha Variable universal life insurance Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme Humphrey Bogart Medicine Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Circumcision MMORPG Mutual fund Taxation in the United States Circumcision advocacy Open access Growth hormone treatment Arguments for and against drug prohibition Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Social Security Administration Neighbours Midwifery Alcoholics Anonymous Mental Health Act 1983 Pseudoscience Involuntary commitment Education in the United States Urinary incontinence Medicare (Australia) Managed care Emergency Medical Services Philosophical skepticism U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Friends Terri Schiavo Alternative medicine Copyright Public Eye Anorexia nervosa Social rule Folic acid 2003 California recall Health savings account Medical prescription HIPAA Knots Landing Edith Nourse Rogers Vicente Fox Canada Health Act Traumatic brain injury Fecal incontinence Traditional Chinese medicine In vitro fertilisation Microeconomics
