crazy hands the swaddled baby whenever i put my mnth old to sleep i swaddle him during the day he is fine but at night after sleeping a few hours he starts to squirm because he wants his arms out so i let them out he's fine for about an hour but then he's squirming because his hands are moving around rubbing his face or whatever and it's waking him up so i have to swaddle him again and he'll fall asleep if i stop swaddling him do you think he'll get used to having free hands while he's sleeping or does it just get better as he gets older i swaddled my baby till he was months the falling reflex goes away by then they don't startle as much as they get older if it helps him sleep then swaddle him until the falling reflex has gone for him try the free hands during the day when you are up that way he'll get used to it and at night when he breaks out of his blanket he wont wake up ease him through it and in no time he'll be able to go to sleep without being swaddled Narcolepsy The Amber Spyglass Shaggy dog story Urinary incontinence Sleep Breastfeeding Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban W.I.T.C.H.
