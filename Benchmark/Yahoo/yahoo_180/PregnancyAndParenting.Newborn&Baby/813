did you ever get your life back after having a baby my son is months he seems to be getting easier to take care of i know his cries he's more predictable and more social hopefully soon he'll be holding his own bottle crawling and entartaining himself i know our lives won't be the same as they were before but after st year does it get easier caring for your child do you get back some of the freedom of doing things hhaha sorrry this question bugs you but you also didnt read into it does it sound like i hate my life with you giving me advice on pretty much not asking this it does get easier as far as the physical act of caring for children the diapers get less they do hold their bottles and eat 'table' food themselves and when they're mobile it opens up a whole host of problems but makes it easier too so it really doesn't get 'easier' or 'harder' in my opinion just constantly different once you're not changing diapers anymore you're cleaning up bedwetting accidents once you're not holding the bottle anymore you're picking up bottles and everything else that were thrown across the room once you don't have to carry them everywhere they're running off all the time once you can communicate with them and ask what they want they also start to yell at you every stage hell every day has it's own independent challenges it seems you do get a life back but like you said never the one you had before but i've found the older my kids get and mos the more normal it seems our lives have adapted to having little ones in it but we still get our own time back now too sometimes Infantilism Urinary incontinence Fecal incontinence Surveillance Breastfeeding Kimberly-Clark Corporation Kitchen Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Diaper Kodocha The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe The Fairly OddParents The Amber Spyglass Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Avenue Q The Apprentice 2 Jon Secada The Contender (television series) RuneScape quests Theory of conduct Scenes from a Memory Professional wrestling match types Aerial (dance move) Elimination communication Trailer Park Boys Poker jargon Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?
