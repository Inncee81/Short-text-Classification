i'm confused about something i hear all of these people say that letting babies cry is cruel i think that it was the best way to teach my daughter how to sleep in her crib for the first couple nights i would give her a bath and then put her down in her crib and she would cry for about min and then she would fall asleep and sleep all night then after a couple of nights everytime i put her down she would always be awake but she would never cry and fall asleep all on her own she is months old now i don't understand why people are saying that it is mean and cruel i know letting your child cry is not easy it was awful for me but now she knows its bedtime and she knows that she is not going to have mommy running in and out because she is crying she knows that she has to go to sleep and she does does anybody agree with me or is it just me i don't need rude comments everybody raises there children differently so i really do not want to hear about what a bad mother i am for letting my baby cry there is a difference of what you are doing and just getting fed up and placing your child in a crib and not attending i think as long as you make sure that the baby is fine diaper fed etc and that they are truely tired let them cry all they are doing is fighting thier sleep now if it takes longer and they are still crying yes go in there and get them out and double check and try to put them to sleep another way crying out it is so funny it use to be something that was a big thing it was a parenting fad now jsut like everything else that was done when we were kids cruel blah blah blah i am sorry i look at my generation and the ones before and we didnt have all the crap going on in society everyday like we do now days oh gosh sorry i got on a rant lol you arent a bad mother you are a good mother just ignore it some of the ppl who comment about this things dont even have kiddos some of them are the if's The Catcher in the Rye John the Baptist Social rule Phoebe Buffay's songs Sleep Breastfeeding Ayyavazhi mythology Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an AFI 100 Years series Infantilism Laura Schlessinger Sudden infant death syndrome Friends Urinary incontinence Little Britain Kill Bill Knots Landing What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?
