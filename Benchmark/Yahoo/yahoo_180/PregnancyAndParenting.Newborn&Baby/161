doctor messed up at my week postpartum check up with my ob gyn i told him that i was breastfeeding and supplementing with formula and that i would continue to do so even when i would return to work he gave me nuvaring for birthcontrol and i thought nothing of it i started using it about a week and a half ago and after doing some research saw that it's not intended for women who breastfeed since the hormones can affect the baby i took the ring out and haven't been breastfeeding since how long will it take for the hormones to leave my body after using it for about weeks i try to pump to keep my supply up but i don't produce much and never did with the pump my son is only months and i don't want him to be strictly on formula help go to you ob gyn explain this to him her tell them everything you just told us they should have the correct answer you need but if the doctor doesn't realise or act like they messed up then get a new ob gyn you can also ask your babies doctor can't say it is in their field but they would know who you should talk to because there profession is on the other end of the breastfeeding Breastfeeding Fertility awareness Childbirth Prostate cancer Postpartum depression Infant formula Prolactinoma Shaggy dog story Social rule Milk Emergency contraception Oxytocin Ocean's Twelve Pregnancy Breast Vitamin D EastEnders Folic acid Ben Johnson (athlete) Postnatal Friends Stuttering Breast pump Theory of conduct The Shining (film) Prolactin Breast cancer Nipple piercing Urinary incontinence Nutrition Kodocha The Empty Child Clinical depression Hormone replacement therapy (trans) The Doctor Dances The Parting of the Ways Stomach cancer Obstetrics Protein-energy malnutrition Infant Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Little Britain Puberty Cooperative education The Death Gate Cycle Baldness treatments Haven (TNG episode) Thyroid Neighbours The Ark in Space Breast milk Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Menstrual cycle Nestl__ boycott Fiddler on the Roof Jam (TV series) Angel One (TNG episode) Insulin AIDS Sharon Tate Carburetor The Amber Spyglass One (Voyager episode) Nestl__ Cancer Hey Jude Jennifer Lopez Fecal incontinence Phoebe Halliwell Blood Simple The Miracles Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Traumatic brain injury The Ashlee Simpson Show Characters of Lost Doctor Who and the Silurians The Keeper of Traken Piccolo Junior Saga Baby bottle Androgen insensitivity syndrome In vitro fertilisation Protein Haloperidol Pyramids of Mars Brassiere What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?
