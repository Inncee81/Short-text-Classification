my month old son spends all his naps in the stroller for one month i was able to get my son to nap in the crib months of age then he developed a yeast infection on his face weeks ago and then i could no longer get him down it would take hours on off so i would just give up and take him out for a car ride stroller ride now he spends all his naps in the stroller i find he sleeps much better than in the crib he used to only sleep minutes in the crib but will sleep hrs in the stroller i park it in the front hallway after he falls asleep my question is is this a bad habit to get into when it takes little time for him to fall asleep in the stroller but ages in the crib the basic rule i found with my son when he was an infant was that everything is a phase he would do these things that i didn't understand but try not to fight it when my son was an newborn he wouldn't sleep anywhere but on my chest it was a really hard stage to go through then when he was about months old he was actually willing to sleep on his own but he would only sleep in our bed now he is and he sleeps all night on his own in his own room all night long i found that if you try to force it it becomes something that your little guy is going to get stressed over and then it becomes an issue just go with it never give up trying to get him down in his crib but if it causes him stress it's your job to alleviate that stress and make him comfortable you need to build that trust in him and let him know that you're going to be there for him and rescue him he'll eventually go to sleep in his crib or in his bed plus if it gives you a two hour break go with it and take time to get that much needed relaxation Sleep Sudden infant death syndrome Narcolepsy Childbirth Mattress Urinary incontinence Baby transport Public transport Time Out of Mind Shaggy dog story Social rule Polyphasic sleep Time Lucid dreaming Co-sleeping Extreme Programming Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sin City Cat Sleep debt Insomnia Delayed sleep phase syndrome Bombe Characters in the Smurfs Apollo 8 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Equine conformation Avenue Q Herpes simplex virus The Shining (film) Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Sleep disorder Knots Landing Rapid eye movement Infant Infantilism Humphrey Bogart Kurt Cobain Daylight saving time Traumatic brain injury Days of our Lives Out-of-body experience W.I.T.C.H.
