does childbirth hurt as much as people tell us and do epidurals help how long till they kick in and does actually getting the needle put into you hurt please only if you have had a baby i did not have an epidural and it was the best decision i could have made for myself the pain was really not that bad i actually felt incredible sense of relief and it actually felt good to push when the time came the contractions are uncomfortable but once they let me push the pain totally went away and it actually felt amazing i was suprised that it felt so powerful i can't even describe the emotion and the spirituality it was absolutely awe inspiring i felt like superwoman when i was pushing him through the ring of fire it was like genesis i don' t know how to explain it but i am sooo soo glad i did not have an epidural they even had the doctor coming in from home to do the epidural i was in tears because i didn't want it and they were going to do it anyways because they were sure i couldn't handle the pain as if i wasn't strong enough to birth my child the way the mothers before me had it's like certain doctors just want to make the extra money off of a medical procedure that actually takes away from such a beautiful experience and convinces women over time that the pain is unbearable like they are too weak to do what is natural for them like they have no inner reserve or intuition or instincts to carry them through ok ok gets off soapbox no epidural for me it did not hurt like everyone would say it's like an orgasm times it's not like a broken bone or a car accident Childbirth Epidural Theory of conduct Breastfeeding Prostate cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma One Tree Hill (TV series) Traumatic brain injury Pregnancy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an W.I.T.C.H.
