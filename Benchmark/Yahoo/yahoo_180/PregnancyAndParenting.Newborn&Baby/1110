how much is too much alright i asked a question similar but didn't really get any response my baby ate oz of milk and oz of water which the doctor told me i could give him water in a hour time period and then he'll be starving again in hours my doctor said not to feed him more than oz every feeding but he acts like he is starving with only oz do you think it hurts him for him to eat that much my doctor didn't want him to eat more than oz cuz he didn't want him to spit up alot but he never spits up my baby is weeks sorry forgot to put that also if i stop at oz he starts crying so hard that he choaks on his own salivia but he isn't gaining too much weight actually he barely gains any at all the doctor also said to give him water so that his poop wouldn't be so solid if your baby is hungry feed him think about it this way if you were breastfeeding your son you would have no idea if he was eating oz every three hours or if he was slurping down oz every three hours and when you took your son in for his check up the pediatrician wouldn't even ask you how many oz your son was eating at a feeding he would just check your son's growth rate to make sure he was gaining weight correctly edit i just read your latest additional info if your son isn't gaining weight at weeks and your pediatrician is suggesting you limit your son's nutritional intake you need a new doctor Breastfeeding Dieting Milk Childbirth Atkins Nutritional Approach Fertility awareness Ron and Fez Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Folic acid Stomach cancer Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Carburetor Obesity Little Britain Protein-energy malnutrition Milton H.
