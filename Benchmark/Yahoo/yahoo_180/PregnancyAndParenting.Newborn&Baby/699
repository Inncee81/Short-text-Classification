breast feeding bottle feeding this is my second child and i would love to try breast feeding although i would like to use both bottles and breast is there anyway i can use formula during the day and then breast like at night time or do i have to stick to just breast milk only also i know its time consuming to pump the milk all the time so if im only breast feeding part the time do i still have to pump the milk if you want to breastfeed you need to make it not so confusing for baby if you give them a bottle early on it can cause nipple confusion or make the baby a lazy eater at the nipple you should talk to a lactation consultant i had to supplement with formula early on but i was showed a different way without a bottle but a little cup that you would pour cough syrup in they would just sort of lick it into their mouths i didn't like that so i started the bottle i was also breastfeeding with a nipple shield so that immediately caused nipple confusion for my daughter she still wouldn't take to my nipple which was so frustrating i resorted to strictly pumping with formula on rare occasions it was hard at first but you get in a routine and it just becomes part of your normal every day life Infant Milk Nipple Infant formula Breast Baby bottle Prolactin Breast pump Nipple piercing Mastitis Nestl__ Brassiere Mammary gland Breast milk International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes Tea Dairy Pacifier Indianapolis 500 Cat Patent medicine Haloperidol Veganism Coffee Nudity Nestl__ boycott Jaundice Siphon Folic acid Prolactinoma Married... with Children Vitamin D Childbirth Recurring South Park characters Toilet humour Coca-Cola Yoko Ono Janet Jackson Elephant Hong Kong-style milk tea Bottle Maple syrup Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Krusty the Clown The Super Milk-chan Show Medical analysis of circumcision Oxytocin Omega-3 fatty acid Puberty Metastasis Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy Abortion Breast fetishism Bj__rk Drawn Together Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Bong Cytomegalovirus Breast cancer Docosahexaenoic acid Urinary incontinence Breakfast Salad Fingers Sea-Monkey Sugar beet Garfield Obstetrics Champagne (beverage) Teat Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Bottle Rocket (film) Phil Hendrie Guinea pig Intravenous therapy Kodocha Rickets Fiddler on the Roof Trailer Park Boys Gastroesophageal reflux disease Supernumerary nipple Domestic goat Conker's Bad Fur Day New Coke Internal ballistics Thermal power station Kosher foods Male lactation Orgasm Glycogen storage disease type I Carburetor Breast reduction Milkshake Little Britain Premature birth Platypus Characters in the Smurfs
