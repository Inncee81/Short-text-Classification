mth old sleep problems she has been a good sleeper for months but since the past month shes waking up twice per night it is driving me crazy shes slowed down on her milk intake and wont have one before bed but cries and cries and tantrums until i give in at pm or at am and give her just a little bit i know it is comfort but she wont let water suffice or cry herself to sleep any help out there anyone please hi i have thesame problem with my son but what i do is that i give him thesame bottle and that soothes him back to sleep withinn minutes and then if he wakes up again at nightitme i give him the bottle again and its ok but what i may suggest for yourself if your daughter wont have anything thats milk well you could do the following and that is just put one to one and halve spoon of the formula and dilut that in water ml on what ever amount you put in and just give it to her this way you are not going throgh so much formula and it takes care of your daghter quickly otherwise just keep trying the the empty bottle theory Breastfeeding Sleep Mattress Insomnia The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Milk New Coke The Shining (film) Hypoglycemia Knots Landing Indianapolis 500 Apollo 8 Urinary incontinence The Lovely Bones W.I.T.C.H.
