how can i get my baby to eat more i have an month old baby i am pretty sure he is teething my question is how long will his decrease in appetite last he has been refusing solids for about a month now as soon as i put him in his high chair he cries and gets stiff so i wont put him down once i get him in he will only have one or two spoonfuls baby spoons and then he pushes the food away i'm starting to worry he breastfeeds about times in the day for about minutes and then he still feeds at night we co sleep i know he needs to eat solids now but how long will this last it never happened with my other kids help he had been eating solids since months and used to love them he would eat a stage baby food jar and sometimes even more he has always had his solids in his high chair so i dont think it is the chair itself i think its the association with food but why try feeding him on your lap also be sure to breastfeed him right before he eats so that's he's not super hungry this will allow him to think of food as a fun thing rather than what the heck is she doing i'm starving where's my nursies don't stress though as long as he is nursing well he is getting all he really needs at this point solids are more for practice than for nutrition he'll be interested in food eventually i promise Breastfeeding Childbirth Fertility awareness Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Infant Infant formula AFI 100 Years series Dieting Stomach cancer Milton H.
