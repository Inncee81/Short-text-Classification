change in my baby's poop my almost month old use to poop what we called colorful rocks they were almost the size and consistancy of an adult poop and was either green or yellow tinted depending on what he ate now instantly his poop is a very runny yellow and smells to high heaven the only change we've made in his diet is adding some gerber rd foods that are a lil chunkier any thoughts on why this is happening the family was sick for a day hour flu thing but it's been a while now and he still poops dijonaise no meat or milk products yet maybe your baby is dehyrdrated since the food is chunkier it has less liguid so its depriving the child of the liguid try giving him more fluids also maybe the chunkier food you gave him doesnt sit well with his stomach you know just like adults if they eat something to heavy like a new york style hot dog or a spicy exotic food they re stomachs act weird well maybe your baby just has a sensitive stomach nothing to worry about Cat Comanche Milk Hot dog Cuisine of Malaysia Chocolate Tofu Cuisine of Denmark Fecal incontinence Stomach cancer Miso Egg (food) Foodborne illness Russian cuisine "Weird Al" Yankovic Food Curry Cuisine of the Philippines Dog Peruvian cuisine Gray Wolf Common cold Elephant Jewish cuisine Kashrut Chicken Veganism Hair coloring Satay Food coloring Soul food Guinea pig Cantonese cuisine Dairy Livestock Cuisine of Laos Lactose intolerance Garlic Trichinosis Cuisine of Brazil Cuisine of Africa Stomach Japanese cuisine Barbecue Korean cuisine Atkins Nutritional Approach Coeliac disease Gastroesophageal reflux disease Ramen Fasting Domestic rabbit Breakfast Pancake Brain Capercaillie Geography of Bolivia Sauerkraut Coconut crab Domestic goat Kit Kat Puberty Salad Fingers Kodocha Gurage Hypoglycemia Tooth Cuisine of Thailand Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Insulin Gastroenteritis The Wack Pack Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Fugu Taboo food and drink Cuisine of Singapore Diabetes mellitus In-N-Out Burger MRE Vomiting Feces Kosher foods Protein-energy malnutrition Gastroparesis Color theory Whose Line Is It Anyway?
