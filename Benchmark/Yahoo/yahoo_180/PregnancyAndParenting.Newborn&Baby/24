holding his own head up already my son is weeks and days old and he's holding his own head up already sometimes it will go forward but very infrequently i can't believe he can do it this soon he has been for a few weeks but now i can actually carry him around and not have to support is head is this normal well of course i still support his head when needed but he's getting so good i can choose to walk around with him when he's wide awake without supporting it i'm still careful though some babies can hold their own head by this age for a very short time but its still a good idea to support his head especially when you walk around because his muscles are still developing i can't believe how big he got and how beautiful he is i answered one of your quesitions before he was born and then your picture was just an utrasound glad he's happy and healthy enjoy and best wishes Urinary incontinence Equine conformation Le Malade imaginaire Humphrey Bogart Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Aerial (dance move) Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 March Androgen insensitivity syndrome Childbirth Jennifer Lopez The Catcher in the Rye Cerebral palsy Breastfeeding Professional wrestling throws Prostate cancer Strap-on dildo Shaggy dog story Rod Stewart Diazepam Care Bears Narcolepsy Pregnancy Poliomyelitis Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Abortion debate Traumatic brain injury Slow Train Coming Big Brother (USA TV series) Duchenne muscular dystrophy Hormone replacement therapy (trans) EastEnders The Star Wars Holiday Special John Edwards Infantilism Breech birth Baby Blues The Jazz Singer Guillain-Barr__ syndrome Melanie Wilkes Password Ayyavazhi mythology 1957 World Series USS Walke (DD-723) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Goodness and value theory Carrie Jacobs-Bond Nicomachean Ethics Cephalic disorder The Ashlee Simpson Show President of Germany Dieting Baby transport Bournemouth C__line Dion Insulin Apollo 8 Japanese tea ceremony Abortion in the United States Out-of-body experience Grumpy's Three Wishes Super Size Me Theory of conduct Electroconvulsive therapy Young Earth creationism Darwin from Descent of Man to Emotions Fast bowling Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Hiking Physical attractiveness Diving The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Swingout New York Jets Triathlon San Francisco 49ers Frankie Laine Random walk Toilet humour Clinical depression Intact dilation and extraction Cyprus dispute Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 The Time Machine Software engineering Mother Teresa 50 First Dates Divorce Armored Core USS Yorktown (CV-10) Glucocorticoid Utilitarianism Walking Freddy Fender Betting (poker) B-47 Stratojet Vitamin C Shen Gong Wu Insomnia Chlorpromazine
