recommendations needed i don't have my own car but need a car seat i live in a nyc walk up and do not own a car i expect i will occasionally travel in other people's cars and taxis so i need a car seat that is easy to carry and installs quickly ideally it would be only one that goes from infant to child but recommendations would be great also thanks i recommend the graco safeseat because it is the only infant seat that goes up to lbs infant seats are way easier to install than convertible seats and infant seats either come with a stroller they snap into or you can buy small folding metal frames that turn them into strollers yes carrying a lbs baby in an infant carrier is probably ridiculous but as i said you can get wheels for them and they are way easier to install pretty much no baby is more than lbs by one year and after one year you can use the carseats built into some minivans and suvs if you are lucky enough to have those available but you should use the infant seat as long as possible as they are safer there are a few forward facing only seats that have wheels built in for travel that is your other option after your baby outgrows the infant seat i don't have any specific recommendation on those Baby transport Station wagon Car safety Airbag Pickup truck Car body style Ford Motor Company Tire Breastfeeding Rear wheel drive Bicycle Sport utility vehicle Truck Infant Minivan Oldsmobile Silhouette Chevrolet Lumina APV Ford Falcon Taxicab Dodge Charger Passenger car Personal rapid transit Poker jargon Pontiac Trans Sport Mouse (computing) Drill bit Four wheel drive Motorcycle Honda Pilot Limousine P-61 Black Widow Mitsubishi 3000GT Ford Crown Victoria Armoured personnel carrier Lincoln LS Ethernet Hatchback Shopping cart Pontiac Aztek Autorack Pioneer Zephyr Renault Androgen insensitivity syndrome BMW Van (road vehicle) Drifting (motorsport) Toyota Prius Skateboarding trick TGV Mazda RX-7 Chevrolet Camaro Recumbent bicycle Public transport Boeing 747 Knife Manual transmission Tung Chung Dodge Aspen New York Central Railroad Crash test dummy Volkswagen Land Rover Chrysler Minivans Honda Civic Honda Prelude Buick Rendezvous The Amazing Race Locomotive Pregnancy Porsche 911 Spark plug Sex assignment Stuttering De Lorean DMC-12 Fuel efficiency Textile manufacturing Comanche Cytomegalovirus Panzer II BMW M5 Viva La Bam Social rule Toll road Crossover SUV Mercury Cougar Rapid transit Messerschmitt Bf 109 Mazda MPV Kimberly-Clark Corporation Mercedes-Benz A-Class Pennsylvania Railroad Toyota Corolla IPod Punt (boat) The Sims 2 Wind turbine
