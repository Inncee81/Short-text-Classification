month old and rash stool issues my daughter was born july at about weeks old she started getting a diaper rash i tried everything from balmex to cornstartch but it got to the point that it was eating away her skin and the doc gave me diff creams for it i've been using them properly but everytime the rash finally clears up it starts all over again pussing and eating away her skin then it gets better this cycle has happened times now also she has been having very frequent poopy diapers which is ok but i've noticed that lately they have been very soft and there has been some foamy poop colored thin jelly like liquid coming out there were also a few small traces of blood in it a few times but i thought it was ok except now there seems to be more and more little blood streaks with every diaper change shes not straining or constipated so i wouldnt think there would be any reason for blood never delt with these issuses with my first daughter help her doc appt for this is fri any insight till then she is formula fed and has been since she was born she was in the nicu for the first weeks after she was born for breathing problems and the docs started her on formula b c i was still recovering from the c section in a different hospital i'm using the same formula and diapers that they started her on in the nicu sounds exactly like my child when she was weeks old i noticed that her stools always contained mucous streaked blood in them turns out that she was allergic to milk protein since her first symptoms was bloody stools the doctor thought she was most likely alletgic to soy as well she was put on nutramigen but was also allergic to that after months of neocate she is back on nutramigen and doing wondefully at her month check which is only a month away they are going to try her on cow milk formula again anyway it sounds like an allergy to me what you should do is bring a stool sample with you one that has the blood or mucous in it the doctor will tell a lot from just looking at it as long as she is acting normal otherwise then i'm sure your child will be as good as knew once everything has been diagnosed Urinary incontinence Coeliac disease Fecal incontinence Breastfeeding Food allergy Allergy Prostate cancer Insulin Tofu Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Milk Diarrhea Eczema Infantilism Diaper Crohn's disease Childbirth Food Ebola Obstetrics Cat Group A streptococcal infection Soy milk Cytomegalovirus Feces Syphilis Cheese Hypoglycemia Adjustable gastric band Psoriasis Premature birth Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Multiple chemical sensitivity Asthma Tuberculosis Dietary fiber Traumatic brain injury Infant formula Ice cream Hay fever Tarantula Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Hemorrhoid Jaundice Acne Fancy rat Tattoo Cancer Menstrual cycle Gastroesophageal reflux disease Equine conformation First aid Peanut Zinc Soybean Constipation Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Anal fissure Sento Irritable bowel syndrome Carbon dioxide Smallpox Doxepin Breast milk Medicine Leptospirosis Haloperidol Veganism Colorectal cancer Hookworm Atkins Nutritional Approach Spina bifida Botulism Aspergillosis Decompression sickness Lupus erythematosus Bipolar disorder Glycogen storage disease type I Chronic fatigue syndrome Vampire Livestock Chlorpromazine Dialysis Lyme disease Stuttering Gastroenteritis Cystic fibrosis Pneumonia Protein-energy malnutrition Cirrhosis Elephant Ferret Bovine spongiform encephalopathy
