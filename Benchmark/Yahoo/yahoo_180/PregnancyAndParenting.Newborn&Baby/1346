how old does a baby have to be to sit in a front facing carseat i know a baby that sat in a front facing carseat before she was one year a little more than a month before she turned a year and she was over pounds and no longer fit in the newborn carseat her feet would bend because they were so close to the seat she's always been very long and a bit chubby most people will say year and pounds however the doctor said it was all right for her to be in a front facing carseat mainly considering it was winter and the parents could no longer put her in a rear facing carseat with a coat because the straps wouldn't go over her i'd say wait until the baby meets the normal requirement for year and pounds or if the doctor says it's okay try to stick with the rear facing carseat as long as possible until the baby reaches the year and ibs point M16 (rifle) Boxing Professional wrestling holds Baby transport Archery Equine conformation Comanche Humphrey Bogart Childbirth Horse Strap-on dildo Elephant Station wagon Recumbent bicycle Knife Drill bit Swingout Tire Professional wrestling throws Heinkel He 112 Breech birth Internal ballistics Mario Namsos campaign Snooker Revolver Four square Mouse (computing) Undergarment Aerial (dance move) Combine (Half-Life 2) Crash test dummy Motorcycle Ben Johnson (athlete) Bicycle frame Skateboarding trick Horse tack Heinkel He 100 Breastfeeding Windsurfing B-47 Stratojet Battle of Kursk Cat View camera Obedience training Dodge Charger Operation Market Garden Piledriver (professional wrestling) Sex assignment Milton H.
