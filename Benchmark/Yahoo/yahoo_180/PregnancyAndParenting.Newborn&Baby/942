my month old son won't take a bottle he has been breastfed and now it's time to go to daycare i have tried different types of nipples bottles and even a sippy cup messy but somewhat effective we aren't changing the food just the delivery method anybody have a suggestion we battled with this one and found a few things helped first when introducing the bottle don't do it when he is really hungry either try between regular feedings or after nursing for a few minutes second let someone else give him the bottle you should not be the one introducing the bottle because he equates you to the breast have another family member try it third keep trying eventually he will get the hang of it and he will easily switch between breast and bottle when you put the nipple in his mouth squeeze a bit of the milk out so that he can taste it also tell whomever is feeding him to try to replicate the closeness he gets when he is breastfeeding hold him close and secure good luck Breastfeeding Milk Baby bottle Breast Fertility awareness Nipple Brassiere Infant Infant formula Prolactin Nipple piercing Breast milk Mastitis Breast cancer Childbirth Tasmanian Devil Nestl__ boycott Jaundice Bong Vitamin D Bottle International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes Nestl__ Internal ballistics Cat Stomach cancer Breast pump Salad Fingers Platypus Ron and Fez The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Mammary gland Shark PHP Tofu Urinary incontinence Ron Weasley Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Siphon Plastic Champagne (beverage) Tooth Breast bondage Dairy Tea Snake Little Britain HIV Vitasoy Piccolo Junior Saga Phil Hendrie Prolactinoma Social rule Fecal incontinence Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) The Coca-Cola Company Yoko Ono Molotov cocktail New Coke Seabird Cider Kosher foods Domestic rabbit Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Nudity Soft drink B-47 Stratojet Abstraction (computer science) Hypoglycemia Coca-Cola Guinea pig The Lovely Bones Bottlenose Dolphin Wine Erogenous zone Second Battle of the Atlantic Elephant Running Great Teacher Onizuka Guinness Professional wrestling match types Fountain pen Bladderwort Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Insulin American Psycho Mattress Intravenous therapy Wraith (Stargate) Trailer Park Boys Trademark Inheritance (computer science) Hong Kong-style milk tea Obstetrics Big Brother (USA TV series) Water Milkshake Oxytocin Puberty Military history of France
