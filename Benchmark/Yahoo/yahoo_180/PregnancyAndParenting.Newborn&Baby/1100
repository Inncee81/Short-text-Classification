what are your thoughts on young mothers how young is too young iyo i ask because i'm and have a month old i've been extremely lucky in being able to stay home and my landlord has been extremely good to us my husband works for her husband my husband is and is a good provider i still feel like people judge me because of those two things my age and my husbands age i feel so blessed and love being a mom honestly it was sooner than i tought but i felt ready and was extremely lucky that i got pregnant on our first try my son has changed my life around and i never could have imagined loving someone so much how do you feel how old were you when you had your first child and did you plan or did it just happen what are your thoughts on being a mother i must say that teh reason i'm asking is because my niece's mom told me that she was when she had her first and told me something like is way too young i regret having my kid as young as i did and went on to say that my husband is way too old etc it bothered me and it honestly hurt me to hear her say that she regrets her child she's now and already a grandma so the cycle is repeating itself i just didn't feel like typing all of he friend and hubby stuff in i love my husband and although we both have tempers and normal fights like everyone else we kiss and make up and forget anything happened we understand each other and support each other in those tough times im years old and i am about to be a st time mommy in about weeks my husband is and as i read your question it doesnt really matter what others think people are always going to talk talk regardless of the situation wheter its good or bad so dont worry if you are happy with your husband and both of you love each other keep it that way dont let others put you down dont listen to what others have to say about you my husband and i planned this baby we were so eager to become parents and shes almost here my thoughts as a young mommy is that as long as you are married and have a husband that is providing all the needs for mom and baby then everything is fine its when the girl is between years old and doesnt have the fathers child involved then that is pretty disturbing because that is way young be pregnant but just be happy dont listen to others EastEnders Kodocha Marilyn Monroe Atomic Kitten About a Boy Theory of conduct Humphrey Bogart Laura Schlessinger Knots Landing One Tree Hill (TV series) Infantilism Avenue Q Shaggy dog story Charmed The Fairly OddParents Social rule Yoko Ono Jon Secada Recurring South Park characters Pitaten Friends The Lovely Bones Jam (TV series) Pok__mon Live!
