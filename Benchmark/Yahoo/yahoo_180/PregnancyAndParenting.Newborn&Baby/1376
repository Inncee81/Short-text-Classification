when can i start useing the cry it out method with my baby he is driving me crazy he play and plays at bed time and it take and hour or more to get him to bed i dont play back but he thinks its fun to pull my hair and grab my face i move his hand and firmly say no and he laughs at me what can i do he is months old he just started this stuff a month ago when he got his teeth and was scared to start it earlier because he is on an apeana monitor and if his heart rate get up to high it goes off you can start it now i started my daughter on the cry it out method at about that age at first my husband thought i was being heartless but it allowed her to learn how to put herself to sleep without having to have us around which allowed us more freedom and her the ability to put herself back to sleep if she woke in the middle of the night just start by lying him down in his crib and leaving the room for a while minutes if he's in still crying after about fifteen minutes later come back and calm him by rubbing his back or even holding him once he's calm again lie him back down and try again repeat as necessary exhaustion will eventually put him to sleep a few nights of this should help him learn how to sleep without you coming in he may still cry himself to sleep but he will learn to put himself to sleep honestly you aren't hurting the child by letting him cry for a little while you are actually giving him a gift by teaching him to calm himself i've learned that this tends to also make kids more independent my own daughter gets upset when people try to hold her when she sleeps as she sleeps better when she puts herself to sleep i've actually fussed over her all night because i was worried about her crying just to learn that she just wanted to able to cry before she fell asleep after i let her cry and left her alone she fell asleep within minutes she's also the type of person that kisses her own little boo boos saving the big ones for me since you have mentioned though that your son has struggled with sleep apnea i would stay by the door while practicing this technique so that you can be there if any problems do arise good luck Shaggy dog story The Amber Spyglass The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Urinary incontinence Insomnia The Contender (television series) Knots Landing Social rule Sin City Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Aerial (dance move) Humphrey Bogart Lucid dreaming Kodocha Avenue Q Futurama (TV series - season 5) One Tree Hill (TV series) The Inside Vegeta The Ashlee Simpson Show Breastfeeding Out-of-body experience Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Subtle Knife Characters in the Smurfs Tenshinhan Jam (TV series) Drowning Suicide methods Sleep Friends Great Teacher Onizuka The Time Machine One Life to Live Professional wrestling match types Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare W.I.T.C.H.
