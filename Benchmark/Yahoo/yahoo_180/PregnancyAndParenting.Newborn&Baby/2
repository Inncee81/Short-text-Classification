did hyland's teething tablets make your baby more sleepy my month old has been a catnapper since weeks of age min's naps with a very rare hours so he's teething and has one just starting to poke though and i've been giving him the tablets and last two naps have been hrs long is this normal my son slept really well after i gave him the tablets when he was young but the closer he got to months it didn't seem to affect him at months he had most of his teeth so i haven't used them after that when i read the bottle it said the baby may sleep more because he finally feels better and his sleep isn't disturbed by discomfort the tablets do have chamomile in them wish is suppose to help you relax and some people use it to help them sleep so in my opinion yes it does seem to be normal hope this helps and good luck i know teething can be so tough on you both Narcolepsy Sleep Breastfeeding Siesta Urinary incontinence Delayed sleep phase syndrome Humphrey Bogart Social rule Polyphasic sleep Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Paget's disease of bone Childbirth Deftones Negima Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Knife Sleep apnea Phoebe Halliwell Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Cat Tooth EastEnders LSD Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Saturday Night Live Dog training Hour Ben Johnson (athlete) Kodocha Characters in the Smurfs Knots Landing Ra (board game) Milton H.
