am i right about this or completely wrong everyone says to put saline drops in an infants nose when it has a cold well i have a week old and refuse to do it for one reason if you puts drops up there nose wont it hurt like if you got water up your nose it would hurt i just want to no that and if i am wrong i will put saline drops in her nose to help her i am suctioning her nose as often as i can oooh lets see if you had saline spray i'd say go on ahead it wont hurt being how clogged up she may be it might not hurt with drops either do you have a vaporizer you could try some vick vapor for the vaporizer or even a vaporizer by itself keep suctioning we've all been there with the never ending mucus btw when my youngest was month old i took him in for a raspiness in his chest and they put alot of saline solution in his nose which he didnt like but they used it to loosen the mucus to suction it out and test for rsv he came positive and had to be hospitalized be careful because hrs before that er visit i was at the walkin with him and they said he had a cold anything with raspy breathing make them test for rsv its more common than i thought Nasal congestion Asthma Diving Water Pneumonia Breastfeeding Body piercing Water (molecule) Liquid breathing Abortion Mucus Common cold Dialysis Fire fighting Nasal irrigation Fertility awareness Bronchiolitis Suction Pulmonary alveolus Carbon dioxide Water vapor Bong Professional wrestling throws Aerial (dance move) Jala neti Cephalic disorder Diabetic retinopathy Mechanical ventilation Acne Electrophysiology Siphon Sonar Stuttering Sarin Drowning Childbirth Dredge First aid kit Theory of conduct Skateboarding trick Aral Sea Nose Hay fever Mercury (element) Thermal power station Ocean thermal energy conversion Obstetrics Medicine Glossary of firefighting equipment Space disaster Social rule Vacuum cleaner Medical prescription Contact lens Yarrow Professional wrestling holds Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator Anchor Breaststroke Toilet humour Cavitation Coffee B-47 Stratojet Stomach cancer Glen Jacobs History of Test cricket (to 1883) Sauna Wound Carburetor Anesthesia Brewery Salt Ice cream Poker jargon Menstrual cup Air conditioning Borehole Salinity Futurama (TV series - season 4) Nosebleed History of nuclear weapons Discus (fish) Hydrogen chloride Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers 1957 World Series Diseases of the honeybee Water purification Anti-frogman techniques Anatoly Karpov Salton Sea Traumatic brain injury The Marshall Mathers LP First aid Diver rescue P-38 Lightning Tenshinhan Pitaten Anticyclone
