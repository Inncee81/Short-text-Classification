what are some fun educational games to play with my month old son i'm a first time parent and i'm having trouble coming up with new games to play with my son he likes peek a boo and playing with toys but sometimes i'm dumbfounded in coming up with new ways to engage him any help would be greatly appreciated thanks all of you gave great ideas thanks books are the best you can read to him every day for several minutes even two or three times a day there are lots of great books and many of them come in board book form now so you don't have to worry about ripping the pages or chewing on them let him hold the book if he wants to or you can read one book and let him hold another one make it fun and pleasant there are so many books to suggest but jsut go to your local bookstore and get about a dozen he will very shortly end up with a favortie one or two and want you to read that one over and over and over that's how kids learn from repetition you could also get him some stacking nesting blocks that's a good toy for his age or a bucket with holes of shapes in the top that he has to put the shapes through how about some music i like raffi it's kid music that i can listen to over and over without going completely out of my mind puppets can be fun there's no question though that books are the best and really important About a Boy Social rule Expanded Universe (Star Wars) I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue 1957 World Series Chess terminology Mao (game) Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) The Fairly OddParents Avenue Q SpongeBob SquarePants The Ashlee Simpson Show Trigun Scooby-Doo Kodocha John Cage Sesame Street Naruto jutsu Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Marching band Humphrey Bogart Erik Satie Jeopardy!
