breastfeeding question i'm weeks along and i am debating on breastfeeding i really want to because its so much healthier for the baby but my husband has his own concerns he's worried that my boobs are going to change and that they won't ever look the same again he also fears that because of that he won't be attracted to me i was just wondering if anyone has had this problem before how you handled it and do your boobs look normal after you stop breastfeeding absolutely breastfeed your baby your husband should be a little more concerned about your child's health and your health than about appearance seriously what is more important here my husband totally encouraged me and thought i was sexier because he saw me as an intelligent woman being the best mother to his child that i could be he also enjoyed my larger breasts while i was nursing i think anytime you go through pregnancy you're never going to be exactly the same as you were before you have a baby anyway ridiculous and unrealistic thinking i have nursed babies and i am only slightly half a cup size smaller than i was before i was a mom i am happy with my body i weigh lbs and i was when i was married i'm my oldest is and my youngest is i look great he tells me so all the time hot as he calls me your husband is expressing fears and they are not rational of course you're not going to look the same but the pregnancy weight will come off a whole lot faster if you nurse than if you don't i gained lbs with each of my kids and it all came right off within mos every single time breastfeeding is so good for your baby too breastfeed exclusively for no less than mos babies don't need anything else for the first mos this is recommended by the american academy of pediatrics babies get nutrients and immunity from breastmilk that cannot be duplicated in any formula their iq will be higher they are less prone to ear infections and other illnesses too what is better looking normal or attractive or do you prefer running your baby up to the er at am because he she is screaming with an ear infection every other month come on my kids were hardly ever sick when they were infants i breastfed each of them for at least mos then there is the added protection for you did you know that if a mom in her twenties breastfeeds her st baby for mos to mos her chance of ever getting breast cancer is significantly lowered maybe by as much as it's what god meant your body to do it's a no brainer plus lets not forget how much it helps with your bonding with the new baby there were times in the middle of the night that sure i didn't feel like nursing but hey it was a whole lot easier than making a bottle at am diapers won't smell as bad as a formula fed baby's either i can't think of any negatives with breast feeding just educate yourself and get help if you need it when you're starting cracked nipples are preventable it's all about how the baby latches on that was the only problem i ever had and it was with i was thinking i'm a pro at this and i wasn't paying attention well it took weeks to heal up but we got through it your breasts aren't going to look the same either way but it's not as if nursing is going to deflate you you might end up a little smaller but you're not damaged if anything you'll be healthier and isn't that what is most important here remind your husband he didn't marry a barbie doll you're a real woman and if he's a real man he will encourage you to do the best thing for both you and his child because he loves you watch and see most dads i know think breastfeeding is awesome if not sexy have your doctor tell your husband his her opinion too if that helps best wishes Breast Infant Childbirth Milk Infant formula EastEnders Nipple piercing Humphrey Bogart Infantilism Brassiere Prostate cancer Tocopherol Urinary incontinence Cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Yoko Ono Social rule Premature birth Cytomegalovirus HIV Marilyn Monroe Shaggy dog story Medical analysis of circumcision Abortion debate Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Knots Landing Charmed Medicine Domestic rabbit Dog Futurama (TV series - season 5) Abortion Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Recurring South Park characters Kodocha Coeliac disease Simone Weil Theory of conduct Prolactinoma The Contender (television series) Baby Blues Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Stomach cancer A Course In Miracles Obesity Breast cancer AFI 100 Years series Joke Sexual attraction Stewie Griffin Anorexia nervosa Inflation Sharon Tate Negima Characters of The Sandman Reparative therapy Hillary Rodham Clinton Milton H.
