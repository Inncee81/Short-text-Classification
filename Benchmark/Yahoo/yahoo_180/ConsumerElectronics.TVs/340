can i subscribe to digital cable from the states i am in the military but have always been fortunate enough to get stationed places where there is broadband however i've not been so lucky in finding places where i can find high quality english language programming now that digital cable is out is there a service where i can just connect my cablebox to the internet and get stateside programming anywhere in the world it's not likely that you'll be able to subscribe to a stateside cable service over the internet even though their service is digital it is not an internet service however almost all of the networks these days are making their popular shows available for viewing over the internet so if there's a show you like you can just go to the website and you'll likely be able to view the latest episode online by the way the previous answer regarding a slingbox may work but it will be horrendously slow the slinbox is intended to be used within a home network where the speed between nodes is mbps or so the speed at which you'll be able to access that box over the owner's broadband connection will be more like mbps or less so it would take hours to download your shows stick with the network websites Cable television Broadband Internet access Digital Subscriber Line Voice over IP Internet service provider Internet Digital television Broadband Now Broadband TV NTL Power line communication BBC Telewest Broadband TiVo Communications satellite Telephone Ethernet MTV2 Modem Canadian Broadcasting Corporation America Online GSM services Dial-up access StarHub Xbox Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting IP Multimedia Subsystem Public Switched Telephone Network Integrated Services Digital Network Television in the United States Satellite television Media in Ireland Skype MSN TV BBC Television Austar Vertical service code Cable modem British Sky Broadcasting Gnutella Global System for Mobile Communications Computer and video games Broadband Networks Dish Network Telstra Sky Digital Home Box Office Television in Canada Media in Canada Wireless LAN Ulster Television File sharing Nintendo DS Computer Five (TV) Asynchronous Transfer Mode ITV Pirate decryption Online service provider Podcasting Bluetooth Microsoft Freenet Television syndication Satellite internet DOCSIS Television network Eircom Dorama Commercial broadcasting Public Broadcasting Service PlayStation 2 Universal Mobile Telecommunications System TransACT IPod AT&T Telegraphy Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act National Weather Service Channel 4 Telkom MDAC Digital divide Virtual private network Web crawler Foxtel NEC Corporation FidoNet Xbox 360
