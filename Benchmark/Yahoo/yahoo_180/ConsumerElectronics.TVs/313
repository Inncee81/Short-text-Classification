how do i fix the convergence on my tv it is a ge model gw i posted a question earlier in regards to finding a remote control for my tv to see if i could fix the problem i did buy the remote control that was suggested by the ones that answered my question i bought the rca d i went under menu but could not find the option to fix this problem the picture is all over the place i appreciate all of your help thank you very much sorry about the misguidance the picture is notall over the place it is not centered thanks man we might need a chassis number from the back label ctc ptk ptk or or something like that if it's all over the place like you say it sounds more like you have a problem with the output transistors in the convergence circuit unfortunately that's not a consumer based repair as it requires the ability to use an oscilloscope and a digital multimeter to identify shorted transistors open resistors and bad signals driving those transistors ge rca does not use convergence amps if they did it might make it somewhat consumer friendly enough to do it yourself but even then most consumers overheat the copper foils and lift them off the board or solder bridge two pins and blow up the amp also if you find a board located up front with a bunch of pots knobs on them you might want to turn off the tv and disconnect reconnect each plug on the front board about times each i have seen those pins get corroded enough to really screw up the alignment but that's on a ctc chassis only and not all 's have the front board with all the cable plugs either that's why techs are still out there making a living at it Operational amplifier Electronic amplifier Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Atari 8-bit family BS 1363 Circuit design Embedded system Jack plug IPod Transistor Capacitor plague Universal Serial Bus Nintendo Entertainment System Electronics Resistor Computer Modem Xbox SCART Surface-mount technology Electric motor Printed circuit board Commodore 64 MOSFET Television PCB layout guidelines Xbox 360 Liquid crystal display Kenwood Electronics Sound Blaster Central processing unit Fuse (electrical) Gramophone record IBM 1620 Integrated circuit PlayStation 2 Digital circuit Laserdisc Enigma machine Logic gate Soldering CMOS Digital photography Sinclair ZX81 Cray-1 Remote control Semiconductor device Windows XP Radiation hardening Analog-to-digital converter Modchip Carburetor CPU design D-subminiature Electric guitar Ethernet Transformer Synthesizer Rail terminology Marshall Amplification Bass guitar DMX (lighting) Digital Subscriber Line Copy protection IP Multimedia Subsystem Current source Teletext Fluorescent lamp Linear regulator Volt Musical Instrument Digital Interface Field effect transistor Western concert flute Action potential Computer bus Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Canon T90 Electrophysiology Photography ITU-T Digital video recorder X10 (industry standard) PlayStation 3 Effects unit M4 Sherman Aluminium Dimmer Super Nintendo Entertainment System Potentiometer Walkman Password
