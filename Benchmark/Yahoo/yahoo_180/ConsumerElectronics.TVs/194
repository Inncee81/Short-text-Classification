how do you record a tv show from a hd box with a vcr without watching the same show that is being recordest i have a hd tv box can record a tv show but can not watch another show on the tv while the vcr is recording can i buy something or hooked the tv hd and vcr box up different that would fix this problem depends to do what you want you need two tuners one to record and one to watch if your tv has a tuner and it can decode your input signal then you can use the tv's tuner to watch one channel and the vcr to record a different one this scenario assumes the output of the box is in rf and you split it to both the tv and the vcr if the output of the hd box is hdmi or component then there is not much you can do except getting a box with dual tuners SCART Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting DVD Television Videocassette recorder Composite monitor Set-top box Cable television Digital video recorder TiVo Composite video Home cinema Phase-shift keying High-definition television Camcorder Loudspeaker Frequency modulation Receiver (radio) Analog-to-digital converter S-Video RCA connector S__CAM Laserdisc TV tuner card Frequency synthesiser S-VHS Operational amplifier High-Definition Multimedia Interface Electric guitar Field-programmable gate array Central processing unit DVD recorder TurboGrafx 16 DV Copy protection Oscilloscope Sound Blaster 8 mm video format Impedance matching Digital television VHS Teletext Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Digital Visual Interface Compact disc Speech recognition Original Amiga chipset Software testing Analog hole Electronic amplifier Radio clock Atari 8-bit family Betacam Nielsen Ratings System/34 Microphone Electrophysiology Phase-locked loop Freeview Vacuum tube Broadcast flag Betamax VFO Federal Communications Commission Macrovision Race hazard Mathematical model Complexity classes P and NP DVD player MP3 Multiplexer Karaoke PID controller Videotape Collision detection Coding theory High-Bandwidth Digital Content Protection Computer Amiga Cell (microprocessor) Mixing console Dolby Laboratories ABS-CBN Home Box Office Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Surplus value Pirate decryption Production function Production theory basics Telephone exchange Antenna (radio) Atari 2600 Finite state machine PC Engine Stream processing Monty Hall problem Poker jargon Hardware random number generator Amplitude modulation
