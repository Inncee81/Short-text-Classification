coax to rca adaptor i am considering buying a cheap tv but the coaxial input is broken i want to have it capable of watching cable on it is there a way to convert the cable line to go through the rca ports on the tv so that we can watch cable unfortunately not you would need a vcr or some device that can act as the tuner basically with the coax connection broken you also lose the tuner on the tv if you have a cable box then you can use rca jacks two for audio one for composite video to hook it into your tv alternatively you can try to get the coax replaced or repaired you can do it yourself if you are handy good luck SCART Television RCA connector Cable television Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Ethernet Composite video Coaxial cable Atari ST IPod S-Video Nintendo Entertainment System Videocassette recorder Digital video recorder Universal Serial Bus Set-top box High fidelity Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis NTSC Composite monitor DVD S/PDIF Home cinema Jack plug TiVo High-definition television RCA PlayStation Portable Oscilloscope S__CAM Laserdisc Nintendo DS Amstrad CPC Xbox 360 Amiga Federal Communications Commission Musical Instrument Digital Interface Camcorder VHS Electric guitar Archos XLR connector S-VHS Synthesizer Commodore 64 Game Boy Advance Bluetooth Transformer Walkman Sound card Apple IIGS Karaoke Loudspeaker Light-emitting diode PC Engine TV tuner card Vacuum tube ABS-CBN TV game PAL HomePNA AT&T Impedance matching NBC D-subminiature Digital television Domestic AC power plugs and sockets SelectaVision PlayStation 2 Atari 8-bit family Cruising (maritime) Input impedance Teletext ITunes Harp Sega Dreamcast RS-232 Decibel Sound Blaster Telephone exchange Analog-to-digital converter Broadband Internet access FireWire Cable modem Satellite television MythTV Receiver (radio) American Broadcasting Company Atari 2600 Betacam Computer hardware Operational amplifier Vision mixer Handheld game console Dynamic random access memory Macrovision Compact disc
