does a sky box have to be connected to a phone line to work i know the normal sky box is meant to be but it does work without being connected so does the sky box work as it's meant to while it's not connected yes your box will work fine without being connected to a line the only reason they like it to be connected to a phone line is so they can occasionally update the software on the box if you dont have it connected for the st twelve months though they get funny about it they will send you a letter threatening you with charging extra as it is part of your contract unfortunately you will have to have it connected for the st months but after that take it out every feature of sky will still work Voice over IP GSM services Telephone booth PlayStation Portable TiVo Modem Sky Digital Private branch exchange Morse Code Beatmania IIDX Bluetooth Mac OS X General Packet Radio Service Virgin Mobile BlackBerry Surveillance Verizon Wireless Home Box Office Short message service Broadband Internet access MSN Messenger Digital video recorder Skype London Congestion Charge Horus IPod Telephone exchange Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Poker jargon Abandonware United States Postal Service Phreaking Karaoke Football (soccer) IMac Microsoft Windows SCART Eircom Einstein-Cartan theory Jennifer Lopez Teletext The Twelve Labours Musical Instrument Digital Interface Hindu calendar Blue box Global System for Mobile Communications Xbox Social rule Postcode Telephone number Set-top box 9-1-1 FidoNet Integrated Services Digital Network Secure Shell Q-Telecom Database management system Contract bridge SETI@home Telephone tapping Stan Laurel Dual-tone multi-frequency 2001 anthrax attacks IPAQ National Weather Service Caller ID Phoneme Gmail Winning Streak Internet Relay Chat 24 (television) Diacritic Mars Exploration Rover Oscilloscope Lorentz group Power Rangers: SPD Atari ST Videotex Sky Sports Mathematics of general relativity Phone fraud Wheel of Fortune Internet E-mail spam Communications protocol Austar 21 July 2005 London bombings Peter Sutcliffe Air India Flight 182 Automatic teller machine File system Telephone numbering plan Mobile phone System 7 (Macintosh) Software testing Cognitive science AmigaOS Kraftwerk
