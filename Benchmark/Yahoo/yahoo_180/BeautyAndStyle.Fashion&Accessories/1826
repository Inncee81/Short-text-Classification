does anyone agree that kids are spoild these days i just read a whole bunch of questions concerning what to wear for the first day of school from like middle school and high school kids it looks like they all are wearing juicy couture and stuff from saks those days i remember when i was i shopped at kohls and didn't even know what juicy couture was even though now i have many designer pieces i don't think they determine who i am i'm a college student and i don't give a damn about what i should wear during my first day of school haha i probably will pick something i can run up and down our hill easily that's because their parents let them have their way and get what they want kids these days have too many options and not enough discipline they don't appreciate the little things like just have clean clothes on their backs they have to have a certain name brand kids are spoiled because the parents are too stupid to say no and the ones who worry most about the name brand are the ones who work pay check to pay check they'd rather look like they have money then actually have it knowing they spent their last few dollars on an outfit rather than wear a cute outfit that looks just as good as if it were from a high end fashion designer lmao i never understood why people who work pay check to pay check would worry about buying some fashion designers clothes with these high ass prices they're rich you're broke dumb ass JavaServer Pages HyperText Transfer Protocol Java Servlet Web server Ajax (programming) World Wide Web Jakarta Tomcat Website Application server AOL Instant Messenger Uniform Resource Locator HTML Web browser Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition PHP HTTP cookie Electronic commerce SAML Wget Web crawler Character encodings in HTML Digest access authentication Lotus Notes B3ta Phishing Economy of Colombia Plastic bag Shotgun Aldi Web design TOC protocol Uniform Resource Identifier Slashdot subculture Ice core Tesco Port numbers Wiki Wireless Application Protocol Tobacco Java programming language Netscape Communications Corporation Cross site scripting Web page Gopher protocol Web cache Plastic Treehouse of Horror III Unicode and HTML Squid cache Jabber Common Unix Printing System HTML element Server-side scripting Quotation mark Spam (electronic) Physical attractiveness Bicycle lighting WebObjects The Inside Domain Name System Unicode Mozilla Application Suite Dairy Web application Hello Kitty Coffee Client-server File format Spyware Retailer Teen Girl Squad Illegal drug trade Mozilla Firefox Stopping e-mail abuse Virtual hosting Slash (punctuation) Wal-Mart Glossary of wildland fire terms Packages in Java Hydrogen economy Polyvinyl chloride The Book of Mozilla Representational State Transfer XML Tokusatsu Transmission Control Protocol Denial-of-service attack Warez Kuzari Atomic Kitten A Tale of Two Cities CPU cache Apache License ALGOL 68 Professional wrestling slang Bulk vending Hashish Ecclesiastical Latin
