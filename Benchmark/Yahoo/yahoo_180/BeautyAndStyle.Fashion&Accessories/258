why is it that some men will spend fortunes on fancy outer clothes yet will wear tatty underwear every time i go to visit my unmarried sons i have to take a pack of briefs because i just know that they will not have bought any new ones since the last time i visited i know that younger men and teenagers are better these days my boys are in their late twenties but surely they should at least make an effort i always buy underwear for myself as the first option and then work outwards men seem to wear just about anything underneath and then just have one special pair still worn out and faded for certain occaisions normally a football match as they are lucky what is all that about their personal hygeine is fine shoppingspree i did instil that into them from a young age but it's not just them it's many men i bought all of their clothes when they were little boys including underwear now they like many men will buy all sorts of fancy clothes yet their underwear is old and worn and tatty even with holes yet clean i taught them that too and just you try suggesting throwing it out it's like dealing with a three year old again well dan maybe that's the difference i just wouldn't feel right if i had tatty underwear on no matter that nobody can see it and no matter what i was wearing above maybe men really are all about show and not substance it's a comfort thingy like a dummy or blanket and also comfort in general Social aspects of clothing Kimberly-Clark Corporation Briefs Kilt Corset Strap-on dildo G-string Boxer shorts Comanche Trousers Clothing Kimono Social rule Cross-dressing Doug Diaper Avenue Q Professional wrestling match types Swimsuit Hygiene Jackass: The Movie Caving Skirt and dress Temple garment (Mormonism) Penguin (comics) Speedo (suit style) SpongeBob SquarePants President (game) Fecal incontinence Beachwear Cowboy Infantilism Aikido T-shirt The Perishers Little Britain Animal Crossing Wonder Woman (television series) Buttocks Gay slang Brassiere Poker jargon French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Ranma __ characters Shoe Leggings SpongeBob SquarePants (character) Jockstrap Theory of conduct Fancy Crane Japanese toilet Tire Jean Charles de Menezes The Devil Wears Prada Religion Boy Scouts of America Menstrual cycle Brewery Upholstery About a Boy Menstrual cup Frederic Thesiger, 1st Baron Chelmsford Eid ul-Fitr Gay bathhouse Rain Man Urusei Yatsura Potato Guiding Light Breeches Glamour photography Manchester City F.C.
