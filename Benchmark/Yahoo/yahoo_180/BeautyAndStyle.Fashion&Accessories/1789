what should i wear how should i act ok so tomorrow i'm going out to dinner with my boyfriend then i'm going to his house and i'll be meeting his mom for the first time so i was wonder what i should wear also how i should do my makeup heavy or light also how should i act around his mom i'm really outgoing so it's not that i'm gonna be super quiet i just suck at small talk lol thanks so much xoxox wondering i would wear a nice but comfortable dress something to the knee or above but not really short and dont do really heavy makeup i guess if youre meeting the folks for the first time you should try to look your best and make a good impression and remember to be yourself and his mom is probably just as nervous as you i would not try to do all the talking and be a good listener but dont be a bore and not talk at all i know u are a outgoing fun person and that is good but you dont know his mom and maybe u should be a little reserved at first until she warms up to your good nature Coco Chanel Yarralumla, Australian Capital Territory Marilyn Monroe IBM PC compatible Bulk vending Shit Louis Vuitton GBA Movie Player Spiritism Moe Szyslak Autograph Jennifer Lopez Gucci YuYu Hakusho Homestar Runner Wiki Huns Professional wrestling Masashi Tashiro Little Britain Negativland Kate Moss Fashion Social rule In The Groove (game) Karl Lagerfeld The nature of God in Western theology David Beckham The Naked Gun 2 1/2: The Smell of Fear Freak Strike Sanford and Son Poker jargon Lacoste (company) Jayson Blair George Carlin Big Trouble Ninth Doctor 2000 Australian Grand Prix The Daleks' Master Plan Philosophy of business Peter Chanel Good Times Kyle Broflovski Miss Saigon Futurama (TV series - season 5) Tyra Banks Seine (fishing) Chao (Sonic the Hedgehog) Bloody Stupid Johnson Stupidity I Want to Hold Your Hand Alexander Technique The Net (film) Humphrey Bogart Supply and demand Engine knocking Coin collecting The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time weapons and items The Hobbit The Rumble in the Jungle Iditarod Theory of conduct ROC presidential election, 2004 Aphex Twin Gothic metal Chanel Cole Counterfeit Singlish NHL series Internet fraud Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Stupid Girl Gay Super Bowl XXV American football strategy Eminem Barriss Offee M82 (rifle) Scenes from the Class Struggle in Springfield Fashion design Dreadlocks I've Got a Secret Futurama (TV series - season 3) Anglo-Saxons People's Liberation Army Air Force Multiverse The Monkees Wedding Crashers Health insurance Crash Nitro Kart (PS2) M9 Bayonet Five (TV) Montgomery Burns RuneScape quests Survivor (novel) Adoption Tarascan Brand Formula One regulations Mindy McCready Archaeoraptor
