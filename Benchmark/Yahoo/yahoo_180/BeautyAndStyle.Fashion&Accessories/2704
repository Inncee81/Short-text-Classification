what should i wear for my job interview tomorrow i'm years old and i have a job interview tomorrow for best buy this will be my second job but i'm not sure how to dress up this time can anyone help thanks be as well groomed and as professional in appearance as your wardrobe allows this will always be true regardless of the job you are applying for unless you someday decide to apply for a job at a strip club make sure you are not wearing jewelry or displaying tattoos until you learn your prospective employers policy on these accessories your prospective employer will be paying attention to whether or not you care about your appearance so that they can infer whether or not you will care about representing them to their customer in a manner consistent with their image lol if you wear something revealing and tight and your interviewer is a woman what good will that do you maybe you will even be perceived as competition and therefor bypassed never make these sort of gender assumptions be yourself but strive to make the best presentation possible without going to any sort of extreme if you can only get a job somewhere by wearing something tight and revealing why would you want to work for that company Married... with Children Paul Is Dead Good Charlotte Laura Schlessinger Shit Shaggy dog story Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban MSN Messenger Little Big Mom Back to the Future Highway 61 Revisited Social rule Mr. and Mrs. Turner Kyle Broflovski I Am Furious Yellow Garfield Phoebe Buffay's songs Princess Charlotte Augusta of Wales Eric Cartman Galaxy Quest Van Houten family Hollyoaks Series finale Stupidity Cindy Sheehan Opie and Anthony Jane Eyre Dad's Army Jean-Paul Marat New Morning The Catcher in the Rye Kodocha The Shining (film) Singlish Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala(Annoyed Grunt)cious The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Jim Bakker Grandview, U.S.A.
