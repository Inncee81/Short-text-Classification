should i get a snake bite piercing i've been thinking about getting snakebite piercings for the past weeks i really want them but ive been told that they leave really bad scarrs and that they will probably get infected should i get them if you really really want one then get it but know the risks which apparently you already do don't do something you'll regret later like hurting your body infections like that really hurt and you will probably end up removing the piercing however if you take care of the piercing and put alcohol swabs on it everyday after you get it you should be fine also get information about the place you're going to get it at to find out if they can be trusted good luck French Connection (clothing) Fashion design Nike, Inc.
