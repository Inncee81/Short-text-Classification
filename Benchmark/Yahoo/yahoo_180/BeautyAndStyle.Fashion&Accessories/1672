i'm very skinny and don't know much about bermuda shorts will they look good on me im ft tall and am skinny and tall so i guess u could say im very long lol well i relle want bermuda shorts but i dont no ne thing about them first off where should they end on my knee like the top of my knee cap the bottom or the middle second i dont know if i should even wear them cuz i have very knobby knees will that affect it plz tell me if i should or not thnx usually they end just above the knee this is going to essentially draw everyones attention to the stopping point your knee if that is a body part you don't want to accentuate you should stay away from these it'd be like a person who does not want people to look at her cleavage wearing a really low cut blouse instead you might look into capris that end an inch or so below the knee or shorter short that end mid thigh as far as if you should wear the shorts if you're cool with your knees then do whatever you please Abercrombie & Fitch Co.
