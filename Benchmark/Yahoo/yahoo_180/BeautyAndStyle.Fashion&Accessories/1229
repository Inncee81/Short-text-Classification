furr dilemma i've always been against fur but i recently saw a rabbit jacket and rabbit boots that i fell in love with what should i do i'm thinking if the clothes are already made i should by them but if they r gonna go out and kill a rabbit just cuz i ordered them then i don't wanna b responsible that what should i do i want the clothes but no the guilt step away and face the truth do not buy them do not even look at them again or you will be tempted don't let the consumer market possess you just think if you think that if you buy it it won't make a difference but what if a people bought them that's rabbits probably more than killed i look upon fur clothing with great disdain my grandma had a fur coat and a weasel scarf yes with the head still attached and when she put the coat around me i nearly screamed i do not even seem to comprehend how people can stand wearing another mammal's hide it creeps me out and it is utterly disgusting my advice do not buy them you said you were against them right if your still tempted after reading this minor answer you can try to find clothing like around on ebay or online that uses fake fur instead Fur Phoebe Buffay's songs Clothing Rabbit Stoat Jon Secada Taboo food and drink Shaggy dog story Hides Jennifer Lopez Mammal The Amber Spyglass Conker's Bad Fur Day Academic dress of Oxford University The Apprentice 2 Dog Domestic rabbit Weasel Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Who Framed Roger Rabbit Hamlet Miss Saigon Sesshomaru Happy Tree Friends Rod Stewart Court dress Sinfest Fox hunting I Don't Wanna Cry Kevin and Kell Scenes from a Memory The Lovely Bones Trapping RuneScape quests The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Winter Calvin and Hobbes Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time weapons and items Places in the Wheel of Time series Hijab Avenue Q Strap-on dildo Black tie Livestock Futurama (TV series - season 5) Ferret Jean Charles de Menezes Yusuf al-Qaradawi EastEnders Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Lee Harvey Oswald Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism The Hobbit Guinea pig Internet fraud Sin City Heavy metal fashion People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Skinhead Joseph (Hebrew Bible) Fashion Royal Assent Gray Wolf The Curse of Fenric Leather The Marshall Mathers LP Richard Chase Characters in the Smurfs Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Phishing Monopoly (game) Mink Moses Kain (Legacy of Kain) The Dalek Invasion of Earth Cat Macbeth Theory of conduct Comanche Mid-Autumn Festival Notable lines in the Star Wars series Humphrey Bogart Day trading Hunting A Course In Miracles Textile manufacturing terminology Electronic commerce Externality Grunge music Head Professional wrestling attacks Ernst Stavro Blofeld Plastic Self Portrait Chao (Sonic the Hedgehog) Arimaa Monty Python and the Holy Grail
