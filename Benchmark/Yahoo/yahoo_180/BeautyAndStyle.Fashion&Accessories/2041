new underwear i'm in need of new underwear but my girlfriend says shes tired of me wearing boxers i tried wearing boxer briefs but she didnt like those on me that much either so i wore a pair of briefs one day and she said that would have to do until i got new underwear so i don't really know what other kinds of styles of underwear they have i need help ladies what do you suggest so that i don't have to resort to putting a sock over it i absolutely cannot believe that your girlfriend is being critical of your underwear good grief how petty can you get this isn't a fashion statement it's to keep your outer clothing clean ok sorry probably tmi if she wants you to wear a particular type of underwear she can buy it for you frankly i'm thinking that unless she's a really shallow person she is nitpicking something irrelevant when she really has something else that it irritating her maybe she's really just tired of the relationship being so focused on the activity that as merely a girlfriend gives her way more knowledge about your underwear choice than a girlfriend boyfriend relationship would normally have of course if your underwear is old worn discolored or has holes though i can see why she might complain if not something else is going on here World Wide Web Shirt Social aspects of clothing Suit (clothes) Tennis shirt Lacoste (company) Bob Jones University Uniform Resource Locator Raffles Institution Beachwear Skate punk Canadian Armed Forces Electronic commerce Black tie Phishing Softball Okashina Okashi HyperText Transfer Protocol Emo fashion Teen Girl Squad Kilt Casual Undergarment SpongeBob SquarePants T-shirt Napoleon Dynamite Scrubs American Eagle Outfitters Jesuit College Preparatory School Swimming pool White-collar worker Death rock fashion Casuals Skinhead Fred Perry Sheryl Crow Skirt and dress Warez Trousers Breakdancing Villarreal CF Clothing terminology Singapore Police Force Sento Coat (clothing) Necktie Punk fashion Doctor (Doctor Who) Trailer Park Boys HTTP cookie Martin Amis Heavy metal fashion Mario Goatse.cx Juventus F.C.
