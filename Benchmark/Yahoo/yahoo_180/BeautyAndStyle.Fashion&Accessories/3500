what is a good color shirt for a photo shoot my year old son is having a photo shoot done for a cd he is recording and i was told to get a nice shirt for the photo shoot any ideas on what color i should get any advice would be helpful thanks whenever i get headshots i always bring a few options usually the photographer is more than willing to let you try all of the shirts that you bring in at least a few shots plus the photographer might offer an opinion of his own blues and greens are calming while black and white are classics but if you want to go bold try orange or red Kilt Shirt Nakoruru (Samurai Shodown) Visit of King George IV to Scotland Kimono Equine conformation Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Pickup truck Bart Simpson Skinhead Black tie Suit (clothes) Reservoir Dogs Bob Jones University Mario Plaid Blues Drag racing The Beach Boys Steve Martin Singapore Police Force The Young Ones (TV series) Piet Mondrian Dragon Booster Marching band Academy Award for Original Music Score James McNeill Whistler Social aspects of clothing Yohoho!
