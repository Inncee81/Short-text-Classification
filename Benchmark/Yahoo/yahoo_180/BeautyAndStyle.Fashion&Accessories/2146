is it worth it to splurge on clothes when they go on sale a week later the stores im talking bout aka hollister abercrombie fitch etc ugh i hate the fact whenever i do buy something ful priced it always goes on sale the next day and i feel guilty i mean on some tanktop so is it worth it i mean i loove finding great deals like one time i spent like on a victorias secret shirt and i have the money to buy full priced but i feel sooo guilty ill try it on like times a day and decide it its worth the i spent ughh um allyssa i dont think so sb i avoid stuff like that ooh okay nvm what if the item you got is already on sale and it goes down lower can you get ur money back i do the same thing and i always get mad when i see the thing i bought on clearance for half the price but then i found out that if you buy something and it goes on clearance within days of when you bought it you can show them the receipt and they have to give you the money back like if you buy a shirt for and a few days later you see it there for then they have to give you back read the back of any receipt it says it in small print JavaServer Pages Ajax (programming) HyperText Transfer Protocol World Wide Web Uniform Resource Identifier Uniform Resource Locator PHP Website Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition Application server Hello world program Jakarta Tomcat XHTML Web browser Scalable Vector Graphics Cross site scripting HTML Internet Common Lisp Phishing Jabber Java Servlet Windows 2000 JavaServer Faces XML Packages in Java Representational State Transfer Electronic commerce Proxy server Web design Web application Spyware Cascading Style Sheets Gmail Transport Layer Security Federal Communications Commission Transmission Control Protocol Objective-C HTTP cookie MSN Messenger XUL Online advertising Wireless Application Protocol C plus plus Apache HTTP Server Web server XRI HyperCard Mydoom Wget User agent Geographic information system Undergarment HTML element Aggregator Organic light-emitting diode Netscape Communications Corporation Denial-of-service attack Emergence Web traffic Yu-Gi-Oh!
