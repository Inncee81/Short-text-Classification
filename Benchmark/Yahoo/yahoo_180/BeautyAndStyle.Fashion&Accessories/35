what can a guy wear besides polos and jeans i like wearing jeans and polos but what else looks good on a guy i know khaki shorts are good and some tee's but thats about all i know any long sleeve shirt looks cute especially from stores like american eagle or pacsun i think any guy looks extra cuddly in a hoodie but that might just be me xd try khaki pants maybe shirts from hollister ae pacsun that just have a name on it looks fine too make sure not to wear a lot of them though or you might be seen as one of the preppy guys if you don't already have that label The Warriors Shirt Canadian Armed Forces Okashina Okashi Clothing terminology Singapore Police Force Jeans Preppy T-shirt Jesuit College Preparatory School Bob Jones University Teen Girl Squad Heavy metal fashion Softball Skinhead Abercrombie & Fitch Co.
