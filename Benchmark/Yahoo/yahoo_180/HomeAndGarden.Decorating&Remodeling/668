will i get fined for adding a room to my house without a building permit if so how steep is the fine what's the inspection process like and will the addition of the room be automatically added to my blueprints depending on what state you live in although i imagine most have similar laws you definitely need a building permit during construction it will need to be inspected at certain points and signed off prior to being able to complete it the pros to getting the correct permits is that it will raise the value of your home because it adds to the overall square footage the cons are that permits cost money and typically your property taxes will go up as those too are based on square footage you can try building without a permit however if you go to sell your home and it's found out then you may have to remove it or face penalties and fines the government doesn't really like it when people are not paying the correct amount of property taxes and they may come after you for back taxes among other things also in order to properly insure your home you would need to have a permit for the addition or your homeowners policy may become null and void at least for the addition itself play it safe and check into whether you need a permit in the long run you will be glad you did Property tax Taxation in the United States Insurance United States Postal Service Blackjack Annuity Mortgage Life insurance Nuclear power E85 Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus FairTax Microeconomics Article One of the United States Constitution Contract with America Social Security debate (United States) Tax protester Home insurance Expert system Linked list Mutual fund C programming language Speed limit Salary cap Capitalism Treaty California government and politics The Amazing Race Copyright Gun politics Variable universal life insurance Galactic Civilizations Contract Divorce Flat tax National Football League Supply and demand Firefighter Trademark Driver's license Social Security (United States) Public policy Gold standard Screw United Kingdom corporation tax Primerica Financial Services Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Poker jargon Monopoly (game) Interstate Highway Fuzion Arguments for and against drug prohibition Real estate developer Softball XML Tax resistance Inflation Health care in the United States Wal-Mart California Proposition 13 (1978) Mobile home Illegal drug trade Economy of Russia Status of religious freedom in Malaysia Nuclear power phase-out Objective-C Child support Unemployment benefit Value added tax Windows XP Money Casting CPU cache Exception handling Stairway Copyright law of the United Kingdom Easement Surplus value Public good United States Constitution Capital gains tax Hubble Space Telescope Jet engine Keynesian economics George W.
