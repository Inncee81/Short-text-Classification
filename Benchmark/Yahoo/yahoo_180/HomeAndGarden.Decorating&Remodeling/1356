what color should i paint my house i'll be painting the exterior of my house this fall and i'm looking for suggestions a little background the house is a year old square home it's currently pale yellow with cornflower blue trim we just had new windows installed and they are white around the edges our home is the first home on the block in a diverse urban neighborhood please suggest three colors that play well together we'll need a main color trim color and another for the little details thanks in advance go to www sherwin williams com and click on homeowner and then click on launch color visualizer when that window opens you can pick exterior and choose a house that's similar to yours then you can click on different colors to see how they look if your house is the first on the block then i'm assuming you have a corner lot i wouldn't go with white because it will show dirt it's hard to say without seeing your house or knowing what you like but i like tan with green trim another thing to consider is what color your roof is you don't want to paint a color that would clash with your roof Microsoft Paint Colours, standards and guidons Minesweeper (computer game) Paint Color McMansion Blue Cascading Style Sheets Color theory Wassily Kandinsky Gamut Palace of Westminster Dodge Charger Seismic retrofit Wallpaper group Mercury Cougar Xanadu House The Brady Bunch Chess strategy and tactics Ford Thunderbird New Urbanism Light-emitting diode Baroque chess Billiards Stairway Holkham Hall Le Corbusier Unicode Pontiac Trans Sport Rail Blue Yellow Exploration of Mars Honda Prelude EIA-708 Volkswagen Golf Alhambra Game Boy The Covenant The Sims 2: University Drawing Rubik's Cube Traffic light Vinyl roof Nintendo 64 Kitchen Columbine High School massacre Milwaukee, Wisconsin Halo: Combat Evolved Red Line (MBTA) White House Piet Mondrian The Warriors Cadillac Eldorado Grace Cossington Smith Basement Dodge Aspen The Sims 2 HTTP cookie Mac OS X Chatsworth House Chromium RuneScape cheats New York Rangers Sundial Anaglyph image Chevrolet Camaro Opportunity rover Fischer Random Chess Resident Evil (video game) Go (board game) Bungalow Synaesthesia BMW Z1 Xiangqi Color blindness School bus Urban sprawl Flag of the United States Diamond simulant Mobile home Final Fantasy In-N-Out Burger Monopoly (game) Windows XP Sapphire Visual Basic .NET Tudorbethan architecture Vehicle registration plate Mouse (computing) International Phonetic Alphabet Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Human skin color Grand Central Terminal Fluorescent lamp Wrigley Field Harlem Renaissance IPod Pok__mon (video games) AmigaOS
