what is your opinion of painting kitchen cabinets in terms of the actual work of painting them as well as maintaining them do you think it's a good idea depends cost wise it is quite a bit less to paint than to get new but remember you will need at least coats of paint probably more if you don't want to worry about always banging them and that doesn't count the primer and the sanding work you would have to do and if you don't have the time then it might be best to just replace them if you decide to paint remember to prep and primer and to let the paint fully dry in between coats otherwise you won't like your results i hope this helps Plastic Social rule Kitchen Theory of conduct Primer (paint) Drill bit Paint Computer numbering formats Table tennis Gesso Explosive material Casting Art Big Bang CPU cache Epoxy Polymerase chain reaction Jacques-Louis David Jumpstart 3rd Grade 2004 Republican National Convention Wok Brett Whiteley Gordon Coates The nature of God in Western theology I Want to Hold Your Hand Heraldry Gaozu of Han Non-native pronunciations of English Carl Barks Arcade cabinet Wonderland (McFly album) Walter Sickert Epistemology New Zealand National Party Quantum mechanics The Star Wars Holiday Special Aluminium The Catcher in the Rye Chu-Han contention Sandpaper Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Campfire Fuel injection Gross domestic product Outsourcing Game theory Solar cell Public domain Hubble Space Telescope Varnish Internal ballistics Reality Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Rich Mullins Spaceward, Ho!
