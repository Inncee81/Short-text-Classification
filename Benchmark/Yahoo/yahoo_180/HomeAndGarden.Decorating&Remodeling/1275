what are good colors to make a small room look bigger and brighter i'm painting my room and im planning on having a white ceiling with one white wall facing the windows the rest of the walls will be a light apricot color i want my small room to appear bigger and brighter the two windows are small too oh and i also dont want it to look plain any suggestions i think i would paint all four walls if the room is small one wall a different color is going to make the space look choppy apricot is nice i would also suggest a pale yellow or tan glass blue or a soft shade of barely green honestly any light color is going to make the room feel bigger i would also suggest hanging soft drapes from the ceiling to the floor to create the illusion of larger windows go beyond the actual window in width so the illusion is you have larger windows but go with something soft and airy like a faux silk or gauze to give the room breath ikea has some really fun really cheap drapes that would look awesome i am sure hang artwork about midway down the walls to create the illusion of a taller ceiling in other words don't hang your pictures too high that will also make your room seem larger and avoid area rugs on the floors as this also chops up the visuals of the room good luck hope this helps fyi the colors i suggested are instead of the apricot not to coordinate with the apricot sorry if i misunderstood Lighting Sento Color theory Scrubs Autostereogram Color Light-emitting diode Bungalow Sundial Glass Alhambra Grace Cossington Smith Wine Equine conformation Carpet Doom engine Sistine Chapel Fire fighting Volleyball Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Textile manufacturing terminology Wallpaper group The Haunted Mansion Wood carving Cube (film) Primary color Wood Fluorescent lamp Wayne Corporation Blue Art Kitchen Freedom Tower Plastic The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time weapons and items Library Christmas tree Billboard (advertising) Bubble Bobble Bus models used in New York City Transit Jon Secada The Time Machine Flag of South Africa G-Man (Half-Life) Mario series enemies Japanese toilet Xanadu House Extraterrestrial skies Rococo Collectibles in Bionicle Drawing Basement Sari Prank flash Upholstery Black Koopa Kid Stereoscopy Telescope Physical attractiveness Hogwarts Floor Directory Flag of India Hamster Textile manufacturing White House Joel and Ethan Coen Irish Houses of Parliament Chatsworth House The Legend of Zelda series enemies Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance Washroom James McNeill Whistler Optical illusion Dragon Booster Traditional animation Jennifer Lopez Camouflage Jumpstart 3rd Grade Fecal incontinence Spatial disorientation King Khalid International Airport Palazzo Vecchio Holkham Hall Soane Museum John Hancock Tower National Statuary Hall In-N-Out Burger Gamut Pixel Discus (fish) Sunglasses Poker jargon Miniature (illuminated manuscript) Microsoft Paint
