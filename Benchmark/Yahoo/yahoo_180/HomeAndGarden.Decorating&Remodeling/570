holes and adhesive on plaster walls help my husband and i were installing vinyl tiles to the walls in our kitchen and they look great everywhere except over the stove for some reason they shifted there and were out of line and it's the most visible spot in the kitchen so he took the tiles down but now there is adhesive residue left over and there are chunks of wall that came off on the tiles themselves i don't have a clue how to fix this part of the wall to make it even again help please thanks the tile glue residue should come of by scraping if not you could try universal thinners to soften the glue then scrape it of you want to get as much of it off as possible if the residue is really hard you may want to try sanding it to a smooth finish once you have got the residue off or sanded down smooth then you will need to get some drywall plaster premixed and apply by joint knife try and get it as smooth as you can if the chunks that fell out were fairly deep you will have to apply two or more coats to these areas to build it up flush once you have done this and its all dry then sand smooth using a grade sandpaper now seal this plaster with a water based drywall primer and your back to square on and ready to re tile if the tile glue you were using was a water based one then you will want to let it fully cure before using the stove as any steam or heat will soften the glue which may have been the problem in the first place consult the supplier of the adhesive for more detailed advice on this Drywall Plaster Drill bit Seismic retrofit Kitchen Casting Stucco Pottery Sandpaper Masonry Tile Printed circuit board Plastic Screw Mosaic Paint Boat building Cyanoacrylate Knife Internal ballistics Friction Carpet Dairy Wallpaper Genericized trademark Mortar (masonry) Woodworking Diving suit Manifold Asbestos Architecture of the California missions Thermal power station Welding Brazing Water purification Epoxy Label STS-114 Repouss__ and chasing Gypsum Tanning Fire extinguisher Wok Radio controlled airplane Hamster Stir frying Sauna Leather Strake Glacier Furnace Adhesive Opportunity rover Sento Natural building Coffee Dishwasher Violin Carburetor Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Vulcanization Solar cell Glossary of sculpting terms Glass Basement Soldering Wallpaper group Hard water Sand casting Stave church Glossary of partner dance terms Wood Great Pyramid of Giza Straw-bale construction Brush Desert Enceladus (moon) Microwave oven Car handling Stove Toilet paper Roof Sulfuric acid Bong Lost-foam casting Clinker (boat building) Dominoes Gelatin Mahjong Renewable energy Solar power Sea ice Inflation Cello JPEG Aluminium Fiberglass Cartridge (firearms)
