ideas on resurfacing a deck which type of planer sander should i use an idiot i hired to stain my deck ruined it with a pressure washer fired him now i plan to flip the boards x cedar after planing the bottom side about to clean them up joists are i'll also plane down any new boards i have to buy sanding would just be too time consuming even a surface vibrating sander didn't help much on the top surface i have a hand planer but with so many board feet big deck it doesn't seem practical for this job so i plan to buy a power planer i also want something i'll be able to use for future jobs such as trimming x to square the corners i'm just an old fart homeowner who likes to play with wood but not an avid woodworker i'm considering either a bench planer or maybe a planer jointer which might be more useful in the future because i could also use it to do rabbits etc which type of planer would be best for this application and why do you think so any ideas greatly appreciated thanks you don't want to take up your deck because all the nail holes will not go away plus pulling the nails or screws would leave large holes even if you turn the over the holes would weather and add to your mess bleach is a good way to clean cedar a good deck brush and little elbow grease will save you hours of work as for resurfacing the color of new cedar will never come back and if you try to plan or sand you have the chance of putting grooves or cross cutting the grain of the wood even if you could get back the color it would be hard to keep stain it to the color you want then linseed oil it stain alone will last only a year or so because the flat surface lightly oil in the spring will keep it fresh looking Drill bit Plane (tool) Screw Upholstery Poker jargon Table saw Seismic retrofit Knife Manicure Mattress Skateboarding trick Clinker (boat building) Tire Violin Textile manufacturing Equine conformation Bong Radio controlled airplane Brush Wood Floppy disk Ship Woodworking machine Harp The Young Ones (TV series) Glossary of nautical terms Pottery USS Trigger (SS-237) Saw Paint Professional wrestling holds Glossary of climbing terms Golf Wassily Kandinsky Lathe Canoe USS Vestal (AR-4) Casting Yohoho!
