why do my recently refinished wood floors have pits all over them i have hardwood floors in the st floor of my home here in new england usa i contracted a wood floor refinisher to strip and apply coats of oil based polyurethane which he did but the floors are full of small pits which make the floors look terrible the contractor has applied additional coats of poly to try to fix the problem the first time we had lots of fans going to try to get it to dry faster but that didn't fix it the floor still has lots of little pits the second time this morning he sanded cleaned and applied another coat and we had the house all the windows closed so there are no drafts and the ac going and a dehumidifer to keep the humidity lower so it will dry faster which he claims will reduce the pits no luck the floors look terrible and now the poly is getting pretty thick do i need to fire this guy or is he using poor quality poly or should he start over in the fall when the humidity is lower they original flooring refinisher claims that the problem is that he tried to put the coats on too quickly and didn't give them enough time to dry between coats this certainly seems to be the case as the top surface is now hard but if we place any heavy furniture on it it dents into the finish his suggestion is to wait a month then and down the finish and apply a coat of bona kemi premium water based poly the key he thinks is that the solvents that are stuck in all the layers of oil based poly have to dry out before we try to put down another coat naturally i don't have a lot of faith in this guy he is very experienced and other people have used him with excellent results he says he just made a mistake with my floor and is willing to work it out but we're getting another opinion from another flooring guy something very strange is going on here i've managed a flooring store in ga and one in fl there is no worse humidity than fl in the summer and i haven't seen this problem if we could only sand and finish in fl when the humidity was low we could only work in dec and jan the ac should be on the house should be climate controlled yes right now coats of poly is way too much we generally only do you don't say how old your home is hopefully you have another sanding left in them this floor needs to be re stripped and started over this time use a water based urethane it will cost more because the urethane itself is more expensive but it dries quicker and more evenly and is actually a harder finish as far as the pitting sounds like something is wrong with the sander because when you sand you should be getting a smooth finish on the wood not a pitted finish low humidity is not going to reduce pits if the wood is pitted from the sanding if you haven't paid him fire him don't be surprised if he says he is going to lien the property take lots of pictures showing the quality of work and have documentation that you gave him every viable chance to solve the problem and stand your ground and be ready to file a counter suit most installers can't afford the legal hassle in real dollars or dollars lost from the battle and will back off if you are truly in the right they know a bad job and this sander knows he did a bad job a true installer wants everyone who sees your floor to say wow who did your floors not ummmm so who did your floors ask your neighbors ask your friends coworkers and church members as to whom to use for the best results the same name times or more is your man if it should happen to be the guy you chose he really needs to check his equipment i nearly lost a large contractor because my sand and finish guy did not have his equipment in good working order but since this guy wants to contiune to blame the condition on humidity and add more coats fire
