how to apply wall filler hi i've taken a close look at my walls in a new unfurnished apartment and the walls have thousands of holes in them so i've bought some wall filler how do i preper the filler and apply it correctly thanks the best product is premixed lightweight spackle however it sound like you are using a powdered putty make sure the walls are washed with a mild detergent rinsed and dried follow the instructions on the product container for mixing apply to the holes with a plastic putty knife they come in different sizes from get a small and a large one put a small amount of putty on one edge of the blade push the mixture into the holes then use the putty knife as a scraper lay the blade flat above the filled hole and pull down smoothly to remove any excess material after the holes are filled you should use a fine drywall sandpaper to remove any bumps or excess when you're done remove the dust with a slightly damp towel not wet you can use regular paint after this but i recommend that you use primer to seal the repairs first this will prevent the paint from soaking into those spots and showing later good luck Knife Handloading Casting Hand grenade Woodworking Upholstery Dairy Seismic retrofit Internal ballistics Wallpaper Screw Japanese tea ceremony Tofu Asbestos Plastic Welding Brewery Laundry detergent Brazing Drawing Wok Ceramics Brush Soldering Carburetor Thermal power station Lionel Corporation Explosive material Mattress Car washing techniques Dry cleaning Manicure Radio controlled airplane Genericized trademark Hat Tire Condom Fire extinguisher Table saw Plaster Soap Basement M16 (rifle) Pottery Fire fighting Dishwasher Aluminium Sandpaper Printed circuit board Tobacco Gas metal arc welding Paint Coffee Movie projector Drywall Diving suit Canoe Gramophone record Motor oil Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Heinkel He 100 Laundry Collecting fossils Sewage treatment Poker jargon Loudspeaker Equine conformation Phase (matter) Hamster Glossary of firefighting equipment Silly Putty Washing machine Electrical wiring Textile manufacturing terminology Tanning Top-bar hive Shaving Pebble bed reactor Amateur telescope making Japanese toilet Tattoo Sport rowing Flour Steel Concrete STS-114 Leather M60 machine gun Plastic bag Hand washing
