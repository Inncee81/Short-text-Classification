how hard is it to do wood staining i was thinking to repaint my dinner table and chairs but when i striped the surface by sanding i discovered that chairs actually look pretty good only i want them darker i'm thinking about staining them and put polyurethain varnish over is it hard to do the staining any tips for unexperieced person unfortunately table made of fiberwood i think exept the legs i would stain the legs and paint the top with color that match or compliments the rest would you recomend to paint the top of the table with a brush or spray thanks i am a professional furniture restorer and i have to say that it is pretty easy to do just remember to wear gloves that are chemical resistant and have a very well ventilated room preferably out side in the shade not in the sun and not too windy either you don't want the stain to dry before you wipe it off and wipe it off very well too because the finish will have problems sticking if you don't also the stain should dry over night most directions say to hours but the longer the better you can test the color by wiping some denatured alcohol in a small inconspicuous place just enough alcohol or mineral spirits to make it a little wet just so you can see the color if it's too light you can stain it again after the first coat dries though and if it is too dark and it is an oil stain you can use mineral spirits paint thinner to wipe it off but do it gently because toe color you see while you are wiping is usually the color that it will be once you finish it hope i've helped if you have any questions or trouble feel free to write me i'll be glad to help by the way for the regular consumer minwax product are ok Paint Upholstery Plastic Mattress Pottery Varnish Tooth enamel Wood Fire extinguisher Chair Leather Casting Manicure Arcade cabinet Photography Violin Knife Textile manufacturing Japanese tea ceremony Billiards Wood carving Laws of cricket Aluminium Glass Drawing Diving suit Pencil Wood finishing Tobacco Bedbug Fecal incontinence Titanium Campfire Turquoise Snooker Carbon dioxide Brush Volleyball Tooth Skateboarding trick Hamster Cello Wok Nunchaku Poker jargon Opportunity rover Shroud of Turin Staining (biology) Brewery Fancy rat Impressionism 2000 Australian Grand Prix Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Lacquer Traditional animation Kitchen Wassily Kandinsky Rum The Human Stain Table tennis Diseases of the honeybee Christmas tree Welding Fan (implement) Gas metal arc welding Shoe polish Sundial Oasis (band) Car handling Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Marching band Sento Professional wrestling holds Cannabis cultivation Henri Murger Bong Hemp Technetium Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Methanol Sauna Beer Pong Primer (paint) Ultraviolet Carnivorous plant Thermal power station Fast bowling Dog Desert Chopsticks Printmaking Color
