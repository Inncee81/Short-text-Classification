what color should the carpet be i am repainting my room in ohio state colors it will be red on the bottom half of the wall with black stripping and the ohio state helmet stripe in the middle with grey all above it after i paint im going to get new carpeting what color should i use my first answer would be a light grey carpet but since i'm guessing that this room is going to be used as the football game day room i would go with a grey frieze actual style of carpet in the medium to darker tones better yet with a berber fleck since a frieze has more texture will hide more traffic patterns and crumbs if you can find one with berber flecks since it's not a solid will hide more adult beverage spills red is a hard color to match and black well is just going to show every light colored piece of dirt that hits it Carpet Wallpaper group Camouflage Tag British Rail Class 86 Colours, standards and guidons Billiards Color theory Lighting Rococo Sega Saturn Color Animal Crossing Union Pacific Railroad Upholstery Symmetry Human skin color Paint Hair color Stage lighting Wood Netsuke Bicycle lighting Wood carving Koopa Troopa Drawing Sea-Monkey Harrow School Cobra Commander Magical objects in Harry Potter The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time weapons and items Arizona Cardinals Flag of the United States Rail Blue Lane British Rail Class 317 Cat coat genetics Comanche Discus (fish) Doom engine St. Louis Rams Dragon Booster Light-emitting diode Nintendo 64 Cheetah Goomba Eye color Fischer Random Chess Mario series enemies James McNeill Whistler Blue Taekwondo Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME The Warriors Detroit Lions Plastic In-N-Out Burger Invisibility Jumpstart 3rd Grade St. Louis Cardinals The Legend of Zelda series enemies Red-black tree De Lorean DMC-12 Cincinnati Bengals Molding (decorative) Bedbug Wassily Kandinsky Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Chaos Emerald Wheel of Fortune Tampa Bay Buccaneers Conker's Bad Fur Day Neoclassicism Textile manufacturing terminology Cellular automaton Primary color Power Rangers Roomba Fancy rat Baltimore Ravens Nintendo GameCube Vacuum cleaner Legends of the Hidden Temple Items in the Metroid series Sunglasses Chicago Bears Atlanta Falcons Castlevania: Symphony of the Night Opportunity rover Bad Wolf Judo Chair Color blindness American comic book DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Airport Bassoon Frieze group Cello Flag
