feng shui question does anyone know what feng shui says about ceiling fans i was thinking about putting ceiling fans in some of my upstair rooms in fengshui moving objects like ceiling fans can activate good and bad energy in an area you cannot sense by your senses nor intuition this energy in your house you can only calculate them by use of the fengshui concepts when an energy is activated it happens thus if a person who builds his her house based on fengshui and placed the living room in an area where the good energy is located then putting the fans creates no problem because good things will happen every time the occupants use the fans this is what fengshui is about on the other hand if you did not build your house based on fengshui and unknowingly placed the fans in an area with bad energy then bad things will happen every time you use the fans so it becomes a guessing game observe if there is a difference in your life if there are no problems then the fans are good but if in months something happened in your life that is bad then it means that there is a bad energy in your living room this bad energy has nothing to do with bad spirits nor history of the house it is not the bad energy as what most people in the western world come to believe but it is energy that goes against the life of the occupant that is why it is considered bad it might be conflict illness death or an accident it is difficult to give advises to people regarding fengshui because when most people consult a fengshui master professional these people usually visits the houses personally Feng Shui Theory of conduct Fire fighting Force (Star Wars) Luck New Age Karma Logic Numerology Critique of Pure Reason The nature of God in Western theology House Utilitarianism Five elements (Japanese philosophy) Socrates Alexander Technique Moral relativism Legacy of Kain Taoism Afterlife Out-of-body experience Chinese architecture Dualism (philosophy of mind) I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Bad Wolf Evil Nicomachean Ethics A Course In Miracles Scientology beliefs and practices Social rule Special relativity Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Philosophy of mathematics Quantum mechanics Faster-than-light Animal Crossing Shadow the Hedgehog Transactional analysis Reiki Capitalism Justification (theology) Mathematics General relativity Ethics Xanadu House Predestination Tao Te Ching Whose Line Is It Anyway?
