need storage ideas for small apt i am in college live in a tiny emphasis on the tiny bedroom apt i have a bunch of stuff nowhere to put it right now it's thrown in my bedroom closet stacked up all over the living room the things i have the stuff in now are too big to put anywhere else besides the living room so i have to put the stuff in something else if i want to use that space and i do i can't put a shelf on the wall or anything like that since it's an apt and i don't have a lot of to spend so any ideas i can do or make at home would be great or something cheap i could buy or any place that i might not have thought of for storage ps the stuff i'm talking about is old books i want to keep but won't read for a while and pictures and picture frames games etc just a random collection of junk that i need to store somewhere until i move next year if you have a bed store everything under there go to any grocery store and ask them for some boxes what you can do with them is cut them down if they wont fit under the bed stack all your books and stuff in them and push under the bed its a cheap and easy way to store them without them falling over another suggestion would be to use the old books as a table if they are hardcover books you can stack them up into piles beside eachother then put a sheet over them instant side table Kitchen The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Craps Poker jargon Floppy disk The Brady Bunch Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Apt Pupil Cheating in poker Castle of the Winds Star Trek Customizable Card Game Brewery Library McMansion CPU design Textile manufacturing Equine conformation Blankets (graphic novel) Hamster Betting (poker) Time Out of Mind Top-bar hive Crime fiction Emergency preparedness Table tennis Empire Burlesque Ice cream Page table Quicksort RISC Subroutine Computer TARDIS Dormitory Redundant array of independent disks Wilton House Milton H.
