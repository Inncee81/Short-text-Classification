im going to paint my room a springish green color should i paint all walls that color or should i add some designs if so what kind links would be helpful too i would paint only one or two walls in the springish green color when you use a color like green you should use something not so drastic on the other walls for a good contrast and pop i would paint the wall with the bed against it to create a focal wall one idea is to do a really funky modern design not too much or too crazy just something to draw your eye up with simple lines like flowers on a vine or something on the green wall with a slightly lighter or darker color or even if you just painted the green in a flat paint and then did a nice design on it in the same color but in a high gloss paint so it isn't so drastic that would look really sharp Wood carving Drawing Color theory Paint Color blindness Dragon Booster Carpet Rococo Camouflage Wilton House The Wall Color Eyepiece Light-emitting diode Sundial Art Lighting Game Boy Pump It Up Georges-Pierre Seurat Grace Cossington Smith Hangul Piet Mondrian Wallpaper group Wassily Kandinsky CPU cache Technicolor Cinematography Diamond cut Tarot Pysanka Sunglasses Christiansborg Palace Autostereogram Perspective (graphical) Wood Dodge Charger Blue Anchor Acrylic paint Graphics Glass Music history of the United States (1960s and 70s) Disney's Contemporary Resort Heterochromia Eye color Traditional animation Microsoft Paint PNG Projection screen Mahjong Anaglyph image Physical attractiveness Goomba Miniature (illuminated manuscript) Japanese tea ceremony Passenger car Culture of Korea View camera Chatsworth House Casting Stereoscopy Computer animation Classical music era Irish Houses of Parliament Plasma display RGB color model Bassoon Pennsylvania Railroad Basement Fluorescent lamp Roxette Joel and Ethan Coen IPod Leather Chaco Culture National Historical Park Loudspeaker Circuit design Bass guitar Human skin color Stucco Golf club (equipment) Billboard (advertising) Buckingham Palace Kirby: Canvas Curse Atari 8-bit family Molding (decorative) Bong Hair color Bread Billiards The Legend of Zelda series enemies M.C.
