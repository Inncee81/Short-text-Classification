any suggestions on using painters tape i have tried on several occasions to use painters tape to get nice edges against trim and when painting adjacent walls different colors most of the time when i take the tape off it peals the paint off of the wall so i end up spending hours carefully going around with a razor trying to trace the edge of the tape so that the paint job isn't ruined this often leaves a raised edge which i don't like either i have used the lightest sticking blue tape available but it doesn't make a difference i could definitely do a better job of not getting so much paint on the tape thanks for that tip however taking the tape off while the paint is wet isn't usually an option if i have three white walls and a wall with a dark color sometimes it takes four or more coats to get the coverage i want so the tape has to stay on until all five coats are on usually a couple days work yes i use a dark primer but some colors are just take a bunch of coats lol i was just telling another questioner to burnish down the blue tape well so he wouldn't get seepage but when i paint most of the time i make very certain that i don't get any paint on the blue tape because i have the same problem with the raised edge hence i have gotten real good freehanding straight lines basically using the blue tape as a guide rather than to be able to count on it as my straight line remember straight is optical not necessarily exact all of the time i always remove the blue tape while the paint is still wet too that way you get less of a raised edge to contend with Paint Knife Colours, standards and guidons Pottery The Inside Color Drill bit Piet Mondrian Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Wassily Kandinsky Glaze The Brady Bunch Casting Theory of conduct Volleyball Poker jargon Avenue Q Blood on the Tracks Laserdisc Empire Burlesque Snooker Wallpaper group Halting problem Handloading Ontological argument Friends Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Reservoir Dogs Wood carving Amateur telescope making Glossary of graph theory Georges-Pierre Seurat Real Love (song) Time Out of Mind Sundial Laser engraving Philosophical skepticism Social rule Violin Professional wrestling match types Vitreous enamel Craps Upholstery Blonde on Blonde Shroud of Turin Escape from New York Stucco Rendering (computer graphics) Perspective (graphical) Textile manufacturing Plame affair Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Taikyoku shogi Whose Line Is It Anyway?
