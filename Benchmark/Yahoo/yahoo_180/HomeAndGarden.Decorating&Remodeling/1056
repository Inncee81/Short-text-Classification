what makes an interior designer an interior designer just what i mean is like what are the things that they notice and things like that i want to be an interior designer when i am older but i dont know if i have the qualities of one i watch hgtv a lot but i'm not sure if i could be that creative if anyone has any websites or anything on designing then i would really appreciate it thanks d there are so many different types of designers it would be wrong to say you must at a young age notice this or that if you have any interest in art or architecture or enjoy doing crafts that is certainly an indication that you might eventually go into interior design some designers concentrate in only one style or one particular type of room or green design ecologically aware or feng shui also there are so many careers within the design field that are not just interior designers there are all kinds of computer software experts helping designers plan out kitchens and bathrooms or people who specialize in window treatments people who specialize in color people who design furniture etc i'd say just that fact that you are asking the question at a young age shows you're interest and you have more than enough time now to see the types of jobs tasks you actually enjoy doing there are many jobs that seem glamorous or fun but depending on what types of tasks you like to spend your time doing when you are an adult you may find those so called glamorous jobs just don't personally make you happy there are so many jobs out there you've probably never heard of i'd say learn about art architecture and history but keep your mind open about what your particular job will be when you're old enough maybe you can intern with a design firm good luck i'm sure you'll be great Computer Lighting Social rule Pitaten Architecture IBM PC compatible Apple Macintosh Interior decoration W.
