with my fiance moving in soon i need to get rid of some old furniture need some suggestions my honest thought is that i don't need to sell this stuff i would like to give it away to someone or some organization that needs it my kitchen table is in great shape but my fiance prefers hers for example does anyone have any ideas about how i can donate this stuff the last thing i want to do is trash all of this stuff check out a website called freecycle org and see if there's one in your area i have given away a lot of things that were in good condition but not worth selling using the freecycle network a non profit organization answered one of my ads and i gave them some furniture and household items there's a 'links' page where you might be able to find organizations accepting donations nearby the beauty of it is these folks have to come to you and pick up the items and i was given receipts to claim my donation on my income tax return Amazon.com Advertising Neopets Animal Crossing Discordianism RuneScape cheats The Best Page in the Universe Freecycle Network Theory of conduct Let's Make a Deal Microeconomics Flat tax The Star Wars Holiday Special Best Buy Indian English Gaia Online The Apprentice 2 Recycling Surplus value FairTax Empire Burlesque Internet fraud Dave Matthews Band Wal-Mart The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Alcoholics Anonymous Tax Intellectual property Gift economy United Kingdom corporation tax Live 8 Rich Mullins Shit Fry's Electronics Productive and unproductive labour Upholstery Inventory Mid-levels Life insurance Babylonian law English plural Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Organic food Intelligent design Pretty Good Privacy Capital accumulation Ontological argument Backstreet Boys Utilitarianism Philosophy of language Epistemology The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Non-profit organization RuneScape locations Inflation Infantilism Red Hot Chili Peppers Gross domestic product Extreme Programming Current teachings of Prem Rawat School choice W.
