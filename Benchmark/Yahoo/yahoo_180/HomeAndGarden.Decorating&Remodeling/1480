how can i cut ceramic tile that is already laid i am about to buy a house in which the previous owner laid ceramic tyle in a laundry room i'd like to keep the tile but when he laid it he didn't stop at the rear door he kept laying all the way through the doorway and to the outside step he didn't install a threshold with weatherstripping he instead hung the wrong kind of door and it has a gap that both hot air and water can get in through i plan on installing pre hung insulated steel doors and need to remove the tile in the doorway so i can get the pre hung door and frame to fit any suggestions first get a hand grout removal blade looks like single edge razor blade with tungsten carbide grit on edge scrape out the grouting on the outside tiles and the ones that go under the door that keeps tiles from cracking during the next step next put a flat blade under the outermost tile and bang on it until the tile is loosened repeat until you have gone through all of the outside tiles and the ones just under the door scrape off any cement or glue stuck to their bottom side now that all of those are off you are ready for final step measure how close to the door you want the tiles to end transfer that mark onto a tile so you can cut it either buy or rent a tile cutter and cut the tile along the line you made if you have a problem on the first few cuts then you could use some of the extra ones from outside till you get them cut neatly now refasten those tiles along the door edge with thin set cement or adhesive when that is dry apply grout that matches the original grout and you are done Drill bit Knife Seismic retrofit Tile Ceramics Textile manufacturing Door STS-114 Spark plug Roof Adhesive Brewery Casting Amateur telescope making Sento Mattress Upholstery Tire Violin Architecture of the California missions Razor Bicycle frame Dominoes Sharpening stone Boat building Saw Transformer Scissors Semiconductor device Poker jargon Pottery Rail tracks Handloading Thermal power station Rathfarnham Asbestos Screw Woodworking Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Shaggy dog story Fire fighting Rail terminology Glossary of American football Radio controlled airplane Glossary of climbing terms Katana Trapping Lawn mower Plane (tool) Beehive (beekeeping) Furnace Tungsten Milling cutter Bulldozer Floppy disk Jet engine Naval mine Equine conformation Solar power B-47 Stratojet Masonry Glass Glossary of wildland fire terms Kitchen P-61 Black Widow Diving suit Space Shuttle program Diamond cut Mahjong Gramophone record Barbed wire Fast bowling Tessellation STS-61 King Khalid International Airport Clinker (boat building) Campfire Printed circuit board Table tennis Harp Terminal ballistics Professional wrestling match types Hemp Time Out of Mind Internal ballistics Dodge Charger Sword making Welding Taikyoku shogi Dredge Bassoon Table saw Canoe
