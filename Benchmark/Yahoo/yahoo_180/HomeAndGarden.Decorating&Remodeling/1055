thinking of building extension where do i start who should i get in touch with first will builder give me drawn plans or do i have to get an architect have been told so many different ways i am confused thanks for any help start by approaching your local planning office they will be able to give you advice on the size of your extension and a list of approved architects and contractors then speak to one of those architects have a rough plan drawn up and talk to three or more approved contractors to get estimates under new legislation everything you get done will have to have a certificate that is stamped by the planning office inspector otherwise you may find it difficult to sell your house later on you will probably have to thrash the plans around to get it exactly right and then the architect should present you with finished plans as long as the planning office approve these and you do not stray from these original plans the contractor should be able to give you a start date and finishing time just remember good contractors will not be able to start quickly and they will never ask for the full amount up front you may be asked for a percentage to get initial materials that's expected and as the work progresses you will be able to hand over a little more each time only when the work is completed to your satisfaction should you hand over the final payment the main thing is to work with your contractor and not ask him to deviate from the plans because you forgot something before asking for a change ask his advice first then talk to the architect and finally call the planning office to make sure that it's acceptable and when you get written confirmation you can make the change try to think of problems ahead of the work as it is much easier to make adjustments as the work progresses rather than try to retro fit something later if you cannot be there when the work is being done get a project manager they work for you to get the job done on time and within budget it's not worth the hassle letting the contractor make decisions on your behalf he won't have to live with it when it's done the project manager will make sure the plans are followed according to your instructions be nice to your project manager a properly built extension should add tens of thousands of pounds to the value of your property but in some cases where there was no project manager or owner on site to deal with problems the resulting extension has actually cut tens of thousands of pounds off the value of a house at some point you will have to decide if you are going to decorate the extension yourself or if you will get decorators in to do that a simple rule of thumb is that any tradesman is likely to cost between per day they like to get started early in the day between am and am and they will always try to finish for pm make sure that the quote you get is final and that there are no hidden charges a good contractor will list the tools he will need to hire like a small excavator for the foundations and their approximate cost and length of use you can save money by clearing the area where the extension is to be built ie taking up carpets removing curtains clearing out furniture if you can store it in a neighbour's garage that would be good remember to say thanks with a gift afterwards as the contractor may need to store tools in your garage rather than cart them back and forth every night and lastly if you add an extension the rateable value of your house will increase and you may have to pay more rates a bigger council tax bill good
