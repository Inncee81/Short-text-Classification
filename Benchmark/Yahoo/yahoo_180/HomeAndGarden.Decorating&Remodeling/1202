advice on painting older mobile home i just bought a x mobile home the inside looks great the outside on the other hand looks kinda yucky the bulk of the trailer is white and the trim is a brownish reddish color it does need to be washed to get mold mildew off but i'm wondering what are some good colors that would go for a mobile home i dont want it to end up looking gaudy thanks for any advice websites with color examples would be great i would say to leave it white and get some type of shutters to put on the front maybe the shutters could be red burgandy or blue color that way it doesn't make the trailer look so old and makes it stand out better as in it makes it look more attractive and inviting to friends and family Red Wheat Casting Stage lighting Billboard (advertising) Horse Upholstery Stereoscopy MS-06 Zaku II Paul Is Dead Lighting Xanadu House Rose Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children View camera Rugby union positions Wayne Corporation Dodge Charger Glass Colours, standards and guidons Chicago White Sox The Warriors Tank Light-emitting diode The Red Green Show Aladdin (1992 film) Color ZAFT Armed Keeper of Unity Leica Wallpaper group World War Three (Doctor Who) GunBound PlayStation Portable Oakland Athletics Wood carving BNSF Railway National Day Parade BMW M5 Blue Iris (anatomy) NBC Typewriter Chess strategy and tactics Discus (fish) Tier One Color theory Trailer Park Boys Condom Priestly Code Driver's license House Maneki Neko RuneScape quests Drawing Ultramarine Father's Day (Doctor Who) British Rail Class 421 Miniature (illuminated manuscript) Past teachings of Prem Rawat Blood on the Tracks Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Grumpy's Three Wishes Gamut Vehicle registration plate British Rail Class 317 Trailer (vehicle) W.I.T.C.H.
