what order should i do in working on my home i have several major things i want done on my home does it make sense to consider the order of what is done i want the carpet out and put in a wood floor i want the inside of the house painted and new base boards i also want the spray ceiling removed i'm also considering retiling the kitchen counters and bathroom counters and shower but i probably have to wait on this because of the cost the place to start would be to remove the base boards carpeting and scrape the ceiling once the demolition is complete paint starting with the ceiling then the walls next apply the new base then the floor i assume youy are talking about the wood laminate type floor if it is a full thickness wood floor do the base after floor installation once the floor is installed then comes the base shoe which fits over the floor and against the new base fill in nail holes in base and shoe and seal them finish this project before attempting others good luck Drill bit Kitchen Carpet Basement Shoe Xanadu House Asbestos Stairway Seismic retrofit St Albans Cathedral Knife Sento Bathroom Diving suit Parquetry Buckingham Palace Wallpaper group Timber framing Fire fighting Animal Crossing Bubble Bobble Chatsworth House Japanese tea ceremony The Young Ones (TV series) Hogwarts Floor Directory Toilet paper McMansion Printed circuit board Japanese toilet Upholstery Mosaic Horseshoe House World War Three (Doctor Who) Dial M for Murder Richard Chase 1957 World Series Casting Blackjack Heinkel He 100 Woodworking Epoxy Doom engine Sistine Chapel Electrical wiring Air-raid shelter Poker jargon Brush Textile manufacturing Solar cell Wood University of Tennessee at Chattanooga Pittsburgh Steelers Saw II Lighting Drywall Light-frame construction Architecture of the California missions Volleyball Wood carving Stucco Tile Paint Professional wrestling match types Glossary of partner dance terms Wind turbine Comanche Professional wrestling holds Wilton House Passenger car Tire Air pollution Naval mine Temporal bone Jumpstart 3rd Grade Spark plug Cremation Straw-bale construction Tag Domus Aurea Shotgun house Sundial The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time places Fecal incontinence Shaggy dog story Holkham Hall Clinker (boat building) Dymaxion house Door Columbine High School massacre Dundas Square Super Mario 64 Mattress Deck (ship) Funeral of Pope John Paul II Polyurethane Vickers Valiant Portsmouth Block Mills Screw
