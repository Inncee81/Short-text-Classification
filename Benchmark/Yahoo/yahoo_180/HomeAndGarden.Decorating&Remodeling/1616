do most large architectural firms accept bids for kitchen bath product or do they do it all on their own i am a kitchen designer in boston and there is a project going on in town that i would love to participate in i am afraid i don't know much about how large architectural firms work obviously they create the floor plans for the project head the construction of it and have designers on staff but do they accept bids for things like a kitchen even if the kitchen design is already done by them do they usually go to an outside source to get the product do they accept bids on the project the website for this particular company doesn't say much about how they operate i figured before i contact them and ask i'd check here and see what you all have to say depending on the type of contract that the owner has with the architect firm the firm may be in complete control of the building project normally the actual construction work is contracted out to a builder or general contractor who manages the project and takes bids from sub contractors these sub contractors normally supply the labor and material to perform their specialized area of construction you need to find out who the builder is he will likely already have his own suppliers but it never hurts to ask the architect would be the place to start since they are the ones that write the specifications into the building plans if you can sell them your product to be specified then the builder will have no choice but to get bids on your product or an equal one Construction Architect Architecture Information Services Procurement Library Inventory PRINCE2 Management John Hancock Tower Rational Unified Process Microeconomics Oil-for-Food Programme Crew Exploration Vehicle Boston and Lowell Railroad Wal-Mart Matthew Brettingham Scottish Parliament Building Bechtel Corporation Product Lifecycle Management BAE Systems Ludwig Mies van der Rohe The Apprentice 2 Petronas Towers Halliburton Landscape architecture Corporate governance ITV The Fountainhead John Poulson Natural monopoly Business continuity planning Economy of Venezuela Auction Labour economics Mechanics lien Frank Lloyd Wright Nuclear power Efficiency wages Supply and demand Xanadu House Pennsylvania Railroad Hawaiian architecture Ra (board game) Wall Street Elevator Habitat for Humanity International Principal-agent problem Dynamic Systems Development Method Office Ford Motor Company Hercules Linton Cray Inc.
