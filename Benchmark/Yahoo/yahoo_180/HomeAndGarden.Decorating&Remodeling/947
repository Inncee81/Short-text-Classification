what do i do odd screen door size my kitchen screen door is old and needs to be replaced we were going to switch the front screen door out with a new one and put it on the kitchen quick and easy but the kitchen screen door is inches wide this is not standard i don't want to spend tons of money to get a new one even if i can find one but can't reframe around the door either does anyone have any ideas what to do i am really confused there are a couple of options you don't mention the size of the front door but i will assume it is if this is true you must add to the frame or the door are you measuring the door jamb or the molding you could add to both sides of the molding this would give you the extra width otherwise add to each side of the screen door itself although this would move the handle away from the strike plate the plate can be shimmed out to meet the latch if you measured the molding does the door jamb come closer to the width you need if so install it on the jamb Door Floppy disk De Lorean DMC-12 Oscilloscope Movie projector Mouse (computing) Dodge Charger Glossary of ballet terms Typewriter Mazda Miata M16 (rifle) Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Stairway Panzer II Volleyball Fenway Park STS-61 View camera Dishwasher Compact disc Equine conformation Kitchen Porsche 993 Vehicle registration plate Winning Streak Molding (decorative) Scale model Stereoscopy Piano Canon T90 Elevator Glossary of American football Ford Thunderbird Buick Skylark Tire Volkswagen Type 2 (T3) Laws of cricket Chevrolet Corvette Atari 8-bit family CPU cache Striker Pack Bicycle frame Mattress Violin Detroit Tigers Rail terminology Skateboarding trick Softball Airbag Eagle Talon Amateur telescope making Screw Residual-current device Mercury Cougar M4 Sherman Port Authority Trans-Hudson The Star Wars Holiday Special Minesweeper (computer game) Sega Saturn Beatmania IIDX Dodge Neon Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Glossary of firefighting equipment Embedded system Knife Windows XP Faster-than-light Tank Laptop Redundant array of independent disks M60 machine gun Lincoln LS Brassiere Wayne Corporation Football (soccer) Ford Cortina Monty Hall problem Station wagon Apollo Command/Service Module Toyota Camry Headlight Casting Architecture of the California missions Chair Terminal ballistics Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Leica Panzer I Heckler & Koch G3 Chopper (motorcycle) Original Amiga chipset Subaru Loyale Widescreen IPod BMW E34 Pickup truck Mountain bike Normal distribution Brewery
