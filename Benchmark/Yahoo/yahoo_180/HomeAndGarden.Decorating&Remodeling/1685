how too make coasters with digital photos i was wacthing design on a dime on hgtv and one of the host charles burbridge made custom coasters with digital photos all i know is that i need to use pictures and ceramic tiles but i dont know what to use to stick the pics on the tiles or what to pure over the pictures so that its glossy and they dont get messed up help thank you first on your tiles if they are glossy you might want to sand them lightly to get the gloss off so that way they could adhere better decopage should work make sure your pics are printed on paper and not photo paper apply on the back of picture decopage the front side of them let dry to use the tiles as coasters apply a coat of water based polyurethane to the tiles polycrylic sealant produces a shine to the tiles apply the varnish over the polyurethane layer in a sweeping motion from left to right and bottom to top and presto you have personalized tile coasters just a suggestion though since the tile pics wont be able to hold the condensation of the drink and in time they can get worn out you might want to try making coasters by decoupaging a photo to the bottom of a round glass candle plate they tend to have a lip and it wont ruin the photograph have fun Paint Pottery Drill bit Manicure Lacquer Solar cell Plastic Photography Polyurethane Traditional animation Casting Photographic film Stereoscopy Ceramics Glass Toynbee tiles Ra (board game) Varnish Cellular automaton Photographic paper Compact disc Circuit design Sento Seismic retrofit Mars View camera Textile manufacturing terminology Violin Printmaking Escalator Printed circuit board Roller coaster Dundas Square Toilet paper Bong Diving suit Tile Enlarger Brush Basement Collage Glaze Softball Architecture of the California missions Mattress Konica Minolta Mahjong Brewery Coffee Corrosion Japanese tea ceremony Hard disk Patricia Ford Cedar Point Nunchaku The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening Digital photography Cookware and bakeware Amateur telescope making Vacuum tube RollerCoaster Tycoon Hydrochloric acid Dominoes Taikyoku shogi Drawing Furnace Stucco Chobham armour Chromatography Ship Tooth Playing card Dot matrix printer Water purification Vehicle registration plate Tessellation Laser engraving JPEG Photograph Genericized trademark Atomic Kitten Punt (boat) Swingout Pai Gow Bicycle M.C.
