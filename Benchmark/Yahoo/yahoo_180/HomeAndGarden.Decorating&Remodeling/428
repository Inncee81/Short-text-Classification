any dorm room ideas my dorm room has white walls and light brown furniture any ideas of how to make it seem more like home on a very small budget and without using nails i'm moving into a dorm room too i haven't done this yet but here's my plan i went to meijers and got picture prints i like black and whites they are relatively cheap and some of them look awesome then i went to my local dollar store to pick of frames since i can't put nails in the wall i had to make sure i got the lightest frames possible you can even take the glass out of them too then masking tape should hold them up drapes lighting and color can do a lot for a room hopefully you got a window to do this it should make it feel more like home and less like a space you just sleep in you could even just take random pictures of your friends outings you recently took your family and just stick them all over your walls gives people something to talk about when they walk into your room hope this helps o Window Dormitory Upholstery Lighting Kitchen Stereoscopy Wheel of Fortune Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Digital photography Milton H.
