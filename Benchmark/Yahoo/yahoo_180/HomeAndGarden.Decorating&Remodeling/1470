buy a large older home or new construction what are the pros cons of buying an older home and restoring the character and history of the home and buying a newer home i like the first option but not sure about the hazards of older homes i would really like the challenge of restoring a craftsman style home over the years but i want all the information i can get before embarking on this challenge pros are the pleasure of doing it yourself and loving what you have done older homes have so much character and beauty and you will have the pride of ownership cons are it could cost you much more than you expect it might take more time than you expect and with older homes things are constantly breaking down if the house was not well maintained if you are doing an accurate restoration it might take time to find replacement parts if the house is in complete disrepair you could actually be rebuilding the house to me it's too much of an expense but you are not me whatever your decision i wish you luck Energy development The Amazing Race Habitat for Humanity International Capitalism Space Shuttle program Social Security debate (United States) Amalienborg Palace Wind power Gross domestic product Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, manga or movie only characters Microeconomics Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba Health insurance Atari 8-bit family New York Yankees C__ile Ferate Rom__ne London Bridge Nuclear power phase-out Beatmania IIDX Verizon Wireless Windows 2000 Magic: The Gathering Neighbours Council house Bicycle lighting Radeon New York Giants Insurance Nicomachean Ethics Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Life insurance Animal Crossing Cerritos, California Home Rule Act 1914 Submarine Manuel I Comnenus Tram New York Jets Nuclear power DIY audio Magnetic levitation train The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking Los Angeles Dodgers Hubble Space Telescope Jacksonville Jaguars Arbitrage History of Microsoft Windows Unreformed House of Commons Outsourcing Grammatical aspect Planned Parenthood v.
