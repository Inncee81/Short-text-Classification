shelves for gallon storage totes i have about or gallon storage totes in my small storage closet they're stacked to the ceiling so obviously when i need something out of the bottom tote it's a pain i know other people have this problem and was wandering if there were shelves sold somewhere to fit these totes perfectly so i can pull whichever one i need out without having to unstack them or am i going to have to suck it up and try to build some myself if you can fit a modular baker's rack in the closet that would be ideal you can adjust the height of each rack to accomodate as many as can fit this would be cost effective as well as convenient you can find the cheapest baker's racks at places like home depot target etc Flush toilet Refrigerator USB flash drive Microeconomics Closet De Lorean DMC-12 Kitchen Stairway Glossary of firefighting equipment IAR 80 19-inch rack Fecal incontinence M16 (rifle) Hard disk Recumbent bicycle E85 Bong Bicycle Strap-on dildo Sinclair Research Ltd General Dynamics F-111 Supply and demand Autorack Utility cycling Air-raid shelter P-61 Black Widow Crane (machine) Carburetor Ford Mustang Bread Fossil fuel power plant Hydrogen economy Compact audio cassette Autonomous building B-47 Stratojet Short Sunderland Elevator The closet IPod RISC Blood (computer game) Rigging Wine making Early IBM disk storage Dairy Gasoline Combine (Half-Life 2) Nuclear power phase-out Just In Time Hawker Tempest Warehouse Oscilloscope Taxation in the United States BGM-109 Tomahawk Steering Heinkel He 111 Obesity Heckler & Koch G3 F-89 Scorpion P-47 Thunderbolt Cruising (maritime) Technology in the Stargate universe Sea level rise Digital photography Recreational vehicle Energy development Vacuum cleaner Barrel (storage) F-4 Phantom II Grid energy storage RX-93 Nu Gundam F-16 Fighting Falcon Transportation of Los Angeles Diving Transformer Compiler optimization Windows 2000 Royal Arsenal Alcohol fuel P-38 Lightning Tire Internal ballistics Wind turbine Drill bit Fire Sprinkler Hubble Space Telescope Homebrewing Battery (electricity) Bus stop Atari 2600 Battery electric vehicle 64-bit Organic food Limp Bizkit Dormitory Cessna T-37 Tony Banks (musician) History of computer and video games Samovar Dassault Mirage III
