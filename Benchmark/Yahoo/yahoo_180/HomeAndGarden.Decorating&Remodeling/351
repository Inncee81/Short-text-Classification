i need some ideas for a very small bathroom what can i do with the walls i don't want to paper perhaps a paint treatment i was thinking of doing something using aluminum flashing any ideas well what's cool about a really small bathroom is that you can use expensive flooring and not go broke i redecorated a little half bath off my kitchen the only bath downstairs i needed to add a bunch of storage i had nowhere downstairs for soft goods kitchen and bath towels tablecloths etc so i was going to make that small bathroom even smaller with an additional closet so here's what i did i love purple i chose a dichroic mixed color glass tile mosaic for the floor never could have afforded this if i had more floor area it is predominately deep purple with splashes of light purple plus some copper and a few green tiles mixed in the walls pick up the palest shade of purple from the tiles in sherwin williams washable semi gloss bathroom paint this paint is lovely easy to apply and just the right sheen and it is truthfully scrubbable which is important the moulding and window framing is done in one of the deeper purples all of the cabinetry and the paper holder and some hooks on the back of the door are white ceiling is white fixtures are chrome with a swirl pattern in both the light fixture and the cabinet knobs they are very simple there are some pictures which pick up the colors in the floor green frogs purple florida flowers frame on one is purple the other is painted copper colored the most complicated thing in the room is the floor and after that everything is very very simple so my suggestion in a small room is go with one element that catches attention and make the rest pick up on that element and be very simple so the room does not get too busy Lighting The Brady Bunch Kitchen McMansion Mosaic Wilton House Bathroom Aluminium Glass Dundas Square Casting Stage lighting Plastic Wood carving Color theory The Shining (film) Basement Washroom Drawing Japanese tea ceremony Fluorescent lamp Shaggy dog story Wallpaper group Hogwarts Floor Directory King Khalid International Airport Light-emitting diode Mahjong Toilet Friends Yellow Francis Bacon (painter) Fire extinguisher Tessellation Blood Simple Chatsworth House Tile Seismic retrofit Fecal incontinence Paint Ammolite Pottery TARDIS RuneScape quests Abbey Wayne Corporation Bubble Bobble Drill bit Queensbridge Stained glass Billiards Terminal ballistics Molding (decorative) Upholstery Digital photography Brett Whiteley HVAC Brewery Aerial (dance move) Solomon's Temple Carnivorous plant Traditional animation Sicilian Baroque Knife Architecture of the California missions Miniature (illuminated manuscript) Mario Dance Dance Revolution Comanche Bristol Grammar School Sistine Chapel Bus models used in New York City Transit Cannabis cultivation In-N-Out Burger Culture of Korea Color Towel Autonomous building Ultraviolet Dormitory Solar power Palazzo Vecchio Antioch, Pisidia Shotgun house The Inside Home improvement Titanium Ceramics
