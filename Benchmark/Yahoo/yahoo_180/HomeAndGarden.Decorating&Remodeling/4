need some painting advice i just bought a house with horrible purple trim i want to paint it white but am i going to have to primer it first or can i just paint over it going from purple to white is going to be a two coat process no way around this so as a painter with over years experience i reccomend you do and right and then not worry about it for to years from now one thing that you can do to make your prime coat more effective is to get the primer tinted to a light gray gray will cover purple more evenly than leaving the primer its origional color white and a good exterior white will cover gray really well to speed up the process of priming use a winnie roller inches wide and a water base primer will be fine and is eaiser to clean up Color Paint Primer (paint) Color theory Cartridge (firearms) Light-emitting diode Fluorescent lamp Glass Wassily Kandinsky Sunglasses Pottery Titanium Colours, standards and guidons Drill bit Amateur telescope making Brewery Internal ballistics Casting Plastic Vitreous enamel Upholstery Mezzotint Purple Heart Piet Mondrian Opportunity rover Blue Gesso Epoxy Carburetor Table tennis Sequencing Handloading Percussion cap Prime Minister of Australia Brett Whiteley Mouse (computing) Wildcat cartridge Chevrolet Camaro Gray Wolf Gamut Mattress Ammunition Massachusetts State House Nintendo GameCube Painter and decorator Billiards Printmaking Dragon Booster Carpet Leather Stucco Sega Saturn Manicure Common bean Glaze Polymerase chain reaction Tin Drew Struzan Lionel Corporation Items in the Metroid series Transformers: Cybertron Dodge Charger House System at the California Institute of Technology Honda Prelude Diamond enhancement White Jan van Goyen Horse Pontiac Trans Sport The Warriors Eyepiece James McNeill Whistler BMW M5 Wood carving Wire Stereoscopy Photosynthesis Apollo Command/Service Module Japanese tea ceremony Heraldry Drawing U.S. two-dollar bill Cerebellum Grey Cookware and bakeware Material properties of diamond Primer (molecular biology) Diamond color Ford Mustang Cinematography Prime Minister of Canada Francis Bacon (painter) Lake District Pansy Welding Diamond simulant M&M's Watercolor painting President of the United States Photographic film
