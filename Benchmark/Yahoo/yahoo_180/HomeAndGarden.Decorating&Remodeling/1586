faucet with sprayer attached right to faucet or separate sprayer i will be buying a new undermount sink and need to buy a new faucet i will be buying a faucet that has one handle for hot and cold versus the handle because of the sink we're getting my question is should i get a faucet with the spayer attached if i do this then when my new granite gets installed i will only need them to drill one hole i'm really kind of nervous about the srayer being attached because i wonder if it will not go back in the faucet properly after being used a gazillion times so what do you think spayer attached or separate sprayer which then they would have to drill another hole but not a big deal to me what do you think have you had good luck with sprayer attached to faucet thanks i love love love my faucet with the pull out sprayer it is not an expensive faucet but is absolutely fine after years of a lot of use i like not having to reach to another place i push up the lever and in the same move push to the temperature i want move up a bit during washing and there's the sprayer if i need it plus being on the faucet means the sprayer is very convenient to either sink in my double sink setup my mother has the separate sprayer and i just find my faucet so much more convenient i don't find any issue with the hose and its weight i haven't crowded the hose under the sink so it can move as it needs to it has always glided in and out of position with ease be sure to get a faucet with the proper spout length that is the only thing i wish i'd known about when i got my faucet i find i must lean over the sink to get hands under the water kills the back if doing a lot of washing up a longer spout length would have allowed me to stand upright as i wash so i suggest you measure how far out the spout should be to be comfortable for you Sento Tap (valve) Equine conformation Japanese toilet Internal ballistics Siphon Carburetor Cruising (maritime) Knife Menstrual cup Textile manufacturing Drill bit Toilet paper Professional wrestling throws Anchor Glossary of firefighting equipment Radio controlled airplane Diving regulator Bidet Naval mine Plumbing fixture Double bass Tire Samovar Irrigation Professional wrestling holds Glossary of nautical terms Casting Gliding Aerial (dance move) Drill Customs and etiquette of Japan Paragliding Bong Baroque chess Mercury 4 Bass guitar Floppy disk Bicycle frame Elevator Cross-country skiing Swimming Happy Tree Friends Hard disk Water polo Trombone Energy development Sailing Bicycle Breaststroke Swingout Hand grenade Weighing scale Handloading Screw Poker jargon Mattress Breastfeeding First Battle of the Atlantic Abortion debate Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Washroom Mouse (computing) Passenger car Sport rowing Milton H.
