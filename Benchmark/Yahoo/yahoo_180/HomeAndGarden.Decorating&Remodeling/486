installing durock in basement i have vinyl tile in my basement that contains asbestos so i'm leaving it there i'm going to tile the floor so i'm about to install durock cement board on top of the vinyl i was told that i could just use liquid nails to secure the durock is that ok underneath of the vinyl is cement you can certainly apply it with an adhesive you wouldn't put down durock over cement using screws anyway what you've described is the industry standard for putting down cement board or durock over cement floors and tiling in fact the vinyl should provide an excellent vapor barrier as well it is also acceptable to tile directly over the vinyl provided it is in good condition and not loose without using backboard i did one of my rooms in this fashion and it's been great for years now good luck with your project Asbestos Basement Tile Mahjong Epoxy Mosaic Electrical wiring Drill bit Arlington House Upholstery Stucco Roof Dundas Square Kitchen Seismic retrofit Vinyl roof Fluorescent lamp Mattress Ra (board game) Disc jockey Water (molecule) Screw Brewery Vinyl chloride Space Shuttle Columbia disaster Furnace Bristol Grammar School Label Drywall HeroQuest (board game) Straw-bale construction Polyvinyl chloride Professional wrestling match types Carpet Jean Charles de Menezes Adhesive Remix Granite Elevator Pavement (material) Piccadilly Circus Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Basketball Autonomous building Animal Crossing Great Depression Ceramics Plasticizer Water Wallpaper group Sento Water vapor Acetic acid Gramophone record Ammunition Tai shogi Audiophile The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past History of Microsoft Windows Solar power Le Corbusier Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Final Fantasy Legend III Bridgwater Cement Dominoes Pai Gow ZX Spectrum Combine (Half-Life 2) Aluminium The Chemical Brothers AFI (band) West Side Highway Solar cell Build engine Stairway JPEG Explosive material Iligan City Clinker (boat building) Ocean's Twelve Architecture of the California missions Scrabble Guastavino tile Acquire Ministry of Magic Ron Weasley HVAC The Fragile Montreal Screwjob Buckingham Palace Violin McMansion Air-raid shelter Lighting The Pentagon Motor oil Manicure Hydrochloric acid Knots Landing
