what's the difference between a family room and a den my wife and i just bought a fairly roomie house we've been watching tv in what we thought was the living room but after looking at the fllor plan i see it is actually called the family room what are you supposed to do in the family room what is a den a living room is a formal area the family room is a casual area usually there is a tv in the family room but not the living room if there is only one community area in the home it is the family room same w the dining area a dining room is a formal area not all houses come w them because you can easily just eat at a kitchen table or nook which is the area just off the kitchen but as noted earlier you can make your space your own and call it what you like best it is good to know the formal names for when you go to sell your home and want to make it seem more appealing to potential buyers or just hire a real estate agent congrats on the new house Kitchen Dining room Restaurant McMansion The Brady Bunch Real estate broker House Chatsworth House Merton College, Oxford Frankfurt kitchen Shirley, London White House Blenheim Palace Carlsbad, California Emerson College Holkham Hall Mansion Casual dining Harlem German grammar Self-adjoint operator Metaphysics White flight Estoppel Bungalow Microeconomics Mortgage Passenger car Property tax Xanadu House Cohousing Roman villa Monticello Cardinal number James Lick Cyberspace Tea (meal) Mobile home Abbey Babylonian law Economics Mentmore Towers Berghof (Hitler) Internet fraud Urban sprawl EastEnders Supply and demand Animal Crossing Advertising University of Scranton Wilton House The Inside Ascott House Burwash Hall Fuzzy logic Melbourne High School Cuisine of Denmark Citigroup Japanese tea ceremony In-N-Out Burger University of Tennessee at Chattanooga Monopoly (game) Betting (poker) Food court Public transport Palace of Westminster Kingsley Hall Kitchener, Ontario Lauritz de Thurah Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Home of Franklin D.
