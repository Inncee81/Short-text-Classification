can a two story home plan be used for a one story home i like the look the taller look of a two story but do not want to deal with an upstairs i think by doing that you probably insulted a lot of architects and designers out there but i believe people should know reasons and then they can decide for themselves in your situation it all depends on how the drawings for the storey house you are talking about are planned normally the goal of an architect designer is to maximise the use of space and functionality of an alotment while at the same time saving you money ofcourse its not always the case but now lets get to your situation it is very possible that your plan could work for one storey but you should look at the plans backwords try to see why who ever designed it in the first place designed it the way it is list all the things you need from you new house when ur spending a few hundred thousand you want something that would return your investment and be comfortable to live in saving a bit on designing it might come to haunt you later see if all these facilities that you need exist on the lower floor start looking at all the things you would need to add to the plans and the things you can remove reducing a level could mean that you can reduce a lot of piping with bathrooms because a storey design is very different to a multi storey design when it comes to plumbing also consider the structure of the house and how it will get affected basically make sure that u don't have something that you don't need and ur not missing something that you need you would have to alter the working drawings of the house to accomodate the changes otherwise you can easily get ripped off by you builder or build something that doesn't follow the building code in you area this is all just for you own information but i am against it i think you should either hire someone to design you a house based on your needs which will end up saving you money on building it and maximise its value or find the person who designed the plans you currently have storeys and ask them to alter it to suite your needs it might seem that designing a small residence is a simple thing but there are actually so so many considerations and variations its best to hire the services of an expert architect to design your new home to best suite your need and save you money in the future at least they will be liable if somethign goes wrong Construction Kitchen Stairway CPU cache Microeconomics Theory of conduct CPU design Chatsworth House FairTax Space Shuttle program Dundas Square Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Supply and demand Life insurance Basement Seismic retrofit MMORPG Social rule McMansion C plus plus Robert Moses Blackjack Logo programming language Insurance Palladian architecture North York, Ontario Capitalism Gross domestic product Keynesian economics Quicksort Coercion Friends Wilton House Flat tax Poker jargon Robert Lawson (architect) Mach kernel Class (computer science) World Trade Center United Kingdom corporation tax Autonomous building Bristol Grammar School Bloody Stupid Johnson Cheating in Counter-Strike Product Lifecycle Management RISC Compiler optimization Equine conformation Freeters Hash table Inflation Loudspeaker Surplus value Drill bit Surveillance Object-oriented programming Digital circuit Toilet W.
