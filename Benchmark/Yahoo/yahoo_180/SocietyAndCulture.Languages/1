in spanish if i am a guy and i'm speaking to a woman would i change it to feminine and vice versa would she use masculine or is it if you are male you use masculine and woman use feminine i'm very confused as the thing i'm learning from contradicts itself hmmmm not very clear to me but what i can tell you is that the adjectives must be matched to the subject you're talking about who is making the action regardless of who's speaking example if you want to say i am ugly you'd say yo soy feo masculine because it's you we're talking about if this same thing is said by a woman about herself she would then say yo soy fea now let's say the girl is talking to you you are still feo because you're the person that the adjective is being applied to regardless of whether it was a woman or a man who was speaking to you and if you want to tell a woman that she's ugly you'll still say tu eres fea feminine because you're talking about her i hope this is what you needed to know Gender-neutral language Grammatical gender Catalan grammar German grammar Hebrew grammar English grammar Gender role Bulgarian language Esperanto vocabulary Italian grammar Spanish nouns Effeminacy Arabic grammar Latin declension God and gender Serbo-Croatian language Spanish determiners Amharic language Woman Spanish grammar French grammar Cross-dressing Dutch grammar Slovak language Machismo Irish nominals Czech language Irish initial mutations Portuguese language Esperanto as an international language Latin grammar Carl Jung Homosexuality and transgender Gender identity Quebec French Heteronormativity Proto-Indo-European language Spanish pronouns Relative clause Polish language Masculinity Asperger syndrome Article (grammar) Vulgar Latin Iberian naming customs Grammatical number Venetian language Rhyme Akkadian language Gay Goddess Finnish grammar Ojibwe language Spanish verbs Physical attractiveness Esperanto grammar Sexual differentiation Aramaic of Jesus Sicily Friends French language Gender differences in spoken Japanese Japanese language Sesotho language Adjective Spanish adjectives Pushtu language Given name Betty La Fea Spanish prepositions Varieties of Arabic Nobiin language Tashelhiyt language Romance copula Aesthetic Realism Ido Chinese name Feminism Yin and yang Biology and sexual orientation Gender-neutral pronoun Fight Club German language Vocative case Butch and femme Liaison Ancient Greek Old French Family name Attic Greek Dutch language Macbeth Greek language Classical definition of effeminacy Sanskrit Swedish language Transsexuality Man Intersexuality
