what exactly does teutonic mean is it of german language or something cant seem to find definate answer on the web the word teutonic derives at once from both the latin name for a tribe who were thought by the romans to be germanic die teutonen wich means the teutons and from the germanic word tiutisch new high german deutsch german originally meaning belonging to the people the romans identified die teutonen as a germanic tribe and therefore roman writers began to use the term teutonicus as a synonym for their existing word for germanic peoples germanicus today many scholars think that die teutonen were not a germanic tribe at all but were actually a celtic tribe and it has been suggested that teutone derives from the celtic word tuath meaning the people or the tribe as in the mythical irish race the tuatha de danaan the tribe of danaan citation needed tiutisch is the source of the german word deutsch as well as the english word dutch by germans writing in latin used teutonicus instead of the earlier theodisca which was a latin word form of the germanic tiutisch which meant germanic it appears they thought it was an alternative form of the same germanic derivation as theodisca the words teutone and tiutisch thus merged into one modern term teutonic the italian form tedesco derives from the older theodisca the term was used by the economist william z ripley to designate one of the three races of europe which by later writers was called the nordic race this word was also incorporated into the great gatsby by f scott fitzgerald as part of a phrase describing the great war or in other words world war i the teutonic order history of the order the teutonic order was founded in during the siege of acre when a hospital brotherhood was established to care for the many sick german crusaders it was given a building after the conquest of the city and in was turned into a military monastic order on the model of the hospitallers of saint john and the templars this creation reflected the growing involvement of the hohenstaufen dynasty in the holy land from the start the order started a policy of conquering land and building up independent territory in the holy land in hungary in and later in prussia after it absorbed the sword brethren in livonia it was in prussia that the order fought with the polish dukes of masovia and silesia to subjugate the pagan prussians and fight against novgorod after the fall of acre in the grand master went to venice and following the conquest of pomerelia in to marienburg in prussia thus the order by now exclusively nobiliary came to form an independent political entity in pope innocent iv had placed the order's possessions in the pope's domain but in practice the order was completely independent its fortunes began to fade in with the defeat inflicted at tannenberg by poland lithuania and a revolt in its territories in further diminished it and it became a vassal of poland the reformation brought many changes to the order in the hochmeister albrecht of brandenburg anspach secularized the order's prussian holdings into the duchy of prussia resigned from the order became lutheran and gav ehomage for the duchy to the king of poland on april in livonia the ordenmeister livlands gotthard von ketteler did the same in and turned the remnants of the order's estates most of which had been divided between sweden and poland into the duchy of kurland in the german empire the deutschmeister became grand master in and the seat of the order transferred from marienburg to mergentheim the order survived in germany adapting to local politics the protection of the habsburg dynasty which reformed the order in proved a mixed blessing the order survived but it never regained any independence and its efforts were redirected in the habsburgs' wars against the turks with the treaty of westphalia in catholic lutheran and calvinist knights received equal rights within an order headed since the late th century by a habsburg grand master some bailliwicks like elsass burgund koblenz sterreich bozen remained catholic others like th ringen sachsen were protestant and hessen was tripartite catholic lutheran calvinist in the protestant dutch knights broke away and formed the ridderlijke duitsche orde ballij van utrecht which still exists in the order was expelled from most german states and survived only in austria reduced to four knights in it was reorganized by the austrian emperor as a catholic charitable institution nuns were introduced they had existed in the medieval order knights of honor and marianer were created to attract financial support while the knights themselves were essentially noble austrian officers with world war i and the end of the habsburg monarchy the order lost its last possessions in archduke eugen resigned as grand master in the pope reorganized the order as a purely religious order of priests no more knights were created and the last one friedrich graf belrupt tissac died in the order suffered during world war ii when it was abolished by the nazis in austria and czechoslovakia but it survived in italy and started again after in austria and germany in its current form the order has brethren sisters honorary knights and marianer or associates the hochmeister resides in vienna
