i have a budgie that has a growth on his chest the vets i have taken him to say its a growth of sum sort but its growing bigger by the day hes lost weight but hes still feisty and whistling away hes approx yrs old i realy dont no wot to do for the best he dusnt seem in pain do u think it would be wiser to have him put to sleep it is caused by the diet you have fed it another instance of a high fat diet and the seeds i can't say enough about the way all of you feed your birds and what it does to your birds i have studied these birds in the wild and they do not eat seeds in the wild they eat insects as a main staple which are high in protein seeds cause a disease known as fatty liver disease a parakeet on a seed diet will live about yrs just long enough for you to get the bird just the way you want it and then it dies pet store lining their own pockets with your money if more people would use their common sense more birds would be living longer and healthier lives and saving their money start feeding your keet veggies it might be to late for your bird or it may not be educate yourself now on the diets of your birds don't rely on a pet store for your education they are only out to take money out of your hands i commend you for taking your keet to two vets where most won't take a keet to one depending on how involved the tumor is it can be removed but at what cost with the keets age would it be wise evaluate the situation as best as you can for now i'm sure you will know when the time is right good luck Hedgehog Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hypoglycemia Obesity Ferret Guinea pig Hamster Chicken Breastfeeding Nutrition Fancy rat Dieting Cancer Domestic rabbit Milk Stomach cancer Acorn Colorectal cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Dog Vegetarianism Coronary heart disease Cirrhosis Domesticated turkey Garfield Tocopherol Growth hormone Budgerigar Genetically modified food Egg (food) Tasmanian Devil Weight training Vitamin Cat Adjustable gastric band Insulin Shrimp farm Fasting Sorghum Protein-energy malnutrition Famine Bodybuilding Biological pest control Liver Raw food diet Maize Foie gras Bread Organic farming Folic acid Orca Veganism Aspartame Sesame Street Mosquito Salmon Capercaillie Apple 613 mitzvot Puberty Cystic fibrosis Epilepsy Lung cancer Bat Pneumonia Multiple sclerosis Metastasis Stroke Coeliac disease Glycogen storage disease type I Fecal incontinence Cardiovascular disease Tooth enamel Vegetarian nutrition Hepatitis Taboo food and drink Koala Crohn's disease Pet skunk Healthy eating Cholesterol Growth hormone treatment Rice Kashrut Fugu Bird migration Honeybee Hypertension Breast cancer Weight loss Brown Bear
