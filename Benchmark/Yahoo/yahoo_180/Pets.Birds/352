i want a bird i want a bird that will follow me and not fly away and that will become a best friend to me do you have any idea for a bird that will be easy to train p s i would perfure a little bird but a big one will work too p p s plus can you give me some tips on how to train it if this is your first bird you won't want a larger parrot heads up birds are noisey the bigger the louder usually although conures are loud and they aren't big messy food water and poop all over destructive antique wood furniture say bye bye and even the little guys can be loud at times what they lack in volume they make up for by doing it all the time they require about an hour a day out of the cage on average unless you want a screaming feather plucking biting crazy bird if you are still sure you want a bird then i'd say a cockatiel they are friendly and love to ride on your shoulder but all birds can fly and if a window is open they will fly away and you may not get them back it's not like a dog a bird can become your best friend although it will take awhile for you and the bird to bond birds are fun because unlike dogs they don't always have the will to please they are so full of personality say come and they be like to you ha and go right back to playing it's very much like having a toddler for at least years they never do what you want them to do when you want them to do it so if you aren't at all intimidated by any of those facts a tiel could be for you but you will have to do a lto of research you can't start any training until the bird settles in but the first thing you teach is step up and step down most birds learn very quickly you just go to get them to get on your hand and say step up and when they get on your hand then you praise them do this for about minutes a day and during the day ask your bird to do ti while your playing be consistant and then once he knows step up teach step down just go up to his play stand or cage and say step down when he gets of your hand praise him birds respond well to praise the best way to train is to ignore bad behavior and use little disicpline and lots more praise praise the good and ignore the bad except biting that should be disciplined once they know step up and step down they will be more handable and after that you can teach them to turn around on commadn fly to you on command roll over fetch car keys and even learn to count they may not be able to talk but my tiel was in the process of learning to use peg thing with little rings i would say blue rings and he would actually start to get blue rings on the peg they are soo smart give them lots of toys to detroy and explore but udnerstand training any trick will take lots and lots of patience for you if your bird doesn't get it move on to something else no reason to get him all upset Dog training RuneScape quests Aerial (dance move) Hamster Shaggy dog story Dog Theory of conduct Garfield Social rule Piccolo Junior Saga Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Harp Time Out of Mind Bird Humphrey Bogart Violin Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Blonde on Blonde Tai shogi The Shining (film) German grammar Swingout Taikyoku shogi Falconry Obedience training Double bass Paragliding W.
