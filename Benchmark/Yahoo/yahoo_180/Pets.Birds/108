can someone help i started raising turkeys this year they do well up to wks and then start dying off they are getting something from the ground mainly when it rains their pens are covered from the rain but water stills runs thru pens i am now putting down plenty of pine shavings to help with sanitary concerns i just don't have any way to keep off the ground when they get over wks old getting something from when it rains sounds like botulism or salmonella they'll spend a day or more looking drunk and then die until you actually remove the organism the problem will keep popping up take all the animals out of the pens while you use some stall cleaner to clean up their area a concrete floor will cut way down on the problem and is easy to install just get some quick crete and pour it on the floor of the pens then smooth it with a flat shovel nothing perfect just something to separate your birds from the water coming in with or without the quick crete floors you can put down some wood ash from a fire place or bonfire pit or you can just buy the all natural wood coal five bucks a bag and crush it up pour this evenly over the floors and it'll help neutralize the droppings which the organisms feed on never use stall cleaner on a dirt floor if you've just got a dirt floor and you can't put in concrete then use a mix of one half cup bleach with a gallon of water and soak the area this will cut down on bacteria build up it takes months to clear up a bad infection and while you wait you may want to get the terramycin poultry powder for your birds follow the directions closely i personally use the terramycin livestock pills as they are extra strength and can be cut up in a pill cutter for correct dosing where as you can't accurately dose water where multiple birds will be drinking i don't raise turkeys i raise ducks but ducks go through the exact same thing we had a bout of salmonella early this spring due to some heavy rains and dirt floors we've been putting in concrete floors over the summer Mattress Dairy Wood Menstrual cup Basement Drill bit Tattoo Concrete Biological warfare Textile manufacturing Thermal power station Livestock Sewage treatment Coffee Domesticated turkey Casting Fossil fuel power plant H5N1 Japanese toilet Social rule Seismic retrofit Kitchen Skateboarding trick Barbecue Poker jargon Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Professional wrestling match types Tofu Brewery Diseases of the honeybee Guinea pig Marine aquarium Apollo 8 Campfire Gramophone record Gypsy moth GunZ The Duel Coal Fancy rat Chopsticks Vacuum cleaner Fire fighting Egg (food) Tooth enamel Trench warfare Fecal incontinence M16 (rifle) Violin Fast bowling Carburetor Baptism Soap Atlanta metropolitan area Indianapolis 500 Hemp RuneScape quests Illegal drug trade Idli Sento Japanese tea ceremony Tobacco Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II Time Out of Mind Logging Psoriasis Escherichia coli O157:H7 Ionizing radiation Diarrhea Nuclear fallout Domestic rabbit Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Diving Upholstery Factory farming Vinegar Autonomous building Urinary incontinence Fire extinguisher Tea Water purification Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Pottery Water Battle of Kursk Pok__mon Abilities Fountain Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Second Battle of the Atlantic Shotgun West Side Highway
