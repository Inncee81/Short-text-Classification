of all pets are any animals more restricted and imprisoned than birds held in cages fish are allowed to swim in their tanks as restricted as they are dogs and cats have a fair amount of freedom but holding a bird in a small cage like most pet birds are is a different story birds in the wild can soar on wing at their choosing and to keep them in a home in small cages is an abomination think about it would you like to be kept in a box never allowed to walk or run or even frolic in any way some people have just bird so it would be you all alone in your box doesn't the saying free as a bird mean anything to you bird owners obviously i'm speaking about people who keep birds in tiny cages inside their homes what a horrible life for a bird john p if you bothered to inform yourself instead of making comments about a subject of which you obviously know absolutely nothing if you bothered to read my post you'd know i wasn't talking about those people your defensive protest makes me wonder if you're doing it out of guilt would you ever let a domesticated bird out in the wild to die i would never have one to begin with do you ever look at the sky and see a bird flying your bird will never have that freedom you might offer better conditions than most but it's still unfair i'll repost this portion of my original post as all of you have ignored it obviously i'm speaking about people who keep birds in tiny cages inside their homes instead of accusing me of generalizing and such understand that i'm talking about people who keep birds in small cages where they can't fly at will if you keep your bird in a cage it should be open at all times except for company and such or you're imprisoning the bird you can defend doing it all you want but it doesn't change the fact that you deprive your pet of even a remotely natural existence do you know wwy your bird seems happy around you it's all that it has btw anyone who has just bird is an offender on a deeper level no matter what you think your bird is lonely you don't compensate for that there's no birds in the wild out seeking human companionship in general i agree that's why my parrots cage is always open and he can roam as he pleases Theory of conduct The Amber Spyglass Public domain Ferret Slander and libel Hamster Pet Garfield Sinfest Bird Salad Fingers Fancy rat Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Original sin European Convention on Human Rights Aladdin (1992 film) Burrhus Frederic Skinner RuneScape quests Kosher foods Livestock Theodicy John Cage Poker jargon American individualist anarchism Philosophy of language Freedom of speech H5N1 Feral cat Pet skunk Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) House Chicken Surveillance Zoophilia Social justice Liberal Democrats (UK) The Human Stain Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong GNU General Public License God Emperor of Dune Domestication Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Mealy Parrot Goodness and value theory Scientology beliefs and practices Vietnam War Professional wrestling match types Canary German grammar Dog training Mumia Abu-Jamal Capitalism Snoopy Taikyoku shogi Seabird Hunting Jury trial Species Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Prior restraint Kakapo Gaia Online Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Yoko Ono RuneScape locations The Death Gate Cycle Falconry Abortion debate Sant Thakar Singh Donkey Kong's Animal Buddies Reality Sin City Plame affair Albatross Energy development Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Schapelle Corby Sleep Bat Fish farming Dog agility Criticisms of Christianity Scenes from a Memory Zoo Pet store Ward Churchill The Raven Rudolf Steiner African Grey Parrot City of Heroes Shaggy dog story
