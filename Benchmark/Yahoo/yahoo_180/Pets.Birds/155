how do i stop my parrot from biting i have a red lored amazon who is approx y o who was my fathers but he past away years ago the bird used to never let anyone one else pet him but my father now he has bonded with me very very well however the bird chases my mother around the house and when he can will bite her my mother has never been able to pet hold or go near him w o risking getting bit i dont know if it helps but my mother used to have to hold him down and give him injections in his chest when he was a baby do to being sick and he doesnt like anyone else but me no friends relatives no one he just trys to bite how do i fix this i just wish my mother could enjoy the parrot as much as i do with out being bit to tell the truth it's going to take a lot of work before this bird will accept your mom i never clip my own birds' wings or nails because though i can do it they start to see me as the bad guy you mom is the bad guy now and he may never cuddle with or love her but he will learn to be nice you need to be the one telling him what to do he wont care if your mom disciplines him because he doesn't care about her he wants your affection so whenever he chases her have her wear boots or something so he can't bite her hard just go up to him pinch his beak look into his eyes and say no and put him in his cage no cover when he realizes that it makes you unhappy when he chases your mom he'll stop also your mom shouldn't run away from him this makes it into a game and will make him do it more often it also tells him that he is above your mom in the pecking order hope this helps you can also check out http www cockatootrainer com biting Pok__mon Live!
