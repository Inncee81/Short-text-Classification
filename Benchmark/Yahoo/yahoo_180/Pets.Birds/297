my parrot masturbates does anyone else's yeah my parrot rubs his rear against a branch like perch i have in the cage he does it nonstop and im starting to think something is wrong with him i know his genitalia are located under that wing so im just wondering basically if anyone else has a horny bird thanks for the answers so far but i dont think its mites or anything like that when he does it he sticks his tail straight up in the air and makes the most ridiculous noise and moves himself slowly up and down hes done similar things when i was petting his tail and lower body so i highly doubt its anything other than for pleasure i just dont know if its normal yeah he must have an overactive sexdrive he does it literally for hours on end he ll keep going for maybe minutes then rest for a bit get some water get some food then go back to it im considering getting him a female i have heard of parrots doing this to certain toys they like or their owner's arm and they are certainly getting it on it could be that or might it be at all possible that your bird has mites or worms or something else worm it at nighttime shine a torch in the cage and see if there are tiny red bugs running from the light mites it could be that he's humping the perch or that it may be something else edit just read your additional notes sounds like a horny bird lol touching his back and tail can be seen as sexual to him so can touching the vent area and beak wrestling it's not something i would neccasarily reccomend though because sometimes birds that do that can turn very aggressive towards anyone else and be possessive of you or possibly even harming yourself but yes it is pretty normal Chicken Fancy rat Mealy Parrot Cat Bird African Grey Parrot Equine conformation Professional wrestling match types Salad Fingers Human sexual behavior Canary Sexual dimorphism Masturbation Animal communication Strap-on dildo Dog agility Capercaillie Professional wrestling throws Fauna of Australia Hamster John Cage Unreal Treehouse of Horror V Mitsubishi 3000GT Wheel of Fortune Dead Parrot Platypus M16 (rifle) Parrot The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Skateboarding trick Kakapo 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Tag Ferret Professional wrestling attacks Characters of Naruto Sesshomaru 2000 Australian Grand Prix Blood on the Tracks Pet skunk Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Tetrapod Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Puberty P-38 Lightning Sant Thakar Singh Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an European Nightjar Gray Wolf Snooker The Legend of Zelda series enemies Paraphilia The Shining (film) Penis Gesture Oral sex Gramophone record Creatures in Bionicle Sea-Monkey Sinfest 24 Hours of Le Mans Leopard Aerial (dance move) Animal Chinchilla Biological pest control Social rule Ancient Macedonian language RuneScape quests Mosquito Condom Naruto jutsu Bladderwort Laserdisc Wood carving Internal ballistics Domestic rabbit Toilet humour Devil Fruit Child sexuality Snake Joke Falconry Nile crocodile Water polo Mario Saturday Night Live Mouse (computing) Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Octopus Simone Weil Swingout House of M Garfield
