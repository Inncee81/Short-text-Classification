cockateil question i was at the pet store the other day when i saw this white spotted cockatiel but the people that worked there failed to tell me exactly what kind of cockatiel she was x she was white with small brown spots at the end of each feather not dark brown but more towards tan does anyone know what kinds she is i really want to by her but i want to know what kind of bird she is first while i'm at it what are good measurments for a cockatiels cage also what kinds of food besids bird food do they eat to most need a cage mate if so how many and that's all i'm done thankies it sounds like you are looking at a pearl cockatiel these are lovely birds well you cannot get too big with cage space but a good general size is about x inches and feet tall that's big enough for a bird or even and still have lots of room for toys and perches food should include a good pellet food plus fruits and veggies fresh dried or cooked and a small amount of seeds cooked pasta is a favorite as is a little cheese or cooked meat my birds actually like lukewarm soup do not give chocolate coffee or avocado these are poisonous to cockatiels if you get it a cage mate it will likely bond to the other bird instead of you this means it will be less friendly to you as long as you spends time with it every day your cockatiel should not need a cage mate good luck Hamster Guinea pig Fancy rat Cuisine of Denmark German cuisine Cockatiel Breakfast Mealy Parrot Potato Domestic rabbit French cuisine MRE Capercaillie Cuisine of the Philippines Cuisine of Brazil Cantonese cuisine Chicken Polish cuisine Pasta Canary Hamburger Bird Food In-N-Out Burger Hot dog Cuisine of Africa Food preservation Vitamin C Cuisine of Argentina Ostrich Cuisine of Singapore Cajun cuisine Sausage John Cage One Piece minor characters Meal Cuisine of Malaysia RuneScape quests Tofu Chinese food therapy Chili con carne Ramen Dumpling Ferret Cuisine of Laos Fecal incontinence Jewish cuisine Garfield Banana Peafowl Chinchilla Common bean Comanche Acorn Korean cuisine Chocolate Foodborne illness British cuisine Taboo food and drink Shark RuneScape locations Kakapo Avocado Chile pepper Coconut crab McDonald's Tomato Pysanka Chinese cuisine Fruit Shotgun Cha chaan teng Maize Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown) Cigar Egg (food) Cuisine of the Southern United States Chicken soup Rainbow Bee-eater Kashrut Bengali cuisine Bean Genericized trademark Bread Rice Kitchen Minestrone Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Snack food Japanese tea ceremony Kosher foods Dragons (Pern) Fugu Pet
