should i get a friend for my parakeet her mate is gone and she's never been an only bird before she's only years old but i have no idea about her mate's age though it was much older i don't know what happened to her mate so how long should i wait before getting a new mate for her to make sure she is still healthy if you really want to get her another friend them wait at least weeks and get her checked by a vet to ensure what killed the other bird is not contagious when you get a new bird do not just put it straight in the cage with your original one place it in a separate cage next to the other bird and give them time to get to know one another first once they have become accustomed to one another and you want to place them both in together you will need to reaarange the cage you are going to use so it is like a new one to both birds change the position of the perches and add different toys and place feed containers at different places this gives both birds the same level in the pecking order if you just put a new bird in to the old birds cage then the old bird is dominant over it and will act accordingly if the cage is new to both then it reduces the chance of one being overly bossy monitor their interaction closely for for the first few days to ensure they get along and neither harms the other i have used this method many times and it works extremely well Hamster John Cage Chicken Poker jargon Ferret Guinea pig Mealy Parrot Airport Spider Canary Falconry Animal communication Wa shogi CPU cache Debugging Extinction Bird Dog Trapping Sea-Monkey RuneScape quests Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Professional wrestling match types Species Social rule Hall & Oates Dairy Theory of conduct Chess strategy and tactics Mixed martial arts Tai shogi Dai dai shogi Equine conformation Prostate cancer Mosquito Kakapo Betting (poker) Seabird Elections in the United States Chess terminology Housebreaking Breastfeeding Taikyoku shogi Consensus decision-making Diseases of the honeybee Biological pest control Champagne (beverage) Earthworm Royal Assent Tori shogi Shogi Lung Condom Electrophysiology Team Fortress Classic Yerba mate Influenza Judkins shogi Fox hunting Zone of the Enders: The Fist of Mars Carolina Parakeet Bird migration Chess opening Maka dai dai shogi Ivory-billed Woodpecker Jon Secada The Menagerie Kangaroo Gray Wolf Vitamin C Publication of Darwin's theory Humpback Whale Elections in the United Kingdom CPU design Garfield Sexual dimorphism The Emancipation of Mimi The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Cockfight Surveillance Fancy rat Tasmanian Devil Orca Remix Sesame Street The Incredibles Venezuelan recall referendum, 2004 Shotgun Billboard Hot 100 Magic (illusion) Albatross RuneScape weapons Domestic rabbit Boxing Microshogi Tenjiku shogi Shaggy dog story Budgerigar
