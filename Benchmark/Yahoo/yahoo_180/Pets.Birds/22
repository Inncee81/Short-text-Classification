why does a rooster crow at dawn we have a rooster near us that goes off at just about anytime of the day or night is this normal like all birds roosters sing or crow as the case may be in a daily cycle almost all animals have daily cycles of activity known as circadian rhythms a rooster crows because he has an internal clock that helps him anticipate sunrise that way he knows when to begin his daily hunt for food and defense of his territory but if one rooster in the neighbor has an internal clock that s set a little early he can stimulate other roosters to crow early too the rooster s sunrise song is actually a way of establishing his territory when a rooster crows he s sending a signal to other roosters that if they trespass they re asking for a fight a rooster will often crow from a vantage point above his territory so he can make others more aware of his presence and so that his songs travel farther often nightlights floodlights or other artificial lighting will throw off the animals natural rhythm and he will crow when it is not daylight dawn yet Chicken Circadian rhythm Cock (chicken) Sleep Day Daylight saving time Cockfight Sheryl Crow Insomnia Stage lighting Crime prevention through environmental design Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography USS Tunny (SS-282) Alice in Chains Delayed sleep phase syndrome Biorhythm Chinese astrology Navigation Canonical hours Twilight Solar eclipse Millennium Group Chinese calendar Hunting Japanese New Year Australian rules football Drosophila melanogaster Europe Gospel music Suprachiasmatic nucleus Julian day Urinary incontinence Journey (band) Menstrual cycle Softball South Australian National Football League Time dilation Onomatopoeia The Vile Village Fertility awareness Atomic clock South Sydney Rabbitohs Doo-wop Capoeira Melatonin Sundial Jazz Time signal Time American popular music Capercaillie Denizli Province Mike the Headless Chicken NRBQ Birth control Siesta Cardiac arrhythmia Atlanta Campaign Sioux Uprising Sunset Intellectual history of time Legend of Zelda series songs Clock Ecco the Dolphin Cat Hiking Music video Eye Light pollution Vehicular cycling Progressive rock Native American music Tlingit Gallium Breastfeeding Honeybee Howlin' Wolf Estrus cycle Genesis (band) Haibane Renmei Vitamin C Earthworm Timekeeping on Mars Animal communication Nutrition Central processing unit Solar time Chronobiology Victorian Football League Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Harry Nilsson James Brown (musician) Music history of the United States Cray-1 Rush (band) Aliasing Artificial pacemaker Time zone Toledo Strip
