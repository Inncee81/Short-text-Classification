rainbow lorikeets and cockatiels can these share an aviary and breed or would they need to be housed separately ok apart from feeding requirements which wouldnt' be a problem as they would be fed separate diets can they live together in peace lol never in my wildest dreams did i consider breeding a tiel with a lorikeet omg some ppl go to extremes i shall extend the information i have a breeding pair of cockatiels yes one female and one male cockatiel who are a couple and a breeding pair of rainbow lorikeets one male and one female lorikeet who are a couple might i add i have had indian ringnecks cockatiels and budgies all in the same aviary and i never saw them try and breed with the other species lol the last two answers i read this morning really got me laughing sigh taught me to spell out exactly what i mean in future though are people really that dumb there is absolutely no chance whatsoever that these two species would cross breed that would be like trying to breed a chicken and a duck it just aint gonna happen provided that the pairs in question aren't overly aggressive or territorial you shouldn't have a problem but my lories love a bit of bird seed so you will probably have to provide extra seed in order for your tiels to get enough to eat and i would provide double the number of nest boxes that you have pairs i have had lories that raid the nest boxes of other pairs and kill the chicks Bird Chicken Cockatiel Hamster Rainbow Lorikeet Kakapo Seabird Species Peregrine Falcon Domestic rabbit Bird migration Scaly-breasted Lorikeet Sibley-Monroe checklist 4 Emu Spider Kea Platypus Non-human animal sexuality Albatross Mallard Ant Redundant array of independent disks Cat Capercaillie Lorikeet Mountain Gorilla Red Squirrel Psittaciformes Nest box House Sparrow Animal communication Mosquito CPU cache Domesticated turkey Guinea pig Budgerigar House Mouse Canary Livestock Ostrich Northern Pintail Domestication Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Agriculture Red-necked Phalarope Unified Modeling Language Rhea (bird) Gray Wolf Contract bridge Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Leatherback Sea Turtle Quotation mark Ruff Minor Harry Potter Beasts Northern Shoveler Ivory-billed Woodpecker Hunting Egg (food) Shaggy dog story Brolga Common Raven Zerg Bobwhite Quail AFI 100 Years series Musk Duck Ferret Red-winged Blackbird Beetle Wilson's Phalarope Red Phalarope Bald Eagle Bird ringing Africanized bee Acorn Osprey The Cure Whose Line Is It Anyway?
