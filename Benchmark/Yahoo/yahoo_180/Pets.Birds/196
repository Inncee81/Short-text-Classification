help needed to tame cockatiels i have cockatiels a male and a female both approx months old i knew that getting two would mean they were less tame but i didn't want one to be on it's own at first i could get them on my hand but since having to towel them to get them back in the cage they seem to have lost their trust in me and now won't come near me at all they are in a very large parrot cage but i still want to be able to take them out for exercise would adding another bird a hand fed one be a really bad idea any suggestions they are petrified of me one won't even take millet their favourite through the cage bars from me they seem to take their cues from each other one freaks the other out etc thought that if they see a calmer bird being handled they might copy realise that being handled is ok hi your problem is not uncommon you have lost your birds trust by as you say towelling them can i suggest that you first gain their confidence by not attempting to go near the cage for a few days what i mean is don't stand over them give them time to see that you are no longer a threat then leave their cage door open if they come out then let them find their own way back this will happen when they become hungry and the cage is their only source of food don't offer any inducement at this time if they are hungry they will find their way in place a sprig of millet spray in the door way and hopefully this will entice them into the cage when they go into the cage don't rush to close the door just leave it till they settle down then gently close it you have to gain their trust again and it is of no use trying to rush this be patient and you will gain their trust again it will take time but you will get there Hamster Cockatiel Professional wrestling match types Plame affair Trapping Domestic rabbit Mixed martial arts Menstrual cup Kasparov versus The World Social rule Kakapo RuneScape quests Steel Cage Match Mealy Parrot Jason Reso Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Salad Fingers Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Shaggy dog story Parrot Obesity Sento Romulus and Remus Ruy Lopez Montreal Screwjob Bird House Mouse NWo The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Boom Town (Doctor Who) Falconry Ferret Breastfeeding Magic (illusion) Seabird The Ersatz Elevator Muslim ibn Aqeel Antenna (radio) Albatross Colony in Space Customs and etiquette of Japan Wolfrider Jean Grey Breath of Fire III Humphrey Bogart Saruman Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Equine conformation Second Battle of the Atlantic Shifting cultivation National Kidney Foundation Singapore Sola fide Fire fighting Tour de France Ron and Fez Chinchilla Chicken Champagne (beverage) Super Bowl XIV The Contender (television series) Fancy rat Common cold Punt (boat) Ashton-Tate 2005 English cricket season Douglas Adams Atkins Nutritional Approach M16 (rifle) Johnny Cage Garfield Sydney Riot of 1879 Conspiracy (TNG episode) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Doctor Dances One Tree Hill (TV series) Electrophysiology RuneScape Random Events Canary StarCraft: Uprising Ric Flair Futurama (TV series - season 2) The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy 1957 World Series Emu Time travel Eddie Guerrero The Ark in Space The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Airport Textile manufacturing Journey (band) Sub-Zero Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Asthma Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Charles Darwin's illness Paul Wight
