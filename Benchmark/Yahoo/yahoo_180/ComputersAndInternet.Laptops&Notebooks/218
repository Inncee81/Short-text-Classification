pc or mac looking at getting a macbook pro soon just curious as to know what people thought make your points known if you see yourself as an individual get a mac if you prefer to follow the crowd get a pc you can run windows software on your mac although why you'd want to is beyond me admittedly there aren't many games but that should only bother the kiddies i switched to mac years ago after having had pcs for a few years and i have never not once regretted it the os is far more stable you don't need to worry about viruses and at the end of the day when i've shut it down it still looks fabulous on my desk the reason i think that the whole thing just works is that the software on a mac appears to be designed to work together and it is largely very intuitive to master not only that most of the applications mask very powerful software with an easy to use and attractive interface i think flattery is the highest form of compliment and if you take one look at ms windows vista you'll see what i'm talking about the only difference is that vista is out dated and rubbish as for price people say macs are expensive but i just helped a friend buy a computer we looked at dell and what started off as a system ended up costing nearly by the time we had added all the basic gear and software that was missing for a couple of quid more she got an awesome stunning imac intel ghz with everything she needed built in Mac OS X Apple Macintosh IMac IBM PC compatible Microsoft Windows Windows Vista NeXT History of the graphical user interface Windows XP Timeline of computing 1990-forward Microsoft Office Floppy disk OpenGL History of Microsoft Windows Computer virus Apple Intel transition Apple II family PowerPC Mac OS X v10.4 Operating system Linux X Window System AmigaOS Computer workstation Perl Amiga Mac OS Windows 2000 CPU design Microsoft MAME Personal computer Blue screen of death HyperCard Atari ST Mouse (computing) RISC System 7 (Macintosh) 64-bit IPod CPU cache Mozilla Firefox Computer Konfabulator Common Unix Printing System Microprocessor Wi-Fi Mac OS X v10.2 Supercomputer Mach kernel Radeon Pocket PC Server Linux distribution Stardock PlayStation 3 ATI Technologies Mac OS history Hard disk Atari 8-bit family Thread (computer science) Windows Server 2003 Ethernet Commodore International Apple IIGS Objective-C Mainframe computer MIPS architecture AMD Macintosh Finder Common criticisms of Microsoft Laptop Computer and video games Library (computer science) Digital rights management Timeline of computing Redundant array of independent disks FoxTrot Mac OS 8 Kernel (computer science) PowerBook Oscilloscope CP/M Embedded system OS/2 USB flash drive Peer-to-peer WordPerfect Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Python programming language File system Screenshot Digital audio workstation Unicode Linux kernel
