do laptop cooling pads really work i am thinking about buying a cooling pad for my laptop can anybody tell me if they are effective in doing what they are supposed to do and is there any difference between the usb type and the ac dc type any moving air current will transfer some heat from the laptop which is always a good thing key point is where is the hot spot on the pc i have running at the moment and on checking the toshiba's base is completely cool as heat is being vented out of the side left hand keys on the other hand no pun are warm to the touch using a cooling pad would not therefore make a great deal of difference the dell however is noticeably warm underneath indicating that a lot of heat transfer is taking place between the components and the case a cooling pad here would help reduce internal temperatures by speeding up the heat transfer on the question of usb v mains as others have pointed out usb will allow you to cool on the move but will reduce battery life whilst a c will be more efficient and extend the battery however it follows that if you are able to plug in your cooling pad you can also plug in your laptop so any situation in which you could use a mains unit would also allow you to use a usb unit without using the battery at all i would therefore go with the usb version to give you more usability Laptop Motor oil IBM PC compatible Heat Solar power Thermostat Lithium ion battery Hard disk Internal combustion engine Computer cooling Bluetooth Thermal power station USB flash drive Engine cooling Floppy disk Stirling engine Energy Mouse (computing) Spacecraft propulsion Battery electric vehicle Nuclear reactor Air conditioning Ocean thermal energy conversion IPod Overclocking Secure Digital card DVD Tank Carburetor Computer bus Toyota Prius Fire fighting Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Jet engine Tire Terraforming Battery (electricity) Soldering Wind Windows XP Energy development Lighting Transistor Apple Macintosh Renewable energy Autonomous building Vacuum tube Welding PlayStation Portable Diode Ford Ranger EV Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Casting Computer forensics Desktop computer IBook Peltier-Seebeck effect Explosive material Creative Zen Sun Two-stroke cycle Closed-circuit television Global warming FireWire Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Gas metal arc welding Flash memory Diesel engine Turbocharger Plutonium Swamp cooler HVAC Convection Digital photography Water (molecule) Central processing unit One-time pad Transformer Digital audio player Hyperthermia Heat pump Urban heat island Upholstery Incandescent light bulb Cheating in Counter-Strike Nuclear power Windows 2000 Xbox 360 National Weather Service Heat exchanger Strap-on dildo Scramjet
