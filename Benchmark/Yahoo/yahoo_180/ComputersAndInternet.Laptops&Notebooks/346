if you already have your laptop what is the least expensive wifi internet connection i have dial up desktop service now and it's so cheap i'm spoiled as per colinic's post you have a misconception that wifi can be subscribed like dialup well it can be provided you live in an area that has it in general internet service providers isps sell types of internet access to home users dialup and broadband dialup is what you are using currently broadband can be either adsl dsl or cable if you live in an area with wifi coverage then you can also subscribe to wifi access if you have wifi coverage at home you can subscribe to that but it wont be very cheap i assume your laptop has wifi capability but if not getting a wifi pcmcia card is not an expensive issue these days if you dont have wifi coverage at home then you will need to subscribe to broadband with your isp and also buy a wifi broadband router if it does not come free with your internet broadband subscription wireless is not worth it to run from your existing dialup connection although it can also be done and will be costly your laptop as usual will need to have wifi capability or else plug in a wifi pcmcia card finally you will need to configure your wifi router and your wifi on your laptop to communicate with each other and then you are set to go 'portable' within your own home Internet service provider Voice over IP Wireless LAN WiMAX Hotspot (wifi) Dial-up access Cable television Laptop Eircom Telephone Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Telstra Telegraphy Broadband Wireless community network GSM services Modem Power line communication Digital divide Asynchronous Transfer Mode Television Global System for Mobile Communications Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection PlayStation 2 Bluetooth BT Group plc Xbox Windows XP Integrated Services Digital Network Differentiated services Telkom Router Universal Serial Bus Ethernet StarHub IBM PC compatible Desktop computer Cable modem Floppy disk UK telephone numbering plan Q-Telecom Telecom New Zealand HomePNA Communications satellite Skype Verizon Wireless America Online Apple Macintosh Pirate decryption Etisalat NTL Hard disk Nintendo DS Grand Haven, Michigan IBook Local area network Chorus Communications Tesco Computer IP Multimedia Subsystem Windows Vista Password Wireless Usenet Network address translation Private branch exchange Alcatel Mobile phone Dialer AT&T Denial-of-service attack Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Computer bus Telephone exchange IPTV USB flash drive Quality of service North American Numbering Plan Sega Dreamcast Virtual private network MSN TV Computer hardware
