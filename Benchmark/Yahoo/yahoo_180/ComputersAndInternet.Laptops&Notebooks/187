is my laptop battery dead or is it the ac adapter i have had my comp for about years i had a generic type of ac adapter i bought for my computer since my cat chewed though the last one it lasted for a good amount of time but last month or so it wasn't charging very well i tried jiggling it around and it would work again or take it out and put it back in that stopped working it didnt seem to work anymore so i bought a new one this is another generic type of one i plugged it in to my computer and it showed it was charging but when i turned on the computer it turned off quickly and said there was no juice i tried taking the battery out and plugging the computer in to see if it was the battery like you would with a cell phone but it didn't turn on does anyone know if a laptop could run if no battery was in there but it was plugged into the wall how can i find out if it is the battery or the adapter yes the laptop can run with only the adapter plugged in and with no battery i've done this so many times on many different models maybe it would be helpful if you could tell the model of your laptop but since you say it is only years old i'm sure it can run with only the adapter plugged in try buying some more expensive generic ac adapter i've had many cases when people lost damaged their original ac adapters and bought a generic one of good quality and it worked fine enough as the original and yes as teef au mentioned you should check if the polarity and voltage is matched as your original adapter you must set your generic adapter exactly as it was on your original adapter or your adapter laptop could get damaged the voltage and polarity are usually printed on the original adapters Laptop Lithium ion battery IPod Toyota Prius Liquid crystal display IBM PC compatible Battery (electricity) Universal Serial Bus Atari ST Personal computer Volt Nickel-cadmium battery Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Game Boy Advance SP Electrophysiology Spark plug Battery electric vehicle Action potential PowerBook Digital photography Thermal power station Hybrid vehicle Hearing aid Circuit design Bicycle lighting AlphaSmart Membrane potential Oscilloscope Bluetooth Jumpstart 3rd Grade Atari 8-bit family Diode Vacuum tube IBM PC Windows XP ATI Technologies Jack plug Computer forensics Wind turbine Reading spark plugs for racing Read-only memory Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Nickel metal hydride Solar cell Strap-on dildo Operational amplifier Wi-Fi Lithium ion polymer battery CompactFlash Poker jargon Model aircraft Transistor Electricity meter Cruising (maritime) Light-emitting diode Oplan Bojinka Hybrid Synergy Drive Surveillance Sega Mac OS X Musical Instrument Digital Interface Radio controlled car Macintosh Portable GSM services Electroshock gun Ford Ranger EV Computer hardware Semiconductor device Pentium M John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Internet fraud Power supply MOS Technology Second Battle of the Atlantic Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma John Forsythe Johnny 5 Direct current Tooth enamel Multimedia Card Impedance Welding Embedded system Television PHP Computer Gas metal arc welding Torpedo Transformer Kaypro Radio controlled airplane Ignition system Antenna (radio) Internal combustion engine Floppy disk Rail transport modelling Jump start (vehicle)
