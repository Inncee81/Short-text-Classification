is toshiba a good choice for laptops i am in the market for a laptop and see that toshiba has pretty high ratings are their computers good better than hp i hear from some people that hps are junk i have a toshiba and it's very good they lots of extra memory and it comes with everything standard you'd probably get windows xp which is easier to operate than windows vista i think however you want to make sure that the battery is always charged because you can only get about hours of battery life assuming you don't play a movie you can have a burn drive and extensions if you have floppy disks Laptop IBM PC compatible Windows XP Atari ST Floppy disk Hard disk IPod Apple Macintosh Lithium ion battery USB flash drive Secure Digital card Flash memory DVD AmigaOS Redundant array of independent disks History of Microsoft Windows SmartMedia Digital audio player Sony Windows Vista Battery electric vehicle Blu-ray Disc Desknote Toshiba IBM PC Atari 8-bit family Timeline of computing 1990-forward Microsoft Windows Creative Zen TRS-80 Kaypro Oscilloscope File system IBM Apple II family IBook Binary prefix Macintosh Portable Commodore 64 Commodore International MS-DOS Personal computer Computer Apple Computer History of the graphical user interface DVD-RAM Amiga Memory card Computer virus Linux DOS Windows 3.x Amstrad CPC Universal Serial Bus File Allocation Table Mouse (computing) Computer bus System 7 (Macintosh) PlayStation Portable Computer forensics Digital photography Mac OS X Computer hardware Acorn Archimedes Multimedia Card Battery (electricity) Windows Server 2003 BBC Micro Booting Embedded system Lithium ion polymer battery Xerox Star NeXT Compact disc History of computing hardware (1960s-present) Original Amiga chipset MSX BIOS Wi-Fi CP/M PC Engine Windows 2000 MIPS architecture Blue screen of death Oplan Bojinka Bluetooth Computer storage Radeon Wintel IBM PCjr PlayStation 3 Xbox 360 Hydrogen economy MP3 Digital cinematography Advanced Technology Attachment LiveCD Zip drive
