how do i get my computer to load in 'safe mode' my laptop loads and then turns itself off before it gets to my desktop and then does exactly the same again and again it's pretty old now and i want to get a new one but i need to recover my files no they're not backed up how do i force it to let me load in safe mode and does anyone want to hazard a guess as to what's wrong with the bloody thing thanks to start your windows computer in safe mode start up or your computer and get ready to press the f key before the loading windows screen appears timing is everything so you may have to try a couple times as your computer is starting up occansionally press the f key don't hold it down or press it like crazy or the computer will assume the key is stuck down and ignore it you just need to press the f key after the bios screen which is usually a logo of the manufacturer who makes your computer and before the screen that says windows xp or windows vista with the blue or green bar filling across the bottom if you press f at the right time you will be prompted on how you would like to start your computer and two of your options will be safe mode with networking and safe mode without networking i always try with networking first since that will allow internet access if the system has problems starting reboot and try again without networking if you're having trouble getting the system to start in safe mode you can always use msconfig click start run type msconfig without the quotes and click ok then select diagnostic startup on the general tab and click ok after selecting diagnostic startup the next time you reboot the computer it will start up in the a mode very similar to safe mode with only the most basic services running once you're done fixing your computer though remember to run msconfig again and change it back to normal startup i wish you the best of luck in fixing your issue gl Windows XP Blue screen of death IBM PC compatible Windows 2000 AmigaOS Windows Vista History of Microsoft Windows Mouse (computing) Screenshot Windows 3.x Booting Microsoft Windows Hard disk Atari 8-bit family System 7 (Macintosh) X Window System Minesweeper (computer game) Mach kernel Computer virus Floppy disk Internet Relay Chat Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Commodore 64 Control-Alt-Delete Embedded system Password USB flash drive Emacs Laptop IPod Apple Macintosh Operating system Redundant array of independent disks System/36 Object Desktop Opera (web browser) Windows 95 Apple IIGS Common Unix Printing System Toyota Prius History of the graphical user interface 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines BIOS Modem Mac OS X NX bit Hello world program RISC NeXT Macromedia Flash Sun Microsystems Knoppix Ethernet MDAC Library (computer science) Bluetooth Computer security Amiga Palm OS Pretty Good Privacy OS/2 Btrieve X86 Dance Dance Revolution Control Panel (Windows) Java programming language Sonic the Hedgehog 2 PowerPC Computer Oscilloscope Architecture of Windows 2000 PlayStation Portable Database Novell NetWare CPU design Linux Windows registry Anchor Taskbar Wintel Google GSM services ITunes Atari ST Personal computer Amstrad CPC DESQview Pixel Keyboard layout ZX Spectrum IMac
