i have a question about notebook memory i upgraded my notebook memory i got the correct memory specificially designed for my notebook i installed it it seems to be working however when i go under my computer and check the properties under ram it still says which was my old ram any idea why the new memory didn't register itself try restarting the machine and bringing up the bios instead of booting normally check to see what it says about your memory if it doesn't see it either then you should try removing and reseating the memory module you can also try reversing the positions of the two modules if it turns out that your machine only sees one stick at a time then they may have incompatible characteristics Booting Laptop IBM PC compatible Windows XP Commodore 128 Atari 8-bit family Apple Macintosh Hard disk CPU cache Blue screen of death MSX Floppy disk Sinclair ZX81 Computer virus Apollo Guidance Computer BIOS USB flash drive Knoppix Commodore 64 Emulator Atari ST CDC 6600 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Virtual memory Windows 2000 TRS-80 Motorola 68000 Quantum computer ZX Spectrum PowerBook IMac Copy protection IA-32 History of Microsoft Windows C programming language Personal computer 64-bit Original Amiga chipset Commodore PET SAM Coup__ Data General Nova CPU design X86 Compiler optimization Debugging INMOS Transputer Upper Memory Area PlayStation 2 IBM PC Flash memory Nintendo Entertainment System Super Nintendo Entertainment System IBM 1620 Tandem Computers Embedded system System 7 (Macintosh) OS-9 Assembly language Central processing unit Texas Instruments TI-99/4A PC Engine Magnetic core memory Acorn Archimedes Acorn Electron Halting problem Modchip File Allocation Table Common Unix Printing System Random access memory Cray-1 AmigaOS Commodore Plus/4 Burroughs B5000 System/360 Library (computer science) Nintendo GameCube Calculator Apple II family RISC Windows Server 2003 PowerPC TRS-80 Color Computer System/36 Kernel (computer science) IBook Ethernet Fritz-chip Advanced Technology Attachment IBM 700/7000 series CDC 8600 Word (computer science) Computer Cray-2 Redundant array of independent disks Memory (computers) Front side bus The Sims 2 L4 microkernel family IBM Personal System/2
