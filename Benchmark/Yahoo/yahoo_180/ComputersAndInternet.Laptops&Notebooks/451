laptop without a system restore disc is this normal should i take it back i asked a question similar to this about a backup disc but i guess my parents misunderstood when they went to buy the laptop it's actually a system restore recovery disc so i thought i'd re ask the question just bought a new laptop and it doesn't come with a system restore disc this seems odd to me as most computers i buy come with windows restore discs does vista usually not come w one this is my first vista computer anyway the store wants to make one we haven't opened the box yet my father said the store bestbuy which is usually reliable had a big clearance sale and a lot of the employees were acting funny selling hard like they were cars salesmen telling him they'd take it out of the box to see if it works even though there's a restock fee if box is opened pushing a mouse laptop cover etc should we just take the laptop back or give the for restore disc many laptops and desktops these days are shipped out with what is known as a recovery partition it is functionally the same as the restore disks just that the image is saved to a hidden partition on the hard drive read the users manual and there will be details on how to access this partition and create your own restore cd's for backup in case the hard drive ever fails the salesmen were probably just being pushed by their supervisors to get the machines out to make room for new models they would not charge you a restocking fee for opening it in the store in fact they open the boxes all the time to install software such as antivirus and antispyware programs in the geek squad setup offers they have after they are done they put a sticker over the opening that clearly outlines the restocking fee policy and you are only charged the restocking fee if you break that sticker Hard disk Laptop Floppy disk Windows Vista Backup Redundant array of independent disks Computer virus Best Buy Apple Macintosh AmigaOS Computer USB flash drive Copy protection Amstrad CPC Atari ST Knoppix PlayStation 2 IPod MAME History of Microsoft Windows Object Desktop Sega Saturn Visual Basic Atari 8-bit family File Allocation Table Personal computer NeXT NTFS Sega Dreamcast Computer hardware IBook Digital rights management Commodore 64 Spyware Apple II family Universal Serial Bus Public-key cryptography Software testing File system SUSE Linux Enterprise content management Surveillance Apple Computer Bluetooth Disk cloning Mac OS X Macintosh Finder Stardock Partition (computing) Booting PowerBook Blu-ray Disc Xbox PlayStation Portable Embedded system IBM PC Wi-Fi OpenGL Desktop computer CPU design Microsoft Windows X Window System Acorn Archimedes Automatic teller machine Virtual memory Amiga Microsoft TRS-80 Pretty Good Privacy 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Disc jockey ITunes Timeline of computing 1990-forward Kaypro Operating system Computer security System/36 America Online Commodore International BIOS Disk image Cache Neopets The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) MySQL TiVo Modchip
