hp pavillion tx vs macbook i have been a pc user for a few years and was planning on buying my first pc laptop but then i came across the new macbooks because of my budget i would have to get a very inexpensive laptop so would the mac or the pc be better choose for me i was looking for the following things in a laptop light mobile good for surfing the web and running basic programs reliable low maintenence okay graphics okay amount of memory and i also wanted to know if everyone else in my family had a pc would i still be able to send them pictures and things like that it's a matter of personal taste which you would prefer a mac or a pc nowadays a mac can run windows natively by using 'boot camp' which is a download from the internet that allows the mac to switch boot between windows and mac osx it's one of the better options for people who don't like windows too much and the constant need for 'cleaning' and maintaining their pc because of the constant threat of viruses and spyware too common on windows machines as with exchange of files that go on the internet like bmp tiff and mp these should be okay as they're supported if it's pc programs that are only available on a pc but not a mac then you'll have difficulty but as i said you can run them under bootcamp and these files can still be exchanged whilst in pc mode note the pc running on the mac intel machines run natively and are not virtual programs so the performance is exactly like a pc machine there is also another way to run pc on a mac using the program from connectix which is called 'parallels' that enable you to run both windows and mac at the same time however the mac and pc will share the ram and harddrive so will run a bit slower the pc will run under emulation but you're looking for an inexpensive laptop on a budget which might rule you out for a mac sorry Mac OS X Windows XP Linux Microsoft Windows Computer virus Apple Macintosh IBM PC compatible Windows 2000 Hard disk AmigaOS Laptop Computer History of Microsoft Windows System 7 (Macintosh) Windows Vista Apple Intel transition Windows 3.x X Window System Apple II family Operating system MS-DOS Mac OS PowerPC Bluetooth Kazaa Commodore 64 Java programming language Mouse (computing) PlayStation Portable Thread (computer science) IPod OS/2 DOS Virtual memory Peer-to-peer Floppy disk Timeline of computing 1990-forward Trusted computing Skype X86 Personal computer Atari ST CPU design Windows Server 2003 Emacs Mac OS X v10.4 Microsoft Office Microsoft .NET Musical Instrument Digital Interface MAME Ethernet Acorn Electron Embedded system Visual Basic Mozilla Firefox ATI Technologies Computer multitasking Sun Microsystems USB flash drive History of the graphical user interface WordPerfect Microprocessor NeXT MIPS architecture Windows 2.0 64-bit Redundant array of independent disks Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis RISC Central processing unit Perl Data General Nova Radeon Microsoft Virtual PC ITunes Opera (web browser) Macintosh Finder Forth programming language CPU cache Kernel (computer science) File system ZX Spectrum Comparison of web browsers Architecture of Windows 2000 NX bit Screenshot History of operating systems Objective-C AMD64 File Transfer Protocol Microsoft
