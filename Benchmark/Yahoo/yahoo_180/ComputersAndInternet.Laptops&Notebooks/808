should i return my notebook i just got a brand new hp dv and i followed the directions on setting it up and after it was all done i clicked on what i thought was the shut off button but in reality was just a hybernation button so basically i thought my computer was charging all night which it was but it did not charge all the way so when i got up i actually turned it off then charged it until the battery was at but today when i tried using it i noticed that the battery died unusually quick so i charged it back up to and then put it in power save and just let it sit in min it was down to in min down to and in min it was down to battery life now please keep in mind that i didn't run any applications after about min the screen even went dormant that it's in the lowest power consuption mode also that the n b is brand new i know n b's battery life are pretty bad but i think that this is excessive should i return it i got only days left to xchange return its probably fine u need to discharge it all the way and then charge it straight to full it will naturally drop off from quickly and the other problems are just ur power settings and u should never turn a laptop off using the power button it can corrupt the harddrive Laptop IPod Toyota Prius Hard disk Embedded system Windows XP IBM PC compatible Ecco the Dolphin Hybrid vehicle Poker jargon Battery (electricity) Lead-acid battery PlayStation Portable Universal Serial Bus Lithium ion battery Game Boy History of Microsoft Windows Atari ST Hello world program Bicycle lighting 2000 Australian Grand Prix PowerBook Screenshot Oscilloscope Guilty Gear Protoss Floppy disk 1987 World Series Game controller Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Opera (web browser) Liquid crystal display Pentium M Tungsten Handheld Palm OS Nickel-cadmium battery Canon T90 Xbox 360 Appeal Uninterruptible power supply Artillery AmigaOS Taskbar Hybrid Synergy Drive Advance Wars: Dual Strike Gas metal arc welding Theory of conduct Personal computer Professional wrestling throws 2003 North America blackout Commodore 128 Action potential Second Battle of the Atlantic GunBound Nickel metal hydride Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Mercury Atlas 6 Solar power 2003 United States Grand Prix Atari 8-bit family Beatmania IIDX Fuel injection Lithium ion polymer battery Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Visual Basic National Weather Service AlphaSmart Bomberman Big Brother UK series 6 Pinball Handheld game console Dungeons & Dragons: Shadow over Mystara Volleyball Vacuum tube USS Terry (DD-513) Elevator USS Twining (DD-540) Solar cell USS Uhlmann (DD-687) EastEnders M16 (rifle) USS Waters (DD-115) ThinkPad Colony in Space USS S-35 (SS-140) Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Dance Dance Revolution Electricity Linked list Diode Blood on the Tracks Microsoft Windows The Inside DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Tenshinhan
