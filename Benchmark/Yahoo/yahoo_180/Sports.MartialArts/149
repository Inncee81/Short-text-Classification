who will win and why bruce lee vs benny urquidez in the ring chuck norris vs sugar ray leonard in a boxing ring steven seagall vs muhammad ali in the street jackie chan vs donnie yen in the octagon tony jaa vs o j simpson with a knife in the street jet li vs joyce gracie in the street jean claude van damme vs layla ali in the boxing ring most likely benny he actually has a fighting record unlike bruce so no one actually knows how good bruce is anyways benny style it more for ring fighting oppose to bruce's jeet kune do which many moves would get him dq'ed under boxing rules sugar ray because he's a boxer duh oh my bad i mean chuck norris chuck norris owns everyone steven seagal never really impressed me neither does aikido so i'd go with ali they both seem to be martial art performers and not really fighters but i'll go with jackie i love his movies a weapon is a pretty big advantage but i dont o j knows how to properly use a knife and most people without knife training dont and if tony jaa really is proficient at krabi krabong then he should be able to disarm a knife jet li has incredible speed however i dont know how practically he can defend himself because he is skilled in performance wushu and to my knowledge hasnt trained in actual combat fighting royce gracie has beaten many people back in the day due to their lack of ground fighting game so if jet is taken down he doesnt stand much of a chance in my opinion i would normally pick a guy to win in a fight against a girl because if equally trained a girl just isnt as strong as a guy however van damme is a ballerina who got knockout by his bodyguard so imma go with laila now these are just my opinions fights can go anyway though Bruce Lee Mixed martial arts Jeet Kune Do Action movie Muhammad Ali Jean Claude Van Damme Boxing Double Dragon Tony Jaa Jet Li Sugar Ray Robinson Mike Tyson Wushu Steven Seagal Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu The Contender (television series) Aikido Royce Gracie Evander Holyfield Johnny Cage Leon Spinks Stage name Joe Frazier Game of Death Archie Moore Ultimate Fighting Championship Chuck Norris Cowboy Bebop Wing Chun Tenshinhan Donnie Yen Chun-Li Cliff Richard Kung Fu Hustle Tekken characters Roy Jones Jr. Joe Louis Street Fighter (film) Tai Chi Chuan Hong Kong action cinema Shen Gong Wu The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll Jackie Chan Jennifer Lopez Nunchaku Carmen Basilio Piccolo Junior Saga Professional wrestling match types Ring Magazine Rocky Marciano Pro Football Hall of Fame World Boxing Council Fixed-wing aircraft Michael Spinks Team Fortress Classic Kid Chocolate Taekwondo Sonny Liston Willie Pep Rocky Floyd Patterson The Karate Kid Michael Watson Henry Armstrong Lightsaber combat Ranma __ characters Miyamoto Musashi V__ctor Gal__ndez First World Martial Arts Championship Saga Muay Thai Unreal New York Giants Cody Travers YuYu Hakusho Fighting Spirit Professional wrestling attacks Wilfredo G__mez The Rumble in the Jungle Jackie Chan Adventures Razzie Award for Worst Actor The Fairly OddParents Lupe Pintor Danny Lopez Rickson Gracie Tom-Yum-Goong Emile Griffith
