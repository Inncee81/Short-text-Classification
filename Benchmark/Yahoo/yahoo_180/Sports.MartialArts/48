about pressure points and martial arts well i know i'm not much of a fighter i only like to fight the way i know but there's a friend who learns martial arts and he used to learn also ju jitsu so he's practically unbeatable lool neway i don't want to hurt him but he always picks up with me and tries some new moves and sometimes he uses pressure points and i can't escape from it the last time he did a pressure point on my neck my neck hurted for a whole day i wanted to ask if u could give me some hints how to defend myself and how maybe to turn a bit the situation and do me something to him don't get me wrong he doesn t wnat to hurt me he only jokes but i always finish hurting and pls don't tell me to leave him cause he's a maniac or something like that i only want some advices to defend a bit myself and don't tell me to avoid fighting him cause i only defend myself plsss help me if u can well as long as you say it is under control then i would have to agree with the first statement made learn some pressure points as well in reverse counter moves are always the best when someone is at you and wont let you go you have to use self defense techniques that cause minimal harm and temporary with those pressure points to learn these though you should really have a physical teacher show you them safely one safe one i know is directly behind the ear lobes with your fingertips both hands on both ears hurts like heck while pressure is applied great for making someone let you go have fun learning but do find a teacher it is the best way to learn them safely Martial art Mixed martial arts Aikido Jujutsu Social rule Aerial (dance move) Vegeta Tai Chi Chuan Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Diving YuYu Hakusho Breastfeeding Eskrima W.I.T.C.H.
