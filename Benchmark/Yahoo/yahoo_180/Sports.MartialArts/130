teaching an old dog new martial arts tricks the past year and a half has been my worst for injuries so i've gotten more into judo and aikido it's been really hard to set the other stuff aside and learn new tricks any advice on setting the old aside for just a while to bring in the new i want to mix everything up once i have a good healthy streak thanks for any answers d an old dog new tricks well i can tell you a few things that have helped this old dog get through one is that you have to take warming up stretching and injuries even little ones more seriously not less your years of experience and training do not make you impervious to injuries they actually make you more susceptible to them due to the affects of the aging process on your body while still trying to do the same things you did when you were younger so on those days or workouts that you are working out hard you have to take more time warming up and stretching also injuries need to be avoided since your body now takes longer to heal and recover from them if you do get an injury then take extra time and extra care to treat it and let it heal so that it does not become a nagging injury avoiding injuries may mean less physical contact less physically demanding workouts and more rest in between along with that another thing that has helped me is the old japanese masters and their approach to things they rely on their experience skill and understanding of martial arts more so than their athletic and physical abilities as they get older this is especially so in workouts where hard physical contact will be encountered this way they tend to save their bodies somewhat and can extend the time that they can be active in doing martial arts if you start to take the above approaches now and change your approach to things you may find in the long run that you will be much happier not only that you will still be able to stay active and do martial arts at a satisfying level good luck Martial art Aikido Mixed martial arts Weight training Exercise Chinese martial arts Tai Chi Chuan Prostate cancer Karate Professional wrestling holds Traditional Chinese medicine Medicine Dog Negima Aerial (dance move) Insomnia Hapkido Jujutsu Bubble Bobble Sauna Drowning Alexander Technique Breastfeeding Miyamoto Musashi The Book of Five Rings Dog training Taekwondo Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Scientology beliefs and practices Piccolo Junior Saga Paragliding Vegeta Traumatic brain injury Parkour Bodybuilding Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Vulcan (Star Trek) Wolverine (comics) Social rule Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma First aid Skateboarding trick Dog agility A Course In Miracles CPU cache Addiction Massage Stomach cancer Kalarippayattu Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Pitaten Puberty Tekken characters Shen Gong Wu Urinary incontinence YuYu Hakusho Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Infantilism Happiness Fecal incontinence Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Healing Factor Satchel Paige New Age Sleep The Subtle Knife Traumatic incident reduction Kim Possible Marathon (sport) Thermoregulation Koichi Tohei Andr__s Galarraga Aphasia Alchemy Psychology Phoebe Halliwell Association for Renaissance Martial Arts Milton H.
