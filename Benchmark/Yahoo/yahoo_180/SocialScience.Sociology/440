should prostitution be legalized i think so because then they could make the girls get health check ups and they could tax the money what is wrong with adults that consent to something anyway pot too for that matter well i really can't see much wrong with this and not really sure why it is not legal everywhere countries such as germany who have it legalized have no real problems with it if it was legalized the prostitutes would be provided more health information how to practice safe sex etc whereas now they are not provided this it would give a handy way for people who had the money to have some sex and have a little fun it would be great for singles people who had lost spouses etc and did not have a sex partner readily available and would eliminate the problem of having to wine and dine someone to get sex it would also give people the opportunity to fulfill some of their fantasies such as having more than one partner at the same time etc it would be good for the economy as the prostitutes would pay taxes along with the brothels etc i have heard that a big brothel in australia is even on their stock exchange the cops that waste their time trying to pick up people in stings etc could concentrate then on real crimes instead of arresting someone for having sex what a joke of couse the holier than thou hypocrites are going to tell you it is evil because they think sex in general and any kind of sexual pleasure is dirty but i really don't see this as a moral issue so i do think that this is a law that needs to be revisited and probably changed so that prostitution can be legal everywhere as i said the countries that have it legalized see more advantages than disadvantages Prostitution Human sexual behavior Child pornography Consensual crime Marriage Age of consent Pornography Lawrence v.
