sociology how would you use functionalism or conflict theory to assess the impact of the family on an year old girl with learning physical disabilities my friend is doing her hnc on this and is in a flap as she has not got a clue my forte is psychology so cannot really help any yahoo answerer know what this q means and how to tackle it thanks so much functionalism is the idea that each of us in society is directed to act by societies constraints durkheim said that society is organic and each of its systems interacts to ensure maximal function and societal health so there are forces of education law family religion class etc that act on each of us to make us comply with their wishes in the case of the year old girl these functions might include the medical establishments ideas on learning disability the education depatments take on it family expectations of support the acceptance of disbability the role expectations of disability and childhood as negotiated statuses basicaly the girl and her family will act in ways that fit into societies expectations conflict theory i am fairly confident is the structural theory of marx that society treats those with disability in certain ways to differentiate them form the working class who can contribute to capitalist profit there will be elements of gender in this as the child is probably attended by her mother the unpaid carer supporting the father to work and so feed the machine marx would probably say that the disabled are kept at subsistance levels as they can not contribute and assistance is only provided at the level that prevents conflict e g if they were not fed the family would revolt against the system this is conflict theory because the plight of the girl will never be alleviated only mollified until capital and labour come to conflict over it try and explore these areas the functions of society acting on the girl and her family and the conflict with capital that the learning disabled represent feminist viewpoint included Sociology Gender role Social psychology Labor theory of value Unemployment Political economy Autism Liberalism Division of labour Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Labor-power Sociology of religion Sociocultural evolution Karl Marx Transsexuality Law of value Divorce __mile Durkheim Democracy Microeconomics Economic inequality Anarchism and capitalism Social class Indigenous peoples Capital accumulation Libertarian socialism Max Weber Fathers' rights Louis Althusser Education in the United States Narcissism Hikikomori Feudalism History of science Ethics Feminism Productive and unproductive labour Surplus value Education Asperger syndrome Social theory Surplus labour Class struggle Strategic management Medicine Object-oriented programming Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Labour economics Sexual orientation Historical materialism Contract Civil rights Social justice Psychology Religion Social Mode of production Capitalism Socialist economics Androgen insensitivity syndrome New Deal Anthropology Science Antonio Gramsci Michel Foucault War Mental illness Adult attention-deficit disorder History of intersex surgery Sigmund Freud Infantilism Tax Prices of production Clinical depression History of economic thought Coercion Nurse Objectivist philosophy Education in England Anarchism Gender Mental retardation Immanuel Kant Drug abuse Graphology Reliability engineering Obesity Surplus product Carl Jung Pedophilia
