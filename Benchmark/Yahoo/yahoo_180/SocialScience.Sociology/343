how can i be less cowardly but not go overboard i get nervous easily also try martial arts lessons they can instill confidence and help get you over the nervous thing i would also suggest faking confidence stay with me here walk with your back straight and your head up and look people in the eye not menacingly but as if you're in control this will probably feel very unnatural for you but the more you do it and see peoples reaction to you you'll get used to it always have a firm handshake have your shoulders back and smile most people have insecurities alot of times you're dealing with people that are just as insecure as you but they have learned to fake it good luck Aikido Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Kim Possible Sharon Tate Professional wrestling holds Kender The Smoking Room Columbine High School massacre Milton H.
