eye contact what does this mean one recent occasion has brought to my attention the effect eye contact has on me but what could this mean in this one occasion i was chatting with another co worker when our supervisor came by and i asked her a question noticing that when she answered the question she did not make eye contact with me nor did it seem like she responded to me but to my co worker instead she made most of her eye contact with my co worker even though i was the one that started the conversation with her ever since i noticed this i have paid a lot more attention to people s eye contact when in discussion i have seen with certain people that the same thing applies why could this be it seems disrespectful and has my mind baffled any suggestions it means focusing on a person attention Social rule Autism Plame affair Have I Got News For You Milton H.
