poll uk 'silver surfers' only please do you remember the 's and the country as it was do you think immigration has enhanced our country as a nation mustaffa laff did i say degraded or did you just degrade yourself with a foolish answer old know all i think you aren't actually that old really and you know feck all about anything really hello as a 'silver surfer' of i do remember growing up in the s and have some idea of the country as it was to answer your question first immigration has not enhanced our country as a nation since too many people have come here with no jobs no home and no money the majority have expected to be housed by local authorities given money and not find work unless they have to years on and immigration has changed little after the war had ended a blanket ban on all immigration should have been made if immigrants wanted to come here they should have had the means to have somewhere to live a job to go to and money in the bank with which to live off had selective immigration been in place then we would not have the situations we face now years on and instead of million people out of work we would have had full employment for our own countryfolk in the past we had a police force not a dumbed down police service respect for law and order diminishes with each generation criminals were sent to jail for longer for their crimes and corporal and capital punishment were the order of the day bring both back i say pupils had respect for teachers which many now no longer have pupils were given many 'rights' but without accepting 'responsibility' for these 'rights' meal times were the time for families to spend some quality time together there were only television stations and radio stations to watch or listen to and they were not on all day there are no manners being taught these days there is no concern for neighbours anymore and how they are if they were ill shops were not open hours a day like they are now pubs were open for limited numbers of hours every day now that we have hour drinking you can go to any town centre and see the results of it barked up on every street corner the age of consent was and this should be brought back as the 'norm' it used to be a better place in the s than it is in in a nation where foreigners now outweigh the indiginous population like where i used to live in edmonton london and the fact that most of them don't want to or can't be bothered to speak english made me want to move instead of getting better as country we're a nation of i me mine and everyone looking out for their own ends crime is on the increase because we have dreadful legislation with which to punish criminals with there is less respect now than there ever was kids roaming streets at night the untouchables weren't heard of in my day nowaday parental responsibility has gone to the wall with many parents having no clue as to where their dreadful offspring are or what they're doing i could go and on but will end here on a personal level i would prefer to live back in the s if i could it was the only time i felt happy all the very best alan l Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Plame affair
