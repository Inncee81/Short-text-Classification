how to handle crying child in pre school class room its been almost a month but one child still have not adjusted to pre school environment what should i do i am pre school teacher i think it's the worst when kids cry i taught kindergarten this past year and i had kids that off and on would cry one little girl cried often i talked to her and comforted her but nothing seemed to help at the suggestion of a co worker at the beginning of the year i talked to the child and told her every day for minutes she would be allowed to cry as much as she wanted at her desk i would set a timer after the minutes was up it was time to join kindergarten she did really well with that at first but then after christmas break that no longer worked so i talked to her mom and asked her mom to give the child a picture of herself that the child could carry around anytime the child felt sad or missed mom she was allowed to pull out the picture it worked for that situation the other child was much easier i had my aide take him out and read with him or play playdoh with him until he was calm she never talked to him about him crying she just was like let's go read and he would and he would calm down very fast and that extra attention always cheered him up the other thing you could do which i have never tried but sounds good would be to make up a little treat sheet and make sure the parents are involved and let's say the first week if the child cries only out of days he she gets a prize at school and at home then the next week you try for out of days for the prize if the student doesn't make his her goal there is no punishment but if he she makes his her goal there is a reward also the reward has to be something the child really likes like minutes on the computer or a handful of skittles or extra minutes of freetime whatever he she enjoys doing and would work towards getting that prize Dog training Kodocha Kindergarten Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Contender (television series) Great Teacher Onizuka Shaggy dog story Avenue Q Hey Jude The Catcher in the Rye Recurring South Park characters Pitaten Recess (TV series) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Little Britain Scenes from a Memory About a Boy Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Malcolm in the Middle Teachers (film) Columbine High School massacre Social rule Friends Education in Romania Le Malade imaginaire The Adventures of Pete & Pete Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Miss Saigon Quizbowl Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Infantilism Education in the People's Republic of China EastEnders GED Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Drama Treehouse of Horror V The Inside The Amazing Race Code: Lyoko The Fairly OddParents The Amber Spyglass Futurama (TV series - season 5) The Family from One End Street Theory of conduct Sant Thakar Singh Time Out of Mind Football (soccer) Baby Blues Milton H.
