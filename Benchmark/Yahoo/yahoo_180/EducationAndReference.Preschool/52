my child is three months shy of being five years old any ideas he appears to be more comfortable coloring with his right hand and writing with his left does anyone know of an at home test something i can do on my own that will help me determine the best hand for letter instruction also does anyone know of a pen or pencil that is especially designed for children with unusual grips or used to correct unusual grips we are trying to make sure my son has the basic writing skills required for kindergarten so any tips would be greatly appreciated we have been working with activity books purchased at a local teaching supply store but again any other suggestions would be greatly appreciated this sounds too simple but most times i can tell what hand a child is just by holding something like a pencil out to the child and see which hand he uses to grab it most office supply stores carry a special foam grip you slide on the pencil to help the child hold the pencil some of the grips have a shape that helps the child hold it the right way i am left handed but cut with scissors and eat with my right hand i would let your child use what ever hand he wants to pretty soon those muscles in the hand will develop and he will know which hand is best for writing when i was growing up the teachers thought left handed people were just using the wrong hand i spend an entire year in nd grade using my right hand or else i was punished thank god my third grade teacher knew better Ballpoint pen Japanese tea ceremony Education in Hong Kong GED Strap-on dildo Hangul Dyslexia Education in the United States Chopsticks Anchor Traditional animation Aerial (dance move) Aikido Homeschooling One-time pad Menstrual cup Fencing Kindergarten Education in Romania No Child Left Behind Act Professional wrestling throws Education CPU cache Fountain pen Supply and demand Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Asperger syndrome Fast bowling Urinary incontinence Breaststroke Violin Dog training Drawing Floppy disk Experiential education Boy Scouts of America Golf club (equipment) Writing Glossary of climbing terms Education in Japan Bushido Miyamoto Musashi Internal ballistics Tag Coin magic Education in the People's Republic of China Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Milton H.
