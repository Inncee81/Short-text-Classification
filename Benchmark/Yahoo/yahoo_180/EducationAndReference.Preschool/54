why is it that only low income gets accepted into the public school pre k i went to sign my daughter up for pre k at the public school here in maryland and found out today that she wont be accepted due to the fact that they only take low income for the state funding there isnt a daycare that gives her the schooling that would be necessary because most of them are just babysitters not real teachers why is there nothing for the working parents i work my a off and pay taxes for what i want my children to have an education the lower incomes just want somewhere to take there kid now im not trying to be rude or judgemental but for the most part that is what is going on its not fair i did say that it is only most of the daycares that are just babysitters and yes i have seen some where they only hire young kids to watch the children if you have a degree then i wish you were here but around here its not like that i have wrote our governor on this issue and maybe it will ruffle a few feathers for someone to finally look at it all head start is only for the lower income when it comes to public schools if the prek is available it should be available for all funding public school pre k for all children would cost taxpayers a tremendous amount of money it's probably coming someday but the school districts need to pass their budget and if they add in that expense all at once the budget would probably get voted down if you want universal public school pre k talk to people in your district and talk to the district show them that there is support among the voters for the cost increase for this program in the meantime the public schools are doing pre k through state funding which is targeted to low income students because these students are typically lower achieving in the schools the idea is that they are already behind upon entering kindergarten so it is best for society as a whole if they are given a chance during pre k to catch up to where they should be i know it stinks that you need to pay for pre k for your child but that's the way it is for now for the reasons described above drum up voting support if you want it to change No Child Left Behind Act Education in the United States Kindergarten Education in Japan Education in the People's Republic of China Dalton McGuinty School choice Tax Public education Day care Charter school Taxation in the United States Education in Hong Kong Martin J.
