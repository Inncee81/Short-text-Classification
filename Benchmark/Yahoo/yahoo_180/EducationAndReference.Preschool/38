parents of preschoolers how structured is your day i have preschoolers and a new baby on the way i'm nesting a little bit and i'm feeling very unorganized how structured is your day with your preschooler some days i feel like planning everything like i would in the classroom i used to be a teacher but when i do that i feel like we have no freedom to just hang out and relax and just color if we feel like it so a lot of days i just end up planning nothing and not really doing anything either we don't even have a consistant naptime anymore i'm trying to find a good balance so how much of your day with your preschooler is planned my day has a routine not a plan we get up eat breakfast have a little tv time while i fix breakfast and get myselft together we play we go out we have lunch we rest we play again then a little bit more of tv video time while i fix dinner then it's play with daddy snack bedtime routine i find that it is more of a predictable pattern than a structured routine but it works it's enough of a schedule that i know what is going on but it offers lots of flexibility to adjust to their moods sometimes during play we'll do a craft sometimes i play with the kids sometimes they play on their own it all depends on what is going on when we go out it can be something fun or it can be the grocery store and i don't worry about sticking to it if something comes up Breakfast Franklin (television series) Kodocha Sesame Street Education in the United States Meal Kindergarten Education in Japan Education in Taiwan Kimberly-Clark Corporation The Fairly OddParents Delicatessen Breastfeeding CPU cache Garfield Social rule Education in the People's Republic of China Weight training The Wiggles Shaggy dog story Extreme Programming Radio controlled airplane Cuisine of Denmark Strategic management Daylight saving time Our Gang Humphrey Bogart AFI 100 Years series About a Boy The Giver Surveillance English grammar DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution Alexander Technique Fecal incontinence Bulk vending Comanche Timpani Community emergency response team Mid-levels Peanuts Digital photography Coffee Snack food Tai Chi Chuan Tofu Cat Pizza Wall Street Supermarket Infantilism Stage lighting Disney's Contemporary Resort The Family from One End Street Lynbrook High School Calvin and Hobbes Futurama (TV series - season 5) Tea American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Transactional analysis Characters in the Smurfs Insulin Stream processing Grandview, U.S.A.
