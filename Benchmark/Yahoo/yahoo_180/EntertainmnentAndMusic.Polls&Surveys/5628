why does everybody put down emos and goths so what if they are different why do you really hate them it's not because they are losers they are just differet so what the hell i don't hate them and i don't think they're losers at all the fact is they're different from the usual people that's why a lot of people see them negatively personally i think the main reason why there's so many goths and emos is because they just like to be different but if you really feel that being a goth emo reflects your actual personality and that's how you want to live your life then that's completely up to you but if you're just being a goth emo because so and so is a goth emo and he she is so cool unique and i want to be like him her then that's the wrong interpretation High school subcultures Scene kids God Christian Death Gothic metal 21st Century Emo Anne Rice Theory of conduct Secondary education in the United States Kyle Broflovski Goths Something Positive Pop punk Gothic rock Generation Y Timeline of trends in music from the United States (1970-Present) Center for Talented Youth Goth Cyberspace Garfield Homophobia Nine Inch Nails Joy Division (band) Capital punishment Mudvayne Rei Ayanami Neopets Valens Religious views of suicide Nothing Nice To Say Visigoth My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult Year of the Spider Paradise Lost Leonard Cohen Hardcore punk Ranma __ characters Casey and Andy Professional wrestling match types Rock (music) Raisins (South Park episode) Social rule Daria South Park Historical persecution by Christians Slow Train Coming John Howard Yoder Johnny the Homicidal Maniac Spiritism The Merchant of Venice Hate crime Hip hop rivalries Electrophysiology Death rock Black The Sims 2 Jimmy Eat World Rutilius Claudius Namatianus Youth culture Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Bon Jovi Emo Philips Matt Hardy Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Current teachings of Prem Rawat Mojave people Craps Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Subud Cro Singlish Ethics Hip hop collaborations A Course In Miracles Anderson Cooper Heavy metal fashion Moral objectivism Generation X Ten Commandments Fruits Basket Neuro-linguistic programming Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Negligence Sant Thakar Singh YuYu Hakusho Matthew 5 Roger Ebert's most hated films Art rock Sydney Riot of 1879 Popular music Real Love (song) Avenue Q Paul W.
