have you seen the movie v for vendetta what are your thoughts is it happening now just wondering i can't take a gf uncle john as my wife would kill me lol yes i watched it on dvd for the first time a few months ago i thought it was pretty shocking as far as a mass uprising against our fascist government no that hasn't happened yet however months ago there was a group from we the people organization who were dressed exactly like v and they were in washington d c to demand answers from the government and irs about why government and irs will not answer questions about the income tax i saw the pictures online it was very impressive but what the movie v portrays about those speaking out against govt corruption and questioning officials and then they either mysteriously disappear or wind up dead that has already happened to some officials those in government with money and power can get away with anything and the media is complicit i remember sometime last year reading about war protesters in a major u s city can't remember which one and they were attacked by the police and some were incarcerated in a warehouse like place for several days and treated like animals it was abominable when a suspicious event happens in the world especially in the u s and it's big enough to get national media attention ask yourself who benefits from this if you can figure out the answer then you can learn to follow the money if ordinary people commit a serious crime most likely they will be caught and prosecuted for it but if someone or a group of people with money power position and influence decide to do something illegal who's going to know about it if the media is complicit in the cover up that is exactly what is happening in the u s and other countries like britain and israel Tax protester Politics of the United States Plame affair John F.
