should i get a dog so i've always had a dog and last year i had to leave my dog at home since i was at school and couldn't bring her my parents want to keep my dog at home again this year even though my town house allows them basically i was wondering if i should adopt a dog i was thinking something about a year either a lab or shepherd i'm gone for at most hours at a time and would have a few roommates but my own room should i get a dog or not i forgot to ask if you say yes should i get a puppy or an adult not a puppy even hours is too long puppies have to go every hour and a half my pup trained in weeks but we were very good about crate training and housebreaking at around months old the puppy will b able to hold it for hours in the crate managing college and a puppy is too much responsibility time puppies need constant attention its first months are crucial to its learning and bonding experience if your looking to adopt a dog then you'll probably not be looking for a puppy i assume most likely your not gonna find a purebred in a pound even rarer to find a purebred lab or shepherd basically today getting a purebred is much harder even if you buy your pup from a pet store who says its a purebred it may be coming from a puppy mill mutts are great and its cool that you want to adopt a dog if you do just remember even with an older dog you still need to give it attention and make sure u have the budget for one trips to the vet food can get pretty expensive the last thing would be to do some research on what dogs need as in energy and space if you're room and your friends room are the only two rooms its gonna be in you may wanna go for a smaller less physical dog if you're dog is gonna be free in the townhouse with a fair sized yard then you'd be ok for a lab collie retriever etc many dogs need a lot of exercise or they can become destructive and get into things in the house as you said a year would be fine do some research about breeds you'll find a lot of shepherd pit bull and collie mixes in the pound some of my favorite purebred breads are labs boxers retrievers shepherds huskies hope this helped Dog Mixed-breed dog Housebreaking Dog training Guinea pig Fancy rat Nintendogs Alaskan husky Golden Retriever Labrador Retriever German Shepherd Dog Puppy mill Border Collie American Pit Bull Terrier Hamster Socialization Dog agility Dog breeding Keeshond Blood on the Tracks Our Gang Breed registry Crate training Gray Wolf 101 Dalmatians: The Series Humphrey Bogart Pit bull Belgian Shepherd Dog Ron and Fez Kodocha Shetland Sheepdog Swimming Greyhound Piccolo Junior Saga Scooby-Doo Havanese One Tree Hill (TV series) Livestock Korea Jindo Dog Domestic rabbit Australian Shepherd Slow Train Coming Sled dog Time Out of Mind AFI 100 Years series Solar cell Garfield Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Social rule Dog intelligence Jon Secada Lady and the Tramp Shaggy dog story Working dog Docking American Eskimo Dog Yorkshire Terrier United Kennel Club Texas A&M University Avenue Q American Kennel Club Philip J.
