is this weird i have a relative who just got married and he and his now wife were vigins till marriage they never kissed on the lips over the years they dated just on the cheek and fore head they said they wouldnt kiss till their wedding so they could remain pure but at the wedding they didnt kiss is that weird stupid i do i get the virgin thing not the kissing even at the wedding i've heard of couples doing this except they didn't kiss at all not even on the cheek or the forehead because they didn't want any kind of kissing to lead to any kind of temptation before they were married i'm guessing maybe your relative and his wife didn't kiss at their wedding because maybe they felt that their first kiss should be in private i have no idea just a guess on my part i don't think it's stupid or weird at all that some couples don't kiss before they're married i think it's sweet and amazing that they have the willpower not to do it i admire their dedication because it's not something i could ever do i enjoyed the physical side of my relationship with my husband too much before we were married to wait to kiss until our wedding day Marriage Marilyn Monroe EastEnders Humphrey Bogart Charles, Prince of Wales Neighbours Anne Boleyn Friends All in the Family Yoko Ono Eastern Orthodox Church Jennifer Lopez Kiss Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Marriage of Figaro Shaggy dog story Britney Spears Sharon Tate Laura Schlessinger Tribute album The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Henry VIII of England Good Times The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Little Britain Baldrick Mary Jane Watson Game show Days of our Lives Starfire (comics) Hall & Oates Audrey Hepburn Thinks ...
