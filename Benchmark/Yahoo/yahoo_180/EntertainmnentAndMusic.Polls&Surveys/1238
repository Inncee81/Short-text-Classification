what should i wear to the titan's preseason game today considering i will be sitting squished between thousands of fans sitting in a stadium in nashville in degree temperatures i'm guessing clothes aren't optional no i didn't think so here is invaluable information you should wear a bikini with red white and blue body paint that is the titans colors isn't it when you are seated in the stand take the top off and wave it over your head the puppies are covered by paint at this point if you look it up in the mav fact book you will notice that it is a proven fact that women at sports events that wave their bikini top over their heads generate a vortex of air above them creating an updraft of air and thus dropping the ambient temperature by an average of degrees so ask yourself would you rather face degrees or enjoy the game go titans Tennessee Titans Volleyball St. Louis Rams Buffalo Bills Undergarment Jacksonville Jaguars Chicago White Sox New York Jets New York Giants Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium Paul Is Dead Extraterrestrial skies Bowl Championship Series Titanic (1997 film) Ice hockey Temperature New England Patriots Bikini Sauna Bud Adams Powerbomb Double the Fist White Squidward Tentacles Dog Oakland Athletics Chicago Cubs Dodge Charger Cleveland Browns Dallas Cowboys Carburetor Super Bowl Veterans Stadium Houston Texans Paintball Titans (comics) Comanche Triathlon Florida State University Las Vegas metropolitan area Japanese tea ceremony Nudity Reggie Jackson Minnesota Twins Detroit Tigers Los Angeles Kings Ecco the Dolphin National Football League Lore Nintendo Power San Francisco Giants Carolina Panthers Bikini Bottom Professional wrestling holds Gold Coast, Queensland Pok__mon (video games) Aes Sedai Dodge Neon Middle Tennessee State University Team Rocket Fighting Fantasy Game Books National Football League Archery Swimsuit Stadium Chair Softball Color temperature Minnesota Vikings Houlihan's Stadium Swingout Philadelphia Phillies Vegeta Brassiere Rosa Parks Jet engine Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim New York Mets Robot Master Anti-aliasing Indianapolis Colts Color Music genre Degree Fahrenheit American Football League Atlanta Falcons Slayers Doctor (Doctor Who) Huygens probe Cloud Horse Atlanta Braves Wayne Gretzky Concentration Professional wrestling aerial techniques Boston Red Sox Arsenal F.C.
