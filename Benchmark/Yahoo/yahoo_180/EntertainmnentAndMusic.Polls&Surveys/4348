how would you react for a story i'm working on if you found out the guy you were dating had a baby with someone else the previous year and never told you or anyone except his friends you find out after coming home from work one night and seeing the child you storm out angrily and tell him you're moving out a few days later he calls you and tells you he's in the hospital for what he thinks is a heart attack but is actually a severe panic attack due to stress would you immediately forgive him as if what he had done had never happened i personally wqould go be with him but i don't know if i'd be ready to completely forgive him for lying to me if i loved him at this point i would forgive him if our relationship was at the advanced point where we would be living together we would also have some serious straightening out to do if i never realized he had a child that tell me he's not spending too much time with it i would urge him to become a bigger part of his child's life Friends A Course In Miracles The Jazz Singer Scenes from a Memory EastEnders Kodocha Knots Landing Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an One Tree Hill (TV series) Sex and the City The Ashlee Simpson Show Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?
