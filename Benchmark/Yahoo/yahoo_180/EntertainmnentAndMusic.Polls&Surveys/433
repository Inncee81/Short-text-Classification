why am i so insecure and shy lately i have been so insecure and even just looking at people makes me sad i'm very shy too and i just hate it now i'm going into highschool and i'm soooooooooooo very nervous i only have two good friends and often feel lonely when i am compared to the pretty popular outgoing girls how can i stop being this way are you the same way serious answers only that's why i posted it in this section everybody here is so kind and nice and accepting i asked this question twice for more answers being shy is fine being shy almost always means that you are a nice person everybody feels insecure at times even the popular girls there's nothing wrong with having two good friends it's much better than having fake ones who talk about you behind their back and i know that from experience you have to be positive as in trying to see the light in not only good things but bad things too don't compare yourself to other people that'll make you feel worse and it's important for you to know that you are just as important as the cheerleader or skateboarder or whatever regarding highschool i saw the extra part of your question in the lgbt section you have to enter in confidently Theory of conduct Goodness and value theory One Tree Hill (TV series) Singlish The nature of God in Western theology Homophobia Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Shaggy dog story Humphrey Bogart The Emancipation of Mimi Kender Milton H.
