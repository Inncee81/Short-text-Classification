who would make the perfect neighbor if you could design the perfect neighbor for yourself what characteristics would you give your neighbor i think my idea of a perfect one would be someone who was intelligent and had a sense of humor similar to mine they would take good care of their property and not have noisy barking dogs i also think it would be nice if they would come over ans sit on the patio with me 'bout dark and share a drink and conversation or just sit and quietly share the evening with me oh yeah it would help if they looked really hott when mowing their lawn too Humphrey Bogart Brian Griffin W.
