how do you have a good lovers argument ie letting off steam rather than losing your temper first don't put blame on the other person then make sure you don't use hurtful words tell the person how you feel about what they did rather then accusing the person of doing something example it really makes me feel bad when you stared at that sexy waitress rather then you need to stop staring at other women when you first start the argument make sure you tell the person that you love him you can start with i really love you but it annoys me when you leave the lights on all the time validate their feelings example i know you are angry with me right now but let me tell you how i feel about this situation don't raise your voice try to talk with your partner as a mature adult no name calling i use these strategies with my boyfriend and we never have had an argument Friends Social rule Knots Landing Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Pitaten Avenue Q Transactional analysis One Tree Hill (TV series) Jon Secada Asperger syndrome Socrates Milton H.
