did it ever occur to you you were setting yourself up for frustration by memorizing all th wedding etiquette because probably of your guests and of your wedding party have no idea what wedding etiquette is or how to follow it years after my wedding i realized wedding etiquette made me have expectations i shouldn't have had i should have relaxed and enjoyed things more instead of being huffy and offended at all the people who didn't know the proper manners for weddings overall i still enjoyed my wedding a great deal but i could've enjoyed it even more if i didn't have so many expectations i read about these brides spending times what i did on my wedding and being bridezilla's and all i wonder if later they have these same regrets that's why i m asking the question etiquette exists to smooth relations between people and have an established set of communal rules to work with thereby reducing hurt feelings and easing awkward situations if everyone knew wedding etiquette this would be wonderful however i am finding that more and more no one knows what is proper anymore i had people get offended about something that was totally accepted etiquette because they were very simple country folk who got married in their living room and didn't know any better nothing wrong with that but it's a totally different animal than the traditional white wedding that we had even when someone in the family gently informed them that what we were doing was standard they still found it unusual so i was incredibly frustrated because even though we were right they thought we were jerks it does not make me regret learning and knowing the rules though my approach to the wedding day was to be insanely anal about preparing trying to foresee all the problems and fix them ahead of time but then on the big day relax and let whatever happens just happen good planning can help you to relax because you know you've done what you can i think etiquette is a key part of this and i'd do pretty much everything the same except maybe include a photocopy of a page from emily post in with the unhappy family members' invitation Etiquette God Emperor of Dune Avenue Q Friends Ethics Mojave people Sauna Social rule Poker jargon Marriage Customs and etiquette of Japan Meal Humphrey Bogart Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Culture shock White wedding Shaggy dog story Chopsticks Religious Society of Friends Wedding ring Manners Extreme Programming Pitaten Transactional analysis Debugging Killian documents Supply and demand Birth control Stuttering EastEnders Series finale Haven (TNG episode) Sailing Blood on the Tracks Fiddler on the Roof Piccolo Junior Saga John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Betting (poker) Plame affair Chess strategy and tactics Internet troll Newbie CPU cache Craps Child sexuality Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 The Apprentice 2 Sento Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Saturday Night Live We Belong Together Judith Martin Beavis and Butt-head A Course In Miracles The Damned Scenes from a Memory The Marriage of Figaro The Contender (television series) Asperger syndrome Cliff Richard Lauren Bacall Social aspects of clothing Philosophy of mathematics Forty-seven Ronin Aida (musical) Human sexual behavior The Wedding Present Hikikomori Hiking Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Keynesian economics Chinese tea culture Doomsday argument 2000 Australian Grand Prix Sant Thakar Singh Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Calvin and Hobbes Japanese values Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sexual orientation Pretty Good Privacy Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Fecal incontinence Douglas Adams Theodicy On Her Majesty's Secret Service Out-of-body experience StarCraft: Uprising About a Boy The Shining (film) Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist
