having firends well to start off i have firends that talk about me behind my back and they dont talk to me for days and i wanted to know how do i make new one before starting h s i had those firends forever but its time to put um in the garge and find new ones i am afiad when i get to lunch they going to come up to me and say you cant sit here and i going to eat lunch in the bathroom and i will be put in a locker aww okay well forget them you do not need that dont worry about what they say or do because they do not seem like very nice girls be friendly to everyone if there are new kids this is easier to make friends but be friendly to everyone make plans with them after school to hang out and be confident and be yourself most people are nice and will want to get to know you if you have friends in other groups hang out with them for a while those terrible stories about eating in the bathroom and sutff do happen but only for a very short period of time and no one is ever forced to eat in the bathroom their just too afraid to ask someone to join them it depends on your hs but you will figure it our eventually it may take time but expose yourselfs to as many new groups as you can so you can find the right one for you ie people with the same interests who really care about you good luck Kodocha Shaggy dog story Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Friends Social rule Humphrey Bogart Mojave people Pitaten Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Teen Girl Squad The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe The Lovely Bones The Family from One End Street Singlish The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Avenue Q Teacher's Pet (Disney) The Shining (film) Theory of conduct The Pet Sounds Sessions AFI 100 Years series Characters in the Smurfs Fecal incontinence Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Philip J.
