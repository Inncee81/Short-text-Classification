how do i get people to leave me alone without being rude i'm a loner outsider i'm a student so i'm constantly around people i don't like to talk and would rather go to class and do my work without being bothered but it seems i can't get through one day without someone trying to make conversation with me for instance i'll be on break reading by myself and someone starts talking to me someone who has seen me around i just want to finish my work in peace i'd like to go back to my apartment and study but all the stuff i need to do research on is on campus or i'll be at a bar cafe lounge and someone will come up to me ramdomly and start making conversation while i sit there frustrated and wanting to walk away it's not that i hate people but i like peace quiet and i really don't care about what people have to say about the weather and sports and television and i hate being hit on what can i do to avoid conversation without appearing rude and arrogant one word headphones big obvious ones even if you dont want to listen to music no one else will know you're not hope i helped or at least made you smile gypz surely you realize there is a difference between social and public just because this person is going out in public doesn't mean they want to be sociable Social rule Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Catcher in the Rye Shaggy dog story Teachers (film) The Death Gate Cycle Eddie Guerrero Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children Sin City __douard Manet Humphrey Bogart Kodocha Georgia Institute of Technology Religious conversion Russian joke James T.
