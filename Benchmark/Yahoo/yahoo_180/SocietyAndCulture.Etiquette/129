a homeless man asked for change but i didn't have any so i gave him some pizza hut coupons was that wrong as i see it there are three very different types of panhandlers the first is the person who absolutely does not want to be homeless but who has been forced to that state by an unfortunate set of circumstances they often will not beg but will look for resources that may help them back onto their own feet such a person should not be offended by any offer of help including a food coupon then there are the many who actually should be in a mental institution many were once institutionalized but have been forced into the streets by our health care system these are the somewhat scary people who rant or talk to themselves their's is a sad situation but they are also very vulnerable to alcohol and drugs i think its best to not give them money and enable their destructive forces a food coupon would be better finally there's the group who simply prefer the homeless lifestyle they simply prefer not to work or take any kind of responsibility easier to beg and let life's circumstances control them than to take control for themselves my sympathy tends to be least for these though some are such humorous characters and harmless that one may occasionally feel like giving them a bit of change but they too are vulnerable to drugs and alcohol so a food coupon might be better for them even if it isn't what they would prefer i think you did a fine thing Homelessness Begging Borderline personality disorder Hypoglycemia Health care in the United States Human sexual behavior Avenue Q Drug abuse Sant Thakar Singh Theory of conduct Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Abortion debate Pacifism Sexual orientation Health insurance Autism rights movement Rape Alcoholics Anonymous Infantilism Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Shaggy dog story Libertarianism Bond American Psycho Ex-gay Ethics Knots Landing Mojave people Involuntary commitment Probation officer Social rule Word of Wisdom Breastfeeding Cancer Pitaten Meditation Alcoholism Child sexual abuse Fixed income Addiction Charles Ponzi Controlled Substances Act Kodocha Drug test Illegal drug trade Theodicy Information warfare Social work A Course In Miracles Trimurti Clinical depression Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Paternalism Peter Griffin Philosophical skepticism Drama Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sant Mat Goodness and value theory Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Meaning of life Badly Drawn Kitties Little Britain Computer virus Prostate cancer Abortion Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Ontological argument Scientology and psychiatry Transactional analysis Poverty Schapelle Corby Floppy disk Viz (comic) Humphrey Bogart Rationing Eucharist Pedophilia Michael Garibaldi The Smoking Room PaX Mental Health Act 1983 Friedrich Schleiermacher Springfield Elementary School Organic farming Plame affair Mothers Against Drunk Driving Polyamory Pizza Hut Hey Jude A Series of Unfortunate Events Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Friends Fast bowling National Institutes of Health Aesthetic Realism Motion picture rating system Arguments for and against drug prohibition Value system Trafficking in human beings
