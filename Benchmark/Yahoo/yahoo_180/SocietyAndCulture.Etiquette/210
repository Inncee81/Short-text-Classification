neighbor with noisy bed springs my neighbor gets laid about once a month and when he she gets busy the bed springs squeak so loudly that they wake me up in the middle of the night here's the problem i can't tell which neighbor it is since i live on the bottom floor of the apartment should i just leave a note on everyone's door oh give me a break beds should not be so loud they wake a person up during the night i've lived in apartments for years and never experienced anything like this it's loud that's terrible i know b c i deal with that a few times a week my neighbors above me screw like rabbits good for them but i have to hear it one night i tried jumping on my bed to bang on my ceiling their floor in an effort to get them to stop i found out the hard way that the ceiling is made of concrete so i smashed my hand and i still had to hear all of the squeaking you could leave an anonymous note on their door to politely ask them to keep it down however you run the risk of ticking them off and they could end up making more noise just to spite you in the end you're probably better off just not saying anything especially since you don't know what unit the noise is coming from specifically Mattress Hearing impairment Shaggy dog story Blood Simple 1957 World Series Richard Chase Avenue Q Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Guinea pig Door Sento Sin City Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Milton H.
