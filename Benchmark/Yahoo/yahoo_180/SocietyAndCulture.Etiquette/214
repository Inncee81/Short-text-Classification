how do i ask my roommate not to eat drink my food drinks i just moved into my new place recently and noticed that my roommate has been drinking my beverages normally i would not have a problem with this had they asked me first however i am on a really tight budget and can't afford to share my food plus i work long days so i dont' have time to grocery shop all the time so when i come home i want to have my food intact for example i bought a case of water bottles this morning i woke up with killer cramps but had no water left to take my ibuprofren with and therefore am in a lot of pain my roommate is a nice person so i don't want to start things off on the wrong foot help to roommate i can't afford to treat us to food and drink but i will gladly pick up enough for you if you can give me the money before i shop it isn't a problem to share but i don't have the money to get enough supplies for both of us i am sure that you understand so do you want to pay me now and i will go shopping it is a yes or no response from here you haven't insulted them or hollered so there should be no hard feelings only a guilty sneak would put up a fuss or make trouble at this point you didn't move in with a guilty sneak though your gentle words in a soft voice capture more attention than hollering or whining that would only start a fight and put them on the defensive keep it peaceful but look them in the eye Social rule The Catcher in the Rye Avenue Q Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Hiberno-English Humphrey Bogart Customs and etiquette of Japan Knots Landing Singlish Sin City Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Time Out of Mind Milton H.
