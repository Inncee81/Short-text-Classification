do you see a problem with someone paying for their with change at a bar my boss would get angry if someone paid with quarters dimes etc i know it is a pain in the neck to count but she would say if they have to pay that way they don't need to be in here her thought was they could use the money for something better but what if you just didn't get you check cashed etc what do you think omg are you serious just because someone pays with change doesn't mean they don't have much money i sometimes unload change with an apology to the cashier just to lighten my load it's heavy to have that accumulate in my purse or maybe the person is a waiter also i've know a lot of waitresses who got a lot of change from tip money they always want to get rid of it again it's heavy Waiter Tip Babe Ruth Oh My Goddess!
