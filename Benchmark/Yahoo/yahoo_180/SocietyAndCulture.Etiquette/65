are you really too sensitive to be on this site i think i am i asked a lighthearted question about fudge chocolate bars and someone answered what who cares do you care which i thought was rude and unnecessary i've looked over the answerers profile and they appear to have answered other lighthearted questions without being rude so why did they do it to me but more importantly why do i let it get to me take a deep breath rachael see now silent movie hasn't offended me because they appear to give cheeky answers to most of the questions but the individual i'm referring to doesn't if i knew how to blow a raspberry in writing that's exactly what i'd do to that person just to prove a point silent movie has added an answer to the fudge question which made me laugh my bottom off an innocent question obtaining an unnecessary rude answer always offends and rightly so what did the answerer gain from it they upset you i don't know what the question was but i'm trying to lose a lot of weight but if you have some fudge to spare i will take it off your hands very reluctantly of course as a favour please please plea se ok pretty please Theory of conduct God Emperor of Dune Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Social rule Plame affair Joke Russian joke Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film) Shaggy dog story The Ashlee Simpson Show Sub-Zero The Apprentice 2 EastEnders One Piece minor characters Charles Darwin's views on religion Past teachings of Prem Rawat The Doctor Dances Have I Got News For You Abortion debate Friends Koan The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Meaning of life John Kerr The nature of God in Western theology 2000 Australian Grand Prix Milton H.
