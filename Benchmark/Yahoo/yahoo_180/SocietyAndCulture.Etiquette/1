what is the proper way to handle when your husbands's co has a holiday party and spouses aren't invited its a night time function not a luncheon during the work day i think that's rude considering the owners are millionaires i didn't take it out on him he went i did call the office and spoke to the secretary in conversation told her i thought it rude maybe i'm the tacky one hah lol foxhound your just a jerk there were no wives there as the secretary put it the owners are single so that is why they arranged the party as they did they are all young rich preppy guys that are single and my husband does not work there anymore he has his own company i might i add will he ever be as rude as the guys that run the company mentioned in my question didn't asked to be insulted but if it makes you feel better good for you some people just go on here to purposely put down and trash people not answer a question just wanted some insight not insults my husband went for a few hours came home doesn't work there anymore has his own company didn't yell at the receptionist learn to read people her and i had a civilized conversation about it i haven't heard of company holiday parties that didn't include dates or spouses seems suspicious that they would have a sausage fest their intent must have been to invite only single women as well you are a more tolerant wife than i am i absolutely wouldn't have encouraged or supported my husband attending a function that would be inappropriate for a wife to attend i suppose if it were mandatory then my hubby would be putting in the standard hour appearance and then bowing out since it was a holiday party then it was not part of the work day and they wouldn't be getting paid for attending so to leave out partners is completely inappropriate Plame affair Social rule Marriage Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Avenue Q Mojave people The Star Wars Holiday Special Haven (TNG episode) George Galloway 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Fiddler on the Roof Humphrey Bogart Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Sydney Riot of 1879 The Catcher in the Rye Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Time Out of Mind EastEnders Late Night with Conan O'Brien Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Extreme Programming Philosophical skepticism Alan Keyes Singlish Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Good Times Plame affair timeline Marilyn Monroe Montreal Screwjob Divorce Rosa Parks Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Donald Neilson Married... with Children Kodocha Past teachings of Prem Rawat Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Futurama (TV series - season 5) Little Britain George Brown, Baron George-Brown One Tree Hill (TV series) Investigations since the Fiji coup of 2000 Iranian presidential election, 2005 Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Pip (South Park episode) The Catherine Tate Show Big Brother (USA TV series) Rick Santorum The Emancipation of Mimi Recurring South Park characters The Inside Same-sex marriage in Canada ECW One Night Stand Rais massacre 50 First Dates Teresa Heinz Kerry The Smoking Room The Lovely Bones Lauren Bacall Jewish services Babe Ruth's Called Shot Friends Mail-order bride David Blunkett Russian joke Domestic violence Blood on the Tracks U.S. presidential election, 2008 LiveJournal Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Germaine Greer Reaction to the assassination of John F.
