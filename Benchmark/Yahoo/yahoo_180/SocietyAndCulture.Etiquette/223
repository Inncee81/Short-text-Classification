facial from a friend i have an appointment at a spa to get a facial from a friend she's a good friend of mine but i've never had her give me a facial before and i am new to the american culture is it ok for me to tip my friend at the end of the facial or should i not do that also how much tip is a good idea like i said i am new to the american culture and any help would be great tipping a friend isn't a good idea i'd say ask her after the service to take her for dinner lunch or a movie that should be a better way of saying thank you rather than paying it off with cash Tip Beauty Physical attractiveness Great Teacher Onizuka Oral sex Facial nerve Eid ul-Fitr Cuisine of Denmark Kodocha Publication of Darwin's theory Chinese New Year Mr. Bean Surveillance Thanksgiving Beard About a Boy Humphrey Bogart MV Galaxy Toilet humour Nashville Skyline Clint Eastwood Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends Dabbawala Nick Adams Bottle Rocket (film) Sign language Homer vs. Dignity Wario Little Britain Scarification You Only Live Twice The Strangerhood Bond Herbert Hoover Ra (board game) Friends Lisa the Vegetarian Extraterrestrial life in popular culture Mona Lisa Advertising Oakland Athletics American Sign Language Depilation Dragon Booster Facial feminization surgery Charles Darwin Channel 4 Hiberno-English 10 Things I Hate About You Shaving Headgear Wyatt Earp Singapore gay equality movement Mormon missionary Marie Antoinette Meal Microeconomics Psycho Socrates Contemporary culture of South Korea Firefighter Wall Street Lunch Facial expression Striptease Guns N' Roses As Good as It Gets Supper Economy of Africa Ancient Egypt Yogiisms BC Rail IBM Belarus Minimum wage Brian Mulroney Sydney Riot of 1879 American Psycho Vladimir Peter Tytla Confucius Molecular nanotechnology The Marvelous Land of Oz Waiter The Rutles Shaggy dog story Ethnic group 2005 Belgian Grand Prix D.
