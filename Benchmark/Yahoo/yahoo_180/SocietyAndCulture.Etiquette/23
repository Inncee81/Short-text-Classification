is it bad being an emo well i'm asking this question because i'm just not so sure if i really am an emo most of the people tell me that i really look and act like an emo for me i just can't say of being an emo is bad so what do you think emo is just another name for a style of dress or music hey if you like it go for it dont let the judgments of others determine how you should express yourself just be careful not to go over board and try and be something you are not just be you and do what you like not what others like have fun Emo 21st Century Emo Scene kids Emo fashion Scene (youth) Hardcore Emo Kyle Broflovski Ethics High school subcultures Popular music Whose Line Is It Anyway?
