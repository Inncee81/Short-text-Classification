who enjoyed rush hour i just saw it yesterday and thought it was the best of the rush hours lots of fresh jokes that car chase sequence was also insane with all the complexities of the final installments of this years trilogies this should be a welcome change of pace probably the worst of the series but really not bad highly predictable were as i told the people i was sitting with who was behind it all and who the accomplices were the movie in a whole is about an hour and twenty minutes it has pretty humorous parts throughout and some good action scenes but in all honesty they could have been better the chemistry between the two leads is still there which makes these movies fun in the first place this was an unneeded yet entertaining entry into the series but it is basically the love child of the first two the outtakes as usual are the best part of the film to wrap it up if you enjoyed the first two you will probably enjoy this one as well sure you can see everything coming from a mile away but it still makes you laugh and still entertains take this for what it is and you will have a good time Joker (comics) Blooper Anime Back to the Future The Ashlee Simpson Show Time Out of Mind Humphrey Bogart Late Night with Conan O'Brien Good Morning, Vietnam Shaggy dog story Manos: The Hands of Fate Back to the Future Part II Martin Lawrence Fast bowling The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (film) Paul Is Dead Once Upon a Time in the West Meta-reference Serial Blackadder The Aristocrats Machinima The Simpsons Scooby-Doo Eddie Murphy Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker The Blues Brothers Taxi Driver Something Awful The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Married... with Children Roger Ebert's most hated films Care Bears Our Gang Comedy film On Her Majesty's Secret Service Beavis and Butt-head Mojave people About a Boy Avenue Q Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Saturday Night Live Elijah Wood Sketch comedy Infidels Back to the Future trilogy Whose Line Is It Anyway?
