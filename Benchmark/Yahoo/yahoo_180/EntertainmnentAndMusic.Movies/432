movies money i just wanted to know how the movie money making works for example if a big budget movie such as transformers took like million dollars to make but made millions dollars in the box offices how come movies studios says they still barely make a profit until dvds come out can you say completion bond there are about a hundred thousand things producers have to pay for that the general public has no clue about completion bonds cost money the mpaa symbol costs money prints and advertising cost money flying actors and directors to new york to appear on david letterman costs money insurance for all that costs money interest on whatever loans the production costs money postage to ship all those copies of that film costs money postage to send everybody their paychecks costs money cell phone bills that have been stacking up since the beginning of pre production costs money then you've got every person in those credits turning in last minute non budgeted receipts for gas construction materials hotel rooms the wrap of the location production office and it goes on and on and on and on are we forgetting about all the trashed hotel rooms and busted rental cars a few of the less responsible members of the crew left behind i've heard of cases of producers claiming the movie didn't turn a profit at the box office because they were trying to get out of paying some of the folks who had negotiated percentage deals on the box office profits but it's more likely that all of the above and more is costing the production enough money that they really aren't turning much of a profit until it hits dvd Insurance United States Postal Service Economy of the United States MPAA film rating system Microeconomics Film Internet fraud United Artists Social Security (United States) Economy of Russia Hyperinflation Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards James T.
