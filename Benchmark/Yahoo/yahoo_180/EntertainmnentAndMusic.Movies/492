who likes the infinifilm feature on their dvd movies infinifilm is where you have special features while watching a movie this is a old style but a new technique for dvd movies why do they bother to do this when hd dvds are already coming out with extra crap to toss onto the disk i am glad i rent movies for a buck i'd never buy one with the extra annoying infinifilm settings if i want extra features i'll select them the old fashioned way by clicking on extra features in the sub menus i agree the infinifilm is super annoying DVD Mouse (computing) Audio commentary (DVD) PlayStation Portable Super Mario Bros. 2 Motion picture rating system System/34 Screenshot Super Mario remake series The Ultimate Matrix Collection Napoleon Dynamite Extras (sitcom) Atari 8-bit family Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (television special) Macromedia Flash Anime GunBound New Order Konami Code Software bloat The Criterion Collection Craps IPod E-I-E-I-(Annoyed Grunt) Easter egg (virtual) Beauty and the Beast (1991 film) Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution Sorting algorithm Poker jargon Floppy disk DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Bubble Bobble Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories My Family (television) Stereoscopy Mystery Science Theater 3000 The Incredibles Family Guy DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution McFly Widescreen System 7 (Macintosh) Advance Wars: Dual Strike Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Pump It Up ILife Attack of the Show!
