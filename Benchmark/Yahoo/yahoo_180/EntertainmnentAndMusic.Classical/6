questions for piano courses if i buy a key keyboard and take the pop piano course would it be ok do i have to tell the teacher that i have a key keyboard and the piano has keys and my keyboard has keys am i going to learn properly cos there's a difference in the number of keys btw i'm gonna save money and buy a piano after learning from the course it's alright right you'll be fine for a bit once you start learning to pedal you'll probably want to get a piano because the pedals that they make for electric keyboards really don't feel at all like the pedal on a piano and switching from your keyboard at home to the piano at your lesson is going to be a big pain most of my students start on a keyboard now while i can't say that i'm thrilled with it it's okay for a start the main thing is that you've got something at home to practise on because if you don't do that between lessons you're not going to get anywhere work hard at it it's a rewarding pursuit Piano Organ (music) Electronic organ Musical Instrument Digital Interface Brian Jones (musician) Queen (band) Player piano American Beauty (album) Harp Keyboard instrument Slow Train Coming Elton John Time Out of Mind Miles Davis Fortepiano Blood on the Tracks Accordion Steve Reich Diving Tai Chi Chuan Classical music era Sonata (music) Keyboard layout Bringing It All Back Home Musical keyboard Transactional analysis Sergei Prokofiev Hotel California Computer keyboard PLATO Empire Burlesque Blonde on Blonde Journey (band) Music lesson Alexander Technique Pat Metheny Keyboard technology Tony Banks (musician) Optigan Authentic performance Come on Over (1997 album) Jazz String instrument A Hard Day's Night (song) Electric guitar Highway 61 Revisited Piano Sonata No. 14 (Beethoven) Bohemian Rhapsody Current teachings of Prem Rawat Scientology beliefs and practices Musical instrument The Who Harpsichord Great Teacher Onizuka Humphrey Bogart Digital A Course In Miracles Bartolomeo Cristofori Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Jamiroquai The Kinks Suzuki method Chick Corea Typewriter Tom Petty Mouse (computing) Sonata form Enigma machine Tablature German grammar Arnold Schoenberg Snowboarding Major scale Self Portrait Max Martin String piano Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Double bass Musical mode Pipe organ Iggy Pop Jumpstart 3rd Grade B__la Bart__k True Crime: Streets of LA Herbie Hancock Saga (band) Language education Songwriter John Cage The Isley Brothers Scrooge McDuck Tina Turner Education in the United States Chicago (band) Teacher Maison Ikkoku Lesson Johannes Brahms Can't Buy a Thrill
