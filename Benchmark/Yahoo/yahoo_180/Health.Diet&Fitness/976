protein shakes when you add peanut butter and fat free milk to your protein shakes does it become a regular milk shake with all the fat and colories i'm not sure why you would add peanut butter but if it's in a chocolate flavored protein powder that might be kind of good anyway any type of milk is fine to add and typically tastes better than water or juice but adding a little peanut butter won't be really detrimental it's just adding some fat and calories it doesn't take away anything from the protein powder as it will still have the high protein content and amino acids that you are taking it for Milk Chocolate Tofu Peanut butter Veganism Butter Soy milk Soy protein Coffee Peanut Breakfast Cheese Nutrition Cream (food) Bread Kit Kat Ice cream Omega-3 fatty acid Protein Yoghurt Dairy product Dieting Aspartame Vegetarianism Pancake Tea Rice Dairy Saturated fat Cookie Gatorade Cake Chili con carne Milkshake Hypoglycemia Twix Ramen Curry Trans fat Curd Food In-N-Out Burger Peruvian cuisine Monosodium glutamate Sugar Cannabis (drug) Biochemistry Porridge Breastfeeding Insulin Hot sauce Avocado Cocoa Brewery Junk food Protein-energy malnutrition Amino acid Margarine Oreo Jewish cuisine Nutrient M&M's Potassium Olive oil Slim Fast Fat Cuisine of Brazil Bubble tea Sugar beet Cuisine of Africa Espresso Muesli Girl Scout cookies Chicken soup Fasting Soap Kidney stone Tortilla Food additive Hummus Egg (food) Essential amino acid Ham Gumbo Gelato Yerba mate Fecal incontinence Sugar substitute Fire extinguisher Weight training Breast milk Joke Magnesium Honey
