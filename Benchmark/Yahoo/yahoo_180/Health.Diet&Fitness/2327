what type of food is eggs category my friend is very food conscious and has noticed that in the health books in the section where they split all food into categories of meat wheat junk veg fish etc she has noticed that eggs are not listed in there and she wanted to know which category it might belong to i personally believe its poultry but for some unknown reason she thinks it might belong in the vergetables category what do you think eggs are often lumped together with dairy because of the cholesterol content and they are found in the dairy aisle of your grocery store but they are not considered dairy eggs are classified along with meat and fish as animal protein i see some confusion with people thinking eggs are somehow dairy eggs are not the product of cows nor do people considered to have any kind of dairy allergy or intolerance have the same issue with eggs or rather if they do it's a separate issue altogether in other words an egg allergy and a dairy allergy are two separate things and are allergic reactions to two separate kinds of protein if you look up the definition of dairy what you'll find are meanings related to milk and milk products period your friend might think that eggs are considered vegetables because perhaps she knows some vegetarians and know they while they don't eat animal flesh they do eat eggs and dairy they are lacto ovo vegetarians as contrasted with vegans but i digress bottom line eggs are considered to be an animal protein along with meat fish and poultry but they are their own kind of animal protein which is to say that they're not considered to be poultry themselves Food Kashrut Milk Cheese Tofu Meat analogue Kosher foods Dairy Soy milk Vegetarianism and religion Egg (food) Livestock Vegetarian nutrition Dieting Taboo food and drink Chicken Crohn's disease Pizza Unclean animals Allergy Vegetarian cuisine Lactose intolerance Agriculture Pesco/pollo vegetarianism Factory farming Organic food Bengali cuisine Soy protein Omega-3 fatty acid Sausage Environmental vegetarianism Meat Ice cream French cuisine Cat Halaal Quorn Yoghurt Healthy eating Atkins Nutritional Approach Chinese cuisine Butter Peanut Fasting Organic farming Cuisine of Brazil Food preservation Shark People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Russian cuisine Nutrition Lactobacillus acidophilus Insulin Bovine somatotropin Gluten Supermarket Breakfast Jewish cuisine German cuisine Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Cuisine of Malaysia Food guide pyramid Korean cuisine Cuisine of Singapore Multiple chemical sensitivity Brain Cattle Japanese cuisine Trans fat Coronary heart disease Fugu Gelatin Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Dairy cattle Monosodium glutamate Farmer MyPyramid Breastfeeding Dairy farming McDonald's Cuisine of Africa Dairy Farm International Holdings Limited Ramen Hamster Cuisine of Norway Breast milk Roman eating and drinking
