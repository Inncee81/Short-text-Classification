does sweatting help you loose weight ok i was just wondering if sweat helps you lose weight i know that you will lose water weight and gain it back when u drink water but i want to know if the combine action of the transportation of sweat out of your pours and the rise in body temperature results in an increased metabolism faster rate of burning calories for example if i ran a mile on the treadmill with a sauna suite on vinyl layer that raises you body temp causing you to sweat would i burn more calories than if i ran a mile at the same past with out it on you will lose more water weight you will sweat more with the suit on so you will lose more weight temporarily your body has a knack for equalizing things though so if you lose water weight your body will replace it eventually sweating as far as i know serves only to cool the body and has no effect on metabolism or the rate at which you burn calories wearing a sauna suit while working out can also lead to heat stroke or other heat related conditions it could be dangerous the best way to lose the water weight is to drink alot of water at least a gallon a day your body is storing water because it thinks that it isn't getting enough once you get into a routine of giving your body enough water it will eventually stop storing as much and your total water weight will go down keep exercising and increase your water intake bump up the protein and lower the carbs and you'll do great hope this helps Dieting Sauna Swimming Atkins Nutritional Approach Thermoregulation Insulin Milk Obesity Low-carbohydrate diet Anorexia nervosa Water Bodybuilding Weight training Fire fighting Explosive material Diabetes mellitus Hydrogen economy Jet engine Hiking Calorie Brewery Sweating Chlorpromazine Swimming pool Warm-blooded Nutrition Temperature Sugar substitute Hypoglycemia Energy Bong Urinary incontinence Aspartame Carbon dioxide Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Water (molecule) Breastfeeding Protein-energy malnutrition First aid Alzheimer's disease Marathon (sport) Casting Caffeine Welding Skin Diesel engine Car handling Stroke Siphon Turbocharger Dehydration Drowning Enzyme Folic acid Heat Ocean thermal energy conversion Dietary fiber Cancer E85 Creatine Sport rowing Internal ballistics Tire Hair Protein Intracranial pressure Tocopherol Cocaine Sento Central processing unit Tooth enamel Mattress Alcoholic beverage Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Aluminium The Contender (television series) Renewable energy Fire extinguisher Tooth Traumatic brain injury Motor oil Chocolate Nuclear power Tank Ton Ammonia
