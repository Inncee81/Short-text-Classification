abs workout cramp i just started working out again over a year gap yesterday i did one set of crunches after i was done my stomach felt like it was cramping and i can feel my ab muscles shake is this normal any advice to start my ab workout routine back yes this can happen i would make sure u stretch out your abdominals very very good before doing any ab work the major abdominal stretch is called the seal stretch and also try and drink a fair amount of water stretching the abs will help warm them up for what ever exercises you are planning to do to start back on an ab workout i would suggest doing hanging leg raises these are the hardest for most people and can take time getting used to yet they yield the best overall results secondly i would try and find an ab machine at your gym such as the nautilus ab rocker or the cybex crunch machine although any ab machine will help get a good workout while ensuring you have proper form so you wont be cheating or using other muscles and lastly cardio if you have fat covering your abs cardio will be the only way get the fat off of them as you prob already know abs take alot of work to get even if someone already has a low body fat much luck and i hope ive helped Exercise Abdomen Bodybuilding Cramp First aid Stomach cancer Stretching Equine conformation Professional wrestling holds Dialysis Puberty Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Fecal incontinence Urinary incontinence Atkins Nutritional Approach Tocopherol Siphon Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Dieting Swimming Menstrual cup Triathlon Running Deadlift Obesity Cholera Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Dairy Mattress Milk Osteoarthritis Cheating in poker Babe Ruth Motorcycle Breastfeeding Poker jargon Physical attractiveness Prostate cancer Aerial (dance move) Nutrition Hypoglycemia Physical fitness Gastroparesis Thermoregulation Marathon (sport) Professional wrestling attacks Breaststroke Trans fat Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest Textile manufacturing Insulin Flat feet Hiking Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 2 Insomnia Chinese martial arts Andr__s Galarraga Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Abdominal pain Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Carpal tunnel syndrome American lobster Gaussian elimination Diabetic ketoacidosis Acupuncture Clinical depression Crocodilia Human height Aortic dissection Infantilism Muscle Mesothelioma Strap-on dildo DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution Kidney Poliomyelitis Backstroke WCW Power Plant Anorexia nervosa CPU design Peritoneum Eye Massage Calisthenics Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Nuclear weapon design Anxiety Dog Iliotibial band syndrome 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Growth hormone treatment Jackass: The Movie Friends Diving Pneumonia Muay Thai
