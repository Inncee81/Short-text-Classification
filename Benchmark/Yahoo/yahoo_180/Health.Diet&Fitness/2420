had an minor operation yesterday and havent been for a no since any ideas how to prompt it i had an minor operation yesterday unrelated to my stomach or any of my digestive system you don't want to know and i don't want to tell you i was under general anaesthetic and subsenquently on co dydramol started course of them after i woke up and got home so dont think that is the cause although probably not helping despite returning to a normal diet on my return depite very sore throat from the tubes and urinating as usual i havent taken a crap yet despite a lot of food disappearing into the mouth nothing is coming out the other end except the most heinous of farts starting to feel a bit bloated and the bathroom scales are telling me its still in there eating fruit at the moment to no affect so can anyone suggest a decent and healthy foodsource that i can use as a gentle prompt or failing that a full on laxative i thought kiwi fruit would work but no joy as yet i should also point out that i am not in a fit state to leave the house and certainly can't drive so it will have to be something i am likely to have around the house no laxatives at home sadly never needed them before as generally speaking very healthy usually and eat a good diet it the co dydramol that constipates you i have a similar painkiller and it really bungs me up in an extreme case i take milk of magnesia but on a day to day basis i take a couple of table spoons of mil par which eases it a lot if you don't have any of those to hand then half a small glass of orange juice with a generous tablespoon of olive oil works wonders and doesn't give you any cramps you may have to repeat it a couple of times before you actually go but don't take loads at once take one now if you haven't been by bed time take another if you haven't been in the morning have another an hour or so after waking if you haven't been by tomorrow night take another if still no luck you should see a doctor as he may need to prescribe something when taking opioids like co dydramol you should drink as much water throughout the day as you can handle this really helps the situation and minimises the blocking effect these drugs have hope it works for you Fecal incontinence Urinary incontinence Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hypoglycemia Hamster Breakfast Dieting Toilet humour Breastfeeding Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Tooth Laxative Diarrhea Prostate cancer Opioid Milk Social rule Dietary fiber Adjustable gastric band Theory of conduct Craps Milton H.
