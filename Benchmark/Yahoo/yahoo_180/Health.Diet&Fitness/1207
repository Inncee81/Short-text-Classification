opiates vs alcohol so after many experiments i've noted that both alcohol and opiates give that same kinda high if youthink about it the more you move the more vertigo you feel and you just feel like youre being pressed down into whatever chair bed your in that relaxed feeling i love do'nt get me wrong i'm not a druggy but i do like a high once in a while and opiates do it wonderfully with a relatively even for me low dose of any opiate i feel moderately high and stuff and then with alcohol a few shots will get me moderately buzzed high but for some reason although i get the same satisfaction outof both chemicals i always drink more alcohol to get a better buzz when i never need a few more pills to get that extra high although that'd be a nic eidea i generally don't go for it so my question is why do i go for more alcohol but not more opiates anti drugists please chill out afterall whats answers for anyways alcohol and opiates act on the brain in different ways opiates act on your endorphin receptor sites endorphins are your body's natural painkiller euphoric chemicals while alcohol is more of a general central nervous system depressant so they really aren't doing the same thing to your brain your conscious mind is just interepreting the sensations as being similar another factor if you're like most people you've been doing alcohol longer than opiates so you likely haven't built up a tolerance to opiates yet don't worry you will then you will definitely need those few more pills also to be considered everyone has a different body chemistry and experiences drugs in their own way not everyone experiences either of the sensations you describe with alchohol or opiates in fact in my experience it's pretty rare for people to think the two buzzes are at all similar for excellent non judgmental and non biased info on drugs i recommend www erowid org they have extensive well documented info on every imaginable aspect of drugs and their use Addiction Opium LSD Drug abuse Methamphetamine Diazepam Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants Withdrawal Opioid Caffeine Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Cannabis (drug) Psychosis Illegal drug trade Nitrous oxide Migraine Alcoholic beverage Narcotic Consciousness Religion Hypoglycemia Happiness Meditation Clinical depression Sleep Anxiety Tetrahydrocannabinol Hashish Hypnosis Pain Alcohol Analgesic Psilocybin Cocaine Insomnia Alcoholism Paracetamol Orgasm Francis Crick Sadism and masochism Sedative Non-medical use of dextromethorphan Buprenorphine Endorphin Chlorpromazine 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Self-harm Oasis (band) Doxepin Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Psychology of religion Tobacco smoking Near-death experience Cannabinoids Folic acid Urinary incontinence Beat generation Theory of conduct Arguments for and against drug prohibition Cancer Bipolar disorder Drowning Panic attack Breastfeeding Aspartame The nature of God in Western theology Gamma-hydroxybutyrate Kurt Cobain Birth control Salvia divinorum Paroxetine Cognitive science Borderline personality disorder Sin City Nicomachean Ethics Sleep apnea Tocopherol Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor Traumatic brain injury Raphe nuclei Oxycodone Social rule Psychedelic mushroom Health issues and the effects of cannabis Chronic fatigue syndrome Philosophy of mind Fitz Hugh Ludlow Balance disorder Common cold Ex-gay Alexander Technique Sexual orientation
