hi i'm years old and i work out with lb dumbells i am lbs should i get heavier weights considering your weight and age you should probably get a slightly heavier weight to make it where doing reps will be hard your pretty big for so i think you might be ready for something heavier but be careful and maybe only jump to or lbs you need to focus more on the proper way of lifting right now than already building muscle get a slightly heavier weight and focus on fundamentals and the proper positions then slowly add weight as you become more familiar with it also assisted weights would be good for you as you learn if you have a gym membership otherwise do not lift without a spotter who is older and knows how to properly watch over you Weight training Bodybuilding Aerial (dance move) Bench press Pound Equine conformation Mixed martial arts Professional wrestling throws Powerlifting Volleyball Car handling Gliding Weight Internal ballistics Diving Skateboarding trick Anchor Mitsubishi 3000GT Mattress Parachuting Figure skating Walt Disney World Railroad Helicopter Mercury Cougar Explosive material Snowboarding P-61 Black Widow Royal Marines Childbirth Drawing Radio controlled airplane Deadlift Battlebots MoveOn Atomic mass Dodge Charger Menstrual cup Bicycle lighting The One (film) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma M60 machine gun Guilty Gear Headlight Strap-on dildo InuYasha (character) Boxing training Squat (exercise) Ford Thunderbird Prostate cancer Muay Thai Falconry Mountain bike Connectionism USS New Jersey (BB-62) Piano Trampoline Chinese martial arts Paragliding Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Weightlifting Fixed-wing aircraft Casualty lifting Climbing specialist (cycling) Redbone Coonhound Natural Selection (computer game) Dumbbell Puberty Devil sticks Handloading Anorexia nervosa Dieting Mark I (tank) Clean and jerk Terran (StarCraft) Humphrey Bogart Douglas DC-8 Bokken Physical attractiveness Enriched uranium Lincoln LS Saturn I Professional wrestling holds Major League Baseball television contracts Swingout Horse Golf club (equipment) Breaststroke Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Browning Model 1919 machine gun Terminal ballistics BattleTech technology Pickup truck Nuclear fusion M16 (rifle) Comparison of 21st century fighter aircraft Motorcycle Object-oriented programming Seine (fishing) Carburetor
