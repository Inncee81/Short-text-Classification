please answer real answers only today i ate blueberry bagel with butter salad w low fat ranch cinnamon roll bun things from sunnyway about cheese fries small dinner rolls piece of watermelon about how many calories did i intake and will i gain weight from eating all this i hope not because i want to try to eat healthier any advice hello with my estimate i would say just under kcal in regards to your question about whether or not you will gain weight this will depend on other factors as well such as your current height weight and age to calculate basal metabolic rate bmr which is different for everyone depending on weight and amount of lean muscle mass activity level what you did today in terms of physical activity including exercise as well as normal daily routines i e pretty much anything that involves you to move food intake amount of food you have eaten so in your case the list that you gave assuming it is accurate so to start off it sounds like you had very light meals throughout your day while being conscious of what you eat is key to healthy weight management you really have to consider other factors which play significant roles in terms of your overall weight and health going back to what i just touched on about basal metabolic rate bmr you would need to figure out what yours is depending on height weight and age regardless your value should fall somewhere between and kcal however keep in mind this is how much energy you burn just to meet the minimum requirements to function minus any additional activity so you can calculate that for yourself since i don't know your stats but a helpful website that you can use is this http www bmi calculator net bmr calculator harris benedict equation now i'm not a dietician nor doctor but from my exercise physiology knowledge i would say that if you're trying to lose weight by eating smart there are ways to eat enough to keep your satiety level satisfied while providing enough nutrients you can add a lot more fruits and vegetables to your diet without worrying about adding a significant number of calories while at the same time getting the essential nutrients found in these foods i wish i could keep writing but time is not on my side right now so to sum it up my advice to you is to not worry as much with how much you're eating while still eating sensibly and to incorporate a regular exercise routine throughout the week keep at it and don't be discouraged if you don't see immediate results as this is a common fault but after a few weeks you will be surprised at how much you have progressed if you have any further questions or need clarification don't hesitate to ask all the best to you Nutrition Anorexia nervosa Explosive material Weight training Tocopherol Folic acid Bodybuilding Veganism Milk Insulin Omega-3 fatty acid Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Super Size Me Prostate cancer Hypoglycemia Vegetarianism Calorie restriction Nutrient Diabetes mellitus Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Breakfast Calorie Jet engine Food Breastfeeding Binge eating disorder Protein Microeconomics Protein-energy malnutrition Healthy eating Low-carbohydrate diet Human height Glycemic index Hamburger Coronary heart disease Puberty Normal distribution McDonald's Chocolate Energy Hypertension Glucokinase Mass Exercise Body mass index Cuisine of Denmark Raw food diet Brain Adjustable gastric band Thermoregulation Jewish cuisine Vitamin C Nuclear fusion Sleep Fasting Urinary incontinence Growth hormone Hamster Weight Watchers Sugar substitute Growth hormone treatment Tofu Stomach cancer Crohn's disease Gross domestic product Fecal incontinence Meal Ecology Food guide pyramid Weight loss Clinical depression Escape velocity Dietary fiber Peanut butter Obstetrics Watermelon Osteoporosis Colorectal cancer Trans fat Organic food Chronic fatigue syndrome Organic farming Tooth Life insurance Terri Schiavo Alcohol fuel Diarrhea Vitamin Equine conformation Taxation in the United States Cholesterol In-N-Out Burger
