carbs make me very fatigued why help whenever i eat anything i get fatigued i notice it's worse in items with more carbs i just want to lay down and sleep i can barely stay awake right now as i am typing this i had slices of little cesars and a few bread sticks tonight and it's make me feel like i am going to pass out where i stand sit is there something wrong with me i thought carbs give you energy i ate it hours ago i don't sleep until am carbs make you sleepy because they are heavy and take a long time to digest it's true they give you energy but if you aren't an active person you will feel fatigued and you'll likely gain weight if you are eating a lot consider having less carbs and maybe right after a workout when your body is burning a lot the more carbs you eat the more water you need to drink that will help the feeling go away it could also be that little ceasers bread sticks are very fatenning loaded with sugar and oils which can also make a person feel fatigued Atkins Nutritional Approach Breakfast Low-carbohydrate diet Weight training Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Dieting South Beach diet Bong Knife Carburetor Hypoglycemia Marathon (sport) Tooth Mattress Bodybuilding Food Bread Stomach cancer Social rule Shaggy dog story Happy Tree Friends Time Out of Mind Carbohydrate Fecal incontinence Theory of conduct Mountain Dew Cannabis (drug) Chronic fatigue syndrome One Tree Hill (TV series) Binge eating disorder Narcolepsy Ekadasi Ferret Current teachings of Prem Rawat The Shining (film) Humphrey Bogart Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma 613 mitzvot Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Chocolate Dialysis Post Polio syndrome Toyota Corolla Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Characters in the Smurfs The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Hypnosis Kit Kat Sleep Sleep debt Obesity Clinical depression Sewage treatment In-N-Out Burger Sleep deprivation Domesticated turkey Coffee Methamphetamine Philosophical skepticism Rosa Parks EastEnders Sleep apnea Anorexia nervosa Gastroparesis Nutrition Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Cuisine of Brazil Ford FE engine Piccolo Junior Saga Fugu Insomnia Sauna Fasting Word of Wisdom Hydrogen economy Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Glossary of climbing terms Thor (Marvel Comics) Johnny Appleseed Hydrogen sulfide Singlish Chicken Energy drink Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Apprentice 2 Biochemistry Marie Antoinette Dairy Hiking Old wives' tale Cuisine of Denmark The Subtle Knife Lisa the Vegetarian Porridge Caffeine Sin City Brewery Urinary incontinence Ecology
