is this normal or weird ok when i am bored or sad or something like that i will eat the junk food i can find in my house and thats pretty much all i eat all day unless i go out for food which is about ish times a week but then ill be like im gonna get fat if i eat like this so i will excerise a lot is this weird im just wondering or is this like a typical teen diet im not overweight or anything im ' and its just like eating then excerising makes me feel better but then i will like pray about it that i would stop eating the junk food oh i didn say that im not looking to lose weight but the junk food is all my parents buy and now they wont buy me food i want to eat there like theres some food this is not typical teen diet at least not teen who will turn into healthy adult with healthy teeth good skin and hair and not being obese many teens eat like this because they don't know that it will start showing not necessary right a way as fat on their bodies but in their appearance pimple on pimple teens see those women with tyres around their waist and huge bumms did you also notice that they are rather ugly look when you are in grocery store what they are buying eating it is great that you excercise a lot and keep it up but quality of food you eat will show on your skin hair nails teeth and i think that you do like to look good that way too the reason why you are eating junk food in your house is probably because you don't have lot of other snack food to eat like low fat yogurts huge variety of fruit vegetables and yogurt dip there are many other easy to prepare foods you can eat the reason you feel like eating and eating is that you didn't plan on proper meals protein meat eggs canned fish cottage cheese and soy products are important as they keep your body from craving unhealthy food considering that you have internet you can search for healthy menu not reduction but suitable for keeping teen body looking great make a list of food you would like to have in the house and go shopping with your mom who is that junk food for anyway perhaps your mom will need some nudge to start buying good stuff doesn't mean expensive but healthy and tasty you are a big girl now and you should have input into what food is in the house so you have something good and healthy to eat at all times don't wait till you get bored explore internet go to public library and see their non fiction section start discovering how much you can do to have a fun and learn and see new things when you get older you will know that there is so much fun stuff to do that lifetime is not long enough to do it all good luck Food Dieting Atkins Nutritional Approach Vegetarianism Milk Garfield Healthy eating Veganism McDonald's Super Size Me Domestic rabbit Breakfast Cheese Tofu Nutrition Hamster Insulin Anorexia nervosa Obesity Teen Girl Squad Binge eating disorder Low-carbohydrate diet Ramen Japanese cuisine Cuisine of Denmark Hamburger Ice cream Watermelon Fugu Kodocha Prostate cancer Fecal incontinence Soybean Vitamin C Guinea pig Kashrut Raw food diet Meal Crohn's disease Bodybuilding Comanche Tooth Fish and chips Tomato Egg (food) Coeliac disease Livestock Little Britain Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma French cuisine Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Korean cuisine Wal-Mart Human height Fasting Hypoglycemia Adjustable gastric band Junk food Fancy rat Dietary fiber Piccolo Junior Saga Infantilism South Beach diet "Weird Al" Yankovic Invader Zim Chinese cuisine Cat Time Out of Mind Sauerkraut Food preservation Kosher foods Snack food Domesticated turkey Coronary heart disease Cuisine of Malaysia Gelatin Stomach cancer Yoghurt Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an In-N-Out Burger Jewish cuisine Trans fat German cuisine Folic acid Cantonese cuisine Chicken French fries Kim Possible Fast food Acorn Meat analogue
