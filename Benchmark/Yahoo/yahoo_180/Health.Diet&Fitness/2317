my weight has rocketed how can i deal with it help since i married my new man he likes to keep biscuits in cakes sweets and everything sweet even fizzy drinks he also likes chips and eating out all the time at first it was really nice now i'm beginning to hate the sight of food i do like these things but not all the time i suffer from depression and anxiety and when i get bad days i eat the sweet things and give in to him cooking fatty foods because i am so tired now i feel like throwing them in the bin or not eating at all i've tried telling him but he just keeps buying me chocolate it's a nightmare he won't change he says i should have more self control now i just keep crying about it i've been used to not having food like that i could control it now i'm at my weakest physically i just don't know how to organise my food i did try weight watchers but just kept on buying sweet things i gave up i do walk the dog every day but not as much as i did last year due to back problems my husband is not fat at all but i have always struggled with my weight but managed to keep it down with exercise weight loss facts low fat foods don't work you cannot lose weight using low fat diets low fat foods have been popular for more than years but yet our society is getting more overweight as each year passes this fact alone should tell you that eating a purely low fat menu is not the answer to losing weight low calorie diets don't work you won't lose weight using a low calorie dieting plan either in fact eating low calories is the worst thing that you can do to your body since that will only slow down your body's fat burning engine and ruin all chances of losing weight low calorie diets may allow a few pounds of weight loss for the first few days but then after that all weight loss comes to a halt known as a dieting plateau you can never get slim by starving yourself low carb plans don't work you'll probably find it extremely difficult to get slim using a low carb dieting plan low carb diets have recently become popular over the last couple years but the problem with low carb menus is that they are too strict and too hard to follow for average people low carb menus tend to rob your body of too much energy carbohydrates and make it nearly impossible to remain on the program for very long this is why so many dieters find it difficult to follow a strict low carbohydrate menu what about weight watchers and jenny craig dieting plans weight loss programs such as weight watchers and jenny craig usually involve slower dieting progress over a longer period of time since such programs generally promise only pounds of weight loss per week also programs such as jenny craig usually involve buying special meals and or dietary supplements during the initial phases of the program while some people may like these types of dietary programs we prefer a dieting plan which focuses on faster weight loss such as the accelerated fat burning program shown below Obesity South Beach diet Weight training Veganism Anorexia nervosa Bodybuilding Super Size Me Weight Watchers Food Healthy eating Little Britain Breastfeeding Vegetarianism Hypoglycemia Prostate cancer Milk Omega-3 fatty acid Adjustable gastric band Chocolate Binge eating disorder Calorie restriction Hamburger Fecal incontinence Ramen Carburetor Garfield Coeliac disease Insulin Hyperglycemia Urinary incontinence Glycemic index Ferret Protein-energy malnutrition Egg (food) Zone diet Calorie McDonald's Diabetes mellitus Weight loss Dietary fiber Folic acid Soft drink Bread Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Coffee Tocopherol Fasting Slim Fast Food guide pyramid Fancy rat Hamster Cuisine of the Southern United States Alcoholic beverage Chronic fatigue syndrome Hypercholesterolemia Internal ballistics Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Tank Domestic rabbit Social rule Cuisine of Denmark Brown Bear Tofu Osteoarthritis Robert Falcon Scott Coronary heart disease Multiple sclerosis Jennifer Lopez Breakfast Protein Raw food diet Hypertension RuneScape skills In-N-Out Burger Aspartame Explosive material Puberty Bipolar disorder Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Crohn's disease Fat Vitamin C Piccolo Junior Saga Acorn Word of Wisdom My Life as a Teenage Robot Space Shuttle program Sleep Marathon (sport) Billboard Hot 100 Alzheimer's disease Nuclear weapon design Meal
