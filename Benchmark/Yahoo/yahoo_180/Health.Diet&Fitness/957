can anyone suggest me a good fitness routine and food plan i am years old turning in october i am about ft and weigh kg i want to lose abit of fat especially of my stomach and thigh area i go to the gym but it hasn't really made much difference when i go gym i usually jog for mins do some stomach work outs on a ball and do about mins of stepping or something i eat healthy aswell i think the problem might be that i eat too much healthy things like fruit any suggestions how to begin choose an activity that you enjoy the best exercise for you is the one you'll actually do not the one you think you should do walking is a great place to start since it doesn't require special equipment and you can do it anywhere but you can try any activity that involves some type of continuous movement like cycling swimming running aerobics rowing stairclimbing etc start with or days of your chosen activity a week with a rest day between workouts begin with a minute warm up of light cardio to gradually increase heart rate increase your pace and intensity to slightly harder than comfortable about a level or on the perceived exertion scale or you can use target heart rate to monitor intensity and go as long as you comfortably can begin where you are not where you want to be you may only be able to exercise for a few minutes at a time but that will change quickly if you're consistent end each workout with a cool down of light cardio and stretch the muscles you've worked to relax and keep your muscles flexible each week increase your workout time by a few minutes until you can work continuously for minutes a session don't worry about distance or pace for the first few weeks focus on showing up for your workouts and building time you have plenty of time to work on your speed and distance after weeks change your routine by adding another day of exercise increasing your pace intensity adding a new activity and or increasing the amount of time you exercise Exercise Triathlon Bodybuilding Heart rate Dieting Aerobic exercise Insulin Urinary incontinence Breastfeeding Running Equine conformation Parachuting Coronary heart disease Strap-on dildo Myocardial infarction Prostate cancer Bicycle Fast bowling Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 STS-62 Heart Chronic fatigue syndrome Atkins Nutritional Approach Volleyball Anorexia nervosa Obstetrics Sleep Fecal incontinence Obesity Hamster Puberty Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Cardiac arrhythmia Archery Extreme Programming Sauna Iliotibial band syndrome Aerial (dance move) Marathon (sport) Muscle Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) STS-61 Electrophysiology Tai Chi Chuan Dialysis Eye Aikido Car handling Hypoglycemia Drowning Natural Selection (computer game) Welding Cheese Surveillance Physical attractiveness Internal ballistics TGV Chinese martial arts Japanese tea ceremony Carbon dioxide 1957 World Series Clinical depression Vegetarianism Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Keynesian economics Mattress Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Breaststroke DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution Solar variation Action potential Cardiovascular disease Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX Milton H.
