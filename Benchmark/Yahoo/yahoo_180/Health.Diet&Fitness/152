is this my plan something attainable pls pls read well am years old weigh about lbs but want to go down to lbs i have tried some diets and they dont seem to work i dont stick to them so now am thinking i need to overlook the whole 'more of this less of that' concept of things and just eat a balanced diet i know it wont be easy because i definately eat more junkie type food than healthy the majority of the time i want to begin with moderating my eating first then incorparate the excersice in so it wont be overwhelming i think that my poor health affects me negatively mentally sometimes am in a bad mood for no reason my esteem isnt the worst but it could be better and am not motivated for anything physically i dont get enough sleep so that makes me stressed very irritable fragile hair bland skin socially confidence to interact with everyone etc so am opting for a lifestyle change instead of just solely for weightloss but an overall improvement do you think my goals are too far fetched thanks in advance the only way a true diet can work is if you truly want it to you have to change your thinking stop with the junk food and eat more fresh fruit and vegetables stop drinking sodas replace them with water get at least hours of sleep a day and before you start an exercise program see your doctor remember you are what you eat if you feel like crap all the time perhaps a diet change is just what you need i am not a doctor but i am living proof of what a true diet and exercise program can do for you i weighed over lbs and ate nothing but fast food plus my sleep patterns were very irregular my doctor put me on blood pressure medication and my weight was causing sleep apnea that was months ago today i am proud to say that i have lost over lbs and my diet now consists of fish chicken and fresh fruits i have stopped the dr pepper habit and now drink over ounces of water daily plus i now run over miles a day take it from an old washed up year old guy if i can change then anybody can it is all in the mind you have to want to change first the rest just falls into place Dieting Hypoglycemia Urinary incontinence Obesity Fecal incontinence Vegetarianism Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Stomach cancer Clinical depression Food Anorexia nervosa Chronic fatigue syndrome Super Size Me Vitamin C Alcoholism Folic acid Hypertension Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Insomnia Raw food diet Adjustable gastric band Breakfast Scientology beliefs and practices Coffee Jewish cuisine Sleep Fancy rat Pound Fasting Alcoholics Anonymous Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Prostate cancer Hamster Nutrition Bodybuilding Binge eating disorder Hamburger Garfield Hypnosis Colorectal cancer Human Coronary heart disease Addiction Insulin Domestic rabbit Ramen Sleep apnea Alcoholic beverage Vegetarianism and religion Dog Happiness Low-carbohydrate diet Simone Weil Objectivist philosophy Stuttering Tlingit Bipolar disorder The Wack Pack Common cold Buddhism Borderline personality disorder Fugu Cirrhosis Infantilism Diabetes mellitus Stroke Eczema Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an 613 mitzvot Ecology Autism Tobacco smoking Tea Chocolate Cardiovascular disease Migraine Dietary fiber Dairy Cuisine of Africa Puberty Stress (medicine) Natural health Mental illness Japanese tea ceremony Psychosis MyPyramid Medicine
