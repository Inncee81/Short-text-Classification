i want lbs gone fast any suggestions tips plans thankss i'm now i want to be and i'll be happy i'm a short girl ' what are ways for me to loose lbs in about a month what foods are best to eat when loosing weight basically i'd like to know any useful information on weight loss thank you you think ' is short i'm ' and nearly and told all the time how thin i am though i'm a little heavy for what i like i like to be about i like to be very skinny seriously you want a good way to lose weight ok number one start doing exercises at least every couple few days with weights to build muscle next calculate you bmi basal metabolic rate or amount of calories you burn per day by just breathing using a simple bmi website there are a few different methods you can choose which you like best they are mostly similar but remember the more thorough the more accurate you can then apply a formula usually included in the whole formula or calculation on the website that allows you to factor in the activity you do in you bmi sedentary would be someone lying in the hospital or on her couch lightly active is going to work etc not much and it goes up from there so you can now establish how many calories a day you burn and how much food you need to eat per day in order to maintain your weight if you eat calories less than that bmi number every day you will lose lb a week because there are calories in a pound and seven days in a week if you somehow burned calories more than you consumed in one day which is would be extremely tough you would lose one pound in one day it's all simple arithmetic people make it much harder than it really is if you'd rather not cut out what you eat so much just up your exercise time vigor or both remember many people disregard the science of weight loss and simplicity of it to their own detriment it's as simple as what goes in must come out since we all already burn a certain number of calories by living exercise isn't even required to lose weight it is just the healthy and smart way to do it a lot of people claim that once you don't eat your body goes into 'starvation mode' and metabolism stops but i ask you this then why are anorectics skinny simply because even if your metabolism goes down you will be burning calories and if you are not eating you will always be burning more calories than you are taking in best of luck Dieting Obesity Anorexia nervosa Atkins Nutritional Approach Weight training Breastfeeding Super Size Me Low-carbohydrate diet Swimming Binge eating disorder Hypoglycemia Bodybuilding Weight loss Body mass index Weight Watchers Adjustable gastric band Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Explosive material Urinary incontinence Calorie restriction Ton Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Nutrition Equine conformation Body type (exercise) Diabetes mellitus ELO rating system Gastric bypass surgery Calorie Protein-energy malnutrition Jet engine Milk Fecal incontinence Energy Extreme Programming Aikido Microeconomics Gross domestic product Welding First aid Folic acid Normal distribution Piccolo Junior Saga Thermoregulation Tofu Knife Theory of conduct MyPyramid Carburetor Healthy eating Physical attractiveness Fasting Stomach cancer Dietary fiber Space Shuttle program Spacecraft propulsion Hamburger Health insurance Fertility awareness Muscle Enzyme Alcoholic beverage Economics Clinical depression Pro-ana Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Little Britain Commodity markets Aerobic exercise Omega-3 fatty acid Internal ballistics Guinea pig Bread CPU design Glycogen storage disease type I Tocopherol Mixed martial arts Terminal ballistics Exercise Life extension Computer Insulin resistance Tyrannosaurus rex Weight Unemployment Glucocorticoid Cocaine Inflation Mnemonic Tank Compiler optimization Surplus product Carbon dioxide Tooth Creatine
