help with diet i'm years old about feet tall and weigh lbs ive heard its harder to loose weight after i hate to exercise its too darn hot to do that whats a good way to loose a few pounds and get some exercise i dont eat junk food btw i think your weight is great right now especially for your age but if you want weight loss info the only variable you can really control is exercise find a method exercise that you enjoy and do it every day the key is to try something until you like it and look forward to it find at least three things that you really like if you need help with motivation download some music or podcasts or books on tape to enjoy while you work out build muscle eat what you want when you are actually hungry and stop before you are stuffed full try to eat a balanced diet but don't limit yourself with a bunch or rules and diets diets don't work and are unhealthy in the long run only do things that are healthy and that you can do forever for the rest of your life like cutting fast food forever percent of dieters gain it all back in one year and percent do in two years dieting is associated with weight gain over a long period of time and it makes it harder to lose weight again after each diet which is one of the reasons it's hard for older people to lose weight they've already ticked off their bodies you need at least to calories every day just to perform basic bodily functions if women like you learned to love their bodies a billion dollar industry that cashes in on insecurities and making people feel like they are not good enough would collapse quite frankly being a little fat isn't as unhealthy as being thin anybody who thinks diets or restricting food types is a good idea is uneducated about the human body short cuts do not work most of the weight you lose is water weight for health eat a balanced diet and exercise for the health and endorphins and forget about an ideal shape the average age a girl starts dieting is women are on a diet at any given time us women are unsatisfied with their appearance your body has a set point weight that it wants to be if you starve yourself the body will fight back by lowering the metabolism to maintain it's ideal weight limit your tv viewing tv commercials send out a message about attractiveness in this brainwashed society that has been seeing images of beautiful skinny women and mocking chubby people it's worse for women look at the number of average or uglier guys on tv and in movies versus the number of women percent of women in a study rated their ideal shape and it turned out to be percent underweight julia roberts and cameron diaz meet the clinical requirements for anorexia and so do of playboy centerfolds if the flippin mannequins became real women they wouln't be able to menstruate women finally get some rights but we limit ourselves like this and our bodies are reduced to objects we inspect and criticise men decide to only value women for their looks and a thin attractive wife symbolizes social status for them girls call each other fat as the greatest insult they can muster when did fat become worse than cruel stupid dishonest lazy or cowardly when did chubby start to mean the last four of those things we are killing our daughters and wasting our lives trying to meet an ideal that blows i wish women would get together and fight it instead of letting others control us like this unless you are considered obese or have a bmi of over don't worry about it love your body and your confidence will light up the room and give other women permission to love themselves too Binge eating disorder Physical attractiveness Super Size Me Low-carbohydrate diet Equine conformation Bodybuilding Human height Nutrition Milk Breastfeeding Garfield Urinary incontinence Prostate cancer Swimming Body mass index Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Friends Sin City Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Body image Weight loss Vegetarianism Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Little Britain Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Diabetes mellitus Diamond EastEnders Insulin Folic acid Veganism Kodocha Microeconomics Humphrey Bogart Kashrut Simone Weil Sexual orientation Trans fat Puberty Social rule God Emperor of Dune Shaggy dog story Theory of conduct Carburetor Cancer Abortion debate Clinical depression Stomach cancer Mixed martial arts Unemployment Vitamin C Overpopulation Tai Chi Chuan Make money fast Exercise Megan Griffin Deflation (economics) Married... with Children Stem cell Fecal incontinence Calorie restriction Fast food Guinea pig Healthy eating Gold standard Human Fancy rat Coeliac disease Cat Body type (exercise) Coronary heart disease Fasting Knife Babe Ruth The Critic Transsexuality Piccolo Junior Saga Milton H.
