drinking water while dieting i've been excercising to lose weight and i got sweaty if i drink water wouldn't that be like putting tat sweat back in my body if i drink a lot of water would i gain a lot of weight how does it work water suppresses the appetite naturally and helps the body metabolize fat studies have shown that a decrease in water intake will cause fat deposits to increase while an increase in water intake can actually reduce fat deposits here's why the kidneys can't function properly without enough water when they don't work to capacity some of their load is dumped onto the liver one of the liver's primary functions is to metabolize stored fat into usable energy for the body but if the liver has to do some of the kidney's work it can't operate at full throttle as a result it metabolizes less fat more fat remains stored in the body and weight loss stops drinking enough water is the best treatment for fluid retention when the body gets less water it perceives this as a threat to survival and begins to hold onto every drop water is stored in the extra cellular spaces outside the cell walls this shows up as swollen feet legs and hands diuretics offer a temporary solution at best they force out stored water along with some essential nutrients again the body perceives a threat and will replace the lost water at the first opportunity thus the condition quickly returns the best way to overcome the problem of water retention is to give your body what it needs plenty of water only then will stored water be released the overweight person needs more water than the thin one larger people have larger metabolic loads since we know that water is the key to fat metabolism it follows that the overweight person needs more water water helps maintain proper muscle tone it does this by giving muscles their natural ability to contract and by preventing dehydration it also helps to prevent the sagging skin that usually follows weight loss shrinking cells are buoyed by water which plumps the skin and leaves it clear healthy and resilient water helps rid the body of wastes during weight loss the body has a lot more waste to get rid of all that metabolized fat must be shed again adequate water helps flush out waste water can help relieve constipation when the body gets too little water it siphons what it needs from internal sources the colon is one primary source result constipation but when a person drinks enough water normal bowel function usually returns Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Insulin Folic acid Weight training Water Urinary incontinence Nutrition Gout Prostate cancer Protein-energy malnutrition Hypoglycemia Fecal incontinence Dehydration Anorexia nervosa Glucocorticoid Diabetic ketoacidosis Milk Stomach cancer Bodybuilding Glycogen storage disease type I Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Dialysis Protein Puberty Growth hormone treatment Colorectal cancer Breastfeeding Chronic fatigue syndrome Fancy rat Equine conformation Creatine Carburetor Pneumonia Multiple sclerosis Hiking Clinical depression Kidney Hyperthermia Thermoregulation Marathon (sport) Chlorpromazine Homeostasis Swimming Diarrhea Alcoholism Low-carbohydrate diet Osteoarthritis Nutrient Exercise First aid Psoriasis Eutrophication Traumatic brain injury Atherosclerosis Urinary system Caffeine Amiodarone Acute renal failure Paracetamol Childbirth DNA repair Urine Hamster Sewage treatment Skin Stroke Cell (biology) Wood Mesothelioma Carpal tunnel syndrome Liver Jet engine Mattress Vitamin C Hypertension Eye Hemorrhoid Decompression sickness Biochemistry 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Siphon Epilepsy Acne Dietary fiber Ketosis Constipation Chlorophyta Alzheimer's disease
