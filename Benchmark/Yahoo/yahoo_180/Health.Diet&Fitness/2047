someone help me healthily lose a bit of weight please i would like to lose some weight for the sake of being healthier and feeling better i am yrs old ' and weight lbs so i already know that i am overweight and i really want to change that by losing about lbs not over a short amount of time but gradually i start college in a year so i'd like to be down some by then but i want to do it healthy i am currently working as a cna in a nursing home so i get lots of exercise there also i wake up every morning and walk which is usually about miles in an hour then i go to work and i come home and do more miles before i go to bed and start all over again is this all i really need to do do i need to do more what kind of quick and easy things can i do for breakfast lunch when i'm working also my family is very big on family suppers and whatnot so i want to kinda eat what they make can you help me please i'd appreciate it pip my guess is that your family will be the big problem here that can be overcome but you'll have to steel yourself against the inevitable disapproval that will come your way from stepping out of your accustomed role it can be done but you'll have to do it deliberately first about the food since you want to lose weight and want to get down to about the place to start would be with the rule of ten ten times your weight in calories is what you should eat each day since you want to weigh then eat calories each day how to do that get a copy of the calorie a day cookbook and follow it there are lots of little books the calorie king is one that will help you count the calories you eat whether at home or at a restaurant to help you keep to your limit or you could get a copy of dean ornish's book from several years ago everyday cooking with dr dean ornish mind you he's vegetarian but there's nothing wrong with that especially since you can eat more and weigh less as one you could visit the life extension websites or the cron calorie restriction with optimum nutrition website and get lots of ideas about eating less while eating well from them too but and this is a big but don't laugh it's not much of a joke if you lose weight for the wrong reason depend on it you will gain it all back the wrong reason to lose weight eh isn't that why i'm doing this yes and no note that you want to weigh less but you want to do it for health's sake bravo keep that firmly in your mind for now and for forever because you're going to need to remember it always the diet you are about to embark on will be what you will eat for the rest of your life so do it for that reason your present lifestyle and diet made you need to lose weight so you have to change all that all that when you let your family know this at first they may smile indulgently little pippy is in another phase isn't little pippy that's cute want another doughnut but soon when tehy decide that you really mean it they will not be so happy about it that's when you have to put your foot down and refuse to fit the role you have been in for the last years whenever we step out of an accustomed role we disturb the family equilibrium and they react negatively i've been eating ornish vegetarian for h'm about years now and my wife still gets a little snippy about being a bother at mealtime sorry lass i plan to be around a lot longer so get used to it again that's going to have to be your attitude as long as you're not self righteous about it and remind others about the right way to eat which they will interpret as your saying why don't you eat right like smart i do and quite understandably resent it as long as you quite happily let others do at the table what they've always done you'll eventually be all right they will slowly get used to it another equilibrium will be established and everybody will be happy again eat the veggies they serve stay away from anything with oil or fat or butter in it including cheese oh brother check out the calories in cheese it's horrifying because these things will have a bucketful of calories in them you can eat a little meat but a piece no bigger than a deck of cards and remember that you're going to spend most of your day just a little hungry for a while eventually you'll get used to it but it will take a few months and during that time you'll be susceptible to the occasional binge evenings will be the worst that's ok don't become discouraged get back on your diet and learn to recognize danger signs and stay away from what causes you problems oh and know that sugar is actually addictive it energizes the endogenous opioid systems in our brains that is it makes us secrete our own little morphine like substances which we like a lot so stay completely away from sugar until you have gone cold turkey from it now what i do for breakfast is very simple i have an open faced sandwich with soy butter on it there's nothing magical about soy butter i just like its taste it's like a very mild peanut butter and it's low fat nature that's it for a mid morning snack i need one with a pseudobreakfast like that i have fruit usually an apple for lunch i eat very little usually a few handfuls of a mixture of roasted soybeans dried cranberries sunflower seeds or almonds and raisins not much of this because it will contain more calories than i feel it will what with the nuts in it for an afternoon snack when i have one which isn't always i have more fruit for dinner i make something nonfat and low calorie tonight i made faki a greek lentil soup sauteing the onions in water not oil and cornbread with applesauce not oil dinner was very nearly nonfat all the way around right now i'm having a cup of hot chocolate but i make it the ancient mayan way a tablespoon and a half of baking cocoa powder just enough splenda to take away the bitterness not quite the same amount of splenda as cocoa and a dash of cayenne pepper once i got used to its character it's more like coffee than the dessert cocoa we americans are used to i grew to like it i have it all the time it has very few calories in it and i found out why a spanish explorer called it the drink that banishes hunger it really does and on this diet i can run miles a week that should do for a start good luck oh yes stay away from cleansing or detox or any of the other popular frauds which is waht they are they work only because they cut down on calories which is what you're doing anyway that's why any diet that works does work every diet is a variation on one of two basic diets low fat high carb or low carb high fat they all work for losing weight because they all cut down on calories the low fat diet is the one that studies have shown will lower your ldls and triglycerides while helping you lose weight so it the best one for long term
