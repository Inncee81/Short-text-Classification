what should a person eat daily what should i eat in my situation we're always told that we should eat a certain amount of 'this' or 'that' that if we essentially eat certain foods we'll not be hungry i'm wondering what particular is needed by ones body e g how much protein iron carbohydrates sugar fat etc if one could create the ideal pill that had it all within and would satify ones hunger what would this miracle pill contain i'd like to think i could eat something that will damper my hunger i workout mostly to gain mass and i am i'd like to think i can eat certain foods to eliminate the constant hunger and gain more efficiency out of what i eat generally i eat a lot lean protein relatively high carbs alot of fruit with protein vitamin supplements when i work out what do you think i can contribute to my eating habits that will lessen my hunger i find myself eating at in the morning or waking up with a grumbling stomach how can i win this endless battle of hunger well it sounds like you're not doing too badly just make sure that the high amount of carbs are good for you eat things like kidney beans black beans sweet potatoes real whole grains from a bakery try rye it's an acquired taste brown rice old fashioned oatmeal it only takes minutes to cook this is instead of baked beans corn white rice noodes pasta other than whole wheat white potatoes white breads biscuits pancakes and quick oatmeal when you say lots of fruit if it's more than pieces a day for a man that s too much and for a woman no more than you didn't mention salads but they're important for many different reasons lettuce can act as a mild natural blood thinner it sounds like you might need to add a little fat to your diet add it in the form of a little olive oil also a controlled snack a little while before bedtime a small one maybe ten raw almonds might keep you from raiding the fridge in the wee hours of the morning if you are not losing weight with what your eating or at least maintaining you weight then check that your portions of protein are no more than oz per serving for a man oz for a woman if you're eating out then bring home a doggie bag or simply leave it on your plate those portions are hugh just a few adjustments will do the trick good luck Atkins Nutritional Approach Jewish cuisine Bread German cuisine Dieting Potato Vegetarianism Japanese cuisine Hamster Low-carbohydrate diet Tofu Milk Flour Hamburger Cuisine of the Southern United States Peruvian cuisine Hot dog Cuisine of Brazil Folic acid Chocolate Obesity Tocopherol Hypoglycemia Bodybuilding Food preservation Coffee Soul food Pancake Soy milk Food guide pyramid Cuisine of Malaysia Weight training Cuisine of the Philippines Adjustable gastric band South Beach diet Vegetarian cuisine Peanut Bengali cuisine Fecal incontinence Vitamin C Pasta French cuisine Nutrition Chinese cuisine Insulin Common bean Coeliac disease Pizza Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Egg (food) Ramen Domesticated turkey Vegetarian nutrition Cereal Cuisine of Argentina Dumpling Rice Roman eating and drinking Rice pudding Fancy rat Guinea pig Korean cuisine Alcoholic beverage Passover Fasting MRE Cajun cuisine Salad Cuisine of Turkey Protein-energy malnutrition Chili con carne Healthy eating Soybean Marmite Cuisine of Singapore Organic food Famine Raw food diet Potato chips Dietary fiber Binge eating disorder Cheese Barbecue Vitamin French fries Vitamin D Street food Cassava Anorexia nervosa Beer
