is skipping a good cardio workout in combination with my yoga exercises will this be adequate exercise to help keep me in shape skipping is a good cardio workout if you do it long enough my tip would be to purchase a skipping rope that has a timer calorie counter and how many laps you have achieved you can buy these from argos or even next next is a cute pink colour i have it also do this before you begin your yoga this is because if the body has not warmed up or burnt any calories the toning exercises wont work as well meaning it will only touch the top layer of fat and not work on the muscle i was always confused regarding how to tone up i was doing sit ups a day and nothing was happening until i began to do them after aerobics now i on the verge of having a four pack wahoo good luck and nice to hear so many keeping up with fitness i love it Weight training Bodybuilding Exercise Aerobic exercise Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Calorie Dieting USS Wahoo (SS-238) Physical fitness Swimming Yoga Les Mills Obesity Physical attractiveness Asana Atkins Nutritional Approach Anorexia nervosa Triathlon Bubble Bobble Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Human position Snooker Violin Electric guitar Muscle Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 2 Boxing training Internal ballistics Textile manufacturing Massage Insulin Trumpet Sailing Climbing equipment Urinary incontinence Equine conformation 24 (television) Sexercises Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX Mattress Counterpoint Bikram Yoga Professional wrestling holds Running Taekwondo Bhagavad Gita Life extension Body type (exercise) Bonnie J.
