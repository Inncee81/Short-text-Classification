how do u kno if you are anorexic because i think i am but trust meeeeeee i cant help it i weigh lbs and im ' ana i know you can't help it if you are anorexic because anorexia nervosa is a disease and you are not crazy either but if you really think you are anorexic you can help yourself by telling someone you are sick need help try your parents or an older sister if they will listen if they won't try the school nurse or guidance counselor call the family doctor if you have to but talk to as many people as you have to until someone listens to you takes you seriously the faster you get help the easier it is to treat once you get beyond a certain point it's extremely hard to treat believe me i know there is something called pre anorexia that's when you are thin but feel very fat want to lose weight you get obsessed with diets exercise you keep trying diets but fortunately don't stick to them so you are not actively losing more more weight i hope you are only at that stage if you recognize yourself like this you need to get into counseling fast before something comes along and acts as a trigger to send you into hard core anorexia have you ever heard of aa that's alcoholics anonymous where people who have a problem with drinking go for help there's a similar meeting called oa overeaters anonymous which is for people having trouble eating too much oa has a branch of meetings for anorexics and bulimics too these meetings are free and of course anonymous you do not have to talk if you don't want to you can just listen how do you know if you are anorexic technically you have lost to of your body weight though i believe it occurs before you have lost that much weight you start to weigh yourself each day and you plan out your meals for each day you exercise obsessively you believe you only want to lose more pounds then when you get there you feel it's too easy to put the weight back on so you decide to lose just more to have room for a little weight gain this continues with you finding another reason to lose more weight it's rationalizing sick behavior the very dangerous point is when you reach a certain low weight it's different with each patient something in your brain changes and when you look in the mirror you literally can no longer see how thin you are i don't mean the way most people women especially look in their mirrors don't like certain things they see they can still see what they look like they're just not happy with the way some things are but an anorexic can not see the real person even if she is skin bones that's when it becomes incredibly difficult to treat but not impossible without treatment many anorexics die if they don't outright die they are often left with serious heart defects kidney problems liver problems much more the thing is that the reason people become anorexic is not because they feel fat that's just the substitute for the real problems what they are really looking for is control because deep inside they feel they have no control they feel helpless frightened don't know what to do so when they lose some weight it makes them feel good and all of a sudden they have something that they can control their weight so the emotions they battle with over their weight become the substitute for the emotions they can't handle in their life but if you tell this to an active anorexic they will think you're nuts they are in complete denial this is why therapy is absolutely necessary ana i won't go into my personal story it would take too long and the issue is about you now i see your height weight and you do not need me to tell you that you are thin i will say do not lose any more and i will say that if you think you are anorexic you are starting to reach out you are very smart doing the right thing there is nothing to be ashamed about in asking for help it shows courage and a desire to live i hope you get the help you need if there is a problem get help for it now before you are no longer able to see that you have a problem i wish you the best of luck Binge eating disorder Prostate cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Alcoholics Anonymous Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Bulimia nervosa Nicomachean
