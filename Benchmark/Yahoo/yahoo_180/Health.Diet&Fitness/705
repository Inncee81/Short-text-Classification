i'm yrs old ' '' and lbs how much lbs should i lose to be slim and not chubby plz don say i'm not fator other stuff cuz u haven't seen me so plz also give some good ideas on how i can also quit eating junk food thanx although i dont think you are fat because i am almost and ' and lbs and am in pretty good shape due to cardiovascular and karate activity daily but since it does matter on specifics i can understand why you want to tone up well its har din the beginning i would know becaus ei used to be bigger but once you eliminate most junk food you no longer desire it or you feel guilty after eating it you need moderate activity throughout the day and consume less calories than you burn as for excercise about an hour of moderate to heavy activity is a goos start for weight loss but you do need to find somehting that you enjoy for example play sports run dance etc anything that gets you moving also having a friend buddy up with you is great motivation since humans are naturally competetive anyhow as for food you still have to make sure you are eating enough so your body doesnt go into starvation mood and the reverse effect takes place eat lean protein such as grilled chicken and fish and eat tons of fruits and veggies throughout the day also remember to drink plenty of water if you are asking the specifics well i can give you the plan i use every morning i go out for a mile run jog walk intervals and i use the staristepper for about minutes and then its off to weights for target areas and then ab excercises my diet is made up of health food brands such as kashi and any organics i also keep my fridge filled with veggies and fruits i snack on throughout the day i also eat lean cuisines if im in a pinch for time although they are quite high in sodium just start off slowly when you try to eliminate junk food you still need to eat it sometimes so you can keep yourself happy about once a week such as friday nights with your guy or friends good luck and if yo uneed any advice eating plans excercises just contact me as i have taken courses for physical fitness and nutrition Dieting Atkins Nutritional Approach Nutrition Weight training Obesity Food Bodybuilding Hypoglycemia Fasting Veganism Vegetarianism Tofu Breastfeeding Super Size Me Tocopherol Calorie restriction Anorexia nervosa Breakfast Low-carbohydrate diet Dietary fiber Omega-3 fatty acid Protein Life extension Hamburger Junk food South Beach diet Taboo food and drink Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Adjustable gastric band Raw food diet Folic acid Garfield Social rule Exercise Hormone replacement therapy (trans) MRE MyPyramid Fecal incontinence Marathon (sport) Ramen Weight loss Stomach cancer Cuisine of Denmark Organic food Meal Calorie Protein-energy malnutrition Coronary heart disease Guinea pig Insulin Fugu Hamster Vitamin C Kashrut Cuisine of the Philippines Alcoholic beverage Word of Wisdom Sewage treatment Sleep Japanese cuisine Peruvian cuisine Cliff Richard Kosher foods Time Out of Mind McDonald's Chocolate Fast food Hiking Kodocha Nicomachean Ethics Puberty Dog Prostate cancer Homer Simpson Strap-on dildo German cuisine Korean cuisine Weight Watchers Elephant Cuisine of Brazil Equine conformation Japanese tea ceremony Clinical depression Diarrhea Binge eating disorder Little Britain Vegetarian cuisine Vegetarianism and religion Fancy rat
