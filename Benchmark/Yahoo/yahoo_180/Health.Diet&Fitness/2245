gained weight slowly from birthcontrol and i stopped smoking question in the details okay i stopped smoking and started birthcontrol around the same time last year first thing the weight looks great on me i'm not lbs instead of trust me i look better but i'm not rich and was wondering if there was a way to trim down my belly and thighs as of now i use a stepper machine and i do a lot of hiking i don't want them to lose a lot of weight just enough so my close don't cut my ciruculation off while i'm at work i have put aside a clothing fund to get something new from each pay check but that still takes time and as more time goes on the more tight my cloths get oh yeah i do sit ups and crunches and leg lifts to am i working out to much on my legs other then the wait game is there anything else that i could do i really dont want to lose the weight well a little untill i can get a new line of clothing i was not expecting to gain lbs but now that is' here i don't want it to go you are confusing me if you want to fit into your old clothes you have to lose some weight if you like your weight which sounds absolutely fine you have to get new clothes exercising is good and will help your body look great and distribute the weight more evenly and you should do it but the overall volume will not change so the clothes will have to change otherwise you must get on a balanced diet together with teh exercise Weight training Professional wrestling holds Social rule Triathlon Professional wrestling throws Suplex Poker jargon Swingout Dieting Milton H.
