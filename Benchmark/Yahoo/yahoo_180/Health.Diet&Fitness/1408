losing weight while gaining muscle is this possible ok i'm trying to lose some extra pounds so i'm running and walking and eating healthier counting calories etc and i'm just wondering if these may cancel each other out i mean muscle weighs more than fat right and if i try to lose weight by eating healthy then go out and run everyday i'll just be gaining i know about looking toned and what not but i'm a stickler for the number on the scale will i ever see it go down any advice for seeing a change in number going down thank you you can loose inches while gaining muscle like the difference between a brick and a bed pillow the pillow is bigger the brick is small but weighs lots more however muscle is very very difficult to build it takes long hours in the gym lifting weights you might be confusing the weight gain you see on the scale with water weight our bodies are mostly water and that water fluctuates up and down all week long from day to day you can loose and gain anywhere up to pounds a day by the water in your tissues etc if you watch what you eat and keep walking running you are going to loose stay off the scale and watch what your clothes feel like when your clothes are baggy i mean really baggy then and only then get back on the scale and see what you lost the scale is a trap to cause you to loose heart kick it to the curb hang in there Dieting Weight training Super Size Me Obesity Breastfeeding Bodybuilding Anorexia nervosa Muscle Mattress Weight Exercise Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma First aid Triathlon Insulin Weight loss Swimming Garfield Adjustable gastric band Urinary incontinence Weighing scale Hormone replacement therapy (trans) U.S. customary units Golden Plates Jackass: The Movie Sperm Whale Equine conformation Skateboarding trick Professional wrestling holds Puberty Growth hormone treatment Elephant American lobster Pound Stomach cancer Marathon (sport) Guinea pig Tightlacing Gray Wolf Diabetes mellitus Massage Mass Prostate cancer Hyperthermia Milk Professional wrestling match types Fecal incontinence Milton H.
