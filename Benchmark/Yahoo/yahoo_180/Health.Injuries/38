burned my leg how long will it blister up and what should i do i burned my leg a week ago by touching the pipe on a motor cycle it keeps blistering up and i keep pushing on the now dead skin to drain it it is right above my ankle so when i walk it hurts it feels like the skin in the inside is tighening up and when i walk it does not stop hurting until i walk for a good while but the minute i stop walking and start again it starts hurting again i am now using neosporin in it but i was told the dead skin is protecting it for now im scared to take a bath i take showers instead because the hot water might make it hurt worse how long will this go on i want to pill the skin off so bad and just start putting some cocoa butter on it i have some homemade cocoa butter at home what else can i do to keep it from hurting as i move my foot around do you by chance have an aloe vera plant they are truly amazing with regard to healing i keep one on hand at my house and when we get burned i will cut off a leaf cut it open then lay it on the wound and put tape on around it and leave it overnight it is amazing because aloe not only helps with the pain it also speeds up the healing it is worth a try Aloe Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Piccolo Junior Saga Wound Tattoo Swimming Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling holds Sunburn Diving Hiking Wound healing phases Milton H.
