dealing with workman's compensation my husband got hurt on the job two years ago he was covered by workman's comp he was able to go back to work but now because of his injury awhile ago he has two disintegrating discs in his back and has to have surgery we are worried that wc will not cover everything to meet our bills when he goes on disability recovery could be lengthy also the question has come up that he might not ever be able to go back to his job what then i just have no idea about workman's comp i guess really a lawyer would be best but i am scared the cost could be alot in the case of workman's compensation an attorney will usually work for of any settlement when it is finally reached so you aren't paying them anything until then they won't accept cases they don't feel they can't win because of this but your husband sounds like he has a solid case so you really should get an attorney involved in this as soon as possible Workers' compensation Tort reform Plame affair Appeal Paula Jones Eliot Spitzer Hillary Rodham Clinton Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Knots Landing Pittsburgh Steelers Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Sin City Asbestos Dutch Schultz Rosa Parks Exploitation Contract John Edwards EastEnders Insurance Karl Rove Dead Like Me Divorce Modernization of Sweden Supreme Court of the United States Steve Jobs Medicare (Canada) Medical malpractice Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Graduate school Fathers' rights Paul Hackett Time Out of Mind Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Terri Schiavo Blue Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Nine Inch Nails Little Britain Rain Man Democratic Party (United States) Attorney's fee Katelyn Faber Plame affair timeline Transsexuality Lawyer Israeli settlement Attorney at Law MAME Singlish The Shining (film) Social rule The O.C.
