injured knee a years ago i injured my knee in a softball game and since then it hurts if i move it in a wrong way or sometimes just starts to hurt not unbeariable pain does anyone know what thi is i say you have it checked out by a doctor because sometimes injuries show up later after it occurs sometimes the injury isn't bad to begin with but it could be one that has gotten worse over time my friends horse slipped in the mud and landed on her right leg her knee was fine she could walk it was all good but ever since it aches so i suggest you go to a doctor like she did before the problem gets even worse to wear it is unbearable i asked my mother about this she is a registered nurse Milton H.
