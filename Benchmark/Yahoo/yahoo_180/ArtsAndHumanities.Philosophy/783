what are we doing well that question has many components to it i suppose probably a bunch you didn't want me to discuss but i'm bored so i guess i will anyways on a cellular level we are respirating converting oxygen and glucose into carbon dioxide water and energy which we stick into adp molecules so our cells can divide neurons can fire and our muscles can move speaking of which we are also twitching very slightly as our muscle fibers relax and contract on a more organ based level we are filtering several chemicals from our bodies and sending them to our bladders i'm guessing that there's some tuna moving around somewhere in my large intestines right now we are also cleaning our blood as our heart pumps it through our bodies the marrow in our bones is creating red and white blood cells i've always wondered why it was in our bones guess something had to go there and more bone was just boring which promptly go off to either transport nutrients or to join the never ending war we wage against viruses and bacteria also on that subject we are excreting mucus from our sinuses which either drips down our throats to protect our stomach from its own acid or goes into our noses to retard the progress of invading organisms our ears also are producing wax for the same purpose though there are several other bodily functions that we are doing i'll move on now to the grander concept of we we are striving towards some evolutionary imperative that we have come to call happiness we are trying to survive we are trying to improve we are trying to continue the species we are expending thousands of joules in an effort to maintain a base level of fahrenheit in our core had to throw that one in there Biochemistry Lung Carbon dioxide Cellular respiration Photosynthesis Muscle Circulatory system Carnivorous plant Human physiology Autonomic nervous system Blood Ecology Red blood cell Stem cell Cancer Lymphatic system Pneumonia Protein Skeletal muscle Nutrition Bone Biology Hemoglobin Stomach Stomach cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Kidney Pulmonary alveolus Homeostasis Brewery Glycolysis Enzyme Drowning Medicine Glucose Skin DNA repair Energy development Bacteria Common cold Cerebellum Chronic fatigue syndrome Reptile Wound healing phases Life Brain Hydrochloric acid Anemia Nitric oxide Virus Atherosclerosis Weight training Digestion Poliomyelitis Motility Respiratory system Carbon cycle Traumatic brain injury Urine Iron Artery Nutrient Platelet Liver Heart Chlorophyta Glucokinase Hypoglycemia Vitamin C Post Polio syndrome Human anatomy Crocodilia Origin of life Muscle contraction Dieting Grasshopper Metabolism Irreducible complexity Gaia theory (science) Poison Water Mitochondrion Carbon dioxide sink Intravenous therapy Citric acid cycle Helicobacter pylori Blood-brain barrier Species Caffeine
