does objective absolute truth exist and can we know it are there things that are true to all people in all places at all times past present and future includes physical metaphysical and ethical topics what is your opinion i have a viewpoint i will give once all the major viewpoints on this issue have been represented my answer first let me present some common viewpoints there is no absolute truth for whatever reason this statement is self refuting is the statement there is no absolute truth an absolute truth if the reply is yes then we know there does exist at least one absolute truth therefore we know the statement to be false so we know there must be absolute truth the question now is what is absolutely true many people will instantly dismiss anything said by a religious person as bigoted biased and false just because they hold certain views about god to them i say don't you have certain views about god namely that he doesn't exist of course they do and they are biased just like everyone else some will say they are agnostic that we cannot know truth well can you know that you cannot know truth if you can then you do know something for sure again agnosticism is self refuting the only reliable means of discovering truth is logic the universe is immense in scope and currently may be considered infinite at least in terms of human understanding and for the purposes of my argument to pick one coordinate in the universe randomly and then set out to understand the matter at that point absolutely seems like a simple enough task but then we start to realize that surrounding matter exerts influence on our original point so we have to include this matter in our calculations quickly we see the same external pushing and pulling on our newly added particle and have to add another whole group of offending particles to our equation after carrying out this exercise for an extremely long period of time we will see the whole universe has to be considered to know the absolute truth about our first randomly picked point sure we may step back and pragmatically eliminate everything outside a certain magnitude of external influence to come up with a workable approximation of the absolute truth of our chosen particle engineers physicists sociologists biologists etc all draw these lines to make solutions to their work possible so in conclusion i believe the human mind is incapable of truly knowing absolute truth but we can come up with some pretty good estimates depending on the field Determinism Religion Epistemology Existence of God Logic Atheism Theodicy Goodness and value theory Agnosticism David Hume God Reality Causality Philosophy of science Summa Theologiae Philosophy of mathematics Deconstruction Philosophy of language Scientific method Ethics Falsifiability Intelligent design Free will Supernatural Ontological argument Doomsday argument Meaning of life Abortion debate Philosophical skepticism Creation-evolution controversy Truth Western philosophy G__del's incompleteness theorem Metaphysics Human Philosophy Bertrand Russell Science Aristotle S__ren Kierkegaard Al-Ghazali Friedrich Schleiermacher Objectivist philosophy Theory of conduct Halting problem Simone Weil Advaita Vedanta Scientology beliefs and practices Philosophy of space and time Cultural relativism Karl Popper Cosmological argument Immanuel Kant Teleological argument Relativism Nihilism Alcoholics Anonymous Psychology Age of Enlightenment Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Time travel Critique of Pure Reason Lie Quantum mechanics Entropy Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Evolutionary creationism Intelligent design movement Kuzari Black hole Mathematics Special relativity Atomism Willard Van Orman Quine Soul Biblical inerrancy Human nature Vacuous truth Expert system Bernard Williams Physics John Wycliffe Transcendental argument for the existence of God Modal logic Phaedo Slander and libel Faith and rationality Jewish philosophy Charles Darwin's views on religion Fundamentalism Creation science Evil Victor Cousin
