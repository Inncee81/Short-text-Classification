so now your dead what else is there to do hah a question i actually know the answer to at least for me i was in the last few days of a very brutal chemotherapy regimen had spent the past two weeks in isolation in the intensive care unit was literally on the edge of death i couldn't have flowers in the room uncooked food visitors anything from outside my white cell count was expressed as a decimal fraction my system was one little push away from shutting down for good i was just waiting to see how it would turn out so i wake up one night at about am sit up and look down at my pillow i'm still lying there i close my eyes and look again now there is a large bloodstain exactly the sort of thing i'd been told would kill me uncontrolled bleeding again i shut my eyes thinking i might not have much time left to do much of anything when i look again there is just a pillow so i'm pretty much doubting everything from this point on i spend some time trying to decide if i'm alive or dead and what it all means either way i think about ringing for the nurse or heading down to the station myself but don't have any idea what i'll do if they don't see me or if they come in and i'm back on a bloody pillow in reality this time i just can't decide what to do until i finally realize that i'm really freaking tired and i just want to get some rest so i lay myself back down and go to sleep the next day i started to feel better and a few months later i'd made a recovery of sorts but i remember that when it came down to deciding whether i was dead or not i just wanted to get some rest dammit i was tired of fighting tired of staying upbeat for myself and everyone else just tired so i figure that when i am finally dead then that rest will be the one thing on my mind Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma The Shining (film) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story Social rule Knots Landing EastEnders The Contender (television series) Sin City Milton H.
