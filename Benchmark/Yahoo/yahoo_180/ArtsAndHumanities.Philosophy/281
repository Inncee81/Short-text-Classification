what one moment in your life is the closest experience you've had to ecstasy a few years ago i was at church and the pastor performed the laying on of hands when he came to me he lifted a hand and before he could touch me i fell out i was conscious but i was in agony i cried and wailed and sobbed for a very long time there on the floor the congregation had left except a few who remained to pray over me when i could get up the world seemed different to me i sat outside at home and i saw the beauty in everything the sun coming through the trees the birds singing the breeze on my skin that was ecstasy i didn't have a worry in the world i felt as if i was peace and comfort and love i didn't feel these things i was these things that was the first and last time i ever felt anything so phenomenal The Emancipation of Mimi Shaggy dog story Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Time Out of Mind Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Jon Secada Johnnie Ray Milton H.
