how do you explain free will please understand that for this question free will is just the feeling that we can choose to do good or bad this feeling is a fact for everyone having free will does not mean that there is no consequence to our choice the key point is that free will does not seem consistent with the view that everything including thoughts and actions is determined by the laws of nature so how do we explain free will here are two opposite explanations we're an exception we're not controlled by the laws of nature we are one with nature and especially with its laws the first one would explain free will but i don't believe it the second one also explains free will if you are one with these laws your are not controlled you control most people do not think that they are one with these laws but this can be explained by a misconception about them so free will would be a spontaneous feeling that we are one with these laws without having to know it explicitly of course i am aware of a third explanation we are just deceiving ourselves in believing that we choose i had no room to include it in the main details anyway i don't like it either first it is so sad second i like very much the idea that free will is perhaps telling us something about the laws of nature it would be telling us that even though they are universal there is some kind of subjective aspect to the laws of nature thanks for your answer stephen k of course it does not answer the question at all but i appreciate very much to find out that you have free will the feeling that you can choose the question is how do you explain this feeling jayasri devi dasi though i suggested an answer i had no expectation or desire to control the answers anyway i guess that the question was not clear i know that free will has its limits and it must be that these limits depend on our previous actions this is beside the question the question is within its limits irrespectively of what they are how do you explain free will how do you explain this feeling that we can choose our action within some limit thanks for the answers now i realize i made a mistake in my list of explanations explanations and are not in opposition the first explanation could be rewritten ' it is not an illusion we're an exception if it is not it is an illusion the second could be considered as an explanation of this illusion in the third explanation i guess i meant to say ' we are just dummy people there is no explanation whatsoever for such an illusion the problem i see with ' is that it does not explain why this illusion seems almost a constant amongst all human beings usually in science if some phenomena is observed systematically or even if it is just very frequent we look for an explanation if we were just dummy why it is not random or something we do not experience at all in one way or another i am free to do as i choose a butterfly in the brazilian rain forest will not affect my decision whether to rent or hot fuzz Theodicy Free will Determinism A Course In Miracles Theory of conduct Expert system Artificial consciousness Scientific method Cognitive science Gravity Economics Law of value Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Soul Social psychology Origin belief Goodness and value theory Creationism Creation-evolution controversy Human nature God Microeconomics Victor Cousin Science Philosophy of mathematics The nature of God in Western theology Cultural relativism Creation science Meaning of life Physics Intelligent design Immanuel Kant Philosophy of science Religion Philosophy of language Rei Ayanami Franz Boas Reality Discordianism Psychology of religion Objectivist philosophy Normal distribution Consciousness Coercion God Emperor of Dune Categorical imperative Occam's Razor Dualism (philosophy of mind) Game theory Evolution Transactional analysis Second language acquisition A New Kind of Science Prisoner's dilemma Psychology Quantum mechanics Sigmund Freud Big Bang Alignment (role-playing games) Guns, Germs, and Steel Reincarnation Flood geology Dream Labor theory of value Plame affair Democracy Causality Many-worlds interpretation Logic Human Altruism Atomism Species Abortion debate Music Socrates Philosophy of mind Password Abduction Phenomenon Sapir-Whorf hypothesis Out-of-body experience Sociocultural evolution Civil rights Bayesian inference Entropy Liberalism Friedrich Schleiermacher Supply and demand
