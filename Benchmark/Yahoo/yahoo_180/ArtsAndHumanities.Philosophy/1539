why do women feel the need to tempt man to do wrong i ain't sexist but i wanna know why do they try to tear apart good relationships and sabotage their own well i think that some women do this because they themselves have been affected by men in the same way it could be an intentional thing to get back at men in spite or it could be more of a subconscious thing like getting involved with a man and using them it could also stem from childhood abuse little girls grow up to fear men and it would be their way of lashing out and getting even for the discomfort they had to experience at a young age all in all i think women who do things like this were negatively affected by males at some point in their lives and of course it could also be a fit of jealousy either because someone else has the man she wants or because she hasn't been truly happy herself in her own relationships Homophobia Domestic violence Infantilism Jealousy W.I.T.C.H.
