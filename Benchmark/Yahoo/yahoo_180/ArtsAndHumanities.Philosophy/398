one time a close friend of mine looked at me with suspicious eyes and said you're always in a good mood aren't you and he said it with an incredulous accusatory tone as if that seemed like an impossible thing and he was mostly correct with the exception of life's occasional tragedies and my girlfriends being angry or irritable at me for no apparent reason i am mostly always in a good mood and i can control what mood i'm in so i can't think of any reason why i would choose to be in a bad mood why the incredulosity and why the accusatorial tone i would think that would be an admirable and much coveted way to be wouldn't it he is just envious because he himself can't make himself happy because they felt that they can carry their own problem by themselves when they can be happy too never mind them they choose to be not in a good mood and they're just making themself grumpy and old every body has their own choice to do whatever they like do im sure you don't like to be feel like old and grumpy too right and mybe he is just irritable with you because he sees you smilling all the time though as if you're not facing a mountanous problem that's a positive outlook in life congratulations Theory of conduct Pitaten Social rule Kender Avenue Q Humphrey Bogart English grammar Scientology beliefs and practices Care Bears Goodness and value theory Cliff Richard The Emancipation of Mimi Grumpy's Three Wishes Ranma __ characters Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Friends Philosophical skepticism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Borderline personality disorder Philosophy of language Time Out of Mind Rose (Doctor Who) Daredevil Iago Blur Domestic violence The Ashlee Simpson Show Shaggy dog story Transsexuality The Contender (television series) Nicomachean Ethics Bernard Williams Dragon Booster Infinite Ryvius The nature of God in Western theology Empathy It's Walky!
