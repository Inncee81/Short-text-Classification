why are we aware that we're dreaming we are only aware we are dreaming when we are in the sleep mode of almost awakening i had one experience when i just was waking up and i thought to myself i want to finish this dream but alas it did not happen another time my dream was so real i dreamed i had died i was petrified and started thinking i will never see my family again i don't know why or how but i awoke i was so happy it was just a dream we are also not always aware of dreams we have dreamed ever hear of de'javu it is the illusion of having already experienced something actually being experienced for the first time already seen i believe it is because we once had that experience or have already seen it in a dream it is an odd feeling Dream Lucid dreaming Out-of-body experience Phoebe Buffay's songs Sleep Sleep paralysis Milton H.
