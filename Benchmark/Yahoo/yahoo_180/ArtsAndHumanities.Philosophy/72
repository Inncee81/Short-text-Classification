what is your understanding of post modernism how would you define it what do you think of it ok so let's think about this i'm just beginning to learn about post modernism and i have my reservations about it the problem is it's very hard to openly discuss it within academic circles because so many academics are post modernists and most of the time they can't offer very clear reasons why so i'm asking here what the general public's perception is if you had to summarize it how would you do it what appeals to you about it why are you skeptical of it if you are do you think we're living in a post modern world i've asked my professor's about it and even done some readings but honestly i'm still unclear as to what it really is and what its claims are other than there is no such thing as truth yada yada thanks to anyone who shares their thoughts besides philosophy there are many different fields e g fine art and literature that use the term post modern i'll keep my comments aimed at the philosophical understanding of post modernism the definitions are numerous and different post modern authors all have a slightly different take on the issue but the key may be looking at modernism first to help define post modernism modernism itself or the modern era has four key attributes freedom optimism dominion over nature and progress some think this era began in the th c and continued up until the th modernists believed that with our rational powers we could use science to unlock the mysteries of nature in order to tame it and use it for the good of humankind they also believed that the future for humanity was wide open that we were marching towards greater and greater freedom and that progress was inevitable this was the 'grand narrative' of modernism historically the two world wars did a lot to smash this narrative how could one have faith in the progressive nature of human kind after the atrocities of wwi and wwii it's no surprise that some of the post modern writers came from a war torn europe in addition the terrible price of the domination of nature became apparent with the ecological crisis plus the social movements of the 's and 's showed that this 'grand narrative' was only for some and not for minorities women and the poor in light of this many philosophers think that post modernism can be seen as the loss of this grand master narrative instead the master narrative has been smashed into a million different narratives as voices that have previously been denied in modernism are seeking their chance to speak post moderns are skeptical of any talk of the progress of humankind they always ask progress for who in other words post moderns always look for the 'human perspective' behind any broad sweeping statements about humanity there can no longer be any universalized statements about humanity there is no longer any universal period there are no more categories like good or bad all philosophical statements are analyzed for their particularities like who is making this universal statement and what benefit i e power would they receive if this were true in my opinion the benefits of post modernism is that those who have been denied the chance to speak can now have a voice personally i'm skeptical about post modernism because i've done a lot of work on bruno latour he has an interesting book called we've never been modern the upshot of his book is that if we've never been modern then we're not post modern either his is an extremely intricate argument that requires a lot of background knowledge i won't bore anyone with the details this should answer the post modern world question too hope this helps but keep reading to broaden and deepen your knowledge Postmodernism Philosophy Goodness and value theory
