have you or anyone you know ever seen a spirit or ghost or a ufo please answer seriously no spam plz thanx for your answers i think such apparitions will only manifest to people who are susceptible to it in other words someone like myself who believes that the dead should stay dead and not appear unwarranted thus do not believe in ghosts etc will never see it as to ufos that is another story perhaps because i do believe there is a possibility of extra terrestrial life i would see them if they should appear in other words perceiving any such oddities is purely subjective to the susceptibility of the viewer in all cases Ghost Unidentified flying object Holy Spirit Supernatural Animism God Ufology Spiritism Witchcraft Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Religion Justification (theology) Hamlet Origin belief Charmed Abduction Phenomenon Afterlife Trinity Ouija Socrates Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) The X-Files (season 1) E-mail spam Extraterrestrial life Baptism Anomalous phenomenon Soul Roswell UFO incident Sola fide The Amber Spyglass LSD Viral marketing UFO conspiracy theory Interdimensional hypothesis Poltergeist Mormonism Condon Committee J.
