am i a wasting my life i've spent my life seeking spiritual wisdom rather than financial gain i now find myself totally able to sit in meditation for hours on end i am content with my own company and can go days without needing to leave the house i don't need to go shopping clubbing or 'doing' when i am so happy 'being' my brothers think i am wasting my life being so recusive and not earning and spending loads of money like they do and maybe i am maybe i should be more motivated to earn money to have a recognized career to own 'things' but how can i motivate myself to be materialistic now when i've spent so long rejecting it am i wasting my life the fact that you are having these doubts is proof that you have not yet attained enlightenment but you are on the right path because even as you ask this question i am willing to be that you know the answer some of us have been awakened and we see the transient nature of things there is no going back from that anything you do from now on as it concerns gaining wealth and material goods will be all fake you will have to act your way through it you will have to fake like some new car is super great you will have to act like a new clothing line is really hot once you know the truth there is no pushing it away the material goods are trash garbage they are nothing whats hot today will be played out tomorrow and the people who admired you for what you have today will laugh if you still have it tomorrow or not even remember you at all money on the other hand that may not be the worst thing to have i am trying to earn mega zillions of dollars to help me spiritually i do not need to be distracted by bills and other obligations i want to walk through tibet when i feel like it and chat in london in an old neighborhood pub i want freedom and today in our society money freedom material goods self imposed ridiculous slavery Simone Weil Capitalism Altruism Buddhism Religion Microeconomics Happiness A Course In Miracles Ten Commandments Jiddu Krishnamurti Parliament of the United Kingdom Goodness and value theory Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Merit Nicomachean Ethics Wealth Anthroposophy Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Scientology beliefs and practices Current teachings of Prem Rawat Theory of conduct Stoicism Social rule EastEnders Social justice Capital accumulation Religious pluralism Shaggy dog story Gautama Buddha Plame affair Unemployment Summa Theologiae Past teachings of Prem Rawat Divine grace Atheism Soul Anarchism and capitalism Intelligent design movement Theravada Contract Rudolf Steiner Human Bernard Williams Roman Catholic Church The Amber Spyglass Energy development Franz Boas Immanuel Kant Paul W.
