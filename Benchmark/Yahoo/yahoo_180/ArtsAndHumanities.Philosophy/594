what type of philosophy is your favourite and why i know the divisions are often arbitrary so which philosopher will do i personally prefer modern philosopher's who use technical terms often invented for the subject matter rather than those who belabour their points with repitition and convoluted language like hume and kant i like most types of philosophy personally though i do agree reading some like kant and hume can be a chore they often have very good points to make and to un derstand much of the modern philosophy they effected without knowledge of their work can be more of a chore than reading the originals i must admit i do prefer succint and to the point philosopher's in general however if one turns being succint into an art form it can often take longer to read and fathom than the most convoluted of the past masters just take a look at martin bauber to see what i mean i suppose ethics because of its practical applications is a favourite and purely because i've studied it more in depth the philsophy of the mind with its scientific cross discipline nature is refreshing and does provide many of the coined technical terms you refer to however the classics hold their appeal as does european philosophy in general this is probably because of my comparative ignorance regarding far eastern philosophy Immanuel Kant Philosophy David Hume Objectivist philosophy Western philosophy Critique of Pure Reason Science Age of Enlightenment Epistemology Metaphysics Philosophy of language Logic Determinism Thomas Hill Green Deism Bertrand Russell Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel Utilitarianism Categorical imperative Philosophy of perception Plato Friedrich Schleiermacher Human Goodness and value theory Causality Reality Moral relativism Postmodernism History of philosophy Philosophical skepticism Arthur Schopenhauer Theology Islamic philosophy Ethics Aristotle Reason Theory of conduct Sri Aurobindo Sociology Psychology Cultural relativism Karl Popper Scientific method Critical theory Literature Philosophy of science History of Western philosophy Rudolf Hermann Lotze Donald Davidson (philosopher) Political philosophy Philosophy of religion R.
