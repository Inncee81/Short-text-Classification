is life a repetitive mathematical series of events are you people dense after the fact yes in all reality no mathematicians can calculate the periods in between mass extinctions of earth to create a formula they can say the earth is x number of years old the first mass extinction happened in y the next happened in a so on and so forth by doing this they can construct a working formula the problem is this formula will not hold up to the next mass extinction after the next one they could construct another working formula we cannot foresee the future by combining numerals people that think we can believe in numerology the mystic power of numbers the jim carrey movie is an example of numerology the problem with numerology is numbers can be deceptive it all depends on what numerical system you use we use the base numerical system because we have fingers computers use the base numerical system when we change the numerical system the repetitive mathematical series changes as well mathematics is not only a tool it is a language just as my words cannot express exactly how i feel or just as we cannot express color to a man that was born blind life s events cannot be describe by the tool and language of mathematics Mathematics Numerology Pi Computer Philosophy of mathematics Numerical analysis G__del's incompleteness theorem Numeral system Vector (spatial) 0 (number) Complex number Function (mathematics) Astrology Cellular automaton Trigonometric function Probability Calculus Combinatorics Dynamical system Gematria On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Novelty Theory Book of Revelation Laws of Form Belief revision Set Quaternion Vedic mathematics TeX Prime number Axiom Database Jim Carrey Heim theory Srinivasa Ramanujan Binary numeral system Gravity Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Logarithm Force Mathematics of general relativity Extinction Simone Weil Mathematical model Kurt G__del Units of measurement Science Number of the Beast (numerology) Mathematician Antichrist Curry-Howard Reverse mathematics Maya calendar Unicode Technology Leonhard Euler General relativity APL programming language Scalar Golden ratio Philosophy of space and time Continued fraction ELO rating system History of mathematics Numerical integration Archimedes Chaos theory Logic Pierre-Simon Laplace Geometry Shao Yung Arthur Cayley Model (abstract) Randomness Reality Category theory Bayesian inference Solar system Transformation problem Lambda calculus Astrodynamics Series (mathematics) Statistics Visual Basic Extinction event Orders of magnitude (numbers) Fibonacci number Physics Recursion Mathematical beauty Joseph Louis Lagrange Riemann zeta function Central processing unit Theory Quantification New Age Technological singularity Computer numbering formats
