what is the belief in simulated reality called let's assume that i believe i am the only 'human' to exist let's actually assume that i may only be a mind i might even be nothing more than an intellegent 'computer program' in part of the system that models the universe so everything else around me is part of that simulation maybe i am too but i can only understand my own thoughts and perceive things from my own senses that are all part of that system what is this belief called i thought it might be solipsism but the more i read the more i realise that solipsism doesn't really describe the belief that there may be something real we just aren't in it and perhaps we can never find it perhaps everything is just a simulation of everything else perhaps it's all in the mind of shiva i don't know the point is what's this all called it's driving me mad when people ask me 'what do you believe' having to try to explain to them that i don't even believe they exist a one word response would be easier darlingthatsfabulous no no no i constantly get that response forget about the matrix people already follow that as a religion but totally misunderstand the film treating neo as though he is a human messiah when in actual fact the 'real world' in the matrix is no more real than the matrix itself and there is no reason to assume the human race exists at all it could all be part of an ellaborate thought experiment i want to avoid refering to the matrix because all to often people don't understand the philosophy behind it jungone maybe it is but that's not what i asked i want to know what the belief in simulated reality is called the boho hobo sanity is defined by the majority and in a simulated reality there is no reason to believe anyone else exists not even yourself therefore sanity is defined by the system to keep you under control don't be afraid to let your sanity slip away read the allegory of the cave the people still enchained would believe the enlightened to be insane simon d every time i talk about this i get the same answer from someone think about it this way i am stuck in this game and there are only two ways to get out of any game win or lose remember giving up is another way of losing so how can i lose i can lose by dying like all games but i don't know if like some games i'll just come back around for another shot how can i win well i don't know but i do believe everyone else is part of the game i don't think i want to lose although maybe ultimately that is the only way to end the game so the only option is to keep on playing that's why i interract with people and the universe rather than becoming a recluse and either killing myself or waiting to die because i'm playing the game waiting for clues about how to win and ultimately escape this reality simon d it's not necessarily that i believe i am under the control or machines or that the universe is here for my fulfilment i don't even know if the universe as we percieve it space and time matter energy etc etc etc is at all real of course it's all i can perceive it's all i have ever known and my mind is programmed to perceive reality in the way it's presented to me but maybe it's totally wrong so it would be naive to say 'machines have me locked away in a prison for my mind' because that assumes that firstly i am a physical being with a brain and secondly that machines are real too there is no reason to believe any of this is real it could all be part of a much more complicated simulation so no i don't believe the universe is necessarily here for me because i might just be another program in the simulation as might you be you might be just as real as me but also just as real as sonic the hedgehog to a much more complicated universe spike dude you really have no idea what i'm talking about do you shakes head this is why i want a simple one word answer picture the conversation here below person x hello mawkish hello person x i'm a jehovah's witness and i'm here to tell you about how much god loves you mawkish i'm sorry i'm not interested person x what do you believe in mawkish i believe that you and i may or may not exist in a reality that may or may not be simulated and may or may not at all appear to be how we perceive it because it may be controlled or maybe not controlled externally maybe or maybe not i don't believe necessarily that i am the only person in existance but i also don't necessarily believe that you exist or me or anything in the same way lara croft doesn't really exist except bound by the rules of the game in which she is placed person x you're crazy i'm calling the nut house now picture the next conversation below person x hello mawkish hello person x i'm a jehovah's witness and i'm here to tell you about how much god loves you mawkish i'm sorry i'm not interested person x what do you believe in mawkish i am a insert name of belief here person x i don't know what that is but i will leave you alone whilst i find out so that i am forearmed to combat your beliefs should we meet in the future see much shorter ellmanmichael thank you i will go and look at cartesian dualism again to see how relevent it is it certainly might be what i'm thinking of you ask why i wouldn't seek a simpler solution well i don't know i'm only but since i was about i've been 'searching for the answer' i've done the western religions when i say 'done them' i literally mean 'experienced and believed them' i've done the eastern religions it's still not quite right in my mind something's still wrong materialism was the simplest explanation but it makes one big assuption 'what i perceive is always real' but when one takes drugs one's perception changes but does reality you'd say 'no and everyone elses' perception doesn't change because you've taken drugs' but how can i possible know that when i only perceive them in the same way i perceive everything else it's a horrible cycle and i wish i could turn off but i can't something is wrong with the universe and i want out straight away i don't really agree with cartesian dualism it assumes that the mind is real and in some way separate from the body what if the brain was simulated and the thoughts intelligence emotions etc were bi products of that simulation i e what if the mind is contained in the brain but the brain isn't real the mind would be as physical as the brain but neither would necessarily be real the 'baddies' in computer games for example have a certain level of 'intelligence' they respond to the virtual stimuli they encounter in a pre programmed way we do the same thing but we perform more processes and store more data so what if we're just parts of a computer program see what i mean in a game you would never simulate some biological module to process information it wouldn't be practical but what if memory and processor speed weren't an issue infinite memory instantaneous calculations perhaps it would be more memory efficient to simulate a 'brain' than to pre program explicitly every stimulatic response if that's a word it's just tidy programming simulated reality is a supposition at the beginning of several systems of philosophical thought the most well known of which is that of descartes but there is no organized belief system based on simulated reality unfortunately therefore there is no short
