i just want to tell u how i feel ' i used to be a happy person with deep faith and love for all things i don't even step on an ant and try to live up to the highest of ideals i still do but the world is cutting me up with a sword and i don't know how long i can hang on to being a saint i smile i help every one i never insult anyone even if they are asking for it i don't want to be rich i work i want to learn more i love all people and even for the ones that destroyed my country i harbor no hate or ill will ' i just want to have a peaceful life and to be able to live in my own country around my family and loved ones and to dedicate myself to my art and to use the money to take care of orphans is that too much to ask for i don't want love nor power nor riches nor jets or mansions or fame i don't want anything i only want to go to my beautiful country and enjoy nature and help others and drawww i just want to draw in peace just give me that i want to work with dignity and better myself i want to see all those around me happy because that brings me joy all i see is despair horror and no respect for life i worry for my parents and my relatives and my friends i worry about the balance of nature and why no one respects living things anymore all i see is more despair in the future for my region l i just want to have a simple life but all i get is living in a foreign country almost alone aside from the good friends i made her waiting for peace and stability back home leaving every thing that i held dear behind if this is to be my fate then i pray to god to take me now and spare me such suffering for i can t bare it your problems stemmed from the fact whatever karma we perform in the present manifestation the fruits of the same become available to us right there and then in the cosmic system of things god almighty established the doctrine of karma in a much perfected way as per the doctrine of karma whatever be the karma performed by us in the present manifestation the fruits of the same does or do not become available right now similarly the fruits of karma of all previous manifestations have not been made available in the present manifestation almost residual balance of karma of all the previous manifestations becomes the opening balance of the present manifestation but the remaining remains hidden from mankind this is the only way god almighty could have kept a tab on the workings of human beings the highest manifest stage in the cosmic life cycle this hidden factor of karma is termed prarabdha karma in hinduism the fruits of prarabdha karma become available in any manifestation if the accumulated balance of prarabdha karma is negative we suffer at the hands of destiny what if the balance of prarabdha karma is positive we are a lucky winner of sudden lottery in the system of god there are no free lunches as we sow so shall we get nothing less or more so says the law of karma always remember whatever experiences we pass through in life never result from the doings of god almighty or any other living being on mother earth including human beings all is the result of karma performed by us in this or earlier lives practically every human being manifests ones destiny why blame god or anyone else for our doings in this or the earlier manifestations in the manifest world of god all is the result of a system that cannot err we may be pious and helpful and do not harm one in this life but what of our karma of all previous manifestations we definitely erred somewhere in the previous manifestations the reason why we suffer in present life if we desire cutting across negative prarabdha karma of the previous manifestations we need to earn positive points on the karma index in this life this is the only way to eradicate the bad effects of the previous manifestations i may have born a laborer due to the residual balance of karma of the previous manifestations what if in the present manifestation i desire marrying the princess of the state this is possible i only need to perform my karma accordingly i not only need positive marks to nullify the negative residual balance of karma of the previous manifestations i shall also need to earn greater positive points for marrying the princess of the state more on karma http www godrealized com karma html Theodicy Reincarnation God Sant Thakar Singh Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Soul
