what would life be like if we all came with expiration dates indelibly incribed on us inscribed not incribed sorry this so reminds me of sneetches by dr seuss where the star bellied sneetches felt they were the far superior to the ones without stars upon thars i somehow feel that the people with long lasting expiration dates will somehow be the more confident set and will find a way to demean those with shorter dates until they feel that they don't have the time to accomplish what others can and would tend to give up more easily i think there would be a whole psychology behind the date and the length social groups would be formed around dates and government jobs would be determined by expiration it almost seems communistic i'm shuddering at the thought i think i would much prefer to be a sneetch with no star sigh Dr. Seuss Prejudice Sexual orientation The Cat in the Hat Surveillance Transactional analysis Infantilism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Sigmund Freud Password The Smoking Room Community Gender role Human Generation X Copyright law of the United Kingdom Scientology beliefs and practices Hebrew calendar Franz Boas Republic Strategic management Carl Jung Rape Tony Hancock Robert Oppenheimer Domain Name System Social rule Nerd Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Life imprisonment Biology and sexual orientation Bipolar disorder Procrastination Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Altruism Theory of multiple intelligences Drama Human sexual behavior Coercion Polyamory Economic inequality Psychoanalysis Pentagram Jon Secada Literature Happiness The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Brave New World Self-esteem Blonde on Blonde Narcissism Religion Extreme Programming Unreal Tournament Ethics Intelligence quotient Physical attractiveness Rain Man Nikah Mut'ah Transsexuality Wolfrider European Union One Tree Hill (TV series) Friends How the Grinch Stole Christmas!
