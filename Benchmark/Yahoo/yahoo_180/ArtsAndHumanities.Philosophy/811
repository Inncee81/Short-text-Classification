do people in general expect you to be weaker or stronger than you really feel what do you think explains this discrepancy thanx for answer and your time oppps meant thanx for your answer and your time sorry about the typo i am definitely weaker than people expect or believe me to be they don't see that though apparently i seem stoic and it's hard to tell when i'm actually in pain my entire family thinks i'm so strong and my mother has even told me that i'm the only thing keeping the family together that's terrifying for me to hear i'm the oldest and more mature than a lot of the others my age in my family but that doesn't make me stronger i think that some people believe that if you seem to have it together then you're strong but if you're screwing up then you're weak but personally as someone perceived as strong i think the screwed up ones who eventually get it together are the real strong ones showing emotion isn't weakness it's coping for yourself so that you can lend your strength to supporting others experiencing failure isn't weakness it's only a way of tempering yourself like steel Pitaten Theory of conduct Social rule Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Dualism (philosophy of mind) The Amber Spyglass Piccolo Junior Saga Philosophical skepticism Stoicism Dyslexia Narcissism Transactional analysis Friends God Emperor of Dune Hulk (comics) Psychology of religion Oh My Goddess!
