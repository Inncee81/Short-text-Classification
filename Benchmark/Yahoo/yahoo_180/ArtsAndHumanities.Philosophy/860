can a friendship be broken by religious tendencies i recently wrote a blog expressing my search for answers in the never ending madness of life about how i wonder where we came from what we're doing here and that i really didn't think that god existed one of my online friends read my blog and now she won't even talk to me and goes offline evertime i talk to her she hasn't even commented about it i know that shes religious but i never thought that she would be offended by what i said it was more of a philosophical look into the universe what can i say to her to make her understand that i wasn't trying to offend her or is it even worth the trouble nope nothing hasn't said a word although i know she read it i know that she reads my blog every morning i find myself wishing that i could have an epiphony about life like some great hand coming down from the sky extending a finger and then pointing in a certain direction while an intense booming voice announces the answer is this way or maybe even more subtle and not more then a whisper in my ear that everything i have ever wanted to know is simply located in my closet tucked away in some old book and hastily written on a post it note the answer is out there isn't it the how and why of the universe the ever nagging question of how life began i know i know god easiest answer to any question ever asked but if there was some being that created us where did he go and where did he come from is he just some assistant to some greater god and so on and so on that above is part of the blog that i wrote if it helps answer the question yes and marriages too Blog Socrates A Course In Miracles Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism The nature of God in Western theology Theory of conduct Meaning of life God The Subtle Knife God Emperor of Dune Theodicy Internet troll Origin belief Shaggy dog story Humphrey Bogart Ludwig Wittgenstein Avenue Q Sant Thakar Singh Little Britain English verbs Prayer Autism Free will Gospel of Thomas The Amber Spyglass Milton H.
