color differentiation how do we humans know that each color we have been taught isn't just our eyes' own interpretation of that specific color ex we have all been taught that healthy grass is usually green but how do we know that what i see as green isn't seen by others as i would think would be blue we have all been taught that that color we would see is green but how are we sure the color we see is always the same in every human this could possibly be why people all have spefcific colors that they like and dislike because all people's eyes have different spectrums of color its complex but if you understand what i am saying please try and validate if this can be proved disproved there is an answe trhat i gave a while ago that fits this question as well it is below firstly colour is a frequency of light what our brains interperet as colour is nothing more than the signal generated by the photoreceptive cell in the retina when a photon of light hits it secondly there is the issue of forms as disscussed in platos work in his allegory of the cave while he was talking of our perception of the society around us the concept explain very well the workings of the brain the brain will interpret a signal from one of the sences in this case vision and compare it to past experiance to figure out what is going on when we are young the signal recived form the eye is married with the processed signal recieved from the ear of someone telling us that the colour we are looking at is blue that is how we learn colour sound everything it does not mean however that what we see is the same thing it only means that we have aggreed that the responce generated by the retina is called blue if we have been taught wrongly say the person teaching us was colour blind then we will percive that same colour discrepancy even though we may not be colour blind thirdly there is the physical malfunction or malformation of the eye as in colour blindness or damage as in sun spots or light patches in vision due to over exposure therefore we cannot be sure that we are seeing the same thing just that we agree that we are seeing the same thing hope this helps Color Color blindness Retina Eye Philosophy of perception Light Teleological argument Sun Visual perception Eye color Plato Visual system Hearing impairment Iris (anatomy) Color vision Sense Human Creationism RGB color model Cat History of brain imaging Soul Animal communication Dog Psychology Dyslexia Scientific method Visual cortex Consciousness Sexual orientation Physical attractiveness Brain Cephalic disorder Intelligent design Spatial disorientation Origin belief Socrates A Course In Miracles Stereoscopy Computer vision Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Human skin color Psychosis Free will Franz Boas The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Color temperature Albinism Action potential Sensation Drosophila melanogaster Melanin Fermi paradox Night vision Religion Falsifiability Species Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Neuro-linguistic programming Polarization Quantum mechanics Color theory Light-emitting diode SETI Out-of-body experience Electromagnetic radiation Gamut Cancer Person Cyberspace Tuatara X-ray Planetary nebula Dragon Booster Art Near-death experience Plato's allegory of the cave Sociocultural evolution Asperger syndrome Aesthetic Realism Macular degeneration Direct realism Rayleigh scattering Objectivist philosophy Synaesthesia Goodness and value theory Color space Science Quantum mind Laser Creation-evolution controversy
