why do people live in the moment instead of being intellectual and looking at the bigger picture this is perhaps a weird question but any thinking person would know what i'm saying why do people most of them at least live in the moment and react to stimuli around them like little children who cannot see past their present time and conditions and focus on more intellectual things i for one on any given day think about many other things like world events my mortgage car payment bills and other more important things even as i'm walking around in the mall and then i encounter a plethora of others who just seem to be reacting to what you're wearing your presence or what's around them they're like little shallow children is this a problem of immaturity or am i the weirdo lol i don't see how people can go out and about and not think about anything higher than what's in front of them i mean it's cool to live and let live and not care but when i say live in the moment i'm not implying in a positive way we here in america are a very fortunate group of people we have nearly anything we want at our fingertips and can get another job or borrow money to get what isn't at our fingertips however that is also our downfall if you have never lived in poverty or need then you have no concept of what it's like most of the young people think it's awful if they can't get the latest gadget phone clothing that's new on the market they have no real concept of what it is like to go to sleep really hungry having not eaten much if at all for a couple of days or weeks we are such a me society that most people have no desire to look beyond the moment our political desires show that very clearly i have heard many people both dem rep say it doesn't matter to me because my life is good as long as it doesn't affect me i don't care of course our politians know that and play to it the problem is that is how we look at everything eventually it will have an affect on us we just choose to ignore it if it's not this moment Microeconomics Inflation The Ashlee Simpson Show Intellectual property The nature of God in Western theology Asperger syndrome Goodness and value theory Pitaten Economics Surplus value The Amazing Race Nicomachean Ethics Infantilism The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Sexual orientation About a Boy Extreme Programming Keynesian economics David Hume Psychosis Supply and demand Mortgage Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Insurance Alcoholics Anonymous Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Meaning of life Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Dualism (philosophy of mind) Abortion debate Predestination Capitalism Capital accumulation Surveillance Coercion Shaggy dog story School of Salamanca Free will Moral Politics John Howard Yoder English grammar Law of value Publicly funded medicine The Death Gate Cycle Autism Free trade Kodocha Garfield Supernatural Sex and the City Volleyball Unemployment Property (ownership right) Singlish Person Car handling Great Teacher Onizuka Philosophical skepticism German grammar Theodicy Friedrich Schleiermacher Fecal incontinence W.
