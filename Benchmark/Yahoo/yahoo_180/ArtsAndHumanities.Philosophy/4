peace or war love or hatred brotherhood or racism why always war is 'the'solution why only weapons speak why are innocent people killed instead of evil why does one nation hate the other developing why do they torture the poor and weak why fights do people fight in the name of religion caste colour and nationality why don't we love and care for each other anymore why are we living behind a mask a peaceful world is not possible anymore what do you think peace quote why always war is 'the' solution it's not always the solution but more peaceful solutions doesn't make the news and our awareness as humans we tend to see the bad things while we don't notice the good things just as much it's kinda logic bad things needs fixing but good things are already working and we don't have to put energy into fixing it quote why only weapons speak it's not the weapons by them selves that speak it is the fear and terror that they produce that has the power so why do humans use fear and terror to get what they want because they have learned that it is a good way to get it look at children they try it too but in a smaller scale they want something someone says that they can't have it because it's not theirs and they act out kicking screaming and such to get what they want once the people around them gives in and give it to them they have learned that terror is a good thing and that it works humans had done this since they first became humans and in the same way as children they have learned that it works quote why are innocent people killed instead of evil because the evil ones is the ones with the big guns one part is the bad guys using the killings of the innocent as a way to cause terror to scare people so that they get what they want another part is that big armies and weapons that means that the one making the decisions doesn't have to see what he she has done alienates them from what they are doing once alienated they feel less sympathy for the innocents that gets in their way when they hunt for the bad guys what is a human sacrifice of say innocent persons when you are doing what you think is the only right things and you don't have to actually see what you have done that's where the line between good and evil blurrs out and fades to gray quote why does one nation hate the other developing greed and envy but it goes deeper than that we are social creatures and we bond with those that are close to us like us or has the same values as us by doing that we create a us against them thinking when all is well it is less defined but we are always looking to survive and do it under better conditions that's the way life in general works if someone is doing better it creates envy because maybe just maybe the we group could have benefited from it and increased our chances of survival envy and greed turns to hate and the story rolls on quote why do they torture the poor and weak display of power and to increase terror tools that mankind have learned through out history that it works quote why fights do people fight in the name of religion caste colour and nationality it's the us against them thing looking after your group means better chances of survival and your group surviving means that what you like and believe in will be stronger it's an ancient instinct that made humans as successful as we are in spreading across the planet building civilizations and simply staying alive instead of fading away as the neanderthals did quote why don't we love and care for each other anymore i think that we do it's all tied to the group that we are bonded with we love and care about people that we know areas that we like and live in and so on one thing is different though the media and the globalisation in the past people in an area group were close and news from the rest of the world reached them slowly and didn't affect them in the way that it does now today we are disconnected from people around us and we are bombarded with messages about how we should care about strangers on the other side of the world the more healthy bond with your neighbors and the support of them and from them has been exchanged for the stress of caring for the whole world and not feeling that you can do enough the love and the care for the community is now shattered and spread over several news medias and areas of the world quote why are we living behind a mask are we or are we simply disconnected from each other of course there has always been people portraying themselves as something they are not but that is not new if the mask is emotional numbness then i'd say that the answer is stress the close group is fading and we are supposed to take in larger amounts of information about strangers we don't know stranger and caring for them is hard hence emotional numbness quote a peaceful world is not possible anymore it has never been we have been fighting since long before we had formed languages and civilizations the difference is of course that we didn't know about all the wars and tribal wars around the world before the communications systems were invented quote what do you think i think too much we are as societies disconnected from the others in the society we worry about things on the other side of the world that we can do nothing about while we forget the things that we can do around us the best place to start making changes is at home and close to you we need to learn how to go against our instincts to listen to the bad things and focus on the good things the good things are out there but they need to be highlighted i'd like to see the medias focus on the good things even when bad things happen i e not screaming out disaster people died this is the worst thing ever but focusing on the good thing that happened neighbors helped to save many lives society helps each other to survive they are doing a great job and this is how they are doing it the later wouldn't sell as well as the former of course and that's why we'll never see those headlines money talks i think kids at school needs to be taught how to handle the mass information they are bombarded with kids don't see that there is more to a story and they don't have to capability to see that the medias view on things doesn't always reflect how the world is it is sad to see so many kids teens being depressed over things that they shouldn't have to be depressed over Evil Human Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Social rule Pitaten Episodes of Lost (Season 1) A Course In Miracles
