what keeps moving bodies moving what is the state of atoms and sub atomic particles that keeps a moving body to move i'm not very good in atoms and particles etc but what i think is that moving bodies move because of impulse action reaction chain Newton's laws of motion Classical mechanics Radioactive decay Atomism Nuclear fission Nuclear technology Nuclear fallout Nuclear reaction Antiparticle Spin (physics) Nuclear fusion Mole (unit) Temperature Light Mechanics Determinism Atomic nucleus Manhattan Project Electron Neutron Enzyme Neutron radiation Atom Energy Precession Angular momentum coupling Particle accelerator Nuclear weapon Radical (chemistry) Quantum teleportation Special relativity Ion thruster Quantum mechanics Depleted uranium Photon Quantum number Cherenkov radiation Magnetism Nuclear reactor Particle beam Equivalence principle Cross section (physics) Gas Heat Mass Radiometric dating Phase (matter) Pauli exclusion principle Chemical reaction Chemistry Alpha particle Entropy Criticality accident Particle physics Angular momentum Identical particles Planetary orbit Subatomic particle D-brane Project Orion Current (electricity) Cracking (chemistry) Force Antimatter Phonon Quantum field theory Uranium Ozone depletion Boson Thermal energy Eye Brownian motion Beta decay Neutron moderator Ionizing radiation Technetium Electromagnetism Neutrino Polymer Isotope Inertial confinement fusion Helium Democritus Hydrogen Electron hole Atomic mass Organic chemistry Alkyl Carbon WIMP Ribosome Radioisotope thermoelectric generator Vulcanization Gravity Action potential Corrosion Speed of light Momentum Elementary particle
