why can't people just answer the dam question what percent of answers on ya actually attempt to answer the question they are posted to i would say about it seems to me the other answers are either pop psychology analyzing the person who asked for even asking such a question arguing verbage or pointing out typos or category selection a total misunderstanding of the question to begin with complaining about someone else's answer and my favorite of all time the answer that tells you how you could easily look the answer up yourself if it were so easy you should look it up and earn those points dam is puposely mispelled so it would pass the censor filters damndamndamn i agree about keeping it simple sometimes i have trouble wording my question into one perfect sentence that fits in the spaces allowed a lot of times i lose meaning other times i just piss people off for asking frank questions but really i just didn't have room in the question field to sugar coat them because questions about dams are funny also who cares about points lol on a more serious note it's because of thinking humans tend not to be good listiners when somoene else is talking the listiner's mind is normaly foaming with thoughts some of these htoughts are about what they agree with what hte person is saying if it's a lie if they like the person or anything else that you could ever think p so i guess here people are still having those thoughts when reading the question and so that is what they type as a response a lot of people are just arguementive lol and also u'd get those pts just for saying look it up Wheel of Fortune Theory of conduct Social rule Scientology beliefs and practices Turing test Goodness and value theory Philosophy of language Ethics Socrates A Course In Miracles The nature of God in Western theology Family Feud Sexual orientation The Apprentice 2 Jumpstart 3rd Grade Quizbowl Whose Line Is It Anyway?
