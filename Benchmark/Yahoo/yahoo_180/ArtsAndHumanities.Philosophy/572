you are not allowed to win angel perhaps because you are used to it you never win anything i wonder what would happen if you were not used to not winning eh and to you good thoughts lord z are you being picked on again or does this apply to all either way it's all rather trite considering this is a game for worthless points won in a virtual world i feel insulted for you but you should know better there is a lot wrong with liking the tenor and content of a person s questions and knowing that you can answer that question well why it is almost as bad as asking a question in a particular way so only the people who know the answer will be able to answer it i ve no fear i read all my answers at least twice sometimes i have to extend my questions because i can t pick a ba in time and i provide beyond reasonable feedback for my selection if i chose you as best answer it was because you earned the best answer the people of yahoo just need to accept that some people are simply more masculine funny and mysterious than others and a bit cute when offended most of my bas are from the oracle i like her i like her questions so what so winning is not everything the point is to play a win is a statistic that shows that you are still living in the past i was reading the suppestion board today and someone thinks that they should limit the number of time i can give you or anyone a best answer or at least limit the number of times that you can pick me as best answer like there is something wrong with liking the tenor and content of a person's questions and knowing that you can answer that question well i felt insulted this is not about winning or losing but putting it out there to be read by others to be like dor disliked appreciated or rejected the thought that people in this place think that there is something wrong with doing your best regardless of how often you answer the same person is offending you should be allowed to win but if you are not you should not be punished for playing i find that the only reason for the game is to play the only point for having a winner is to limit how long the game will last if you can not win then the game will last forever recess recess recess play ball Theory of conduct Match Game Hollywood Squares Wheel of Fortune Socrates The Joker's Wild Monty Hall problem Ken Jennings Quizbowl Jeopardy!
