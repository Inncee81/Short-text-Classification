is it true that everyone on this planet is related large scale genetic research have proved that mankind originated from a very small group of people common ancestors have been discovered for the entire population of many billions inhabiting all five continents of the earth these are two thousand primeval hunters gatherers who used to live in africa more than years ago new data has been also obtained about the rates and directions of human beings prehistoric evolution and the way the continents got inhabited the researchers have applied the recent achievements of molecular biological technology which allow to concurrently analyze multiple dna characteristics of a person dna characteristics markers of the currently living nations from all the continents populations from africa europe middle central and eastern asia oceania and america were studied having processed the accumulated data the researchers came to the conclusion that all people on the earth had originated from a small group of ancestors their quantity not exceeding thousand people excerpts from their study the number of people in major territories of settlements including africa was relatively small and probably underwent significant fluctuations a lot of people died due to the limitations in food and severe living conditions however about thousand years ago steady growth began in the quantity of african farmer populations and ten thousand years later quantity of populations started to grow in eurasia it is known that at that time in particular our ancestors started to use new technologies they produced more sophisticated stone and bone tools the tribes succeeded in procuring more food and in coping with unfavorable conditions bad weather predators as a result more children survived in each generation and the quantity of people on the planet grew up continuously thanks to achievement of the mind the human species was winning the evolutionary race it is interesting to note that the populations of hunters gatherers of africa aboriginals of oceania and american indians do not have dna signals of quantity growth indeed these groups of people remained at the level of previous primitive technologies and due to that they can only support their quantity at the minimum level which as thousands of years ago varies significantly from generation to generation depending on weather conditions successful hunting and other favors of gods however maybe the most important finding of the research is as follows all of us people of the earth are genetic brothers and sisters if we are not cousins from adam and eve at least we descended from the children of the same tribe Evolution Biology Indigenous peoples Stone Age Human evolution Species Human Human skin color Prehistoric Britain Evidence of evolution Ecology Biodiversity Black (people) Bioinformatics Indigenous peoples of the Americas Civilization Genetics Extinction Indo-Aryan migration Human migration Africa Dinosaur Genetic engineering Omega-3 fatty acid Transcontinental nation Genetically modified food Archaeology Agriculture Explosive material Sociocultural evolution Fauna of Australia Evolution of the Horse Molecular systematics Molecular evolution Neolithic Revolution History of the World Cradle of Humanity Neanderthal Creationism Junk DNA Olduwan Natural selection Validity of human races Mammal Origin of life DNA Europe Macroevolution Plant breeding Ape Science Solar variation Guns, Germs, and Steel Human height Vitamin C Franz Boas The Origin of Species Scientific method Fermi paradox Race and intelligence Primate Indigenous Australians Famine History of Africa Space colonization Pharmaceutical company Flood geology History of evolutionary thought Celt Overpopulation Stem cell The Night's Dawn Trilogy Irreducible complexity Biochemistry Wealth Hunter-gatherer Economic inequality Scientology beliefs and practices Genealogical DNA test Sea level rise Extraterrestrial life Continent Economy of Africa DNA repair Marvel Universe Central processing unit Mutation Earth Melanin Meme
