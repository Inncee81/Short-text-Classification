what tools can be used to break the cycle of poverty on a large scale i have read most of jonathan kozol's the shame of the nation and for our college summer reading assignment i've most recently read the working poor by david shepler from what i can gather from speaking about the cycle of poverty the solution must be one that encompasses multiple problems at once because poverty is a cycle no one event will break it because they are all interconnected some of these basic issues include poor education poor motivation hopelessness sometimes malnutrition early pregnancies inexperience in the workplace low self esteem and the list goes on some of the most successful programs that i have heard of though few exist from what little i hear of it are those that coach people in my personal opinion the most helpful of these on a longer term scale are those that focus on establishing an adult's self esteem and preparation training for entering the workforce and maintaining a job yet these programs work on very small scales that is how they function because the social workers and job trainers must work with a smaller group for more individualized success those trapped in poverty often come from a long line of failure in the family to rise above their economic status and the same pattern continues with each generation low self esteem is built in from the start that sense of hopelessness and as this person matures into an adult he she lacks the right parental skills lacks the confidence to be a role model for his her children lacks the sense of self worth to prioritize attending work each day etc since poverty cycle issues are interconnected i believe that a sense of low self esteem if boosted in the long term would impact all the other problems seen in cycle so my question is then how can we make these training programs more widespread end this madness called political correctness hold everyone to the same standards blacks whites asians native americans etc not one of the people who are members of these groups is inherently smarter than the other the only difference between these groups is the value placed on education by the family if the family fails to instill the importance of education it is up to the society including schools to do so some people can have their happy cute feelings about individuality and all that nonsense but when it comes to the nation its success is more important than the feelings of an individual everyone of our children is a potential doctor construction worker police officer criminal we must for the sake of our country see to it that our citizenry is educated i also think some forms of tenure are ludicrous teachers have a job to do and should be fired if they fail to deliver Education Affirmative action Economic inequality Education in the People's Republic of China Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Extreme Programming Intelligence quotient Education in Japan Education in Portugal Hikikomori Anarchism and society Poverty Second language acquisition Wealth Goodness and value theory Autism Objectivist philosophy Autism rights movement Narcissism Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Black (people) Religious Society of Friends Asperger syndrome Literacy Drama Trade union Mach kernel Mental retardation Rational Unified Process Abortion debate Infantilism CPU cache Motivation Utility cycling Psychology Tonality Dynamic Systems Development Method GED Plame affair Voter turnout Education in the United States Anorexia nervosa Postmodernism SAT Labor theory of value Multilingual Exploitation Scientology beliefs and practices Domestic violence Bayesian inference Education reform Tripartite System Dyslexia Economics Stuttering Enterprise content management M60 machine gun Weight training Community emergency response team Capitalism Roe v.
