what is the meaning of life ah yes one of life's toughest questions does anyone have a really good answer of humanity the religious folks don't need to ask the meaning of life the church tells them the supernatural explanation but the rest of us can't swallow religious dogma because there's no evidence nobody can prove that there life after death that people are tortured or rewarded after life or that there's invisible spirits running around i've come to two conclusions recently life has no meaning life has a million meanings first there's a certainty that death and annihilation awaits not only you but the earth in general it's an astonomical certainty that our sun will supernova and leave the earth a burnt crisp not to mention all the other extinction level events around the corner second the million things that give us meaning are the pleasurable experiences we can conjure up during the short period we are here on the earth in the form of the relationships we have with our kids and other people and the 'housekeeping' types of purposes what i mean by that are the curing disease ending hunger improving literacy reducing crime preventing war helping other kinds of things so the bottom line is we only have a temporary meaning to life to reduce pain and increase pleasure other than that everything is lost to oblivion to be or not to be to be is temporary and not to be is inevitable Supernatural Religion Al-Ghazali Intelligent design Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Hell Black hole Meaning of life Goodness and value theory Supernova Angel Simone Weil A Course In Miracles Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Soul Human extinction Nicomachean Ethics Fermi paradox Guns, Germs, and Steel Causality Phaedo Mortification of the flesh Kain (Legacy of Kain) Permian-Triassic extinction event Neutrino Gamma ray burst Existence of God Young Earth creationism Immortality Theodicy Justification (theology) Evil Human sexual behavior Prostate cancer Origin belief Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Happiness Sun Tribulation Utilitarianism Clinical depression Scientology beliefs and practices Animism Abortion debate Merit Global warming Altruism Evolutionary creationism Social psychology Impact event God Torture Christian eschatology Theory of conduct Jiddu Krishnamurti Human Solar system Resurrection of Jesus End of civilization Epistemology Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Creationist cosmologies Magic (paranormal) Autism Judaism Creation science Capitalism Falun Gong Ecology Capital punishment Urinary incontinence Expert system Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Ozone depletion Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism S__ren Kierkegaard Demon Zohar Afterlife Biodiversity The Amber Spyglass Ghost Surveillance The nature of God in Western theology Eastern Orthodox Church Urantia Folk music Addiction Population history of American indigenous peoples Summa Theologiae Evolutionism New Testament view on Jesus' life Charles Darwin's views on religion Orgasm
