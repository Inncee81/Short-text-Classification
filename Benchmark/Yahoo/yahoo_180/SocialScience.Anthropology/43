will humans eventually all be the same by this i mean with global travel so easy thus promoting a lot more gene flow between populations then in the past is it possible that we could just breed out all of these ethnic differences that seem to cause so much tension and become one genetically homogeneous race ok let s start from the beginning of our evolution from homo heidlebergensis evolving into the first homo sapiens this speciation would have occurred in an isolated population the group would likely have been small but still large enough to have had enough variance to maintain its health by not having too many detrimental double recessive alignments in their offspring as of such even this first group of homo sapiens would not have been homogeneous albeit they were much less heterogeneous then the human population became at it's height at pre colonial times to best describe how our modern population has experienced such a magnificent gene diversity it would be best to display a couple of diagrams which show the spread and change of our mt dna matrilineal http worldfamilies net migration map wfn gif and y dna patrilineal http jewsandjoes com images ftdna migration map jpg throughout the globe here is another diagram that shows the settling of the y dna frequencies after this initial spread http notavalidname files wordpress com w map gif i would have liked to have found you a diagram showing mt dna frequencies as well but the internet was not forth giving needless to say as the spread diagrams resemble each other the resulting frequency diagrams would be similar as well in other words the majority of the men and the women were migrating together in groups which makes sense given the cultural nature of homo sapiens as you can see from the phenotypic expression of y dna in the frequency pie charts the geographic demarcations closely resemble the racial distinctions to which i believe that you were referring to in your question and although the y dna and mt dna frequencies resemble the racial distinctions that some people like to make in fact the vast vast majority of the human genome is identical when looked at based on geographical averages and as of such the term race is actually a highly flawed term and inappropriate for describing population differences within the human race our human race is one besides this flaw in our application of the term race the human species does still exhibit phenotypic diversity that results in differential morphological expression which follows these geographic distinctions that are clearly seen in the diagrams which i have put forth of course these diagrams are pre colonial or else there would be a large arrow pointing from europe and a slightly lesser one from africa representing the genealogical flooding of europeans and their slaves into the americas as well as these european arrows pointing into australia and new zealand these post colonial arrows would be the beginning of the blending period that we will discuss later on if we were to update the y dna frequency chart to represent the modern inhabitants it would have predominantly red pie charts in the americas australia and new zealand so now to the discussion of whether the human species could experience a blending of these pie charts such that we have increased homogeneous phenotypic expression in consideration of this this is already happening to a degree while looking either at y dna mt dna on the micro scale on an individual basis or on the macro scale on the basis of overall society's y dna mt dna frequencies by micro i am referring to immigrant populations adding to the y dna and mt dna blending via the few incidences of inter ethnicity marriages resulting in offspring with blended pie charts so to speak many humans do still seek their own type in matrimony but still it only takes one inter ethnic matrimonial combination to stir up the pie chart of their offspring and their offspring's offspring etc unless it is bred out by reproducing with one predominant frequency set for many generations on the human macro scale you have societies who already represent extremely blended pie charts like those in the middle east south eastern europe and central russia on the y dna frequency diagram please look at the pie charts labeled pe uz kt and ge all of which are examples of blended y dna frequency such that the predominant y dna gene combinations from all over the globe seem to have representation within these pie charts so a blending has occurred in the middle east and central eurasia being that this area represents the major migratory corridor in our evolutionary history since a continuation of this blending is occurring globally via immigration and cross cultural marriages we will continually experience a general trend towards a more homogenous blending in our human genome although much like the original group of adam s and eve's that emerged from heidlebergensis we will never truly be homogenous no matter how blended the pie chart were to become here is an example of what a blended mt dna pie chart would appear if the human species were to become near homogeneous http www familytreedna com mtpie html but even if so much inter ethnic reproduction occurred to converge on this near homogenous case very few individuals would actually even
