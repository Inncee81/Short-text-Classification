when did the grey wolf's dog association with man begin some years ago i electrical engineer with grad degrees in comp sci worked with a group of biologists archeologists paleontoligists geologists mds on a project we'd meet at a local tavern on friday after work discuss subjects of interest one of these was when the grey wolf began the association with homo sapien if it was also associated with neanderthal or homo erectus because the grey wolf is not found in africa we decided the association began in the mid east spread through out the world from there this would put the association at about yrs ago the idea that the grey wolf human association appeared among differing groups about yrs ago was rejected as improbable statistically however all the current anthropology links i find tend to trumpet the more recent date we rejected the neanderthal association due to lack of supporting evidence but the wolf would have been the perfect hunting companion for a pure carnivore any links samas the dog is but a domesticated grey wolf genetically that toy poodle is a wolf because every human culture in existance has or has had dogs the association with the wolf had to have begun in the very distant past some time later the humans began to selectively breed these wolves rod thanks for the links the australian dingo once a domestic dog now displays the lack of ability to interpret human wants gestures on the same plane as wolves i enjoyed the link on east asian origin makes sense russian experiments with the artic fox indicate that canids related critters evolve toward domestication far faster than we'd predicted as they obtained domestication far more mutations than they'd predicted within a few s of generations at what point one would have considered the wolf to reach the classification of dog is probably an unresolvable question i'd still suspect a long association with the semi domesticated wolf but am at a loss as to how i'd determine facts either way cowboy doc yes we've also found evidence of canabalism in prehistoric fires bone pits i suspect some ate dogs as a food of last resort others developed a taste for dog meat caveman dna tests to date have found the grey wolf to be the sole ancestor of all domestic dogs if any other canid produced the domestic dog we've missed it therefore we have to dismiss the african wild dog the etheopian wolf as ancestors for lack of evidence fromafar sorry if i gave you the opinion that i thought no changes had taken place russians that produced the domestic artic fox did note the increased decreased production of some hormones that appeared in the domestic fox they selected kits that would play with humans rejected those that didn't we do not reclassify humans as was done with the wolf dog australian dingo canis lupus dingo when some degree of behaivior modification takes place humans have chromosomes vs the chimp has chuckle regardless of the fact that chromosome is but a fusion of

thank you for bothering to answer my question i'd love to find credible evidence of a longer association between the dog sapien or one of the other lines of homonoids but other than some slim genetic information it simply doesn't exist science is like that the evidence is just what it is never what you'd like it to be i file these links answers away in hopes of eventually developing a credible hypothesis once in a great while they spawn a line of research for others to follow coop yep everyone seems to agree that the dog was the st animal domesticated by homo sapien little wonder there because due to the enhanced smell hearing it was an invaluable camp guard hunting companion all evidence seems to indicate prehistory settlers of north america brought dogs with them some interbreeding with wolves obviously happened on the journey http www pbs org evolution library i html currently scientists are having problems distinguishing definitively between wolves dogs robert k wayne colleagues are investigating this topic test on both nuclear mtdna are required depending on ancestry an animal appearing to be dog or wolf may test to be either unless an in depth analysis on all dna is done some dogs in the western hemisphere carolina dog or american dingo have a genetic trail to asian wolves others to eurasian wolves the carolina dog australian dingo are closely related one hypothesis the wolf humans domesticated each other by following hunters scavenging from the kills of the other they developed a symbiotic relationship of semi domestic association to k yrs ago dogs are not basically domesticated wolves they are genetically different dogs canis lupus familiaris were domesticated from grey wolves canis lupus i have included some links to scientific abstracts and papers demonstrating this phenomenon and will very briefly sum up some important parts first it appears that this domestication occurred in asia before human migrations to north america some genetic evidence suggests that the division may have occurred as much as years ago but archaeological evidence for man dog relationships is only from about bc and was part of the neolithic revolution one of the most interesting points and something indicating the very real difference between dogs and wolves is that domestic puppies have a better grasp of what people are doing than wolves even if the wolf has lived with people its whole life many native american groups had domesticated dogs and in some cases there is evidence that they had different kinds some for hunting guarding pets and some for eating this has been suggested for prehistoric populations in what is now new york state based on the fact that dogs buried in cemeteries are morphologically different from dogs found in trash pits dogs are also known from prehistoric sites across asia and europe beyond eurasia and the americas my knowledge is a little weak so i'll leave this here Young Earth creationism The Descent
