i believe in the possibility of evolution however since all primates share a common ancestor is it possible that human evolution did not follow the paths of the apes and chimps before it branched into the line that eventually became human but followed a more direct path of evolution just an american it would be all well in good if i knew which species is what as i don't speak latin bravazoloo sp i'm not going back that far so you're asking if the human lineage branched from the ancestral primate line before that line branched into the apes sounds like the monkeys lemurs and tarsiers http news bbc co uk olmedia images primate info gif the lineage or evolutionary history of any species is reflected in its genes we share so much of our genome with the apes because we are apes we are anthropoid primates in the family hominidae african apes and humans subfamily homininae humans genus homo and all our extinct bipedal predecessors and cousins the human genome varies less than or from the rest of our evolutionary cousins the hominids apes if our line had branched earlier the evidence would be in our genes Hominidae Human evolution Evolution Human Chimpanzee Incertae sedis Haplorrhini Scientific classification Aquatic ape hypothesis Lemur Chimpanzee Genome Project Mammal Race Biology Australopithecus afarensis Common Chimpanzee Neanderthal Homo (genus) Evidence of evolution Biped Olduwan Homo habilis Species Linnaean taxonomy Gene Lemuridae Multiregional hypothesis Hair Ape extinction Y chromosome Cladistics Anthropology Human extinction Bigfoot Human genome Whale Single-origin hypothesis Ramapithecus Paranthropus Sociocultural evolution Homo erectus Richard Owen Galago Cradle of Humanity Race (historical definitions) Evolutionary psychology Junk DNA Bioinformatics Lorisidae Polyploidy Human Genome Project Senescence Mycoplasma Mountain Gorilla Murinae Dinosaur Democratic Republic of the Congo Stone Age Dog Cryptozoology Indo-Aryan migration Old World monkey HIV Orangutan Transposon Homology (biology) The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Gibbon Terence McKenna Bonobo Philippine Tarsier Extinction Brain Indridae Barbary Macaque The Origin of Species Banana Jeffrey H.
