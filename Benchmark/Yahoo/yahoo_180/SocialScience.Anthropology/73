why does archeological items sites are buried under the ground this is for my homework many sites and often those best preserved are located near a lake or river sedimentation occurs readily at these sites the artifacts are covered by mu and soil and are this preserved from being scattered or weathered all sites are not covered those that are not are subjected to scavengers which move bones around so they are difficult if not impossible to reconnect wind rain flooding sand etc will damage and destroy artifacts left on the surface therefore the answer is not that all archaeological sites are buried but that those that are covered have the best chance of preservation Archaeology Desert Archaeological site Erosion Flood geology Burial Opportunity rover Olduwan Irrigation Severe weather terminology (United States) Plain of Jars Mount Pinatubo Geography of Albania River Aztalan State Park, Wisconsin Great Lakes Lake Soil Natural disaster Glacier Sedimentary rock Sewage treatment Disaster Avalanche Evidence of evolution Oxyrhynchus Carnivorous plant Mummy Trace fossil 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Pompeii Tank Sediment Collecting fossils National Weather Service Soil science Campfire Flood Swiss plateau Anchor Shipwreck Weather lore Dune Roswell UFO incident Tropical cyclone Clothing Death Valley National Park Land mine Olympic National Park 2005 Atlantic hurricane season Deluge (mythology) Dromornithidae Dallas, Texas Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Eutrophication Dartmoor Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area Eolian Great Lakes Storm of 1913 Flood plain Geography of India Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Zion National Park Balikpapan Dam New Madrid Seismic Zone Tulkarm Decomposition Pok__mon Abilities Indian Ocean Thar Desert Indus Valley Civilization Hohokam Titan (moon) Albedo Archaeological field survey Grand Teton National Park Climate of Salt Lake City Stalag Luft III Sutherland Shire Tornado Yosemite National Park Florida Keys Weather satellite Drainage Geography of Egypt Stone Age Great Flood of 1993 Metal detector Artifact (archaeology) Mount Mazama Desertification Great Pyramid of Giza Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Weathering Nile Radar Noah's Ark
