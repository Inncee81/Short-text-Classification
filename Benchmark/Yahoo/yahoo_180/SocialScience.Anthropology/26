could petroglyphs be graffitti as vital as they are to exploring previous cultures and ages couldn't cave drawings be the result of civil unrest as is the graffitti of today if so what importance will the graffitti of today play in the exploration of our culture thousands of years from now yes i am sure of it most of it probably is unless it is decifered to be accounting or marking of goods and ownership there is evidence of graffitti in many ancient forms of writting all over the world and it stands to reason that petroglyphs would as well workers in egypt use to use graffitti to talk crap about or praise their work bosses romans used latin to make political statements for all we know two rival groups could have had a bit of a competition and were doing the petroglyphs to say we were here louder than the other graffitti they found there to me petroglyphs are just a another language on the path to the sophisticated ones we use to day and so logically all other written languages have examples of graffitti it seems highy probable that petroglyphs though more primitive would also be used for graffitti Nordic Bronze Age Graffiti Petroglyph Chariot Religion Labyrinth Predynastic Egypt Middle Ages Writing Falsifiability Jacob Neusner Ancient Egypt Culture of Egypt Logic Civilization Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Urban exploration Causality Ancient history Ancient Pueblo Peoples Indus Valley Civilization Rhetoric ELO rating system Aegean civilization Chinese language Scientific method Biblical inerrancy Cultural and historical background of Jesus Greek language Shamanism Sociocultural evolution Gottfried Leibniz Democracy History of Africa Dice Prehistoric Sweden Jesus History of technology Latin alphabet Apocrypha Ancient Rome Archaeology and the Book of Mormon Money Jew Culture Bible Bayesian inference Transcontinental nation Hittites Barbarian Black (people) Philosophy of mathematics Reincarnation Bhimbetka Rock carvings at Alta Truth Claude L__vi-Strauss Acts of the Apostles British monarchy Latin Maya civilization History of Scandinavia Game Ra (board game) Economic inequality Olduwan Prehistoric Britain Shit Julius Caesar Interactive fiction Colony in Space Silk Road Cave Laws of Form Epistemology Appeal A New Kind of Science Grand Duchy of Lithuania Complexity classes P and NP Korean art Neolithic Europe Gospel of Mark Modal logic Meaning of life Expert system Minoan civilization C programming language Creationism Library of Alexandria Etruscan language Sanskrit literature SCO-Linux controversies Anarchism Greece Ancient Greece G__del's incompleteness theorem Taiwanese (linguistics) Culture of Ancient Rome Roman Empire
