grad school abroad i'm an international studies major with a focus in international relations i've just switched majors and i'm doing a little bit more research into the field and what my options are after college so i'm not living in a box but i do know that i wanted to go to grad school in the united kingdom more specifically scotland i was wondering if anyone was aware of possible grants or scholarships for international majors abroad and some other careers that i might not have come across i would really appreciate the help i'm excited about the change there is the rhodes scholarship but that's to oxford in england still it's quite prestigious and probably worth a look on your part the marshall scholarship is also highly prestigious and that's more flexible in that you can attend universities throughout the uk links for these two below i believe that the scottish executive their gov't does offer a limited number of scotland scholarship for master's level study specifically for foreign students i know for a fact that they offer it to australian students so wonder if they may not also have one for students from the us or wherever you are from link to their main page below st andrews a fine scottish university offers a scholarship for foreign students i've linked to marist college's page on this below as a first step in your research on this one you can also check with the british consulate in the us and see if their government offers any scholarships for foreign students to study in scotland lastly you should also check the webpages for the universities you're interested in in scotland if they are like oxford some of their constituent colleges may offer scholarships for foreign students nice thing about scotland too is that once you graduate you can stay and work in the country for up to two years as part of the fresh talent scheme Medicine Physician Education in the United States Doctorate Chinese University of Hong Kong Education in Portugal University of Connecticut Master's degree Chiropractic Georgetown University Chemistry Graduate school High school Juris Doctor Florida State University Education in Taiwan Science Advanced Placement Program Education Education in Australia Law school Education in Romania Virginia Commonwealth University Johns Hopkins University Alternative medicine Far Eastern University University of Pennsylvania Traditional Chinese medicine Psychiatry Education in Germany University of California, Irvine Tai Chi Chuan Health science Linus Pauling Johns Hopkins Hospital Occupational Medicine Community college Heidelberg College Stevens Institute of Technology College SAT University of Michigan University of California, Los Angeles Physics Inorganic chemistry Stuyvesant High School Medical University of South Carolina Secondary education in the United States Duke University School of Medicine College admissions University of Central Florida Shreveport, Louisiana Vanderbilt University University of M__nster Columbia University IB Diploma Programme __cole Polytechnique Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Dafydd Williams Veterinary medicine North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics Numerus clausus Seneca College Clements High School University of Hong Kong Massachusetts Institute of Technology British Medical Journal Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Sun Yat-sen University Gymnasium (Denmark) AIDS reappraisal ETH Zurich University of Alabama Chronic fatigue syndrome Ontario Academic Credit University of Queensland Duke University Grove City College Cannabis rescheduling in the United States University of Rochester California Institute of Technology General practitioner Education in Malaysia Hopkins School University of Coimbra The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio Australian National University Cornell University Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination Charles Darwin's illness Publicly funded medicine UCAS Breastfeeding Leaving Certificate Graduate Record Examination Folic acid
