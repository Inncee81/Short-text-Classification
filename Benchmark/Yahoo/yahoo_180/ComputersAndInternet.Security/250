do macs have virus protection built in my friend said that when she was buying her macbook she asked about virus protection and they said it was built in with no subscription or software is that true seeing as how none of the people answering so far know i'll tell you no there is no antivirus software built in the reason is that the mac has a small userbase compared to windows machines so it's not a very good target for attack as it'd affect very few people however the mac os blocks the most common paths viruses use to enter your machine and apple issues bugfixes frequently when a vulnerability is found so macs are pretty safe in that regard same with linux just don't let them lie about antivirus protection macs are protected against common attacks but if there were to be a real virus there's nothing to stop them plain and simple Computer virus Anti-virus software Microsoft Windows Software bug Filename extension Skype Mac OS X Operating system Computer security Spyware Rootkit USB flash drive Mac OS 9 Mydoom Windows XP Mach kernel Windows Vista Microsoft Word AOL Instant Messenger Apple Macintosh Copyleft X Window System Peer-to-peer Internet security Norton AntiVirus Thread (computer science) Copy protection Unicode Mozilla Firefox Blue screen of death Floppy disk Pretty Good Privacy Linux Internet Relay Chat Trusted computing History of the graphical user interface History of Microsoft Windows HyperCard Microsoft Office IPod Windows 2000 Perl E-mail spam Opera (web browser) NX bit Linux kernel Kazaa Common Lisp 64-bit MMORPG Buffer overflow Steam (content delivery) NeXT Wine (software) Timeline of computing 1990-forward Malware Digital rights management One-time pad Library (computer science) Computer surveillance World of Warcraft Microsoft Spam (electronic) MSN Messenger Common criticisms of Microsoft Uplink (computer game) Text editor Apple Intel transition ITunes Java programming language Lisp programming language Zone Labs Common Unix Printing System Commodore 64 Amiga Linux distribution Naval mine Platform (computing) Trojan horse (computing) PHP GNU General Public License Microprocessor Denial-of-service attack Vorbis Emulator IBM PC compatible Mac OS X v10.0 System 7 (Macintosh) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Kernel (computer science) ITunes Music Store Session Initiation Protocol Darwin (operating system) Booting Mac OS X v10.3 Censorware
