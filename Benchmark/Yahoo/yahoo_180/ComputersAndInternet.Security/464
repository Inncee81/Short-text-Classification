anyone with norton anti virus ive just installed a few questions just installed norton anti virus to replace my old ntl anti virus am i protected now its installed just done a full scan and it found a low risk tracking cookie it gave me options fix ignore exclude i chose fix and its gone but whats the difference between fix and exclude ive already have a zone alarm firewall installed and i think this norton anti virus has installed another when i did a live update i no its bad to have firewalls as they clash but how do i no if norton definately installed a firewall cant find it in the options but its in the update list im a bit confused hope u no what i mean thanks for ur help you'll have to look at the help page to find out the difference between fix and exclude at a rough guess fix probably means remove exclude means do not remove you should be able to tell which firewall is running because you will probably have an icon in your system tray next to the clock at the bottom right hand of your screen if you hover over the icon with our mouse it will probably say what it is doing it is pointless having firewalls running as they are duplicating your protection and using up unnecessary resources check what is running by using task manager press ctrl alt delete and click on the processes tab Windows XP Windows 2000 Computer virus Spyware E-mail spam Anti-virus software Firewall (networking) Microsoft Windows Mozilla Firefox OpenBSD Blue screen of death Steam (content delivery) Poker jargon CPU cache Diablo II: Lord of Destruction AmigaOS Bluetooth Gmail Malware Rootkit Internet security DragonFly BSD Buffer overflow Zone Labs Proxy server Linux Spam (electronic) Windows Server 2003 Prostate cancer MDAC System 7 (Macintosh) Windows Vista Broadband Internet access Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Software bug Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Unicode Extreme Programming ITunes PaX Netfilter/iptables Burglar alarm Comparison of web browsers Minesweeper (computer game) Telephone numbering plan Norton Commander Common Unix Printing System Knoppix Web crawler Personal firewall Charles Ives History of the graphical user interface Taskbar Apollo Guidance Computer Thermal power station Screenshot EIA-708 Cytomegalovirus Control Panel (Windows) City of Heroes Computer insecurity Teen Girl Squad Sudoku Screensaver Python programming language AOL Instant Messenger Tank Opera (web browser) Btrieve Trademark Pretty Good Privacy JavaScript WordPerfect IMac FreeBSD Appliance Wget Macromedia Flash DNA Read-copy-update Internet Explorer Colorectal cancer Control-Alt-Delete Cheating in Counter-Strike History of Microsoft Windows Mac OS X Password Dash Architecture of Windows 2000
