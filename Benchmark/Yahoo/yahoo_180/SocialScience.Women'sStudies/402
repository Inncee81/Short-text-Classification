is the princess syndrome a major road block in feminism from reading a lot of answers i'm starting to think one problem with feminism and men who hate feminism is the tendency to generalize we all do it feminist assume anti feminist men hate women and men assume all independent women are feminists but i think the princess syndrome is a major reason for this women who believe in the whole women first mentality these princesses while not necessarily being feminist still manage to enjoy the rewards of feminism and these are the women who make feminism look bad as well they are the ones who follow the double standard and expect equality while also expecting special treatment for being female its especially hard for men today because every woman out there has their own little idea of how a man should treat a woman and if he gets it wrong he is attacked there is really no rule anymore and thats why a lot of men are very frustrated agree yes it has got a lot to answer for all the confusion that this princess behavior causes i really feel for men theses days dammed if they do no wonder we find it so hard to get on it seems women have their own agenda these days and try to fit men around it accordingly men heres a tip avoid all women who insist on be called princess Gender role Feminism God and gender History of intersex surgery Sex-positive feminism Sigmund Freud Gender-neutral language Asperger syndrome Fathers' rights Adult attention-deficit disorder Ethics Transgender Procrastination Theory of conduct Fight Club Androgen insensitivity syndrome Domestic violence Homosexuality and transgender Sadism and masochism Sexual orientation Contract Social rule Feminist movement The Apprentice 2 History of feminism Homophobia Civil rights Eugenics Cancer Liberalism Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Intersex surgery Dissociative identity disorder Animal rights Women in Islam John Money Little Britain Cult Hikikomori Orgasm Abortion Volleyball Masculism Autism Lesbian Transfeminism Stomach cancer Susan McClary Misogyny The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Addiction Religion and sexuality Anti-Mormonism Poker jargon Church of Christ Philosophy of language Democracy Goodness and value theory Biology and sexual orientation Mary Wollstonecraft Andrea Dworkin Same-sex marriage Media and ethnicity Bipolar disorder Avenue Q Anarchism Infantilism Internet troll Strap-on dildo The Contender (television series) Clinical depression Traumatic brain injury Mojave people Free will Lisp programming language Human sexual behavior Gender studies Gaze Germaine Greer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Discordianism Borderline personality disorder Mathematician Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Heteronormativity Penis envy Anorexia nervosa Friedrich Nietzsche Arthur Schopenhauer Leadership Seneca Falls Convention Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism High-heeled shoe Plame affair Radical feminism American individualist anarchism Religion and sexual orientation
