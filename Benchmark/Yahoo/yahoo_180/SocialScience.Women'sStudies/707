feminists about predominantly female occupations i'd like to hear what feminists think of as the eventual future state of things in occupational fields that women dominate such as elementary education or nursing etc will an effort eventually have to be made to get an equal number of males in there with a kind of affirmative action or will we continue to pick proportionally from applicants as they come and just see if things even themselves out the way men seem to continually dominate certain things like the military i know it's not a high priority today but i'm curious that's a really excellent question and i really don't know the thing about most women's professions is that they come with little power and influence and as another respondent noted little pay and many times little thanks there's less of a problem with having fewer men in a field like secretarial work where little decision making is done than there is with having fewer women in positions of power e g in congress and the courts did you know congress still is comprised of only about percent women i think the men who want to go into traditionally female work and vice versa are just fantastic but a lot's going to have to change to get women into welding and men into child care again which is better paid by far welding Gender role Feminism Gender-neutral language Education in the People's Republic of China Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Affirmative action Economic inequality Welding Fathers' rights Civil rights Ethics Education in Japan Israeli Arab Congress of the United States Article One of the United States Constitution U.S. Electoral College Equal Protection Clause United States House of Representatives Education in the United States Transsexuality Woman United States Senate NAACP Homemaker Medicine Capitalism Rosa Parks Military of the United States Feminist movement Federal Marriage Amendment Same-sex marriage Extreme Programming Patriarchy George W.
