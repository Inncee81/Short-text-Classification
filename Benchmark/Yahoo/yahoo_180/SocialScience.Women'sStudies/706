do women really have it worse than men with as little troll in this question as possible i will procede can anyone tell my why women today can get of murder just by saying not even proving he hit me don't they almost always get custody of kids in courts they can get the same job as a man if a women says someone raped her he is pretty much looked at as a scumbag right then without any proof remember that girl who said some guys raped her from duke didnt that turn out to be false i have never heard of a woman paying alimony or child support so why do chicks have it so bad please do not take this as me hating women or something women are not enslaved and they have equal rights it is in no way the same do they have female sections in resturants do you have diffrent water fountains have you ever been spit on and humiliated and for that matter has anyone ever sprayed you with a firehose the only areas where women's lives are more difficult are possibly in a few third world countries but the men's lives are probably not any better by comparison so maybe not and by biology in the us some states demand that a man support his wife financially but do not demand she reciprocate women file for divorce in about of cases custody is nearly always given to the mother by default and with it child support that is based not on children's cost but the parents incomes with add ons such as life insurance on the payer health insurance on the children child care even for teenage and sometimes even grown children etc and the real killer is that this money does not need to be spent on the children at all it is income to the custodial parent period there are a few women who pay child support but they are more likely to skip out of paying than men the number of women paying alimony is as rare but there are a couple of them usually celebrities then there is the false accusations of abuse rape pedophilia paternity fraud etc where a woman's word is taken as fact without corroborating evidence many men have been released from prison over the past few years after serving up to and over years based on things like mistaken identity many more men who are not guilty are still in prison simply because they cannot prove their innocence a requirement that is counter to procedure of american jurisprudence affirmative action is state mandated discrimination used to elevate the numbers of certain individuals to levels and numbers they cannot accomplish on their own merits this was hijacked by the feminist movement to include women as a minority of the population once employed women can claim sexual harassment against any man and her word is viewed as true the man charged must prove himself innocent and if unable will be terminated and possibly sued or even charged with a crime it is possible but very difficult for a man to charge a woman with harassment at least not to the same extent women's health care and research spending is far higher compared to that of men's in spite of the fact that on average women live longer than men men pay higher premiums for auto insurance because statistically men are more likely to be involved in an accident but women don't pay higher health insurance premiums even though they are many times more likely to utilize medical treatment there is a violence against women's act which is a means of funneling millions of dollars from taxpayers into feminists hands for use in areas like promoting the false accusations of abuse and rape and a place to hide out at tax payer expense there is very few such places for men most states have nothing to assist abused men at all every state and some cities has a women's business section in their state government where women can get low cost loans at tax payer expense to start a business that will most likely fail within the first three years there women can get advice assistance equipment etc but men need not apply in the area of crime when convicted of the same crime a woman will receive less time or more than a man women who murder their husbands or children can often claim pms postpartum depression clinical depression and other emotional and hormonal imbalances which is unavailable in men's defense women control of spending in the free world yet earn only a small portion of it women are paid equally to men in the same category with the same education tenure and dedication but fewer women are qualified for upper ranks of management when compared to men obviously the numbers will be unbalanced and for good reason fewer women are as dedicated as the greater number of men and most women choose part time or lower paying jobs the averages are skewed but the wages are equal there are state and federal laws against pay discrimination and more the area where men are favored is arguably that of physiology which may be the whole reason for so much anti male sentiment in feminism trying to make up by law that which cannot be
