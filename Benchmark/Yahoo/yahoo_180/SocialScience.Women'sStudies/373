domestic violence and women's rights to the people who claim that it is never acceptable for a man to hit a woman i have a few questions for you is it ever acceptable for a woman to hit a man if so why does it work for women only and not for men if a man should suffer the most severe consequences for hitting a woman should a woman who hits a man also suffer the same consequences if not why is it one way for women and another way for men keep in mind when answering that men and women are considered both by law and by social standards as equal if you suggest that men and women are not equal do you support and promote equality for women voting rights salary etc if so why the double standard for those whose answers are not applicable to the questions please spare me your opinions i have seen plenty of women who deliberately provoke and invite violence upon themselves and then act like victims when it happens a good friend told me once about a woman he was seeing who when they had even a minor tiff used to say things to him like why don't you hit me i know you want to hit me c'mon hit me then over and over and over until one day during a fight he found himself actually raising his hand to hit her he didn't follow through but he knew at that moment he had to end that sick relationship immediately and he did this was a man who would never hit any woman i knew him very well that story really got me thinking and i began to closely observe the sorry tales of women who were 'victims' of abuse many of them were not anything like as innocent as they claimed the same went for 'date rape stories many women put themselves in a position where they were vulnerable to an unscrupulous man some deliberately led the guy on and then tried to push him away the stories are legion the truly innocent victim is a relative rarity unfortunately and in entirely too many of the cases women had only themselves and their stupidity to blame it would be a much different world if women spent more time on the insides of their heads instead of the outside Abortion debate Rape Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Child sexual abuse Divorce EastEnders Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Plame affair Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Utilitarianism Estoppel Theodicy Social rule Women in Islam Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Civil rights Feminism Federal Marriage Amendment Economic inequality Sin City Age of consent Infantilism Socrates Roe v.
