decrease in my sex drive my husband and i have been happily married yrs and i am and he is during our whole marriage my sex drive seemed higher then his and lower then most men that i have heard and read about well anyways for the past months his sex drive has gotten higher and wants to do it more then he use to he says he wants me more and wants to make our sex life better but my sex drive has gone down for yrs and yrs i waited for this change in him and now that it has happened it doesnt seem important or matter to me anymore and i dont know why cause i still love him more then anything and still find him sexy and attractive but i just dont have the desire like i did when i was in my mid 's thru my 's we still make love a few times a week and its still satisfying but i dont have the desire like i use to going to a dr is not an option cause we have no medical insurance so any other idea's so what is my problem i know one way to rev up your drive exercise you need some good cardio workout it is the best therapy for this type of problem talking about it won't fix it you have to move your body to get it back in full form and function i was in a similar situation and i began running from zero i went to running miles every other day it took months to work up to miles but if i can do it so can you you can swim bike skate whatever even walking fast but do it for at least hour each day or every other day you won't believe how that will renew you if you don't want to do it alone ask him to share or a close friend if you move your body and get it tuned up your mind and heart will follow and so will your drive you will feel alive and he will notice a difference that you will be living every day it's worked for countless others who have been in the same situation you have nothing to lose by trying it and it's free no drugs no doctors no psychiatrists or psychologists no lame advice this will do it for you trust that just get up and move and don't stop make it a routine for the rest of your life you will thank yourself and so will he Sexual orientation Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Prostate cancer Milton H.
