should i be more selfish with women i am brought up with hindu value s yup they are the goddess in hinduism allways followed this value s but its seems in the modern world it only back fires i mean should i drop all these value s i allways treat every women i like with respect putting their wants ahead sometimes because its important in relationships but it gets backfired when they become bossy and mistake my respect as being too nice its funny how when i want something then it is wrong but i have to do what she wants because i am a man how come is it that i need to follow her idea s of what she wants from a man but when i say it then i am being controlling how come when i talk to my gal friends then she is questioning it out of jealousy but when i do it then i am questioning her privacy some time i dont get it why do women want men to change so much but yet they are not willing to change their idea s for the sake of the relationship i just couldnt take it anymore sex should be sex not a bargaining tool love should be purely love not what she can get from my outta of my love money should be each others money not something that only a man should contribute where is the equality in this how come its not fine for me to dress up the way i want but i cant say a thing to the women about the way she dresses how come its ok for her to dress revealingly to everyone but its not ok for me to look at any other sexy women how come its ok for her to question me about my past but its past is past when it comes to her how come its ok for a women to leave men because she has found true love but when a man leaves a women its called cheating or he is a player how come sex is used as a bargaining tool isnt that worse then a whore atleast a whore is doing it out of neccessity to support herself how come how a man feels doesnt come into place how come its allways how the women feels and when a man questions it then the man is emotional its kinda sad because i do respect women but i dont see the same thing coming back sometimes i do see why some guys are players i mean like me i am beggining to lose the whole idea of trying to be a gentleman i simply dont get the same respect i never liked playing games and allways are truthfull about myself but how come all this things are taken lighty i dont get women who wants man to be sensitve towards what women wants well i did that and i know the reason why most men are not because it gets miss used see man is there for women and likewise i understand that but if i dont get the same respect then its no point in trying to be that perfect guy its tiring i am a person first of all i am not a slave not someone who will become your puppy well maybe thats why men are not sensitive i know i cannot be anymore because my niceness is often being used as a tool for their well being love is love sex is sex money is money no more contradicting rules from women i know this is type of answer im gonna get go for the theraphy grow up be a man thats the way it is etc well i will also get some women telling me how i am an a for telling this but in real fact thats why men cant be sensitive men are men because of this see how my experiance changed me men behaves in such a manner because they know if they were to change being a man then you will have two females in a relationship and when that happens there goes the balance system in the relationship it takes two of the opposite to make a thing work i kinda understand that concept so from now on im gonna be myself ditch the women who disrespects me think about me first and well sex is gonna be sex long gone are the days where men are blamed if the relationship gone bad i think women should think about their responsibilties too instead of shoving their idea of a perfect guy instead of loving a person for the reason of love hmmm change is good human nature when dealing with another human being in the context of a relationship balance is the ticket most women whether we want to admit it or not like a combination of nice guy and challenge especially in the early stages if you come on too strong with the worshiping thing its most likely going to backfire people respect those that have enough self esteem to stand up for themselves and not get walked all over also i don't mean to judge you i offer this as constructive criticism ive seen plenty of your posts i usually avoid your questions because they are so long and boring and rambling if this is how you converse in your day to day life if you over talk and ramble that could be a huge reason that you have relationship problems no offense but you might want to dial back on the over analysing rambling good luck edit you're ideals are so black and white its that gray area of balance that makes
