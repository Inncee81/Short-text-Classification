what is your idea of the family norm when i say family norm i mean the role of the woman the man and the child children what is your view on this i would like to see if our way if thinking has changed a family norm is a family in which each person is allowed to freely express his her thoughts in so far as those thoughts do not damage another family member everyone has input but final decisions are made by the adult or the adults jointly every person's dignity and personhood is respected the rules as set down by the adult or adults are clear fair and enforced any member of the famiy who is not an adult is given an explanation regarding why the adult family member decided as he she did not by way of having to explain themselves but by way of respecting the younger people's rights to know why something is happening to them the family spends time together as a family at least a couple of times a week all adults are treated equally regardless of age gender etc all children are treated equally regardless of gender age may play into this somewhat though being that a year old should be allowed to drive without having to wait for a year old sibling to catch up all members of the family are loved by someone and that love is regularly expressed it doesn't have to be mushy it does have to be said Abortion debate Gender role Transsexuality Sexual orientation Christian views of women Fathers' rights Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Social psychology Polyamory Divorce Human Theory of conduct Culture Transactional analysis Homosexuality Same-sex marriage Social justice Consensus decision-making Civil rights Contract Infantilism Marriage Person Nudity Family Age of consent Economic inequality Woman Gay rights Motion picture rating system Religion and sexuality French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Brave New World Order of succession Ruth Bader Ginsburg Polygamy Pedophilia Predestination Cross-dressing Religious Society of Friends Freedom of speech Ethics Political correctness Children of God Treaty Sex Legal aspects of transsexualism Theodicy God Human sexual behavior Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Homophobia Lawrence v.
