have you ever heard this from a misandrist out of curiosity you know what i think's funny raping men you know what's so funny raping men beating men and killing men btw this is not something i am saying i am asking if anyone has heard this type of thing being said by misandrists i do not condone this and am appalled that someone would say this to anyone it's still not funny to be raped jackal would you think it were funny if you had a daughter she was raped or if your mother were raped yes mike i understand but i'm afraid that some men do think it's funny many more than people realize and those men do commit those acts i find it rather disturbing that someone could take pleasure in the pain of others that is something i cannot understand so hellfire what would be worse than what you jackal said was funny to do to women hm what exactly makes me a misandrist that i don't want men to go around raping women and laughing about it you have nothing with which to back that statement up if i have done anything that could be construed as hate speech it was not to the entire male population but to an individual just because that individual happend to be male does not make me a misandrist hello did you read what i wrote you're really messed up lady you shouldn't have kids i mean really messed up i hope someone takes your kids away you're a horrible mother where does that say i thought it was funny i thought it was horrible beyond words horrible hellfire you have proven with your answer without a doubt that you are completely delusional http answers yahoo com question index qid aasw cp r w pa fzpthwf bgrx ofmitjtuvhwltmfntrbxzj v rkctokhyd q paid answered dphzcdvcclr uzhdnv read my answer for yourselves everyone i haven't altered it a bit thank you jackal i did not and i re read your editted answer and now think perhaps you were referring that particular lady if so completley understandable she did bring that sort of thing upon herself with that question dorian misandrists on here i'll take your word for it i'm sure worse has been said by misandrists and misogynists both but that does not make either okay at all okay rio clone jackal you're obviously ignoring the caps right below the quotes where i say i didn't say that it's not okay so stop being purposely dumb hellfire she is a misandrist definitely i do not deny that inthe least and i didn't take your word for it because you were the one saying those things of course you're going to say you've seen worse in order to villanize women and therefore justify what you said i asked you to give an example of what was worse that raping beating and killing someone i didn't even ask for proof just what was worse instead you put words in my mouth and called me a misandrist for no apparent reason i do remember those questions posted over over over a guy asking if a woman would kick him in the balls right and yes i was appalled at some of the answers i answered a couple times that the only way i'd so such a thing would be in self defense btw so i agree there are misandrists on here i never denied that and i was actually curious if they had talked about raping beating killing men ok lycraspandex i believe you about dworkin does it make you feel better to try belittle me for having an issue with people joking about raping beating killing others how are those statements not trolling those statements are meant to evoke an emotional response much more than me truly asking if anyone had seen this same behavior in misandrists i wanted to compare the two i have heard this said before and i think it is appauling thank you for pointing it out to people most think it is a joke but the sad truth is it happens more than anyone wants to admit and the psychological damage is devastating due to the way people see men as being in charge and unable to have this weakness i think the joking about it is horrid and i would not wish this on my worst enemy male or female Theory of conduct Theodicy Shaggy dog story EastEnders Social rule Milton H.
