feminists why do you think men complain about most women not being accountable do you think we're a bunch of myopic whiners do you think we're running into and concentrating on too many bad examples and it's skewing our perceptions do you simply recognize that women have more albeit relatively minor incidences of low accountability than men rainbow sounds like myopic whiner eh because most people refuse to look at their own actions and focus on themselves the way i see it b tching about what someone else did only brings a person farther from their own personal growth complaining about what other people do and that which you cannot change is a nice distraction from looking to the self and what you can change and as far as your assumptions about women having no accountability and men having more when i read your guys' posts about this and i think of my past relationships the word women can easily be replaced with girly's ex boyfriends and be just as factual in my mind it never fails that this is my largest beef when ending any relationship that they did not take enough responsibility and personal accountability then i wake up and realize it takes two to tango and the only thing i can do is walk away and try to learn from past mistakes imho both sexes have issues with personal accountability myself and you included and pointing out what others are doing wrong only another example of it Feminism Domestic violence Transsexuality Memento (film) Sex and the City A Course In Miracles Corporate governance Theory of conduct Androgen insensitivity syndrome Milton H.
