if feminist want men to judge by personality and not looks then y are most of them stuck up to men i posted something up earlier saying most feminist are unattractive and somebody says this to me i quote this they simply ask equality which you have proven to be unfulfiled since you have judged them by their physical aethetical appearance which is the calibre with which women are being rated judged for ages k so if you want us to judge you as a person inside then y do you act the way you do so even your personality is unattractive as well as the outside this goes to most feminist not all that person was me but i never told you to judge them by personality either i said never judge a cause by its activists i believe that any activist is an extremist a fanatic in pushing a cause nobody is ever proud of the activists of any cause they are simply doing a dirty job that somebody has to do which is simply making as much noise attracting as much attention as required in order to grabb the attention of the fluff oriented media it's a marketing promotion starategy so forget their image and even forget their personality and focus on the main issue they are promoting i believe that you love your mother your sister your partner your future or present daughter enough to wish them fair tolerant and prospectful life much respects Gender role Physical attractiveness Asian fetish Human sexual behavior Masculism Sexual orientation Feminism Fathers' rights Fathers' rights movement in the UK Same-sex marriage Domestic violence Abortion debate Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Transsexuality Biology and sexual orientation Feminist movement Grimke Sisters Gender-neutral language Abortion in the United States Simone Weil EastEnders Civil rights Divorce Homophobia Polyamory Andrea Dworkin Plame affair Yoko Ono Pedophilia Mumia Abu-Jamal Bernard Williams Bisexuality Homosexuality and Christianity Reparative therapy Dead Like Me Autism rights movement Feminists for Life Theodicy Lesbian Transgender Internet troll Religion and sexuality History of women in the United States Pornography in Japan Sex-positive feminism Jane Fonda Fox News Body image Characters in the Smurfs Polygamy Fuel injection Homosexuality and transgender Roe v.
