why are women most intelligent than men if you say because we are special then you are clearly dumb i should think it's because the female brain is able to multi task while the male brain functions in a linear way this was very useful in primitive times when men would need to focus solely on tracking and hunting meat for long periods of time and needed to develop a strong linear focus to keep motivated the women would remain in camp home tending to a vast variety of tasks while the men were away including maintaining small crops fishing making mending clothes as well as child rearing etc so needed to develop a powerfully multi tasking brain for success these male and female traits are still with us today men display their linear focus in work and war women tend to be more creative flexible thinkers due to their natural multi task ability which can help expand intelligence Intelligence quotient Intelligence (trait) Whale Human Artificial neural network Gender role Physical attractiveness Human brain Tank classification Dyslexia Motivation Dog Second language acquisition Computer Strap-on dildo Leadership Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Asperger syndrome Dynamical system Veganism Stone Age Terminal ballistics General intelligence factor Psychology Comanche Eye Canadian Coast Guard Mach kernel Working memory History of intersex surgery Stuttering Digital photography Game programmer IBM PC compatible Strategic management Race and intelligence Sociocultural evolution Equine conformation Knife Urinary incontinence Clothing Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Sex and intelligence Eugenics Salic law Ostrich W.
