a man will beat up another man for touching his girlfriend inappropriately why don't women do same viceversa a man will beat up or at least sternly address warn a man that is being physically or verbally inappropriate with his girlfriend why is it that women in america don't stick up for their men if it were the same vice versa remember when leonardo dicaprio got cut with a broken bottle by some random crazy woman dicaprio's woman sat and did nothing this wouldn't be the case if a man did this to his girlfriend he'd let him have it a man isn't supposed to hit a woman and most men will not hit a woman the only alternative is for a woman to do something about it when another woman is out of control it's acceptable for a woman to hit another woman if that is the only form of resolution why don't women in america stick up for their men women if you saw a woman spit in your boyfriend or husband's face or saw her being verbally abusive to him or saw her punch him would you let her have it or would you just sit there and let him deal with it himself because he's the man machpen i'm not talking about two women fighting over one man in a love triangle i'm referring to a woman defending her boyfriend because a random woman decided to pick on him and abuse him tera i find that statement about women not being conditioned to fight another woman as being sexist towards women many women that are physically fit strong and can kick ass would be offended by your statement no one said anything about her fighting a man but fighting someone of the same gender how is she going to be inferior against another woman of relatively equal size and strength i was saying when all options have been exhausted and the only way to get the abusive woman away from your boyfriend is with physical force obviously everyone wants to resolve a situation with the minimum conflict as possible but i'm referring to women who become cowards in the face of other women and expect a guy who can't hit a woman to solve a situation with another woman hitting him kjh please read again not another man defending a woman from her boyfriend obiously that would be their business i'm referring to a man defending his girlfriend from another man that's being physically or verbally abusive gc i'm not a woman and i don't fight chicks not talking about a guy hanging out with a verbally abusive woman or trailer trash i'm referring to a guy that is being randomly attacked by a verbally abusive trailer trash woman kjh you got even more confusing simply put a guy with his girlfriend his girlfriend gets attacked by some other guy the boyfriend protects his girlfriend from attacker the end why is everyone being so ridiculously nit picky i still can't get over the fact that people never answer questions but instead like to scrutinize every word rather than what you actually are getting at anyway i completely one hundred percent agree with you girls rarely do it and it is very disrespectful i stand up for my girlfriend and she does the same for me the other day we were waiting in line for the harry potter book and this girl who was that i was discussing musical taste with kept kicking me when i'd say something she didn't like i was polite she was just a brat and her parents with her it felt horrible because its its like you're a guy you feel powerless like you can't do anything if i tell her off i'm an asshole and have to spend the next three hours in line with a bunch of people who hate me you know my girlfriend handled it how it should be but few do it anyway great question thanks for asking it Domestic violence EastEnders Knots Landing Social rule Joke Gender-neutral language Poker jargon The Marshall Mathers LP Plame affair Avenue Q One Tree Hill (TV series) Little Britain English grammar Shaggy dog story Theory of conduct Kodocha Transsexuality Futurama (TV series - season 5) Sexual orientation True Crime: Streets of LA Beavis and Butt-head Something Positive Contract Kyle Broflovski Infantilism Milton H.
