if i took a women's studies course at college would i be singled out and discriminated against by women i've heard horror stories from guys that took gender women's studies courses at college they said first and foremost they stood out like a sore thumb since they were a guy they said there's usually or guys in a class of about so the men will get singled out and receive mean stares from already embittered women students and professor that hates men they said the women professors hate men and a man will have to work about twice as hard a woman to earn the same grade they said the men are routinely ridiculed and embarrassed by the female students and the professor i've contemplated taking women's studies so i can better understand and be concordant with the female specimen however the horror stories told to me may turn me off from following through with such an idea perhaps its best to drop the idea altogether any men or women that have taken a women's studies course care to shed light on why these women are like this towards the men waswis interesting can you elaborate as to why these men got attention and what makes the women foolish for trying to enlighten the guys i took a couple of graduate seminars in women's studies when i was an undergrad and found it interesting i did find some hostility but if you're an intelligent guy with a thick skin then go for it every guy should know about what goes on in women's studies classes feminist theory is often bizarre and often represents almost unimaginable strainings to hammer square facts into round holes through extreme selectivity of vision by validating feelings more than inconvenient data and by some epistemological theories that defy belief many feminist authors try to swamp the reader with citations and huge bibliographies take the time to check out the sources they sometimes include valid data but if you compare the conclusions drawn from them they often rely on very strained and selective interpretations of those data there are a lot of references to third and fourth rate sociological studies whose conclusions don't follow from their data and references to the work of other feminist authors who also treat citation validity as a matter of quantity instead of quality and you should really read some of the leading lights of feminism from betty friedan to mary daly and susan griffin to barbara ehrenreich to see how in the worst cases the stuff is just insane and in the less bad cases it's merely very biased from a particular female point of view and makes no worthy claim for ganeral validation except as evidence of how some women think every guy should come to understand the critique of phallocentrism and the dead white men of antiquity and then use its methodology to guage the uterocentrism of today's conventional wisdom every guy should take women's studies and come to know why serious philosophers don't take feminist theory seriously as intellectual work the basic traditional tenets of feminism are important and valid women should have equal rights and safety but the quality of the intellectual work of recent decades is quite shoddy and consists primarily of attempts to twist the assumptions criteria and methods of intellectual work so that equality ends up being defined in heavily biased ways that knock down any advantage that men have and ignore any power and advantages that women have so that equality is equal on feminists' terms and only on feminists' terms the more benign excuse is that perhaps that women's studies majors need to keep themselves in steady employment and have to keep pushing the envelope further even though the bottom of it blew out long ago that would at least make the more extreme of them seem a bit less delusional but don't take my word for it go in with an open mind and a thick skin and trust your gut don't let the heavy approval witholding pressure get to you by all means do a little reading on phallocentrism before you make your foray get familiar enough with it so that you can give some thought to what uterocentrism would look like so you'll have a framework to put your experiences into when they don't seem to make sense or when the social pressure to knuckle under seems overwhelming and remember that there are many women out there who don't buy into this stuff good luck Epistemology
