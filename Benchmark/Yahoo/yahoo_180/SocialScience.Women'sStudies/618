girls how do you feel about the fact that one day it will be your son who will be ordered to leave his house see his children no more than twice a month and pay alimony and child support no unless she is a druggie she will get the children so even if he was a stay at home husband after the divorce he better get a job at mcdonalds to pay child support for his lawyer ex and prays that his mom will take him back because there wont be anything left for rent if she wants a divorce and children are involved he will be ordered to leave his house beeing responsible for children is one thing having no rights whatsoever and beeing at the mercy of the whims of a wife is another thing ok let me rectify unless the mother is a drug addict or willingly gives up custody for the child and no bijou iam not divorced and i will avoid divorce by avoiding marriage as long as girls will dig guys with money i wont be lonely also yes its funny indeed how divorced women who give up child custody are threated with kids gloves while men in that situation loose of their assets no dramaqueen child support isnt just that to support the children else it would be calculated based on the children needs and not based on the fathers income yes and she can break court orders keep his children from seeing him or even talking on the phone but still she gets the kids and he has no rights and every time she switches boyfriends the kids get a new daddy and never get to see or even talk to their real dad but pay that child support equality my ss Divorce Fathers' rights Friends Child custody Child support Marriage Knots Landing EastEnders Laura Schlessinger Fred Phelps Alimony Neighbours Fathers' rights movement in the UK Polygamy Kodocha About a Boy Humphrey Bogart Status of religious freedom in Malaysia Women in Islam Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Visitation Masculism Marriage strike One Tree Hill (TV series) Days of our Lives Babylonian law Domestic violence Shaggy dog story Women in the Victorian era Social rule The O.C.
