apparently they attacked mensa once what is a troll why do trolls do it recognizing trolls who is at risk when should you be concerned eradication an introduction to dross the object of this page is to bring together a definitive document to cover the utter sadness of the internet troll usually a troll is nothing more than a passing nuisance but as this page will show they can be a worry stalkers however it is almost invariably an inadequate individual who can be safely ignored this page will define the activity and help with early recognition once acknowledged trolls can take up residence and like athlete's foot can be difficult to shift and when you've finished here i recommend this fairly comprehensive guide to managing sad thirteen year olds loose on mom's computer what is a troll the term derives from trolling a style of fishing which involves trailing bait through a likely spot hoping for a bite the troll posts a message often in response to an honest question that is intended to upset disrupt or simply insult the group usually it will fail as the troll rarely bothers to match the tone or style of the group and usually its ignorance shows why do trolls do it i believe that most trolls are sad people living their lonely lives vicariously through those they see as strong and successful disrupting a stable newsgroup gives the illusion of power just as for a few stalking a strong person allows them to think they are strong too for trolls any response is 'recognition' they are unable to distinguish between irritation and admiration their ego grows directly in proportion to the response regardless of the form or content of that response trolls rather surprisingly dispute this claiming that it's a game or joke this merely confirms the diagnosis how sad do you have to be to find such mind numbingly trivial timewasting to be funny remember that trolls are cowards they'll usually post just enough to get an argument going then sit back and count the responses yes that's what they do how can troll posts be recognised no imagination most are frighteningly obvious sexist comments on nurses' groups blasphemy on religious groups i kid you not pedantic in the extreme many trolls' preparation is so thorough that while they waste time they appear so ludicrous from the start that they elicit sympathetic mail the danger is that once the group takes sides the damage is done false identity because they are cowards trolls virtually never write over their own name and often reveal their trolliness and lack of imagination in the chosen id as so many folk these days use false id this is not a strong indicator on its own crossposting any post that is crossposted to several groups should be viewed as suspicious particularly if unrelated or of opposing perspective why would someone do that off topic posting often genuine errors but if from an 'outsider' they deserve matter of fact response if genuine a brief apposite response is simply netiquette if it's a troll post you have denied it its reward repetition of a question or statement is either a troll or a pedant either way treatment as a troll is effective missing the point trolls rarely answer a direct question they cannot if asked to justify their twaddle so they develop a fine line in missing the point thick or sad trolls are usually sad lonely folk with few social skills they rarely make what most people would consider intelligent conversation however they frequently have an obsession with their iq and feel the need to tell everyone this is so frequent that it is diagnostic somewhere on the web there must be an intelligence test for trolls rigged to always say above who is at risk any newsgroup bulletin board forum or chatroom can attract trolls but they don't have the brains to attack nuclear physicists and they are drawn to the quick response where sex religion and race are found so politics is easy prey one troll famously tried to infiltrate a mensa group the results read like trolls and one regular it didn't have a chance but it was stupid enough to persist until removed when should you be concerned usually no though fractured funny bones and occasional waves of nausea have been reported when a troll become persistent and personal you may need to consider the possibility that it has fermented into an internet stalker equally pathetic if not more so but sometimes requiring weedkiller find out more trolls if they had brains they just might be dangerous maybe this question should be posted once every minutes hours a day i loved seeing the responses you already know who the trolls are and aren't by their response ignoring troll questions is good hard to do sometimes and they're right about when you answer a troll question they love it when you show anger and irritation but i wonder how they feel when you just state the facts calmly when answering questions i often do that because i'm not upset but like to see if it irritates other trolls not the troll asker lol and other times i answer the question and point out i know it's a stereotype so the newbies are aware they're just yanking their chain i enjoy mocking troll posts that seems to work sometimes since quite a few have blocked me i block people if i think they're stupid or crazy or boring but i definitely must get to a few of them since they still find it necessary to answer my questions even when they're blocked but they're right in the info you stated in your question trolls love it if you try to disprove their question but i do that sometimes for the uninformed not the trolls i know the trolls are a hopeless lot Atheism Autism rights movement Theory of conduct B3ta Traumatic brain injury Cancer Deconstruction Social rule Psychology I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Blog
