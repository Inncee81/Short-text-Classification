feminists may you give me a source that states women make less than men due to discriminatory pratices i heard it so many times women make less than men for every dollar feminists cannot seem to agree on the real amount women make for every dollar a man makes i have heard them say women make or for evert dollar a man makes which is it aren't feminists especially the radical ones and misandrists supposed to know this things it is their issue yet they cannot agree on a how do they expect me to believe in their fairytale wage gap with stuff like this i want a study which compares men and women within a same company with the same job and job title who have been working for the company just as long working the same amount of hours each week with the same flexibility ability to work extra hours with the same credentials and experiences who took just as many sick days off where the women did not take any maternity leave i will then evaluate the credibility of the source blogs are worthless if you comply and meet requirements i shall believe this wage gap and raise awareness of it i shall fight for your cause failure to comply will result in showing of feminists are full of crap get to work posters you are proving my point you ask me not to question this as to not create more percentages you can disagree on well too bad you ask me to make my own studies i have it says there is no wage gap poster made up stuff the ''geek'' fails to understand ''supply and demand'' http en wikipedia org wiki supply and demand she fails to acknowledge feminism argument of women being discriminated against which results in lesser pay she thinks employers should give single moms more time off etc well get real in the real world employers want people that work when needed no employer will hire a mom that needs a day off every week over a wo man that takes a day off every month she needs to get real this is business if you have no sources to give me then don't fucking spam in my fucking question thx i do not wish to debate here if you're open minded enough for a debate and have enabled email i will email you for now i am done commenting on answers it works to their advantage because most people are too lazy to do their own homework or even worse do their own thinking the reason the percentages never settle on any amount is because it is all smoke and mirrors not reality when like is compared to like men and women are paid the same the eeoc demands women be paid equally to that of equally situated men backed by state and federal law any woman who feels they are being discriminated against only has to file a claim and eeoc will do all the work investigate any claims and fine and or punish violators the problem is feminists compare like with different to prove how unequal wages are which is much like saying teenagers with summer jobs are discriminated against because they don't earn the same amount as a tenured full time employee working a different job in a different company by the way your statistic is wrong the correct number is closer to first the sheer amount of work according to the bureau of labor statistics full time men clock an average of hours a week while women put in hours men are more than twice as likely as women to work at least hours a week that s why most ceos are male only in a socialist economy do employees get paid the same regardless of the number of hours worked second men tend to gravitate to the socially unrewarding but lucrative fields like computer programming tax law and engineering and women select professions such as teaching nursing and social work that pay less but offer more job flexibility third is job desirability recently the jobs rated almanac rated jobs based on income work environment physical demands stress and so forth these were the five worst jobs seaman ironworker cowboy fisherman and lumberjack does it come as a surprise that all of these jobs are male dominated the only way these companies can attract men to do the dirty work is to increase their paychecks finally is the difference in job hazards men represent of all occupational deaths why because if you look at a list of the most hazardous occupations fire fighting truck driving construction and mining they have male employees according to the bureau of labor statistics shouldn t men who risk their lives on a daily basis
