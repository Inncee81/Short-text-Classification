girls are boys are myths stereotypes gender differences as educators and as people we tend to assume that females and males are different are indeed opposite sexes we see someone s sex as an important predictor of their abilities and interests and assume that if we know someone is a girl or a boy we know a lot about them that assumption is wrong knowing someone s sex may tell us a lot about them biologically but it tells us very little about them in other ways knowing someone is a woman does not tell us if her athletic ability is closer to martina navratilova s or a couch potato's knowing someone is a man tells us nothing about whether his math skills reflect those of an einstein or a math phobic sex is not a good predictor of academic skills interests or even emotional characteristics how big are the differences check this paper by patricia b campbell ph d office of educational research and improvement u s department of education richard w riley secretary http www campbell kibler com stereo pdf teeleecee welcome back i missed you great answer i very much agree with you i think it is a very interesting issue if someone tells you since you are born you are stupid because you are a woman man it is possible that the girl boy would have less confidence when she he goes to school thanks for including the paper although i almost never read them having received a nasty virus from one of them but i think i know the gist of the issue there was a movie done years ago called the pinks and the blues and it's about how we segregate children into certain categories right from the beginning i e wrapping baby boys in blue girls in pink there is the myth that male infants are stronger you can tell by the cries and that they are tougher the truth is male children die infancy at a far greater frequency than do female infants and that is because the males are actually weaker in infancy male children are often left to fend for themselves while female children are coddled and overly protected by parents it used to be that males were considered to be naturally better in math and sciences but studies have indicated that males are more encouraged and more closely monitored in these fields because of the expectations of the teachers teachers have a huge role to play in academic expectations as they pay less attention to the girls who express an interest in math science and encourage the boys interested in the same fields in terms of behaviour girls are more likely to be chastised for loud play whereas boys are given the oh they're just boys treatment there are many many studies in this area trying to categorize genders into natural abilities when in fact nothing about these abilities appear to be natural they have everything to do with gender socialization rather than innate abilities separating nature nurture is impossible although scientists try studies of all girl schools show that females do much better when they're not competing for attention with males intellectually there are very few differences between men overall and women overall but women have not had the opportunity to show their stuff on an equal footing with men until quite recently obviously strength and hormonal compositions are different and will have an impact on some things intelligence is however not one of those things opportunity and encouragement are necessary for women to show what they're capable of doing and wrong assumptions will only stifle any potential that is there good question thanks edit hi fh it's nice to hear from you as well cheers Gender role
