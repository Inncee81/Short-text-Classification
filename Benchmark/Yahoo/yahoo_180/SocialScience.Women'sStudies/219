does my talking about sexuality offend people in gws i can ask and answer the same thing over in singles and dating where people are supposed to be less mature and i never get violations there but here i get violations even for the slightest sexual inuendo not that it's going to stop me just wondering what gives i see sexuality as a part of gender studies and since there isn't a biology category i would hope that we could all be mature enough to discuss matters that are even taught in th grade sex ed edit sung yeah right thank you wendy it amazes me too i guess it all depends on who feels like reporting what fyi the first poster sung is not a woman he is a troll so don't waste your energy on him he was trolling i apreciate all the intelligent responses though i doubti'll hear from whoever it is that reports me oh oops i didnt know there was such a category still it amazes me that were not mature enough here so many great answers here i just wish i would have heard from who ever it is that doesnt like what i have to say personally i feel its the sexually uptight amoungst us i try to keep in mind that we are not all adults here and keep my posts apropriate but i'm not perfect i do cross the lines at times i personally am not uncomfortable about discussing sexuality you are not in the least offensive and i can't understand why others would report you however you are also quite outspoken about other areas which might bother the more outspoken trolls and i would imagine that this also intimidates them they certainly are not offensive and hurtful like the jokes about rape please do not change your modus operandi for that reason i enjoy reading your questions and answers and find them both refreshing Sexual orientation Internet troll Rape Theory of conduct Joke Human sexual behavior Infantilism Child sexual abuse Avenue Q Milton H.
