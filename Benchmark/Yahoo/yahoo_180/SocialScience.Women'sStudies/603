gender as a social construct and the pythagorean table of opposites why do people still believe this malarkey that men are the total opposite of women for example that men are logical and women are emotional men are strong and women are weak do you find this just tends to perpetuate gender as a social construct your opinion in my opinion besides the obvious physical differences between men and women we are less opposites than what it has been taught for centuries the only way of one group to have supremacy towards another is by enhancing differences that exist and invent where there are none for example there is a great book called the mismeasure of man by stephen jay gould where he adresses all kind of absurd measurement made in the past by scientists to prove the inferiority of other races same thing has happened through centuries with women it is obvious that if women were not allowed to study but just learn to play the piano and crochet that they perhaps had not the proper tools to debate with a philosopher of those times nevertheless today things have changed and now those differences are shrinking as men and women have the same opportunities to learn and work but old ideas are stubborn and change of ideologies slow also some religions still carry the same patriarchal ideas about the differences between the powerful and the weaker sex your question would need a whole essay as i think there are many branches which help to perpetuate this false gender construct from religion to ancient cultural traditions also based in religion on the other hand we also touch false notions of what is to be intelligent as if an emotional person is not intelligent lately it has been extensively written about emotional intelligence and also about that an aggressive person is not necessary an alpha person but more the person that is able to adapt to circumstances these assumed differences are perhaps also because we see the other as an alien as if there were no empathy and the superficial differences make this gap still deeper i don't know why it comes to my mind one of the early medicine experiments doctors used to open live dogs for their experiments because they thought they could not feel pain as in wars the enemy is dehumanized and women through centuries have been considered also less than human the construction of the alien so it is easier to have the upper hand i don't know if i am making sense as it is very late here but this is a fascinating question that take us to many many different roads Gender role Sexual orientation The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Homophobia Philosophy of language Human Simone Weil Stephen Jay Gould Philosophy of mathematics Sociocultural evolution Social psychology The Mismeasure of Man Franz Boas Bertrand Russell Feminism Atheism Coercion Scientific method Transsexuality Religion Atomism Intelligent design Motivation Culture Creationism Patriotism Psychology Neuro-linguistic programming Plato Human sexual behavior Friedrich Schleiermacher Meaning of life Objectivist philosophy Postmodernism Gender-neutral language Artificial consciousness Race and intelligence (Public controversy) Soul Intelligence (trait) Goodness and value theory Metaphysics Sigmund Freud Narcissism Empathy Confucianism God and gender Carl Jung Gender identity Victor Cousin Meme Theodicy New Age Asperger syndrome Ethics Philosophy Scientology beliefs and practices Chinese language A Course In Miracles History of creationism Economic inequality Race and intelligence Aesthetic Realism God Claude L__vi-Strauss G__del's incompleteness theorem Logic Hypnosis Western philosophy Social justice Consciousness Nature versus nurture Deconstruction Eugenics Anthroposophy Milton H.
