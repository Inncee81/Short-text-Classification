when do we show equality and respect in todays society i think you recieve what you give out so be careful how you act and reply to people of same and opposite sex good point yes i believe that with healthy normal human beings if you show respect you get respect if you smile at someone most of the times you make them smile and so on many people around us are mirrors of ourselves in the sense that if i am in a bad mood and blast at someone because of the way i feel that day well of the times that person will attack back or if we are depressed it seems that people tend to go away from us when we are happy is the opposite we attract people to us so all this to say that respect is the same way if we give respect generally we get respect as also they say that hate creates just more hate respect for me is not to give up your own personal ideologies but is to listen to the other and agree to disagree if necessary yep we are all walking mirrors of each other edited to say i am a woman i forgot to wear some make up in my avatar i don't want to confuse you Social rule Theory of conduct Utilitarianism Abortion debate Eye contact Sexual orientation Goodness and value theory Transgender Objectivist philosophy Current teachings of Prem Rawat Consensual crime Evil English grammar Human sexual behavior Borderline personality disorder Rape Anti-Mormonism The Invisibles Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Homophobia Patriotism Empathy American Psycho Happiness Religion Ten Commandments Alignment (role-playing games) Social justice Charmed K' Brave New World Economic inequality Sex Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an YuYu Hakusho Punk ideology Gay rights Sydney Riot of 1879 Ranma __ characters Liberalism Mojave people Value system Waking the Dragons Transsexuality Sexual addiction Altruism Homosexuality and Christianity Point groups in three dimensions Ethics Fruits Basket Technocratic movement Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Sinfest Futurama (TV series - season 5) Animal rights Infantilism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Mahatma Gandhi Original sin Simone Weil Shaggy dog story Human Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Fallacy Bipolar disorder Nicomachean Ethics Germaine Greer Polyamory Gender identity Sexual attraction Intelligence quotient Human rights Theodicy Cliff Richard Laura Schlessinger Past teachings of Prem Rawat Cult Humphrey Bogart Summa Theologiae Onam Democratic Party (United States) Yoko Ono Gramophone record The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Zoophilia Pitaten Gender role Spanish pronouns Isaac Asimov Aesthetic Realism French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Bulgarian language Black Chosen people Anger management Human height Autism Final Fantasy magic Something Awful Delta Goodrem
