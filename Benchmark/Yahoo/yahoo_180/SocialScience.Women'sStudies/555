feminists question i really don't get the whole feminist thing i'm a woman and every since i was about or so i've never agreed with the majority of the feminists movement in fact i feel that movement has done more to hurt familys than anything else to the feminists out there what makes you think you're right thank you all for your imput far as would i give up what feminists fought for if it'd also erase the damage they have caused then sure to the one talking about burning people to death or mutilation that's not a woman's right issue it's a human rights issue well you might want to check your definition first also many say they're feminists but have no concept of that means let me give you a few examples of why i am one i strongly disagree with female genital cutting female genital mutilation circumcision that happens to young girls in certain african countries they cut the girls' labia and saw them back leaving a small hole so they can urinate the girls get infections that turn fatal in many instances i don't believe one should kill their baby girl after she is born just because she is a girl and the family has no dowry happens in india certain places i think a girl should be fed the same amount as her brother also india i think wife burning is a terrible thing certain indian ppl would burn their wife when the husband died the husband was generally or years old and the girl was arranged marriage i think women in saudi arabia should have the right to drive i also think certain religions have no right to tell a woman how to dress i am referring to places where women are whipped shot mistreated if their ankle is showing or certain religious groups in the us that do not allow women to wear pants feminism is humanism it has nothing to do with bra burning or doing the dishes if a man opens a door for me i say thank you and i understand the art of courtly love i know there are a lot of self proclaimed feminists out there but i'm not the pope just because i say so know what i mean edit capitalism destroys families not feminism get your isms straight read an american tragedy ps between anise smiely waswisgirl and myself i think you have a pretty good idea of the positive things feminists brought to the world Female genital cutting Sharia Women in Islam Theory of conduct The Shining (film) Polygamy Feminism Marriage Gender role Feminist movement Rais massacre Religion and sexuality History of intersex surgery John Money Intersex surgery Masculism Circumcision Mary, the mother of Jesus EastEnders Rastafari movement YuYu Hakusho Domestic violence Woman Genital integrity Yusuf al-Qaradawi Sex-selective abortion and infanticide Androgen insensitivity syndrome Same-sex marriage Ethics Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Amber Spyglass Gender-neutral language Jane Fonda Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Human sexual behavior Penis Deconstruction Sex-positive feminism Gay slang Epistemology Undergarment Fundamentalism Abortion debate Euphemism Religious conversion Heir Apparent Sigmund Freud Jewish view of marriage Civil rights God and gender Capital punishment Objectivist philosophy Anne Boleyn Mahatma Gandhi Incarnations of Immortality Masturbation Fahrenheit 9/11 Transsexuality Orgasm Discordianism Evil History of feminism Piccolo Junior Saga Grimke Sisters Religious pluralism K' One Tree Hill (TV series) Ten Commandments Marilyn Monroe Humphrey Bogart Trousers Goodness and value theory Anarchism in Spain Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Bioethics of neonatal circumcision Sati (practice) Taliban Nonviolence Artemisia Gentileschi German grammar Human rights Patriotism Sexual orientation Frederick Douglass Characters in the Smurfs Scenes from a Memory Eastern Orthodox Church Gandhism Knots Landing
