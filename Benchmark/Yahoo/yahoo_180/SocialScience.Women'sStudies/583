for women to have orgasm okey from my understanding women normally have sex with men she trusts and loves and emotionally attached and for women to really enjoy sex and be able to cum she has to love the men and be emotionally attached to him but i know that doesnt apply to all women as some women women in porn industry nymphomaniacs whores skanks prostitute might be able to cum even if she is not doing it with someone she loves or emotionally attached to is that correct or does it have to do with experience like if women have tons of sex she is able to have an orgasm with a guy who shes not in love with etc also do women who have alot of sex like nymphomaniacs and prostitutes become sorta male like increase in thier male hormone or loose thier feminity in some way i didnt say all women who have sex without emotional attachment or love are whores i said some women so read it carefully delicious if you could cum without being emotionally attached to the person ur having sex with i dont know what makes you so think about that maybe a robot rebel yell you said sex is better with someone you love for both male and female well i will have to disagree with you on this one as some men prefer having wilder creazier sex sometimes not all the time you cant speak for em and i asked if women have alot of sex do they tend to lose faminity because i heard women working at brothel some women there are less feminity and i always wondered about that i dont understand why i am getting angry emotional responses i am first off female and very experienced in sex yes women can cum by having sex with someone who is not emotionally attached to just like there are people who have sex with objects animals people you name it but we are talking about the norms the natural prefered way the way god had created us i dislike the trend of where women take sexually liberated role such as sex and the city girls gone wild all these sex tapes promote very dangerous also wrong ideas to our women in our generation that are confused than ever we do not have to give them guilt trip but make sure they understand sex were not supposed to be about recretional fun exercise where we could do it with someone whom you are not emotionaly attached to i think this is where women get brainwashed because now they feel less inhibited i had to make mistakes on my own to understand my own sexuality and learn about sex but we should not give out these confused women sex can be this and that i guess i regret doing it too fast for my age cuz sex was what were talked about the most by your so called sexually liberated females i regret so much having sex with the men i never loved and much more sexually experienced than i was because of that i was mistaken love with sex when i shouldve learned about love first i guess i am such a sensitive one and perhaps blame myself but i just think some of these sexually liberated women talking about sex with no emotional attachment or love might be the most confused one of all and probably the product of male brainwashing holy crap i wish i could really swear on here because you really take the chauvinistic ignorant moron cake here buddy women can cum if their idiot men know what they're doing they don't need to be attached in any way to do so although granted it is better if they do and as for the hookers and porn hey boy ever heard of faking it my god where the hell have you been i'll give you a buck for every hooker who ever had a real orgasm with a john and even though i'm between jobs right now i'd still have enough left in the bank for next months rent men are sometimes so pushy for sex that many women will have sex with them just to shut them up this does not mean that they enjoy it at all let alone cum apparently centuries of being told what to do and beaten if you didn't is a hard habit to break i'm not saying women are easy either so don't bother reading into that the men may be thinking sluts but the women know what i'm talking about we've all been there of course sex is preferred with love over none women are emotional creatures and men are emotional morons they use women even if they claim they don't i find that the men who claim they dont' use women for sex have developed their personality so that it appeals to the emotional side of a women to further sway them into deciding to have sex with the guy who's sweet talking her it's all a game to them and do men become more feminine if they have a lot of sex holy crap were you sick with the measels the week of sex ed at your school anyone will tell you that women of a brothel are anything but manly if anything they are exaggertatingly female it's better for business because that's what it is and the orgasms are fake bought and paid for and like i said yes a woman can cum with someone she's not attached to it depends mostly on her own self confidence level of desire and skill of her lover gee just like a man's Orgasm Avenue Q Prostitution Sexual
