what do women do for men i have a curious question for all the women here what have you done in the last week to help a man or what nice thing have you done for a man note not a boyfriend husband or father what have you done for a man who is not serving you in some way strangers notice i didn't say male friend you haven't even done anything for guys who are supposed to be your friends also read what lycraspandex said very good point also read hemiboy good point wrensnest i seriously doubt you are doing all that just to be nice there is more to that story trust me great question a lot of women walk around thinking men owe them something i'll be standing in line and self serving women who are at least somewhat attractive will cut in front of me slyly like i'm supposed to bow down to her because she's a woman sometimes i say something but i normally don't say anything i just let the woman live in her bubble of selfiousness and misandry or i'll be walking down an aisle and women white women especially will just walk and cross my path like i'm not even there like i'm invisible to her i have to stop abruptly to avoid a collision which would then be blamed on me since i'm the man and it's not like she doesn't see me walking she just views me as some nobody that's in her way and that i should stop for her like she's a princess walking down a red carpet women think men that don't even know them are supposed to bend over backwards and treat her like a princess many women in the us and many western countries suffer from a condition known as the princess complex how many women will get mad at me now that i've told the truth zikiru instead of sidestepping the question by reflecting back the same question to him how about addressing the issue secondly saying that you have a job where you have to help people speaks volumes i believe mike t was speaking about women that do favors and help men out of the goodness of their heart like men routinely do for women not because their employer gives them a paycheck random you totally missed the point he didn't say anything about serving men he was referring to doing courteous favors for a man or helping him out when he needs a helping hand this is something men usually do for women do you do anything helpful for men Little Britain Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Humphrey Bogart Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Social rule 2000 Australian Grand Prix Paul Is Dead Mojave people The Inside RuneScape quests EastEnders Fight Club Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Plame affair Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Past teachings of Prem Rawat Sydney Riot of 1879 The Apprentice 2 The Lovely Bones Scouting Reservoir Dogs Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Kodocha Hillary Rodham Clinton Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist The Invisibles Teen Girl Squad The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe The Subtle Knife Knots Landing Spidey Super Stories The Shining (film) Have I Got News For You Volleyball Oral sex Sharon Tate Sin City The Time Machine Milton H.
