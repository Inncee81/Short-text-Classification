which gender really has it hardest when it comes to looking 'the ideal' i mean idealistically it wouldn't even be an issue because people would just be themselves unfortunately that's not how it is you often hear women though talk as if they are the only ones that have it hard they go over all the things they have to do which suck and they're legitimate such as shaving make up skin care hair weight loss etc etc you almost never hear about the things men have to do though while it is true that men more than women can just go out and about without having to look nice the thing is some men want to look nice too it doesn't seem to be generally appreciated how hard some men do have to work like going to the gym eating right dressing nicely and other such things all things considered i think both genders have it fairly bad what do you think also what are some examples i might have missed like for example women who talk about weight loss and how hard it is and 'how easy' it is for men who don't have to worry about it forget that some men like me have to gain weight which is much much harder than losing it they don't seem to appreciate that stuffing yourself all day and working out is much harder than cutting back slightly and going on a twenty minute jog the reason for so many ads targeting women is because they are the majority of shoppers simple as that marketings is all about appealing to the consumers one other thing must be considered the grass is always greener on the other side you have to deal with your own hardships every day so of course that's what comes to mind the strongest it's ever a down hill roll when it comes to competing with people who are born and grow good looking without even trying there is always a competition not necessarily only for looks but that's a huge factor and an attribute that is rarely overlooked it's not easy for men or women i have some good looking friends who can go out and get as many women as they want it's just easier when you have the look i also have friends who don't have it so many times they don't even try because they will be overlooked without a second thought most of the time the door simply swings both ways now going by my observations i'd say that women have a little harder when it comes to looks but they have way more rewards the power of a good looking woman is far greater than that of a good looking guy Social rule Theory of conduct Humphrey Bogart Blonde on Blonde Physical attractiveness Equine conformation Shaggy dog story English grammar Transsexuality Little Britain Cliff Richard Ranma __ characters Goodness and value theory Time Out of Mind Infantilism Philosophical skepticism Volleyball Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Surveillance Kodocha Theodicy Jon Secada Microeconomics Capitalism Prisoner's dilemma Weight training Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Human sexual behavior Economic inequality Gender role ELO rating system Sexual orientation Merit Piccolo Junior Saga Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Infidels Friends Hair The Shining (film) The Contender (television series) The nature of God in Western theology Fast bowling Mojave people Conker's Bad Fur Day Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Baldness Diamond cut Unreal Paradox Anorexia nervosa Spidey Super Stories Cross-dressing Wood Characters in the Smurfs Hiberno-English Deflation (economics) Childbirth Aikido 613 mitzvot Stopping power Moral Politics Bodybuilding Ontological argument Eric Cartman Skateboarding trick Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Androgen insensitivity syndrome Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Beavis and Butt-head Knife Phoebe Buffay's songs Happy Tree Friends Socrates Epistemology Badminton Episodes of Lost (Season 1) W.
