what do feminists think of pornography between two women are they doing it willingly or is there a man forcing them to engage in this activity i think the same of pornography regardless of who is involved i find it degrading to be around so i'm not around it i don't see what's positive about it it makes men and women into bodies separated from their minds and feelings who sell their bodies as commodities it's legal but it doesn't make it a wonderful contribution to society i think some people are forced into pornography some people do it willingly some people have been sexually abused who think that's all they are good for others are exhibitionist's others think it's just a job others are fairly young and naive and are convinced to do it fyi you forgot to ask is a woman forcing them to do it not just a man i think both genders are capable of exploiting men and women Child pornography Pornography Human sexual behavior Gender role Transsexuality Zoophilia Feminism Prostitution Andrea Dworkin Sex Woman Pedophilia Human sexuality Child sexual abuse Child sexuality Sexism Radical feminism North American Man/Boy Love Association Infantilism Prostitution of children Childlove movement Sexual revolution Group sex Sexual orientation Transgender Rape Age of consent History of feminism Fathers' rights Incest Domestic violence Social rule BDSM Bondage (BDSM) The Handmaid's Tale Consensual crime Motion picture rating system Pornographic movie Ephebophilia Pornography in Japan Orgasm Jam (TV series) Biology and sexual orientation Sexual intercourse Gaze Friends Robin Morgan Nudity Gender-neutral language Homophobia Sadism and masochism Christian right Domination & submission (BDSM) Abortion debate Statutory rape Masculism Hentai Civil rights American Civil Liberties Union Joke Homosexuality and transgender Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Drag queen Women in Islam Children of God Spam (electronic) Male prostitute Sexual addiction Reparative therapy Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Commercial sexual exploitation of children Bisexuality Female dominance Germaine Greer Divorce Brian Griffin Orgy Homosexuality Sinfest Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Generation X Heteronormativity Cybersex Religion and sexuality Labor theory of value God and gender Sexual abuse Economic inequality Patriarchy Adolescence Original sin Friendship Marriage Yoko Ono Gender identity Serial killer Trafficking in human beings Paraphilia
