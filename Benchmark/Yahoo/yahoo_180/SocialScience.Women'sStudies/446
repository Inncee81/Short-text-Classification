have i made a fair assessment of this situation i had a situation with this girl at work where i sent her seven unanswered emails over a four month span though there was nothing in the emails threatening sexual or asking for dates they frightened her understandable with my sarcastic tone which doesn't come across well in writing i did the most wrong and have felt nothing but crippling guilt for the past two years for scaring her she did some things wrong herself which i consider understandable when taking into account her fear a fear which i feel was unfounded but still i ended up getting written up by my job and have felt like a hopeless stalker over the past couple years and i am a stalker on some levels but not to an insane degree i don't actually follow this woman it's closer to infactuation but was in danger of rising to full blown stalker but now i am working on avoiding her at work and niether demonizing her nor propping her up as a some goddess i probably should get some help but i don't like that type of thing have i taken a fair assessment of the situation or is waswisgirl right and i am in some type of denial and a terrible stalker i discuss the situation in detail in the following resolved questions below i'd hate to crowd this yahoo answers with my problems but this is my only way to vent http answers yahoo com question index ylt ap foadrw ibuc ft fh vty ix qid aaqs kr tzimmer you say dude youve crossed the line in so many wrong ways and your still crossing the line by asking again i'm well aware i've crossed the line with her before but i'm not quite sure how asking this question is crossing a line either it's better to air this stuff out in some way rather than to just bottle it up if i talk to people i know about this all they do is bash the girl and dismiss her as some freak not productive get a grip and let this go like i say i consider this a healthy venting of sorts any letting go may be nothing more than disguised unhealthy suppression plus it a gym right get another job that one aint that great anyway do you work there plus maybe your setting your sites too high aim a little lower in the looks department not really meaning to be mean but like i said you crossed the line so once i've crossed a certain line that means i have to date women i'm not attracted to brilliant logic listen bob it sucks when you find out the person you like doesn't like you back then when that person reports you as a stalker its gotta be devastating i understand you're hurting my advise move on find someone who likes you back and forget about this girl stay absolutely clear of her for future reference stay away from the women you work with sticky forget about her and get back in the game Theory of conduct Social rule Friends Sin City Avenue Q Infantilism Transactional analysis EastEnders Kodocha A Course In Miracles Scientology beliefs and practices The Apprentice 2 Goodness and value theory Shaggy dog story Ranma __ characters Extreme Programming Futurama (TV series - season 5) Plame affair Days of our Lives Pitaten One Tree Hill (TV series) Sigmund Freud Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Homophobia Milton H.
