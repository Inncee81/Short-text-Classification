what happens when you go for a day spa i have seen shows about spas but always seen peaple laying face down on tables with nothing on but a towel covering thier behinds the question is do they ever go below the towel also what about the front i take it they do not touch you in tht one spot but what do they actualy do also i take it you have the towel covering that area but what about the top a real spa is the place to relax and be comfortable so the choice is yours to undress or not is again your choice u can choose male or female masseuse if they hv only one gender u can suspect the place start and bring a friend along or maybe even your spouse sibling the ads tend to hype to attract customers Sento Sauna Gay bathhouse Massage Domestic violence Striptease Gender role Swinging Social aspects of clothing Scottsdale, Arizona Homosexuality and Christianity Manicure Sumo Survivor (TV series) Advertising Shawn Michaels Corset Nudism Order of succession EastEnders The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Sanitary towel Anal sex Changeroom Leamington Spa Tennis Biology and sexual orientation Bisexuality Sexual orientation Mid-levels Cannabis cultivation Charles Darwin's illness Gender-neutral language Polygamy Same-sex marriage in Canada Professional wrestling match types Gia Carangi Infantilism Menstrual cup The Time Machine Towel Norway national football team Japanese tea ceremony The Usual Suspects Incest Conveyor belt sushi Upholstery Hide (musician) Badminton Funeral Undergarment Gay slang Gender identity Boxing Harem anime Swimming pool Human sexual behavior Munchausen syndrome MTV Manhunt (video game) Druskininkai The Amazing Race Oasis (band) Effeminacy Androgen insensitivity syndrome Naked News Suplex Bath Sexual selection Friends Family 2002 Tour de France Parachuting Bathing 24 Hours of Le Mans Caddy Punt (boat) Kitchen South Park Grammy Award Primogeniture Claude L__vi-Strauss Kakapo The Dalek Invasion of Earth Transgender Japanese toilet The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Jennifer Lopez Contredanse Mercury Cougar Cable television Male prostitute Epsom and Ewell Jeopardy!
