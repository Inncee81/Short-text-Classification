if all feminists leave this category of g and ws would the bashing from some men towards women in here stop while going through my ritual scrolling down of absurd questions i realized that it is getting quiet boring intelligent contributors have left others are coming less and less often so if all feminists left this place would the bashing stop or the people that have fun denigrating others would look for something new to bash curious when a number of the feminists leave the trolls will abuse any newbies who unknowingly answer one of the troll's questions and the trolls will flood the forum with garbage answers and questions but probably a few new feminists will appear will take a beating figure out what's going on and leave after a while too these trolls won't stop bashing women until they go back to junior high high school or college or get a job or they get electric shock and lots of medications or they die Internet troll Newbie B3ta 2channel Eddie Guerrero Spam (electronic) Feminism Bill Maher Slashdot trolling phenomena Jewish humour Changeling Feminist movement Feminists for Life Trolltalk Shaggy dog story Troll Internet phenomenon Gay Nigger Association of America The Shining (film) Trolls (Warcraft) Saved by the Bell EastEnders Kodocha Sin City Slashdot subculture American football World Championship Wrestling Little Britain Domestic violence Blog Ariel (Firefly episode) Slashdot Gary Gygax Characters in the Smurfs One Tree Hill (TV series) Detritus (Discworld) You Don't Know Jack Masturbation Mark Calaway Ethics Hazing A Series of Unfortunate Events Misogyny Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Apprentice 2 Tenshinhan Monty Python's Flying Circus Knots Landing Andrea Dworkin MAD Magazine Rice University Milgram experiment Tic-Tac-Dough John O'Hara Joke Transsexuality Boston Public Netiquette Asterix Census Troll (Discworld) Rabbi Mathematics Gender-neutral language Female genital cutting Civil rights The Great American Bash Feminist theology Susan McClary Priesthood (Mormonism) Haven (TNG episode) Germaine Greer Quizbowl NWo Piccolo Junior Saga Internet Relay Chat Satanic ritual abuse Gender role Randy Savage Simone Weil Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Transgender Deconstruction Dianic Wicca The Apple Double the Fist Fathers' rights Bash At The Beach Social rule Prisoner (TV series) Fifteen to One Characters in Atlas Shrugged Religion and sexuality Ken Jennings Homestar Runner The Dalek Invasion of Earth Matsuo Bash__ Abduction Phenomenon Zhao Yun Queer
