why is the issue of domestic violence so intricately woven with feminism not saying it should or shouldn't be and i get the history but why are dom vio academic studies so closely related to gender studies why not psychology psychiatry sociology law or criminal justice i've always been curious why gender academia seems to focus on this issue more than the other social sciences academic disciplines your thoughts phil i'm sorry to say but i'm losing respect for you by the minute i had seen you as an answerer who could remain level headed and view the facts but this is now the rd answer i have seen you push an agenda disregarding fact many forms of domestic violence were legal throughout history in ancient greece men had absolute power over their wives and children meaning their family was their property and these men were given the power to kill their wives and children if they saw the need for it as punishment for adultery etc english commonlaw stated the rule of thumb men could beat their wives or children as long as the rod was no bigger than the circumfrence of his thumb also in english commonlaw if a woman was raped the restitution was paid to the father or husband not the woman bc women were the property of these men btw most forms of english commonlaw were inherited by america mississippi reasonable physical chastizement of wives and daughters is permissible by law maryland maryland becomes the first state to enact law against wife beating now these are just a few blurbs i have written down from a college level domestic violence course which btw my prof was very much opposed to feminist power and control theory favoring social learning theory and shame theories phil i appreciate your posts most of the time but lately you are becoming extremist in that your ideas are so anti feminism that you cannot even see the positives of it and how it has helped changed a very negative society i know you disagree with how it has evolved but nothing is ever all bad or all good please don't fall party to anti feminist propaganda or feminist propaganda for that matter if you do you become no better than the radicals take care and good luck to you i think part of it is because until the laws were changed as a result of the feminist movement it was completely legal to physically or sexually assault a wife yep beating or raping your wife used to be legal who in the fields of psychology sociology law or criminal justice was advocating for a law to protect married women from abuse my guess is that's why it's linked with feminism Marriage Feminism Same-sex marriage Ethics Polygamy Rape Abortion debate Civil rights Women in Islam Religion and sexuality Sociology Gender role Anarchism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Fathers' rights Sigmund Freud The Handmaid's Tale Social psychology Feminist movement Homosexuality Human sexual behavior Masculism State Bernard Williams Liberalism Anarcho-capitalism Science Theory of conduct Democratic Party (United States) Academia Transsexuality Plame affair Spanking Woman Human sexuality Gender Philosophy of language Deconstruction Gay rights Sharia Infantilism Capital punishment History of sex Economic inequality Law Incest Non-aggression principle Prostitution Family Software engineering Child sexual abuse Psychology History of women in the United States Lynching in the United States Law of the People's Republic of China Homosexuality and Christianity Sexual orientation Abortion in the United States Logic Opposition to cults and new religious movements Homophobia Social sciences Pornography Gender-neutral language Coercion Originalism Political philosophy Property (ownership right) Radical feminism Rabbi Affirmative action Education in the United States Anti-psychiatry Michel Foucault Andrea Dworkin Postmodernism Libertarianism Zoophilia Democracy Corporal punishment Pedophilia Reparative therapy Lawrence v.
