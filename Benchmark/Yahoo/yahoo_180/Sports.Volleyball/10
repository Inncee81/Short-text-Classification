why is the ball going backwards my bump always goes backwards what am i doing wrong hey i knew you would have this question the problem is that your shoulders are not going up when making contact with the ball if you make your shoulders go up like shruging them while keeping your arms straight but not swinging up the ball should go forward to the setter instead of going backward over your head it would also make the platform look more flat some coaches could suggest that by pointing your thumbs down would help getting your shoulders up hope this helps have fun playing volleyball Volleyball Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling throws Swingout Suplex Fast bowling Professional wrestling holds Softball Backstroke Diving DDT (professional wrestling) Horizontal bar Equine conformation Rugby union Glossary of American football Tackle (football) Breaststroke English Country Dance Contredanse Professional wrestling aerial techniques Butterfly stroke Billiards Water polo New York Giants Golf Field hockey Professional wrestling attacks Glossary of partner dance terms Glossary of ballet terms American football Canadian football Mouse (computing) Lindy Basic The Shining (film) Baseball Snooker Lead and follow (dance) Australian rules football Umpire (cricket) Salute Side pass (dance move) Charleston (dance move) Internal ballistics Gary Sheffield Boxing Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Shoulder Jazz dance moves Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Scapula Gesture Time travel Rugby union positions Poker jargon Taikyoku shogi Powerbomb Happy Tree Friends Fielding (cricket) Revolver Sport rowing Front crawl Pushing hands M60 machine gun Humerus Four square Floppy disk Double bass National Football League Lore Neckbreaker Parade (military) Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Tris Speaker Items in the Metroid series Pinball Badminton Punch (strike) Maka dai dai shogi Textile manufacturing Eight ball Jumpstart 3rd Grade Pole vault Dai shogi Knife Rounders Car handling Golf club (equipment) Cincinnati Bengals New York Knicks Peter Shilton Shaggy dog story Perl Tenjiku shogi Scrum (rugby) 1957 World Series Tenshinhan Football Wa shogi Tori shogi Cricket
