i want to quit last year our volleyball team took second place in the pac we had so much fun and we were a great team this year we have a new coach that really doesn't know anything about volleyball she doesn't know how to run a practice she doesn't know how to make people try hard and listen to her she didn't cut anyone from the team even the people who despearatly needed to be cut i am so frustrated and embaressed to be on the team it really is a huge step backward and i don't know what to do some of my old teammates didn't even come out this year and now i wish i hadn't what do i do talk to someone in charge about your concern this doesn't sound like a team that makes many commitments so join another league for some more advanced practice so your skills don't go to waste remember this is not the only team like this athletes all over the world have this same problem a coach and team that can't challenge them if you must quit make sure you have joined another team and don't make a scene about it but if you really love volleyball and want to make an improvement stick it out and when it's all over you'll be glad you were tough enough to get through it you'll make it good luck Volleyball Sport Team Fortress Classic Ty Cobb Crystal Palace F.C.
