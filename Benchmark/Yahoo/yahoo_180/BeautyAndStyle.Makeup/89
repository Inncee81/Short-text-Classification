how to know if my guy friend likes me i met this guy like months ago we work on projects a lot he has a girlfriend he is always doing nice things for me and always wants to know what's new in my life for example he tell s me that he is comfortable with me and that we're close remember we only known each other for months he is an amazing person we're both indian and his gf is white she's much older than he is so we have lots of similarities for instance he always give me nuggies and he told me that when his gf did he said that it was weird he always tells me that im cute and all of that he once noticed that my hair was different which is pretty funny does he like me or what thx looking forward to the responses well i think he likes you you seem to interest him more than his girlfriend he likes to flirt with u and is comfortable with u maybe the more time u guys spend together he'll realise he likes you and break it off with his girlfriend and ask you out that might take a little while though give him little signs that you like him if you do but don't try to break them up or that will get his girlfriend going crazy just let nature take its course best answer Friends Social rule George Costanza Humphrey Bogart EastEnders Avenue Q Okashina Okashi The Ashlee Simpson Show Kodocha Little Britain About a Boy Shaggy dog story The Smoking Room Ocean's Twelve Urusei Yatsura Extreme Programming Phoebe Buffay's songs Theory of conduct Knots Landing It's Walky!
