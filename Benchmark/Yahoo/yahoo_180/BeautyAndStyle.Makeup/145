mineral foundations does anyone use mineral foundations i hear they are better for your skin than normal foundations but was just wondering how they looked i cant help thinking they would look cakey or make your face look all powdery i was thinking of buying these http www hqhair com code products asp pageid sectionid featuredproduct pid but abit expensive so want to know if anyone has tried anything like this and how it was i have worked in the cosmetic industry for years i have worn clinique which i still enjoy lancome etc i have oily skin and it always mid day looked like i was melting i decided to go for bare minerals which i bought at ulta which is a good place to get it since you are able to take it back within days if you dont like the product which is a bonus it lasted all day and my skin felt and looked better within a week i worked at estee lauder for a year and had converted other employees at my counter who now will only wear bareminerals it doesnt look cakey at all make sure that you get all the essentials if you have problem areas to cover up make sure you get the concelear brush and the concelear which is also in a powder form i noticed you can get a full coverage effect if you apply the minerals with a buki brush when your face is a tad moist and it looks wonderful and feels light i would absolutley recommend it get it at ulta or see what the return policy is at sephora and grab it and try it if you decide you dont like it you lose no money goodluck i know you will love it and dont listen to anyone who tells you the minerals come in a liquid or cream if it is made that way from any company then it totally ruins the point of using minerals you cant imagine the products that are used in liquids and cream foundations and think they sit on your skin all day and you know when your makeup begins to look chalky on your face later on in the day it is because your skin is thirsty and it pulls any moisutre it can so the first place it will pull from is the liquid on your face think this stuff soaks into your skin all day everyday if you were it that often and i knowi did make sure you use a good moisturizer to Cosmetics Psoriasis Est__e Lauder Inc.
