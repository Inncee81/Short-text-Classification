i have a slightly broad face and a slightly big nose how should i cover up my flaws the best way to decrease the appearance of a broader face is to do so with your hair if you have extremely short hair consider growing it out to a little bellow the shoulders not only will this add length to your face but it will give you much more to work with after make sure you ask your hairdresser for some layers that begin just bellow the jawline this will bring the attention from the width of your face and down to your neck next part your hair to the side avoid middle parts as this will exaggerate the width of your face and create an unflattering look also avoid hash blunt bangs if you have any this will also highlight your unwanted features as for your slightly bigger nose detract attention away from it by highlighting features taht you do like such as your eyes or your lips just make sure that you get rid of any blemishes and redness from your nose with a light foundation first then apply some flattering eye contrasting shadows to your eyes and a pale pink lipgloss to your lips for an ultra modern and chic look avoid contouring your nose with different shades of foundation and concealer this will never look natural in real life and is only meant to be used under bright lights such as in photo shoots and runway by the way i am sure that your face and nose is as broad as you think it is and if you try too hard to hide this you may just end up bringing more attention to it so my overall advice to you is to simply embrace your flaws and work with them rather than against it Cosmetics Humerus Skateboarding trick Griffon Bruxellois Drawing Scapula Equine conformation Pachypodium brevicaule Hair Diving Professional wrestling throws Dragon Booster Violin Haircut Extreme Programming Head Leaf Bass guitar Stairway Alaga__sia Stereoscopy Sesshomaru Physical characteristics of the Buddha Cat coat genetics Parallax Backstroke Meriones unguiculatus Autostereogram Eye Mattress Digital photography Sub-Zero Cat Color Cephalic disorder Trumpet Butterfly stroke Salute Vowel Aerial (dance move) Double bass Ulna View camera Solar eclipse Snowboard Light-emitting diode Cheetah Movie projector Thief (computer game) Classical music era Mobile Suit Gundam Wing Puberty Depilation Wood Sexual attraction Osamu Tezuka's Star System Color theory Diamond enhancement Welding Baldness President (game) Extraterrestrial skies Cinematography Goofy Gesture Beard Concepts in the Wheel of Time series Covenant Elite Skinhead Drill bit Order of the Garter Chair Archery Chris Benoit Mooney M20 Sin City Finnish Spitz Evidence of evolution Cobra Commander Tag Radius (bone) Psoriasis Atari 8-bit family Dog Diamond Parade (military) Fast bowling Hair color Henri Murger Pachypodium bicolor Tarantula Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Canoe Oakland Athletics Sunglasses Anime
