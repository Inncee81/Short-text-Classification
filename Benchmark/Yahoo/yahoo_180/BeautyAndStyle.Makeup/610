is there a way to sterilize your makeup without ruining it i buy mac makeup eyeshadows but i never use all of my shades up and i dont want to throw it away whats a safe way to sterilize makeup without ruining it im not too worried about the foundation and mascaras and eyeliners those get used up in time but not the shadows help actually there is a way to steralise them contrary to what other people are saying i totally know what you're going through i have over shadows and there's no way that i can use them all in a short period of time just take some rubbing alcohol and put a few drops or a cap full into the shadow it'll sterilize the shadow and will absorb and evaporate leaving your eyeshadow nice and clean and unharmed even though you say that your other products get used up in time it's extreamly important that you do clean them especially the products you use in your eyes eyeliners you can just dip into some alcohol and then sharpen them a little make sure you clean your sharpener on a regular basis mascaras are really important to clean as air and bacteria can get trapped in the tube not cleaning your mascara can also result in those horrible clumps clumps are just old mascara that have dried in the tube wand just take the wand out and clean it out with some mild soap and warm water put back into the tube and in a circular motion move around in the tube take out again and clean repeat this two or three times this will take out all the old nasty mascara and bacteria Cosmetics Tattoo Mascara Brewery Menstrual cup Dialysis Mattress Sterilization (microbiology) Body piercing Ultraviolet Textile manufacturing Manicure Intravenous therapy Link (Legend of Zelda) Disinfection Dry cleaning Eye contact Hand washing Vinegar Wine making Water Futurama (TV series - season 5) Wound Pneumonia Carnivorous plant Earring Survival skills Aerial (dance move) Otitis externa Diseases of the honeybee Sento Bong Carbon dioxide Ethanol Car washing techniques First aid Baby bottle Knife Swimming Alcoholic beverage Bacteria Casting Seismic retrofit Diving suit Carburetor Dairy Shoe polish Hygiene Dungeons & Dragons: Shadow over Mystara Coffee Tire Floater Yoghurt Acetic acid Social rule Tenshinhan Enema Gram staining Upholstery Battles of Lexington and Concord Singlish Philip J.
