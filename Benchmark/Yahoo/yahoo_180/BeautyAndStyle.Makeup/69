how do i apply make up i only have an eyeliner mac black and a white shimmery eyeshadow what can i do with that how do i put it on okay take your pinky or ring finger whatever u feel comfy with on ur dominant hand if u want more dramatic put a lot of eyeshadow on by moving ur pinky in little circles for a classic look just put the shadow on from the crease of ur eyelid to the lashes for more drama move from the inner corner of the eye out up to the brow bone for the liner hold it in ur dominant hand duh take the outer corner of your eye and pull it gently this help to create a straighter line across which makes it easier to put on start from the inner corner and do soft strokes to the outer corner look at your lash line you may have to put liner in between ur lashes is u can see ur skin really obviously again the more drama you want the fatter the liner line you can put liner under your eyes too only line the outer you may have to put liner on the little pink squishy part that touches ur eye but it doesn't hurt or anything like that note i don't know what kind of liner you have but if it's not liquid you need to get some face powder if you don't apply the powder your liner will smuge and it'll be bad just put a little from the crease to the eyebrow it absorbs the oil so the liner doesn't smudge however if you but shoadow up to ur browbone you don't need the face powder you also have to put it under ur eyes if u put liner on ur lower lash line just sweep the liner on the puffy ish part under ur eye to the lash line hope i helped Cosmetics Professional wrestling throws Aerial (dance move) Eye Professional wrestling holds Knife Physical characteristics of the Buddha Gesture Social rule The Contender (television series) Double bass Three Stooges Laws of cricket Violin Archery Fecal incontinence Equine conformation Massage Four square Fast bowling The Legend of Zelda series enemies Nine Inch Nails Fetal development Internal ballistics Eczema YuYu Hakusho Plastic Three card monte Swingout Chopsticks Breastfeeding Harp Motorcycle helmet Pok__mon Abilities Professional wrestling match types My Little Pony Professional wrestling slang Snooker Baroque chess Drill bit Skateboarding trick Salute Backstroke Naruto jutsu Eyelid Indian Oil Cup 2005 Dragon Booster Puppet Softball Tattoo Powerbomb Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Contredanse Glossary of nautical terms Fischer Random Chess Professional wrestling attacks Doom enemies Condom Hockey rink Rope Volleyball Clarinet Lionel Corporation Cricket Face Tenshinhan Wood carving Tocopherol Fire extinguisher Handloading Strap-on dildo Pinky and the Brain EastEnders Canoe Drawing Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 M16 (rifle) Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Poker jargon Prostate cancer Conspiracy (TNG episode) Little Britain Invader Zim Noonan syndrome Breaststroke Chocolate Skin Physical attractiveness Hand grenade Theory of conduct Eye contact Blepharitis Ravi Shastri Johnny Cash Fluorescent lamp Pastel Boxing Milton H.
