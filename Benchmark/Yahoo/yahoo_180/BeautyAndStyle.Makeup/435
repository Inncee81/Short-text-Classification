any suggestions on how to put eye makeup so it looks nice i want to learn the best way to put eye makeup sometimes it ends up looking a little wrong and unnatural when i put eyeshadow and mascara i prefer to go with dark colours it depends on your skin color and eye color stick with either dark brown or black eyeliner no weird colors don't use too much just lightly outline the fringe of your lower eyelashes it also helps to end this line at the midway point of your eyes and you can even draw it back to the corner of your eye a bit eyeliner can pull your look together with mascara dark brown or black once again and only one coat from the corners of the lashes out don't do really weird or unnatural colors stick with more earthy tones and neutral sheer colors if you are really pale use lighter colors and don't use blue it will wash your face out if it still looks funny cut down on it maybe skip eyeshadow if it looks odd hope that helps k Cosmetics Snooker Cat coat genetics Archery Dragon Booster Physical attractiveness Mascara Drawing Empire Burlesque Colours, standards and guidons Tattoo Human skin color Color theory Double bass Hair color Textile manufacturing Billiards Eye Iris (anatomy) G-Man (Half-Life) Wassily Kandinsky Horse Eye contact Fischer Random Chess Sunglasses Cheetah Milton H.
