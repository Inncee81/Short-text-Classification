is there a way to curl your eyelashes without an eyelash curler just wondering you can take a spoon and heat it up with a hairdryer or by running it under hot water if you do that make sure to dry it off before you curl your eyelashes and then hold it so that your lashes are against the indent of the spoon in other words the part that holds liquid when you're eating with a spoon should be facing your face hold it like that for a while and ta da if you don't feel like doing that after you put on your mascara you can take your finger or a spoon that you didn't heat up and just hold your lashes until the mascara dries and hold them so you're lifting them towards your eyebrow then when the mascara dries they'll be curled i'm speaking about the top lashes the bottom lashes don't really need to be curled Mascara Salad Fingers Cosmetics Physical characteristics of the Buddha Spoon Curling Knitting Gesture Bong Chopsticks Idli Soup Brewery Hair Campfire Russian cuisine Blepharitis Tea Professional wrestling match types Professional wrestling throws Randy Ferbey Homer Simpson Powerbomb Joke D'Alembert's paradox Fork Textile manufacturing Aerial (dance move) Hot air balloon Coffee Engine cooling Ben Johnson (athlete) Knife The Amber Spyglass Casting 2005 Ford World Men's Curling Championship Bacon Wok The Marshall Mathers LP Tofu 613 mitzvot Bread Sea-Monkey Air conditioning MRE Mattress Bactrian Camel In Living Color Casualty lifting Motor oil Hiccup 2005 Scott Tournament of Hearts Mummy Cuisine of Brazil Table setting Geography of Africa Diving suit Baldness Korean cuisine Surfing Fire extinguisher Top-bar hive Quinoa Pea soup The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Radiator Printmaking Billboard Hot 100 Cuisine of Thailand Sulfuric acid Punt (boat) Marilyn Monroe Peach Fecal incontinence Microwave oven Drill bit Instant coffee Steam engine Heat Hay The Vile Village Sauna Diana Ross Potassium Card game Upholstery Russian joke Lake District Paul Is Dead Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala(Annoyed Grunt)cious 2005 Tim Hortons Brier Gilding Equine conformation Fetal development Tattoo Spark plug Sento
