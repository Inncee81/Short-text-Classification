thinking about liquid eyeliner how do you use this stuff i've been using pencil liner for years and i'd like to achieve a more dramatic look how do i apply liquid eye liner w o getting it all over the place also i use a coco pencil liner blue eyed light brown hair should the liquid liner i buy be the same thanks it's tricky at first but just like everything else practice makes perfect i suggest that you still use your pencil eye liner as the base so that way when you apply the liquid eyeliner you already have a line to trace quick tip stretch out your eyelids ever so slightly if you made a mistake then use some q tips with makeup remover to erase your errors and if you're just not good at the liquid thing then get a blow dryer and use the low heat setting to slightly melt the tip of your pencil eye liner this way your eyeliner looks more liquidy and dramatic Gas metal arc welding Overclocking Pencil Glass Cat coat genetics Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Textile manufacturing Pottery Knife Explosive material Typewriter Dragon Booster Repouss__ and chasing Casting Violin Cat Dog Steel Diamond simulant Eye Rocket fuel Sewage treatment Craps Volleyball Teller-Ulam design Welding Carbon dioxide Water (molecule) Empire Burlesque Cheetah Engine cooling Modem Solar cell Spark plug Eraser Iron Telescope Printed circuit board Magnesium Ontological argument Fire extinguisher Transformer Fiberglass Coffee Upholstery Stereoscopy Ammonia Fountain pen Vacuum Silly Putty Barbie Spatial disorientation Electrophysiology Dry cleaning Plastic Debugging Internal ballistics Shit Paintball Eyelid Snowball Earth Drill bit Rayleigh scattering Lead 1957 World Series Money supply Baby bottle Blood on the Tracks Jet engine Gilding Ballpoint pen Shaving Double bass Liquid crystal Normal distribution Inflation Bong Fan (implement) Molotov cocktail SS Andrea Doria Shroud of Turin Rei Ayanami Sand casting Death rock fashion Phase (matter) Dialysis Fluorescent lamp Intravenous therapy Cubic zirconia Gallium Hamster Laurel and Hardy Haloalkane Snooker Hydrogen Operational amplifier
