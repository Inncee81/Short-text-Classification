whats your secret to for anyone who did well in their sat's a levels or leaving cert can you please tell me the secret to your exam sucess i made a on my sat's with only one attempt fortunately i'm blessed with excellent test taking skills so that was a large portion of it my advice for sat's would be this which area is your strong point mine was math so i didn't worry so much about the math part sure i reviewed and studied the main points and some formulas but the math was easy to me i had to work at the vocabulary part get a study guide and pore over the questions frequently don't cram to much into one time period or it will all be a jumble but those study guides contain a lot of the vocabulary words you will come across in the test pay attention the the root part of the word or to the prefix and suffixes as they will often offer a hint to the answer thankfully the test is multiple choice in the math part it's usually pretty easy to rule out one or two answers right away just because they don't make any sense really just buy a study guide and don't wait until the week before the test to start giving it serious effort just half an hour an evening over the course of a month will do wonders for you and for all tests make sure you have plenty of rest eat a good healthy breakfast take your time so that you don't make careless mistakes if you start to feel overwhelmed put down your pencil close your eyes and massage your temples to relax for a couple minutes if you have any time left over at the end of a section go back and check your answers or go back to the ones that gave you particular trouble and give them another go the good thing about the sat's is that you can take them again and again and it's always your highest score that counts good luck SAT Social rule Education in Romania Mathematics Time Out of Mind 2000 Australian Grand Prix Junior Certificate The Princeton Review Singlish Quizbowl Prostate cancer Breastfeeding Craps English grammar Piccolo Junior Saga American and British English differences Pitaten Stomach cancer Second language acquisition Swami Vivekananda Ravi Shastri Blood on the Tracks Have I Got News For You Theory of conduct Crossword Jumpstart 3rd Grade Dyslexia Game show Richard Feynman Hiberno-English Jeopardy!
