starting highschool im starting high school this month wow any tips for making friends managing time just tell me something you wish you would have known going into high school here is what people would say starting high school just calm down because a peer leader will help you no matter what they will help you on the st and nd time then the third time the peer leader will watch you whether you are confident to go which classes to go to go through high school with all of your friends if you are going to get lost get lost together also if you do get lost in the first weeks the teachers give you a break i am not in high school yet one more year but these are just some tips that i have heard also just enjoy high school because based on what i have heard its some of the best years of you life good luck you should receive your new schedule in the mail shortly before classes start usually the schools are open a few days before class so teachers and administrators can prepare for the new year you can take this time to find out where your classes are how to and how long it takes to get from one to the next walk slowly it'll be crowded when school starts etc you will have to check in with the office before you are allowed to do this you might want to call the school first to make an appointment and verify when they will be open after about two weeks you'll know the school inside and out don't freak out it high school does seem huge at first but after awhile it will seem just like middle school a good way not to get lost the first few weeks is carry a map of the school with you that has all your classrooms marked but trust me after a few weeks you wont ever need the map again if you have any friends going to the same high school hang with them until you develop new friends in your classes but don't forget there are other freshman like you so finding friends will be really easy so just stay calm it may seem overwhelming but a few weeks later it will just seem like middle school just with a little more work and a larger building good luck walking around the school with your friends is a great idea you can look around and figure out where all your classes are so that way on the first day you know where you need to be and when high school just takes a little bit of adjusting get to know your teachers too by learning what kind of person they are you will figure out how you need to behave in their class let's say your literature teacher is very outgoing when you write papers for her keep them fun and interesting however if you have a strict chemistry or science teacher make sure you're always on time and keep your work neat and precise eventually your teachers will get used to you too everyone is different so give everyone a chance and you'll do fine just relax high school seems intimidating at first but trust me its like middle school the works just a little harder but not by much trust me i'm a junior i know if you know even one or two sophomores who can make a few introductions for you that would definitely help otherwise remember that you're in the same boat with everyone else tips on how to get thru it don't try to act all cool to upperclassmen don't brag about everything don't dress showing off body parts its not cool yes all the other upperclassmen will b mean to you and they will kill you a freshmen and don't try to make the name freshman into something cool like freshmen cuz your just a freshmen ok i was a fresh men last year and your gonna get stomped on walk thought the high school with some of your friends or by yourself and make mental pictures of where things are located in the building stick with your friends my friends helped me get through my first year of high school on the first day i felt so lost and all the hallways looked the same as well as the lockers so i stuck with my friend and we've been inseparable ever since don't be scared all of the incoming freshmen are new so you're not alone life gets a little more hectic by means of competitiveness and such but you also become a little bit more independent you'll make new friends and still have your old ones so it'll all outweigh those other things after the first few days you'll be used to the school some people even prefer high school rather than middle school you'll do fine good luck Social rule The Citadel (Military College) Columbine High School massacre Shaggy dog story Education in Germany Education in Romania Education in the United States Pitaten Lynbrook High School The Contender (television series) Milton H.
