can you be valedictorian if you transferred schools my friend who transferred to my school during freshman year after st semester is unsure whether he can be valedictorian he has the highest gpa in the class but he transferred from a different school after first semester will he be disqualified due to his late arrival on a side note if he isn't disqualified how late do you have to arrive at a school semesters years before you can't be given the valedictorian postion regardless of gpa from my experience selection of a valedictorian varies from school to school your district may have policies in place for valedictorian selection or it may be up to the guidance office to identify the student with the top gpa if i understand your question correctly your friend started attending the school during the freshman year that means he has been attending the school for years i can't imagine that being a problem i would think that a stipulation requiring valedictorians to go to school all four years at that school would be very rare indeed i could see it being a problem if someone transfered in during their senior year of course you need to ask the principal to be sure don't stress about it just find out from the source most teachers and principals would appreciate a student being interested in making good grades Education in the United States Grade (education) Education in Germany Graduate school Lynbrook High School Dr. Michael M.
