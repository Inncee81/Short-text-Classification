have you had any experience with a smart board in school if so what is your opinion on it our school uses smart boards throughout the building and any helpful feedback i could get would be appreciated i had a smartboard in my classroom and hope to have it again this year i am moving into a different room and it is supposed to come with me but you know how that can be it is integrated into all my lesson plans having an interactive board that everyone can use and see is fantastic it does take some time to create lessons on the computer to use the smartboard but then they are there to use over and over again in my opinion every classroom should have an interactive white board regardless of the brand name although the literature says that you can use it as a normal white board be careful if you don't erase the dry erase marker off at the end of the day it can be difficult to get off and could leave ghosting requiring additional cleaning i also find that keeping the projector set up can be a problem with wires all over the place which increases the chance that the projector computer could be pulled off the table if someone trips on the wires we are supposed to be getting the projectors installed in the ceiling to avoid the wires being strewn everywhere Interactive whiteboard Surveillance Raffles Institution Digital circuit Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Loudspeaker Social rule PLATO Alexander Technique Typewriter TGV Trip distribution Out-of-body experience Teach the Controversy Poker jargon Film Requirements analysis Whiteboard The Giver Wire wrap Drill bit IMAX Hopkins School Prostate cancer Integrated circuit IPod Backgammon Emerson College Hamster Betting (poker) Debugging Classroom Expanded Universe (Star Wars) Modem Electrical wiring Computer and video game genres Hash table Knife Route assignment Spark plug Alternating current Teacher Massachusetts Institute of Technology Linked list Normal distribution Projection screen Sound recording Computer virus Mouse (computing) Robot Lesson StarCraft Secret Missions Software testing Bluetooth Audiophile Extreme Programming Francis Crick Kasparov versus The World Magic: The Gathering Motion capture Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Windows Vista Circuit design Education in the United States Fischer Random Chess Drawing Geodesic dome Central processing unit Go (board game) Database management system Urinary incontinence Japanese tea ceremony PID controller Light gun SS Morro Castle Bristol Grammar School Gas metal arc welding Franklin W.
