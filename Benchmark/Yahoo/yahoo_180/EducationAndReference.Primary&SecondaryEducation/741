which is better public high school or private high school just want to know lol it really depends on you check out some websites of private schools they are usually very college focused and foster a sense of community between students also since they have a huge income from their students they arn't financially starved like some highschools so they will probably have newer technology and smaller class sizes public high schools tend to be more relaxed with more focus on each class then each individual student you will have to do the work yourself because nobody is going to force you to do it it really comes down to a personal choice and also if you are willing to spend a few thousand dollars a year to go to school if the public schools in your area are really sketchy and gross consider a private but if they appear to be lively and have a sense of community there might not be the need to spend all that money Gross domestic product Education in the United States Progressive tax Economy of the United States Graduate school Secondary education in France Homeschooling High school College Education in Germany Education in Australia Education in Romania Public education No Child Left Behind Act Independent school (UK) GED Inflation School choice Capitalism Education in Hong Kong Education in Portugal Secondary education Education in Taiwan Economic inequality Flat tax Tax Microeconomics Education in Japan Scholarship Babson College Students' union Community college Aikido College and university rankings Student Publicly funded medicine Capital accumulation Student loan French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Education in France Rice University Franklin W.
