how do i act tougher i am going into high school in just a few weeks and i would like to be tougher and not like middle school this school is strict and everything and i will pay attention to my school work and stuff but i want people to know that they should mess with me there are two answers to this question depending upon your background first if you have been bullied and a victim then you definitely need to act tougher otherwise you're in for a long four years my suggestion to you would be to join a martial arts program now this is not so you can beat people up etc but it does give you the self confidence that you need believe it or not the knowledge that you can take care of yourself is often all you need people will sense that and pretty much leave you alone but be sure you go into it for the right reasons not to become a bully yourself if you just wish to be more grown up so people don't treat you like a little kid and they are just nicer there is already a lot of good advice up here be kind and considerate to others offer to help them when they need it pay attention and be respectful to your teachers even if you don't like them in other words set a good example for others Boston Public Theory of conduct Education in the United States Martial art Social rule Philosophical skepticism Copyleft Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Plame affair Kodocha Humphrey Bogart Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Graduate school Pitaten Contract Secondary education in the United States No Child Left Behind Act Logic The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Bully Culture of Lithuania Expert system Summa Theologiae Poker jargon Merit Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Code: Lyoko Current teachings of Prem Rawat Vegeta Laura Schlessinger Hikikomori Consensual crime Natural deduction Education Time Out of Mind Education in Romania The Ashlee Simpson Show Aikido Alignment (role-playing games) Presuppositional apologetics Past teachings of Prem Rawat Education in Germany Saved by the Bell Epistemology Rich Mullins Emperor Yuan of Han 2004 Democratic National Convention Philosophy of language Profession American Psycho Emperor Xuan of Han Rape GED Martial Quizbowl Sampling (music) Socrates Microeconomics Theodicy Supply and demand Jiddu Krishnamurti Calvin and Hobbes Swami Vivekananda Section 28 Coercion Homeschooling Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Chinese martial arts Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Great Teacher Onizuka Education in the People's Republic of China 2003 Invasion of Iraq Secondary education in Japan Objectivist philosophy Goodness and value theory Royal Assent The Fairly OddParents Transactional analysis Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Offer and acceptance The nature of God in Western theology Extreme Programming Reiki The Adventures of Pete & Pete Abortion in the United States Little Britain Irish syntax Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Governor-General of Australia Newbie Creationism Danish Folkeskole Education Academia Cultural relativism School violence Sharia Abortion debate God Emperor of Dune Independent school (UK)
