what is your opinion on combining classes in a private school the classes are very small and they have combined the th and th grades at my daughters school i love the school and what it stands for but i don't care for combined classes i am afraid i will have to move her next year it is could be a matter of money two teachers are cheaper than one sometimes it is a matter of shortage of rooms at other times which is the most likely according to the way that your question is worded the groups in the th and th grade are just too small to be viable i agree that combined classes are generally not good i would make an exception if there was an extraordinary teacher who would not have difficulty in handling and even taking advantage of that situation if you have not already done so ask your daughter what differences if any there are before and after class combination you can also visit the school and observe the class by yourself other parents may feel the same way as you do meet with the principal headmaster and explain your disappointment and the fact that you and others may not have a choice she may at this point promise to maintain the separate classes by grade in the meantime be prepared visit other schools find out their costs and see if you and your daughter would be happy there Graduate school Japanese tea ceremony Microeconomics Education in Germany Education in the People's Republic of China Education in the United States Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban No Child Left Behind Act Pitaten Theory of conduct Secondary education in France French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Education in Romania Abortion debate Independent school (UK) Philosophical skepticism GED Pledge of Allegiance Education in Australia Paradox The Catcher in the Rye Contract Primary education Prostate cancer SAT Education Grade (education) Consensus decision-making Current teachings of Prem Rawat Alexander Technique Education in Hong Kong Appeal Everwood Economics Separation of church and state in the United States Fathers' rights Code: Lyoko Economic inequality Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Polyamory Great Teacher Onizuka Boston Public Acts of the Apostles Sant Thakar Singh High school Tripartite System Sydney Riot of 1879 Public-key cryptography Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Kodocha Education in Japan Surreal number Hogwarts Species Secondary education in Japan Scouting Infantilism Coming of Age (TNG episode) Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Moral Politics Education in Portugal Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Education in Malaysia Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Socrates Expert system Ghostwriter (television series) Creationism School choice The Amber Spyglass Law of value The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe IB Diploma Programme Health insurance Monarchy in Canada Publicly funded medicine Homeschooling Galactic Civilizations Separation of church and state Brown v.
