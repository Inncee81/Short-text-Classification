any advise for highschool i am very excited to go to hs but yet very nervous any tips i heard it can either be the best years or the worst years my advice make the most of it join groups that sound interesting get involved in volunteer projects and service hours sample new experiences and meet new people try hard to go on at least one school sponsored trip abroad try to get out of your comfort zone a bit hanging out with the same groups and the same clubs is ok but try new stuff also good or bad remember that it only lasts years it is a real part of your life but it is a terrible predictor of the rest of your life a lot of 'a' students go on to mediocre lives and a lot of nerds and 'losers' go on to great success a lot of the 'cool folk' are peaking now and will only go downhill and a lot of the unpopular kids will blossom later it is never too early to start thinking about the next part of your life if you plan on college what classes can you take now to help out start keeping an eye out for what majors might interest you wear sunscreen Saved by the Bell Education in Romania Social rule The Ashlee Simpson Show Norway national football team W.
