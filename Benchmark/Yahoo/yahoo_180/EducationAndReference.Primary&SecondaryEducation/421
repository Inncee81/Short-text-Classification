is there anything i should know i about high school i'm starting high school on tuesday and i was just wondering if there's anything i should know there will be cliques there will be crappy teachers and not so great people but you just have to roll with the punches manage your time well so you don't get behind on work but be sure to have fun stick with people you know but don't be afraid to branch out join a couple of clubs or try out some sports try not to get caught up in the petty drama you most likely will be involved in some no one gets out of high school without it but it will also show you who your real friends are in the process also homecoming is one of the funnest parts of the year whether you're popular or not if your school is like mine and makes class floats for the homecoming parade get involved in that so much fun when it comes to teachers don't be a total kiss ass but also don't be someone they're always yelling at some teachers just don't like certain kids for no reason but you can't let it effect you but then there are teachers who you will click with and can be a great help beyond the year that you have them don't let whatever negative answers you may get bother you all in all there will be some tough times but there will be some great times four years goes by fast so make the best of it if you're lucky you'll make some really great friends along the way who will be there past high school good luck The Adventures of Pete & Pete Recurring South Park characters Yearbook The Amazing Race Saved by the Bell Social rule Azumanga Daioh Homecoming (tradition) Tai Chi Chuan Columbine High School massacre Homecoming (song) Marching band Joke Saturday Night Live Lynbrook High School Rod Stewart Kyle Broflovski Sid Vicious Ferris Bueller's Day Off The Ashlee Simpson Show Piccolo Junior Saga Paul Levesque Football Married... with Children Roddy Piper The Marshall Mathers LP One Tree Hill (TV series) Recess (TV series) Game show Care Bears The Karate Kid, Part III The Fairly OddParents Viva La Bam Diving Baylor University Shawn Michaels Boston Public Kodocha Avenue Q Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Dawson's Creek Ja Rule Tournament of Roses Parade The Beach Boys Sky High (2005 film) Milton H.
