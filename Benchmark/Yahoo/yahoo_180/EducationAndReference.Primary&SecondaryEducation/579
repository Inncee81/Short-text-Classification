when should a child learn about the declaration of independence in school which grade i was wondering because my soon to be rd grader had never heard of it and i thought she should have by now in school i guess i would have expected that by now they would have had a general overview of it and then of course in later grades delve more deeply into the subject would anyone mind asking their rd and th graders if they know what it is and how they found out i found out because i saw the movie national treasure and thought my daughter would enjoy it because although it's fictional it's still interesting once i explained what it was she was really interested in learning more about it and of course watching the movie i know that my son got at least an idea of what the doi was last year in nd grade i know because i had to make a business trip to dc in the fall near the beginning of the school year and all he wanted me to bring him was a copy of the constitution and a copy of the declaration he brought them for show and tell upon my return quite the hit with the under crowd Graduate school Education in the United States Avenue Q Frank Herbert About a Boy One Tree Hill (TV series) Development of Darwin's theory GED E.L.E.C.T.I.O.N.S.
