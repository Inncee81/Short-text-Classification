my crazy cousin frm india is tryin to read shake speare in nith grade i don't get her she thinks harry potter is hard so she starts readin macbeth she is wierd her teacher told her to try to challenge herself she misunderstood and is tryin to read shakespeare she thinks readin off her level will make hera betta reada her english is ok not the greatest she thought macbeth was easy she did rread it times ova though but only got the basic story i am tryin to tell her that shakespeare is not for her unless there is a teacha there explainin it to her its a basic waste of her time she is very stubborn though even though she is from india and she went to the nd best school in the entire state there she doesn't seem all dat bright her math skills are starange she knows trigno etry but not algebra one my other cousin from india knew algebra one from th grade this school she went required a good score she is very stubborn and loves to argue she thinks damn harry potter is tough and shakespeare is easy she didn't even know macbeth w play i have studied in india for ten years and i know about how they train kids in most of the schools they give a huge preference to english and most schools teach algebra from sixth grade when i came to us i never had a problem with english because of the good educational foundation i got in india in ur cousins case it seens like she is one of those students who might have studied in a good school but might not have put much effort into studying math thats probably why she has touble with math not everyone can get the ability to understand math easily it may require some time and as for reading shakesphere in ninth grade i dont think there is anything wrong with reading it she might not understand it completely but understanding the basics of the story is good enough at her age and she should be encouraged to read more and dont discourage her inclination to read more just because she didnt understand harry potter books even though hp books are written in quite simple language rowling uses a lot of her own vocabulary and also if she was starting to read the story frm the first edition it takes a while to get a grasp of the story for a some people its mostly becasues the first few chapters of the books were a little too descriptive i am a big fan of hp and i love rowlings way of writing but i know some people needs a while to get a grasp of it in my opinion you should make her watch one of those hp movies first and then let her read the book it will help out a lot Education in Romania Mathematics Hogwarts subjects Education in the United States A-level Graduate school Extreme Programming Grade (education) Literacy Education SAT Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Theory of conduct Kodocha Education in the People's Republic of China Milton H.
