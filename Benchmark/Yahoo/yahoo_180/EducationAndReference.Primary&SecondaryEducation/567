how to battle high school on movies they show that high school is so much fun but i don't know if that's true in a couple of weeks school's gonna start and i've been really stressing about it i don't want to be the freaky genius girl again where everyone makes fun of i just wanna be normal and have friends to hang out with i just keep on thinking that high school is gonna be a drag my stepbrother makes high school so much fun he's the most popular guy there and everyone wants to be his friend i was somewhat popular in junior high but that's way different from high school any tips on how to conquer my fears of high school i don't even think i'm ready what is wrong with being the freaky genius girl being smart and being able to pick any career you want is a luxury that most people can only dream of if you are the freaky genius revel in it one of the things about high school is that you will loose some friends it just happens the friendships you develop will become more close and mean more than they did in elementary or junior high but they will be amongst a smaller circle of friends high schools have a larger population so you will have more people who are like you and like the same kinds of things you do this make high school more fun because you don't have to feel like you are trying to be like everyone else you get to be yourself and there are more people like you that you can hang out with if you do not try to be popular you will have a lot more fun trying to be popular only makes you stress about what others think about you if you are just yourself you will be popular among your group of friends also the more you can get involved in things like sports drama music honor society and other clubs the more fun it is that is an easy way to meet people who have common interests with you so don't worry about popularity high school is fun if you let it be fun be ready to make new friends and get involved in activities but above all be yourself have fun and don't worry The Emancipation of Mimi One Tree Hill (TV series) Social rule Jon Secada The Ashlee Simpson Show The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Friends Undergrads Azumanga Daioh AFI 100 Years series Kim Possible Saved by the Bell Avenue Q Green Day Tina Turner Can't Hardly Wait The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Milton H.
