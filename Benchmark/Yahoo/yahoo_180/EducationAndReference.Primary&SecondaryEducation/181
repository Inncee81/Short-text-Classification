i am going for my rn and am having trouble memorizing all the bones for my anatomy and phy class help i learned how to memorize several years ago and i hope the technique i was taught will help you memorizing is not easy but over time with practice it gets easier this summer i have been memorizing anatomy in anticipation of medical school i have memorized the bones muscles and nervous system so far using the technique repetition is the key to memorizing but you have to do it right you have long and short term memories the trick is to get the stuff you memorize into long term memory i use flash cards to help me memorize the best way to memorize bones and muscles is in sets first visualize the system in your mind mentally place the bones muscles or whatever in relation to others bones etc you now repeat vocally the bones in the system six times you can look at the names at this point on the back of the card after the sixth time you cannot look at the names repeat the names of the bones an additional six times you have just placed the names etc into short term memory move onto another card doing the same thing after a few cards go back and repeat the first card spend a set amount of time memorizing after you finish with the allotted time move on do something else wait several hours or even until the next day repeat over the course of several days spacing the memorizing out over longer periods you will reach a point where the information has been placed into long term memory basically permanently good luck Alexander Technique Mnemonic Weight training Memory Brain Stuttering Anatomy Contract bridge Marching band Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Urinary incontinence Password Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Carpal tunnel syndrome Traumatic incident reduction Magic (illusion) Massage Action potential Cognitive science Aikido Martial art Bubble Bobble Stereoscopy Decompression sickness Poker jargon Dog training Swimming Medicine Renormalization group Chiropractic Magic (gaming) One-time pad Glossary of climbing terms Mnemonic major system Ethernet Ultimate Muscle New York Giants Eskrima Clinical depression Textile manufacturing Local anesthesia Computer Modem Menstrual cup Blackjack Puberty Visual Basic Professional wrestling holds Human anatomy Finesse Knife CPU design Paget's disease of bone Clavicle Human brain Neopets Expert system Chinese martial arts Autostereogram Fencing Debugging Growth hormone deficiency Naruto jutsu Cangjie method Anatomical terms of location James Paget IBM PC compatible Tai Chi Chuan Human physiology Rush (band) Time Out of Mind Education in the People's Republic of China Education in the United States Floppy disk Central processing unit Hearing impairment CPU cache Equine conformation Advertising Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Capoeira Nurse Sonata form Bone Radar Python programming language Flash memory Traumatic brain injury Arm Compiler optimization Occipital bone New Age Breastfeeding Mahjong Proprioception Shen Gong Wu
