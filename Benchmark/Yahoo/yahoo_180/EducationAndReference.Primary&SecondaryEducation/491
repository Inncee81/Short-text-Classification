how do you save time on school mornings to save time in the morning on those hectic school days i typically take my showers at night and lay out the clothes and shoes that i'm going to wear the next day the night before sometimes i have to skip breakfast unfortunately so i make sure i have a granola bar or something quick on the counter for me to grab on my way to school well once in a while being late is okay but everyday its not so okay first thing i would ask you to think to yourself is are wasting time at any point like getting glued in front of the tv or fixing that one strand of hair if not and you are free of distractions then i would say if you have issues that your hair needs to be perfect do some stuff before sleeping like blow drying for instance or straightening next if you are just short on time then wake up earlier by minutes and see how that works unless u keep hitting the snooze button often i had the same issue as you so i just wake up earlier i do shower at night and lay out my clothes definately makes things easier hope you get better good luck Sin City Breakfast Textile manufacturing Clothing Violin Bubble Bobble 2000 Australian Grand Prix Aerial (dance move) The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Characters in the Smurfs Shaggy dog story Pitaten DisneySpeak Treehouse of Horror XV Volleyball Phoebe Buffay's songs Super Mario Bros. 3 Kitchen Curling Professional wrestling match types Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Floppy disk Japanese toilet USS Tunny (SS-282) Charles Goodyear Social aspects of clothing Oh My Goddess!
