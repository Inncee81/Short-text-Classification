what are some study methods you used in high school ways to study for people in high school i went to high school before dayplanners came onto the market so i basically took a spiral notebook and created a dayplanner of my own to keep up with my homework extracurricular activity schedule when big tests were etc so my advice get a calendar dayplanner that you like and get your assignments organized i also kept a separate notebook for each class that way i did not mix things up like leave my math homework in my science notebook and then not have the homework when i got to class which gave me a i got a different color notebook for each class then got book covers that were the same color as the notebook seriously we did not have much time between classes or to get to afterschool things so saving a few seconds to get the right book for class or to take home was important i know these are not study methods but they do contribute to keeping things organized so you can study more effectively in your notebook take notes i always dated the notes too keep them in running order don't mix them up your teachers should emphasize important points provide examples etc get those into your notes too sometimes teachers will tell you what you'll be doing the next day so if they tell you read that chapter in the textbook the night before that way you are more familiar with the material and you can spend more time listening to the lecture and taking quality notes every couple of days review your notes to keep things fresh in your head ok i know this may sound dumb to some people but don't try to get all your homework done before you leave school use those few extra minutes to make sure you understand the material go through your notes to make sure you completed everything you wanted to write down like important vocabulary words and spend the time organizing or writing down anything the teacher may have said like you may have a pop quiz on the material on p tomorrow or you will have a test over chapter next tuesday then when you get home relax have a snack then you will be able to concentrate more on homework with fewer distractions and feeling less rushed be sure to eat breakfast everyday and get a good night's sleep everynight GED Extreme Programming Aikido Education in the United States Theory of conduct Education in Romania SAT Quizbowl Tonality Mathematics Gross domestic product Physics Test (student assessment) Boston Public Harrow School Lynbrook High School Graduate school Economics English grammar Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Grade (education) Shaggy dog story Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Calvin and Hobbes Music STS-62 Education Homeschooling CPU cache Education in Taiwan Franz Boas Community emergency response team Current teachings of Prem Rawat Compact disc Psychoanalysis A Course In Miracles Religious Society of Friends Mattress FoxTrot Finnish language Social rule Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Roxette Education in Portugal Negima Computer Color Education in Japan Hunter College High School The Austere Academy Notebook Church of Christ, Scientist Intelligent design movement Floppy disk Objective-C Law school Chinese character Ludwig Wittgenstein Botany Web crawler Jon Secada Blog Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) YuYu Hakusho Pitaten Martial art Dyslexia Reading (activity) Timekeeping on Mars The Book of Five Rings Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma College admissions Capitalism Procrastination Game show Social psychology Cascading Style Sheets Apollo 8 Homework Behaviorism Chicago (band) The Catcher in the Rye Bristol Grammar School M.C.
