i know nothing about physics i'm taking physics high school this year and i know nothing about it does anyone know of any good books or websites or anywhere i can read up on it before school starts i'm a fast learner so i don't need anything to oversimplified thanks well i'm physics teacher maybe i can help first you should have already taken some course like ipc or physical science which has a lot of intro physics concepts so hopefully you do in fact know a little bit about physics right now there are tons of online physics tutorial sites really just do a web search and you'll find lots of them with interactive labs and self paced tutorials along with mini tests at the ends of each unit if you really so want to get ahead go up to your school and get them to issue you the textbook you'll be using this year this may be a little tricky since some administrators don't want to adjust their inventories right before school begins but then again if you're showing this much initiative then they should bend over backwards to help you along with this another idea contact your instructor and get a copy of the syllabus and maybe a study guide for the first weeks he she can email this to you so it's no big deal you can start looking at knowledge and skill basics right now finally if all of this fails go to your local half price book store and buy a used physics textbook they're generally pretty cheap and even if the book is a couple of years out of date don't worry the physics will all be the same it hasn't changed grin so you should be in good shape very best of luck to you and have agreat year Legal research GED Physics Economics Education Theory of conduct Supply and demand Computer Education in the United States Graduate school Textbook Education in the People's Republic of China Game show Many-worlds interpretation Open access Neopets CPU cache Book Education in Japan Physical cosmology Extreme Programming 2000 Australian Grand Prix Alexander Technique Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Education in Romania Second language acquisition Glossary of partner dance terms DVD Gmail Internet fraud Computer virus Science Mathematics Kodocha Python programming language Arianne Causality Biology Homeschooling Microeconomics Quantum computer Augustus De Morgan Forth programming language ITunes Music Store British small press comics BitTorrent Gifted Education Programme (Singapore) PHP Secondary education in France Experiential education Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Microsoft Bicycle lighting Social rule Tai Chi Chuan Blended learning SAT Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Star Trek Customizable Card Game Intelligent design movement Education in Germany Philosophy of science Amazon.com Spring operating system Surveillance Time travel Education in Taiwan Redundant array of independent disks MP3 PLATO Perl Google Pretty Good Privacy Lynbrook High School Patent Windows XP Password Speed reading Geometry Statistics Digital photography Martial art Bayesian inference String theory Education in Hong Kong Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology PlayStation 3 MapleStory Of Pandas and People Central processing unit Virtual memory Montessori method The Standard Emacs The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy IBM PC compatible Hash table
