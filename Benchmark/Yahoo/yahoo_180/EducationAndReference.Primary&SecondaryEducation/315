question for the schools of america i have many friends around the world and all of them have been foreign exchange students many of them think that our schools are a joke my friends in germany have school from september to july with longer vacations and they also go to school for an extra years which is madatory i had the chance to sit on some classes that were learning the same calculus and ap bio i was learning what i didn't know was that i was sitting in on a standard freshmen class they also require the students to have the required amount of credits usually two years in two languages other than their mother tongue is it just me or is the no child left behind act holding the entire country back if a kid is having a learning disorder than put him in a class with other kids he can be competent with whereas me and the rest of the seniors like me can quit being left behind i can't believe that they think the way they fund schools is working its just like with taxes the rich get richer and the poor get poorer the thing is is that they should fund the schools that aren't up to par with scores so that they can actually afford teachers and equipment yeah that makes sense there would be no such thing as remedial courses or community college not that they're bad its like the system expects people not to be on par of where the rest of the world may be if education was stepped up to like you said germany there would probably be many drop outs and people would complain and revolt sad Education in the United States Education in the People's Republic of China SAT Education in Germany Student Education in Hong Kong Tuition 1957 World Series Graduate school Advanced Placement Program Grade (education) Secondary education in the United States Golf No Child Left Behind Act Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Education in Japan High school Education in Scotland Education in Australia Secondary education in France Bretton Woods system Public education Stuyvesant High School Capitalism IB Diploma Programme Education College admissions Japanese tea ceremony Professor GED Esperanto as an international language Flat tax Bond School choice Community college Politics of Canada Education in England Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Middle Tennessee State University Trinity College, Dublin Student loan National Certificate of Educational Achievement Credit card German language Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 College Education in France Appeal Poverty Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Education in India Separation of church and state Whose Line Is It Anyway?
