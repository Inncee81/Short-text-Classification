why can't i catch a wave when i went bodyboarding i went bodyboarding and i thought i was doing everything right i waited for the wave as it started to appear and ride on the top of the wave but it just went past me i was doing it right when i was closer to the shore it was easier when i was in the shallow parts to ride the top of the wave because i could just stand and catch the good part of the wave i am a little limited in my swimming so do you recommend i get flippers thanks it's all about timing and if your not that strong of a swimmer than timing is even more important then ever don't get discouraged just keep practicing and you will get the hang of it since you stated that you weren't that strong a swimmer it may be a good idea to get flippers keep your head up and practice Bodyboarding Diving Backstroke Kitesurfing Butterfly stroke Swimming Bottlenose Dolphin Rip current Breaststroke The Wedge (surfing) Front crawl Triathlon Dolphin Lifeguard Aerial (dance move) Surfing Ecco the Dolphin Swimfin Beaches of Hong Kong Keynesian economics Medley swimming Diving suit Skateboarding trick Drowning History of swimming Guilherme T__mega Swimming pool Tsunami Sailing Plesiosaur Frogman Punt (boat) Landing at Anzac Cove Whitewater Paragliding Anchor 1896 Summer Olympics Fast bowling Skimboarding Quantum mechanics RollerCoaster Tycoon Scientific method Hitchhiking Theory of conduct USA Swimming Flipper (cricket) Naval mine Windsurfing Rapid Shark Cool (song) Cetacea Baseball USS Talbot (DD-114) Pinball Antenna (radio) Poker jargon Anglo-Chinese School Flag Oscilloscope Swimming at the 1896 Summer Olympics Equine conformation Speedo (suit style) Ironman Triathlon Shaggy dog story Tests of general relativity Knoebels David Hume Jon Secada Cleveland Browns Evidence of evolution Jonathan Wild Bicycle frame Speed of light God Save the Queen Human torpedo Mercury 4 Sesshomaru Stingray Snorkel Fishing Jodie Henry Seiche Coast Swimming at the 2004 Summer Olympics - Men's 50 metre Freestyle Dog paddle swimming Tag Laws of cricket Tiger Tour de France Supply-side economics Social rule Wave Lake Burley Griffin Chris Amon Determinism Education in Japan Basketball MS-06 Zaku II New York Giants
