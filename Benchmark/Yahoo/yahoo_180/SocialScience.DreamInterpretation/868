what does it mean when someone in your dream dies my boyfriend died in the dream i had last night i love him with all my heart and would never wish death upon him he is also very healthy and never gets sick so what does this mean all help is appreciated ack i'm starting to get really scared now i really hope he doesn't die i'm fairly certain it doesn't mean his death is imminent or anything depending on the context of the dream it could mean many different things you didn't mention anything about watching him die or being the one that kills him or anything like that and you say you have a very close relationship so my best guess is that you're just scared of losing him forever not necessarily from death maybe from him moving away or something when interpreting dreams remember that almost everything is symbolic his death doesn't mean he will die it just symbolizes something relevant that might be worrying you EastEnders Characters of The Sandman Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Immortality Philosophical skepticism Phaedo Dead Like Me Theory of conduct Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sin City Jon Secada One Tree Hill (TV series) Avenue Q Pitaten Philosophy of language Kylie Minogue The Lovely Bones Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Phoebe Halliwell The Amber Spyglass Time Out of Mind Sharon Tate Social rule Scenes from a Memory StarCraft: Uprising Shaggy dog story Karen Horney Ten Commandments Reincarnation Kimi Finster Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) W.I.T.C.H.
