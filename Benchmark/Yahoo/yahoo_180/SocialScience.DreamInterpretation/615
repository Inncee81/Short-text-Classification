interesting dream help me interpret it please i had a dream the other night where i died but it wasn't a normal death dream no way let me elaborate i dreamed that some people and i all had to die for some great cause but we'd only be dead for a year don't know the cause but we all agreed to it the people with me were the kids i went to elementary school with only they were grown up now we died by entering a classroom trailer outside of my high school the lady organizing it told us once we walked in we would be dead but i didn't quite believe this was true as people don't die by entering classrooms so i walked in but nothing happened but before i turned back around all the colors became much more vibrant and all of our eyes turned light green signifying that we had died it was a wonderful feeling but i was worried because i hadn't told my mother i was going to be dead for a year so i started freaking out because i didn't want her to be sad so i was a little afraid of the lady organizing it but a friend suggested i use my camcorder to send my mom a video of me made perfect since in my dream so i go to the bathroom to make the video and the girl's restroom was full of urinals and the sinks full of sand but the stalls were alright i go in the stall to make the video but i realize my purse had spilt and there was two of everything i owned all over the floor then i returned to the classroom and we just stayed there i grew closer to my classmates to where we were all friends and the experience of death was wonderful but what could this mean what a great dream wanting to make a video leads me to believe that you have had someone close that has died when my mother died all i wanted was just to be able to call her the colors becoming more vibrant sounds like insight into what could happen one thing that i think our minds do while asleep is figure out problems and death is certainly a problem you seem to want to be prepared for it and i find that remarkable for you to dream about you must be a responsible person also the bathroom with urinals and sand bring the image of a sand clock the kind you turn over to start again very good symbol for time running out of course it could represent growing up since your childhood friends were there Shaggy dog story Paul Is Dead Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Shining (film) The Amber Spyglass One Tree Hill (TV series) Jon Secada The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Marilyn Monroe Futurama (TV series - season 2) Milton H.
