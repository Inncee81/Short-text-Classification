am i psychic or plain stupid i have dreams about strange creatures that dont even exist supernatural stuff mostly some female spirit who tries to harm me n i start chanting prayers loudly snakes those which dont really exist and some other animals which look weird im scared i fear sleeping alone at night what do u think people i don't want to sound like a professional christian here i am just a broken sinner and believe in the christian faith not so much from my study but from my experiences and answers to prayers i do know that angels appeared to people in dreams in the scriptures it also says that in the later days old men will dream dreams and young men will see visions i personally don't think the people who wrote the inspired word of god were thinking only men and not women would have this or that see this or that etc i think they just weren't all that pc and used men instead of men women so in my view women will dream dreams and see visions as well i do believe that there are two realms good and evil if you are dreaming of a female spirit who is trying to harm you then it makes sense and you are using good innate instincts to chant prayers loudly if you will recall or perhaps you haven't heard i'm sorry for taking it for granted that you have but in scripture satan appeared in the form of a serpent in the garden of eden so he could be trying to mess with your head in your sleep the really wonderful news is that you can relax and know that satan was defeated on the cross he cannot harm you don't be afraid to sleep alone because jesus said i will never leave you nor forsake you this could just be your wakeup call that it's time to make a decision to yield to god and ask him to protect you and keep you and give you a peaceful night's sleep if you own a bible i would encourage you to read philippians chapter verses through if you don't have a bible i will write it out for you and you can read it over and over and be thankful that greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world i do not know you but i hope that someday i see you in heaven and god will say hey you two were blogging to each other when you should have been sleeping august but i'm glad you blogged cause things got better and the stupid dreams stopped by the way you are not stupif satan is just trying to make you feel stupid rob you of your joy and frighten you he' a jerk we have the power throught the name of jesus to stomp him under our feet he is powerless in the presence of the name of jesus ok now here comes the verses i was telling you about philippians rejoice in the lord always i will say it again rejoice let your gentleness be evident to all the lord is near do not be anxious about anything but in everything by prayer and petition with thanksgiving present your requests to god and the peace of god which passes all understanding will guard your hearts and your minds in christ jesus finally brothers and sister's quotations mine this is also mine here comes the good part whatever is true whatever is noble whatever is right whatever is pure whatever is lovely whatever is admirable if anything is excellent or praiseworthy think about such things sweet woman be thankful for these bad dreams because they may have woken you up to the beautiful power in praying for them to go away please google the lyrics to the song river god by nicole nordeman it is a beautiful illustration of how the difficult things in our lives are what smooth us out much like the way a river rock tumbles over the hard rocks and gets smashed around and hurt only to come out in the end smooth and more beautiful as a result of the difficulty along the journey to become perfected please know that i will pray for you tonight that you sleep safely in the hollow of our father's hand you are loved in fact he is crazy about you now go to bed sweet girl Angel Epistle to the Philippians Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism God Roman Catholic Church Holy Spirit Satan Mary,
