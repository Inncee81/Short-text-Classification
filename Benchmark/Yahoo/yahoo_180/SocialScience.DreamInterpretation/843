i had this weird dream what does it mean last night i was dreaming that i was having a full blown physical fight with my yr old's dad but we never had a physical fight before while we were fighting he put his foot out to kick me and i bit him on his foot okay in reality it was my daughter's hand that i accidently bit by accident mind you this was all sub conscience and i feel really bad now with that said my daughter's dad has been gone since she was months i don't know if this wacky dream makes a deifference but i am also pregnant with another child what does this dream mean and how does it all tie in together fighting in dream shows sign of violence however it is a way to release your anger and helpless conscience although you have never had a physical fight before subconsciously you wanted to vent out your feeling to you he is the one you have to let it go since your daughter's dad has been gone since she was months that hints that there is some support you are seeking now and perhaps the support you have now is not exactly what you want in other words you want a perfect family structure but in reality you may be feeling that you can't achieve and this hidden blame goes to your daughter's dad and projecting fighting with him show emotionally you are hurt by his departure basically you are trying to vent out your helpless conscience EastEnders Bene Gesserit Knots Landing Futurama (TV series - season 5) The Tracey Ullman Show shorts Social rule Eminem Kim Possible Transactional analysis Hulk (comics) Narcissism Mystique (comics) Ranma __ characters God Emperor of Dune Spanking Unconscious mind Days of our Lives Vegeta Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an One Tree Hill (TV series) Buffy Summers Kill Bill Married... with Children Oasis (band) Game show Religion Domestic violence Irna Phillips Simone Weil Friedrich Schleiermacher Virginia Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) YuYu Hakusho Human Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Novel Obi-Wan Kenobi The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Theory of conduct Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Late Night with Conan O'Brien Infantilism Anger management Jean Grey The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Scarlet Witch Family Guy Kurt Cobain Autism Jon Secada Hey Jude Hollyoaks Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Situation comedy Wonderland (McFly album) Consciousness The Contender (television series) The Adventures of Pete & Pete Montreal Screwjob Spider-Man 2 W.I.T.C.H.
