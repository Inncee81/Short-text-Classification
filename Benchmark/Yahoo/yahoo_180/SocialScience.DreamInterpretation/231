i have vivid dreams in sequences like real happenings or movies how do i find out the meaning if there is no distinguishable symbol or theme am asking same q in mythology for instance i dreamed that my favorite band gave a concert in my childhood teen bedroom at one point the drummer was laying on the other twin bed beside the one i was sitting on afterwards we all sat on a couch talking i was between the singer on my left he holding my left hand between his two and guitarist on right leaning against me to hear conversation w singer after awhile i realized the guitarist had his hand on my right breast and as i realize this he leans in very close and asks am i hurting you needless to say he was not then i woke up nice but according to dreamcrowd to dream that you have or play a guitar represents passion and emotion it also relates to sexual connotations and may signal an erotic dream to see an unstrung or broken guitar signifies disappointments in love try posting your dream on dreamcrowd for a free interpretation Cliff Richard The Shining (film) Out-of-body experience Jon Secada Time Out of Mind Shaggy dog story Scenes from a Memory Journey (band) Blonde on Blonde Guns N' Roses Nirvana (band) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Frank Zappa Good Charlotte Avenue Q Child sexuality Madonna (entertainer) Dream The Beach Boys Mulholland Drive (film) Pet Sounds Revolutionary Girl Utena Knots Landing W.I.T.C.H.
