i'm not a violent person but i had the most violent dream i find myself smiling all the time and i'm generally a happy person unless we put an animal to sleep iwork vets sure my family and i have small arguments about small things but we get over it i can't find anything to trigger this i had a dream i graduated highschool and went to college for no apparent reason i beat the crud out of this girl to the point where she had to go to the hospital i felt satisfied at hurting her and had an evil smile and as i walked back into the building the door next to me people were trying to shove a black horse through the door but it fought for it's life understandibly because even i knew that animals went in to be disected i wanted to turn and help it but as i turned to i woke up when i feel asleep i drempt i was a rainforestranger and i found a baby a mom dad tapir in the back of a poachertruck the poachers were small boys fully clad in hunting outfits with rifles they were smiling evil the whole time i was getting onto them and it additional details hours ago was making me furious i started picking up the boys and flinging them around angerly trying to get them to feel sorry for almost killing the tapirs but they continued to smile at me with this evil look of contentment i wanted to feel sorry for throwing them around and hurting them and i did but i was still angery they weren't crying and apologizing as u would think someone would i started hitting them so hard that the anger i felt woke me up i didn't go back to sleep and haven't had any violent dreams since that was about days ago i want to know what is wrong with me i've never even drawn myself to hit anyone in my life and these dreams frighten me of what might be lying underneith your mind is still processing what happened throughout the day we all have the potential for violence and in your case your brain works it out as you sleep it sounds like you feel you are being taken advantage of by someone lack of money on the job or feeling you are doing more than your fair share of the dirty work in any case just a wild guess just remember a dream's a dream and it's not reality and you will be fine Shaggy dog story EastEnders Sin City Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Shining (film) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Social rule Knots Landing Jon Secada Dream Lucid dreaming Pitaten Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Theory of conduct One Tree Hill (TV series) Avenue Q The Amber Spyglass Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Ranma __ characters Phoebe Buffay's songs Kodocha Futurama (TV series - season 5) Humphrey Bogart Philosophical skepticism Scenes from a Memory The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Jam (TV series) K' The Catcher in the Rye Anger management About a Boy The Marshall Mathers LP One Piece minor characters The Inside Narcolepsy Characters in the Smurfs Phaedo Time Out of Mind Joke Bob and George Friends Macbeth Cliff Richard YuYu Hakusho Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Escape from New York The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Miss Saigon Salad Fingers Tenshinhan Daredevil Socrates Milton H.
