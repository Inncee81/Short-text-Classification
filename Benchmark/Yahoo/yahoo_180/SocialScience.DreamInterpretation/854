in my dreams he was trying to reach out ok make a long story short i was in a yr relationship it ended months ago he broke up with me and it isnt the first time awhile ago i saw him while i was walking but i just kept on walking he drove off and said fine becouse i didnt enter his car so anyway i had a dream last night that i was on the train looking threw the window and we came to his station the area where he lives and as the train was going he was running after the train cuz he saw me on the train and he like hollering and all my question is could my dream be telling me something you're safe secure in the train and you're moving on he realizes his mistake and makes a crappy attempt to chase after you you bought the ticket to be on the train you made a decision to not take him back seeing as how he made little effort you assume it's pointless to worry about him anymore Shaggy dog story Jon Secada Scenes from a Memory Sin City The Amber Spyglass Miss Saigon One Tree Hill (TV series) Wyatt Earp John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Chapterhouse Dune New York Giants Children of Dune 1957 World Series The Body (Short Story) Johnny 5 Avenue Q One Piece minor characters St. Elmo's Fire (film) USS Walke (DD-723) Fiddler on the Roof God Emperor of Dune The Inside Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) G-Man (Half-Life) Baseball Stars Michael Garibaldi Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Spider-Man 2 Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Escape from New York Transportation of Los Angeles Rose (Doctor Who) Kodocha Spice Girls 1919 World Series Aerial (dance move) Blood Simple Muni Metro Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) Fancy Crane Columbine High School massacre Eddie Guerrero C__ile Ferate Rom__ne Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Shining (film) Syphon Filter Jean Grey Leon White Full Metal Panic?
