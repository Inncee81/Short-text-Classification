what does my nightmare mean okay two days ago i had a terrible nightmare and i woke up crying in the dream i was talking with my mom and we were in the shore the clouds started turning gray and black and a huge wave came towards us so we ran because we didnt want to get wet then another huge wave came towards us and we heard my little brothers screaming because we forgot that my little they were playing in the water all we saw was my little brothers being carried into the sea i was trying to go and save them but for some reason something was holding me back me and my mom were both crying it was horrible i dont know how to describe it but the whole place looked real scary the sky was black and purple and there was nothing around us exept for the beach and a weird building wow to me it sounds symbolical well when you said when the clouds started turning gray that means that troubles might be comeing to you or someone else you know or don't know it's a sign that something bad is going to happen then you said when a huge wave came toward you to me that sounds like a huge problem or worries are going to happen it doesn't mean it's going to happen to you it could happen to anybody in the future then when you wrote another wave came toward you that means someone you know or it could be yourself is going to have even more problems when you also wrote when you saw your little brothers got carried to the sea that could be that something might happen to them or in the future you or your mom will probably so depressed by the problems that you probably forgot about your lil brothers remeber it doesn't mean it could be you or your brothers then when you said that something was holding you back sounds like you were trying to save them but something is in your way to try and save them also it could be that your weak in some sort maybe spiritualy or emotionaly this sounds very very similiar to this testomony this guy at church had he said that god was going to take all the children because god did not want them to suffer yes i know that it is sad and hard but in the end of times god is going to be takeing a lot of kids because again he doesn't want them to go through whats going to happen to this world i don't want to scare you and make you think that your brothers are going to die soon or sumthing i does sounds very scary and i wouldn't want to have those kinds of dreams even though sometimes i do the dream could be about someone else that is going through a problem if you need any more advice email me at michelle beauty yahoo com try praying before you go to bed because i know that if i don't pray before i don't go to bed i get nightmares and can't go to sleep hope this helped and hopefully pleasant dreams Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Time Out of Mind Miss Saigon Pitaten Piccolo Junior Saga Characters of The Sandman Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Scenes from a Memory Dream Futurama (TV series - season 5) The Tracey Ullman Show shorts Space opera in Scientology doctrine The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Sin City Invader Zim Rich Mullins Avenue Q Wes Craven's New Nightmare Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Social rule Pok__mon Live!
