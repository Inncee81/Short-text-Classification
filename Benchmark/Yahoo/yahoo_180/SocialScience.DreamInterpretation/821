why did i dream about him i work in hospital there is a handsome surgeon who is married his wife is a doctor here to he and i have never had a conversation and have no contact at all other than in passing i could be wrong but i really think that he goes out of his way to make eye contact with me and holds it longer than normal and when passing in the hall i've looked back and seen that he was staring at me i've seen him rush like crazy to open a door for me that he wasn't even intending to go through this has been going on for a few months i didn't think anything of it because men often react that way i'm pretty nice and smart i'm married and even though not happy have never cheated in my marriage never even been tempted i'm shocked now because i had a dream last night about the surgeon i don't remember all the details but it was definitely him it was intimate and sensual what's up with that do i have a crush if i do it would be the st one in years according to dreamcrowd to see a lover in your dream symbolizes acceptance self worth and acknowledgement of your true inner value it may also indicate integration of masculine and feminine traits into yourself you are feeling complete or whole to dream of an old or former lover signifies unfinished unresolved issues related to that specific relationship your current relationship may be awakening some of those same issues try posting your dream on dreamcrowd for a free interpretation Marilyn Monroe W.I.T.C.H.
