can the best dream interpreter interpret this dream in my dream i sow jesus came to my house old one he asked me to help him to bath people becouse the world is ending i was providing towels and water finally my turn came and around people just appear they wore white clothes different collors different ages and ethnicity and jesus gave one of them a watch he took it prayed and passed around finally jesus took it and tied it to my arm and he pured hot water to me and then the end came i was scarred and i sow my father is on the floor and not moving i took his hand and bring him to jesus and ask him to save my father he said that he tied my father with seven lives what does my dream mean i know it means something please help me sighs i'd say this dream is a mixing of your spiritual beliefs and your concerns over them as well as your future and that of those you love i see it not as prophetic but more along the lines of you working out your spiritual and natural concerns and of being given a reassurance i'm assuming that youre a christain so obvioulsy according to the spiritual undertones him jesus asking you to help bathe people is in regards to 'preaching the gospel' in the sense of the days are short and in accordance with matthew therefore go and make disciples of all nations baptising them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit in regards to as it being the comission of all christains not always on a missionary or corporate level such as a pastoral position but even insofar as sharing the gospel and the love of god with co workers family friends and et cetera the number can signify judgement but it can also signify trials or testing in this respect each ethnicity represent the kingdom as a whole i e every tribe and nation et cetera in accordance with rev is being tried by and for their faith white represents purity holiness forgiven for sin etc the watch represents the 'time' as in the 'last days' and in accordance with matthew to be watchful and to keep watch because you do not know on what day your lord will return seeing your father on the floor perhaps you are worried that he wasnt isn't 'saved' and therefore did not will not go to heaven i e reiterated by your asking god to save your father you took his hand and bring him to jesus you lead him to the lord the number seven represnts perfection complete wholeness therefore as a new being in christ your father is now complete perfect this is just my opinion take with a grain of salt Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Christian views of Jesus Christianity Eastern Orthodox Church Trinity Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sola fide Mary, the mother of Jesus Book of Mormon Holy Spirit Justification (theology) Jesus Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Roman Catholic Church Divine grace Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Ten Commandments Eucharist Church of Christ Cultural and historical background of Jesus Repentance End times Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Dispensationalism Abrahamic religion John Howard Yoder Christian Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Sermon on the Mount Sabbath Religious conversion Mormonism Second Coming Mass (liturgy) True Jesus Church Mormonism and Judaism Pharisees Merit New Testament The Pilgrim's Progress John the Baptist Philipp Melanchthon Resurrection of Jesus God Religious perspectives on Jesus Priesthood (Mormonism) Catechism Charles Grandison Finney Seventh-day Adventist Church Endowment (Mormonism) Apostle Book of Isaiah Aramaic of Jesus Coptic Christianity Herbert W.
