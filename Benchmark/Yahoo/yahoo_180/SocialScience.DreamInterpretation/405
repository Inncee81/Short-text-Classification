what does this recurrent dream meant this dream i have been having for more than yrs then it just stopped for no apperent reason this dream was recurrent occuring day after day except one night where i had a different dream this recurrent dream was like i would be falling from great height wearing a white or pale blue frock soundlessly screaming my hair flowing about me like being caught in a wind i would be falling to some whirpool of water there was nothing else just me falling forever and this strange water whirlpool the thing is i would never reach the bottom this dream would occur day after day except one night when i dreamt of everything black but a small shining being of a sort holding an umbrella it was actually a pleasant dream i have since then stopped having these dreams i still cant figure out wat they meant i wud remember them clearly every time i woke up i dont believe very firmly dat every dream has a meaning but dreams like dis so regular which then just disappear are strange just thougt to add as well this dream has been there since the earliest days of my life and am only btw well yeah mayb its physiological but i sometimes wish i would dream of it again that feeling of falling and falling and falling without ever hitting the bottom was sort of releasing you had this dream every single night then it seems to me that perhaps it might have been an aspect of your brain chemistry that was triggering something i e when you were finally ready to fall fast asleep and losing 'control' of your waking brain activity i say that it just might be physiological rather than some sort of hidden message because it happened every night Dream Lucid dreaming Narcolepsy The Shining (film) Sleep Out-of-body experience Urinary incontinence Salad Fingers Cliff Richard Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare Philosophical skepticism Scenes from a Memory Rod Stewart Daz Dillinger A Day in the Life Hypnosis 1957 World Series Electroencephalography Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Shaggy dog story Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Puberty Waking the Dragons Sin City Rayman Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Avenue Q Dave Matthews Band Wheel of Fortune Miss Saigon DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution Sega Saturn Bong Characters of The Sandman Oasis (band) 50 First Dates Frankie Laine Hypoglycemia Green Day Saga (band) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Eternal return Haibane Renmei Artificial neural network Billboard Hot 100 USS Trigger (SS-237) Clinical depression Spice Girls One Tree Hill (TV series) Atomic Kitten Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Time and the Rani She Loves You Sonic the Hedgehog 2 World Series Deus ex machina Hiberno-English D__j__ vu CPU cache Fasting Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Sting (musician) Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Rapid eye movement W.I.T.C.H.
