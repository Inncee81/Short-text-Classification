can anyone help me understand this dream i've had this dream times so this time i wrote it down so i would remember it clearly i went to a foreign country and got arrested for trying to help some poor children when i was released my family and friends gave me a huge dinner only old friends i don't see anymore and dead relatives were there at the same time my family and friends that i do see was waiting for me across town at another dinner i was torn between the sides but i stayed with the ones i never see anymore also when i was looking out of the window at the party i saw a huge snake lizard and an alligator that was under a bed trying to eat one of my sons each time it was a different son i was behind the glass so i couldn't save him but somebody at the party did please help i have no idea what this means and i keep having the same dream when i looked out the window there also was a fully cooked whole chicken floating in the pool i can try to help interprete some of it the fact that you are seeing your old friends and dead relatives is in indication of how you were and how you felt about yourself in the past while you were around these people your current friends represent you now you stayed with the ones you never see anymore because there is something in your past that you need to deal with or cant let go and the fact that you got arrested is an indication that something in your present past life perhaps a secret is holding you back or you feel trapped or held back by something that is going on now looking out the window is an indication of you looking at your life and you have a fear subconciously that your sons are in danger perhaps medical danger and you feel as though you would not be able to help them you feel powerless you want to be there to protect your children from everything bad that might come there way but you know that you cant always be there to protect them thats what the reptile under the bed trying to eat your son and you not being able to save them because you are behind a glass means but i believe there is something in your past that you cant let go of or refuse to let go of that will explain the first part of your dream Jon Secada The Subtle Knife Shaggy dog story The Amber Spyglass The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Out-of-body experience W.I.T.C.H.
