why can't i lucid dream i first about lucid dreaming a long time ago but i never tried it but a couple months ago i looked it up so i did what it told me to do but i still can't maybe this will help throughout the day while you are awake ask yourself is this a dream anytime something odd happens or even when nothing out of the ordinary happens the trick is not to answer the question with an immediate of course i am not dreaming come up with a consistent way to check if you are awake or asleep for example checking the time on a clock and then quickly check it again if you are dreaming the time will always dramatically change at the second glance or if you are reading something look away and then read it again again if you dreaming when you look at it the second time whatever you are reading will be completely different as you keep asking yourself this question during the day the question will become second nature you will ask the question during your dreams and when you do your check to see if you are awake or asleep you are well on your way to lucidity identify your dream signals these are objects or images in your dream that serve as cues or markers to let you know that you are dreaming anything can be a dream signal and is unique to each individual dreamer it may help to read through your dream journal and select an images that seem to constantly appear in your dreams by selecting a recurring image then it has a better chance of appearing in your future dreams then when you are ready for bed tell yourself that when i see an apple then i know i am dreaming or whatever dream signal you have chosen use your dream signs to let you know that you are dreaming when an anomaly or something impossible occurs in your dream instead of ignoring it or trying to rationalize it let it be an indicator that you are dreaming some common dream signs include flying walking through walls or the appearance of someone who is dead in real life finally encourage your lucid dreams but do not force them as your efforts may have an opposite effect it is important to relax as you improve your lucid dreaming you can even learn to write your own dream scripts your sense of smell and touch will become heightened before going to bed tell yourself what you want to dream and what area you want to explore good luck Dream Out-of-body experience Philosophical skepticism Sleep Carl Jung Phaedo Abortion debate Apollo 8 Plame affair The Amber Spyglass Philosophy of language Daredevil CPU cache Scientology beliefs and practices Scenes from a Memory Baseball Telepathy Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Betting (poker) Human sexual behavior Milton H.
