weird dreams what do they mean all in the same night i dreamt i was some kind of bird human creature but i was a baby and i had to cling to my mother in order to fly around and if i let go i'd fall i was in a creepy old ladies house in the woods she was evil and she tortured people and i kept trying to sneak out of her house without her seeing me i was on a train track and a bus crashed on it than the bus fell down a cliff and smashed i saw it sliding toward the cliff for a long time and i just stood there and watched i was a baby and so was my boyfriend well ex boyfriend now and we were friends we couldnt speak yet but we talked through our minds and we were looking at a book with our life story in it it said all the things we've done in the past and present and i wanted so badly to read the end to see if we'd end up together in the end but before i could read it my boyfriend baby version fell and bumped his head so i carried him to his dad cuz he was crying fascinating you are still not mature enough to fly and must rely on a nurturing authority figure to do the flying for you there is something in your belief system represented by the house that is creepy and that you would like to escape from you are watching something slip away and you can't do or don't really want to do anyhing about it you and your ex boyfriend were not truly ready to have more of a relationship i needed more of a parent than you wanted to be you being the more mature one took him to his proper parent and that ended the relationship that particular book ended when the relationship did however you have a library full of books describing other parts of your lie keep opening them you'll find one that brings you up to date and points to the future let me know if any of this rings true for you The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe The Amber Spyglass One Tree Hill (TV series) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Jon Secada Shaggy dog story The Catcher in the Rye EastEnders Knots Landing W.I.T.C.H.
