do people deaf from birth have dreams with sounds i remember reading somewhere but i don't remember where that deaf people do not have dreams with sounds the article said that your dreams are comprised of what you experience in life everyday instead a deaf person would dream mostly visually without sounds because he has never experienced sounds before where people like us would hear spoken voices in dreams he would probably dream of sign language because that is what he is probably used to seeing everyday likewise a blind person from birth cannot see but he can hear so he would only dream in sounds smells touch not pictures while people like us who can both hear and see our dreams are comprised of both pictures and sounds i am not completely sure how correct this article is but it makes sense to me Hearing impairment Deaf culture Deaf Deafblindness Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Sign language Manually Coded English Aphasia Philosophical skepticism Tactile signing Auslan Models of deafness Music British Sign Language Synaesthesia American Sign Language Signing Exact English Jon Secada The Miracle Worker Lucid dreaming Milton H.
