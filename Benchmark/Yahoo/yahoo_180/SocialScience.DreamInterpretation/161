i have had various flying or floating dreams for as long as i can remember what could they mean when i was a kid i would dream of jumping off of high places and floating slowly to the ground when i got a bit older they evolved into me simply flying over a wide river with trees lining each side now the seem to have moved to me trying to practice flying you know learning to float and the controlling as ascent i remeber very few of my dreams but i remember these often enough to wonder what the deal is any ideas i guess my thought process is that the earlier two forms of the dream represent various levels of freedom the latest might be some subconscious attempt to try to regain some actual or perceived loss of freedom in my head that makes sense logically but i don t think dreams always follow a logical pattern yeah i'm with you on this one i've had mostly floating some flying dreams throughout my life and due to when i get them i feel they represent freer times in my life when i'm not bogged down with the weight of the world i agree though it's just a loose interpretation as there's no way of knowing for sure i have to admit also i used to wake up convinced truly convinced i could float and i really enjoyed the dreams Philosophical skepticism Reality Dream The Amber Spyglass Unconscious mind Computer numbering formats Theory of conduct Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Central processing unit A Course In Miracles Aerial (dance move) Lucid dreaming Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel Infantilism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Determinism Atheism The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Objectivist philosophy Consciousness Tenshinhan Scenes from a Memory Fundamentalism God Scientific method Logic Jon Secada Coercion Democracy Randomness Epistemology Immanuel Kant Carburetor Lindy Hop Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Free will CPU design Religion Existentialism Vegeta Phaedo Edgar Cayce The nature of God in Western theology Strategic management Object-oriented programming Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Milton H.
