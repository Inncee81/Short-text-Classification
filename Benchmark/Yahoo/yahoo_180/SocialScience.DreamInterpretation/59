i had a disturbing dream what does it mean i dreamed i was in a big bright white kitchen and my long departed grandmother was there this other person that i knew years ago had just cut off the tail of a little white and black cat and as horrified as i was by this i picked up the pieces of the tail and put them into the dust bin so as not to have my gran upset then the little cat jumped up into my arms it was in pain and i noticed that it's eyes were weeping blood it was crying blood i don't normally dream in colour but the cats eyes were crying red blood it was getting on my shirt as well and i decided that i had to take the cat to a vet right away then i awoke so anyone have any ideas what the heck it all means thanks in advance for any help wowee what a dream it's more useful in dream analysis to try and remember how you felt during the dream and what the different elements mean to you which is not always that simple all that crap about how dreaming about red cars means you're going to lose an arm in an industrial accident or whatever is rubbish how did you feel about the room and about your grandmother being there sad calm excited at home or in a strange place did you feel angry or just horrified when this person cut off the cat's tail was your first instinct to go after the person to help the cat or to protect your grandmother and how did you feel about the position you were put in and the decision you made how did you feel when the cat was bleeding and crying and you had to take it to the vet upset or guilty or irritated or anxious how did you feel to have woken up relieved to have escaped the situation or frustrated that you weren't able to see it through to its conclusion does this person or the cat mean anything to you that you understand immediately dreams often call upon long forgotten fragments of our experiences and imagination to make sense of emotions and uncertainties that are playing upon us now often from childhood or from events which didn't seem to affect us too much at the time but has left some conclusion or impact on our subconsious if you've got time to find a quiet place and try and relive the dream and acknowldedge the emotions that came with it for a few minutes then you might be able to access something that you're subconsiously going through now or make sense of some murmuring changing feeling that you weren't quite sure of and perhaps even find some resolution cool have fun hx Shaggy dog story The Shining (film) Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Lucid dreaming Pitaten Scenes from a Memory Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind God Emperor of Dune Piccolo Junior Saga Episodes of Lost (Season 1) One Piece minor characters Dream Miss Saigon Cat Little Britain The Contender (television series) One Tree Hill (TV series) The Death Gate Cycle Characters of Naruto Time Out of Mind Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Milton H.
