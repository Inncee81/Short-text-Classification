scary odd dreams has anyone ever had one of these types of dreams where you wake up in the middle of it because your whole body feels the same way your foot feels when it falls asleep i've had that happen several times to me and it's like i'm pinned down but i'm totally awake i can't talk i can't move and sometimes i can hear an ugly faint voice can't make out what it's saying but i hear something and i feel like there's a presence in the room i have read about it and i've heard it can be sleep paralysis but one time i felt like something jumped off my chest in the same way it would feel if a cat jumped off you if it was on your lap crazy my sister twin says she had dreams like this before in fact when we were little we used to sleep in the same bed sometimes so it wouldn't happen again anyone have a similar experience i've told my mom about it she's a waaay christian religous person so of course she chalked it up to bad spirits opinions anyone some would call it lucid dreaming if you are into that sort of thing that is to say you are open to certain ideas some would dismiss i would look into something called astral projection people who claim to experience lucid dreaming or maybe it was astral projection people who said this describe a feeling pretty similar to yours lucid dreaming is the state of being conscious while you are still asleep this means you can control your dreams to an extent a certain method of lucid dreaming involves the sleep paralysis you speak of that might actually be astral projection i'm not sure if that is considered a different concept or an extension of lucid dreaming either way lucky you well i guess not really because of the feeling it gives you because it's actually a pretty rare phenomenon to wake up like that and a lot of people try to achieve it so they can manipulate it the part about feeling like there's a presence again if you are accepting to such concepts you might have a ghost in your house who is waking you up in that state on purpose some people are more perceptive to that sort of thing than others for example my cousin and my aunt live in a house with a ghost and they are the only two people who have experienced any sort of odd occurrences despite the fact that her family of has lived in that house for well over years edit whilst reading up on lucid dreaming i think i found something that is exactly like what you are describing it's called hypnagogia you should read the wikipedia article on it it is extremely similar to what you said Astral projection Dream Hypnagogia Philosophical skepticism Milton H.
