i dream of hooking up with my friends cousin she is good looking but i wouldn't date her we hang out a lot i've seen how my friend scares the sh t out of other guys his cousins date because they don't have any brothers i'm usually the muscular guy who stands behind him with my arms crossed and nods while he lays down the law even if she wasn't my friend's cousin i probably wouldn't go out with her she's going into th grade and i'm a sophomore no no no no no no does this mean somewhere deep inside of me i really do want to hook up with her could be i think that sometimes the things that we feel and we push away that we havn't dealt with in waking life always find ways of manifesting themselves within our dreams i used to keep having this reacurring dream of having sex with the same guy who resembled my ex unknowingly that we would have sex one last time what i'm saying is i got it all out of my system when we did and was able to move on truth be told i no longer have that dream this is the truth so maybe there's a lot more to our dreams than we know Jon Secada Friends Rod Stewart Humphrey Bogart Theory of conduct Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Salad Fingers Avenue Q Philosophical skepticism EastEnders Milton H.
