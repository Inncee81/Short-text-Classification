what could it mean if i died in my dream what could it mean if i am running from a group of people trying to kill me and then by the end of my dream the hold me up by my throat and slit my throat thanks and i was also wondering if anyone knew a good website where i could look up dreams or things in my dreams my friends mom has a book like that but i was wondering if i could just use something on the web if you think about it for a moment you'll realize that there isn't any guarantee that specific elements of dreams will mean the same thing to different people the popular literature is abundant with false wisdom about this flying means sex animals have symbolic value etc how can that possibly be one's mind doesn't answer to some sort of rule book in regard to personal meanings what is probably most informative to you is how you emotionally react to the situations that you are presented with in your own dreams it helps to be able to refresh your memory with as best an account of the elements you can recall from your dream as possible if you have interest in this keep a notepad by your bed for jotting down some notes when you wake up in the morning before any aspects of your day cloud your memory remembering dreams is actually a bit difficult it gets easier with effort and time be aware of patterns and recurring themes in your own dreams be ready to write down not only what you remember happening but an honest account of how it made you feel there are no right or wrong answers that come from confronting yourself with your own dreams but there are useful jump off points that can potentially help you to understand parts of your own make up that may not come into the light of conscious awareness otherwise this is useful i hope that helps Dream Social rule Lucid dreaming Out-of-body experience Scientology beliefs and practices Unconscious mind Philosophical skepticism Socrates Milton H.
