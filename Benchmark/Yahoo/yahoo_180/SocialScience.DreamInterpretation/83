what does this dream mean okay so here i am in a college class but the campus is really strange like very high tech and the class is being taught by my high school anatomy teacher there are two of my friends that i recognize in the class but they dont know each other one is my friend paul whom i went to high school with and the other is evie a girl i just met at the beginning of my real summer classes in the dream though i keep forgetting stuff i need and have to go back and forth to get it and everytime i try to go talk to evie i get pulled away from her and its kinda like she doesnt know i'm there then i finally get the chance to walk up to her and then i wake up what do you think this might mean by the way evie is short for evelyn if you were wondering maybe you're trying to cling on to the past like you see all this high tech stuff and then all of a sudden you're teacher from high school is teaching it so it's like you're moving on but you want things to be the way they were before so it's like whenever you talk to evie something such as the past is pulling you back maybe you're afraid of the future or just afraid of moving on in general Avenue Q Shaggy dog story Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Milton H.
