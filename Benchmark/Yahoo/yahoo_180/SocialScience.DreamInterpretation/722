dream help so i am standing in a desert and there is nothing besides me in the desert then out of nowhere the sage pops out of the ground and appears before me he then tells me to look in the air as i look i see floating people in the air shackled together they are pale and ghostly and all are moaning then as i look upon the faces they are everyone i know besides my friends and girlfriend then the sage tells me to eat of which tree i wish i look and tell him that there is no tree and he taps the ground with his staff and again it is divided among my friends and girlfriend i go with my friends because they are more as i did last time as soon as i take the first bite everyone and everything dissapears except me and the desert and then headstones come out of the ground and there are names that i have never heard wrote on them once again i hear the voice tell me that thanx to me all mankind is dead what does this mean this happened days after the this is asking you what do you want from life remember you can have anything that you want from life but anything that you want and work for comes at a price whether good or bad for choices that you make there are results along the path of life that you go you will be faced with many choices some big some not so big remember that for each decision you make there is always a reward of some kind whether good or bad its up to you also you maybe having some regrets for past mistakes that you have made these may have been knowing or unknowing on your part at the time take some time out in the near future to really sit down and learn from them don't obsessed over them you can't change the past only learn from it and try to do better as time goes along also remember this and keep it in mind what is dead can't be resurrected think about this when a person goes to a graveyard there are living visitors but the ones who are staying are not alive if you were to dig them up from their graves no life would be found inside their bodies what is dead should stay dead don't go and try to bring the dead back to life three is a very powerful number it means that a person has grown in life experience the problems that you have faced thus far can only be learned from and that will take time but if you put effort into it you can be able to take bad situations and make good use of them you should write this dream down and keep it with you i believe this can be a great point of inspiration and a guiding light to you in life if you will record it and look at it every so often this can guide you to great things the thing about it is that you have to let it guide you a sword is only good in the hands of a warrior that knows how to use it properly Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Son Goku (Dragon Ball) RuneScape quests Shen Gong Wu One Tree Hill (TV series) Social rule Pitaten The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Socrates Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Vegeta Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Children of Dune Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Link (Legend of Zelda) Kain (Legacy of Kain) Piccolo Junior Saga Scenes from a Memory Jon Secada Burial The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time characters Avenue Q The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Current teachings of Prem Rawat Bad Wolf God Emperor of Dune Romulus and Remus Shaggy dog story YuYu Hakusho Incarnations of Immortality The nature of God in Western theology Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Characters of The Sandman Time Out of Mind Jiddu Krishnamurti Milton H.
