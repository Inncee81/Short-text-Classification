do dreams really come true do dreams really come true i mean the dreams that you dream at night and somtimes you can remember them threw out the day so ive heard they do from so many people so i dont really know i havent ever really noticed if my dreams come true has it happened anybody else i've had a few dreams come true but they were never anything major like someone dying i hope dreams don't come true because i have a lot of bad dreams i've also heard that everyone you dream about or see in a dream you will one day meet i think that's kind of crap because that cannot be possible but the point is there are a lot of ideas about dreams and their interpretations i'm sure you can dream something to happen before it does people who have a religion typically believe that prophets had a vision of something before it happened so why can't it happen to others but i don't think that every dream comes true that's just ridiculous Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Philosophical skepticism Dream Theory of conduct Craps Prophets of Islam Jon Secada Emanuel Swedenborg The Shining (film) Social rule Time Out of Mind Miracle Year of the Spider Book of Mormon The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Cliff Richard Reality Apocalypse Phoebe Buffay's songs Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Lucid dreaming God Emperor of Dune Jacob Avenue Q End times Mulholland Drive (film) Religion Out-of-body experience Discordianism Joseph (Hebrew Bible) Journey (band) Carlos Castaneda Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix The Power of Nightmares True Crime: Streets of LA Second Vatican Council The Rutles Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) History of the Latter Day Saint movement Anti-Mormonism Saint Prophet Joseph Smith, Jr. Field of Dreams Eschatology Ten Commandments Alan Campbell (pastor) The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Dice Phaedo Scenes from a Memory Fundamentalism Witchcraft Divination Carrie Jacobs-Bond Saga (band) Daniel Minority Report (film) Remember...
