i keep having a dream like this i keep having different dreams but the same ending my mom always leaves me alone she is always with a person like my stepdad or brother i hate it what can i do to stop having these nightmares what does it mean really recurring dreams can be highly useful and important to analyze they happen for one of two reasons they reflect an unhealthy pattern that you have fallen into in real life and they are trying to show you that your behaviour is not helping you be happy or they represent unresolved feelings such as anger or sadness over a past situation that you have not healed from in many recurring dreams your sleeping self is trying to solve a problem or confront an emotion that you are unable to face in real life whatever the subject of your recurring dream is you can be sure it is reflecting something in your current life situation even if the dream takes you back in time think carefully about what in your life might be causing you continual stress or worry mothers in dreams usually invoke powerful emotions if you are dreaming about your mother you may be addressing some real life issues or concerns about your mother in your dream or your dream may be based on a valuable memory the general image of mother in a dream may symbolize a variety of feelings and ideas caring nurturing love acceptance hard work sacrifice etc the mother in your dream could also represent that force or current inside of you that nudges you on and inspires you it is your intuition and the knowledge that lives deep within your soul to see your stepfather in your dream symbolizes authority it suggests that you need to be more self reliant consider also your waking relationship with your stepfather a dream about your real brother should be interpreted according to your real life relationship sorry for making it long but at this point i think its obvious this dream is a straight up representation about the relationship with your mom stepdad and brother the reason why youre dreaming it over and over is because its unresolved you havent confronted the issue in real life good luck i know its stressful for you wish u all the best Dream Characters of The Sandman Narcissism Sigmund Freud Scenes from a Memory Simone Weil W.I.T.C.H.
