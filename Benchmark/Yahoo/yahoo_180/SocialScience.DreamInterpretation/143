why do people say dreams can't hurt you when i wake up hurt in the affected area i got hurt in the dream last night i had a dream about spiders that looked like skulltulas from zelda's twilight princess and the dream plot of the new highlander anime movie the night before i watched the movie and played the zelda game that would explain the images and combination of both and yet that doesn't explain when the spider or skulltula bit me i felt it as soon as i woke up which was on my hand but no markings were left just a searing pain i could feel the dream comming to a climax when the huge foot long spider bit me now is a good time to say the dream resparked my aracniphobia and i jolted awake so can someone tell me why i'm feeling pain when i wake up just like in the matrix movie like when a character dies and they die in real life a physical pain is created in your brain and moved to your body parts by different nerves when you dream about getting hurt if it is too life like it can generate the pain in the brain and that particular part of the body will hurt but a little willpower can shove the pain away if not or advil will to the trick cheerios Link (Legend of Zelda) W.I.T.C.H.
