inturitation needed my husband woke up this morning gasping this was his dream we were all in a small room at m' and m s wedding they were doing the handfasting ceremony but after the first three cords all their friends came up and tied more cords on but all the additional cords were black while that was going on i collapsed to the floor gasping for air trying to pull myself up on this arm chair which suddenly appeared though the cushion in the seat of the chair resembled a curled up human being for some reason everyone else in the room had disappeared and i was about to black out when i woke up any insight would be helpful some added information we attended m and m's wedding this past saturday there was a three cord handfasting in the ceremony he admitted to me before the wedding that he was uncomfortable about the up coming union that he felt slightly hypocritical going and giving his blessing when deep down he wasn't fully comfortable with their relationship to me it seems as though he is foreseeing someones future and that he feels a close tie to m and m and may end up being or feeling that he has caused what may be foretold in this dream the first cords are usually white or cold right scottish handfasting the rest seems to foretell of an impending death or close to death experience since it was your husband that had the dream more than likely he is tied to the male m in his dream the cords represent yrs of untroubled marriage the black cords foretell an ominous interuption in the marriage with the appearance of the human curled up as the chair cushion that may be the key if it was an adult i would say that something may happen to the man but if it is more child like i would be more inclined to say it could be that after children in the marriage that the additional children will not make it through maturity have him try to concentrate on the dream again before going to bed then try to remember more destinct details because really the information you have given is very limited and i can not discern if it is ominous to the couple or ominous to you and him or that even you all are even involved let me know more when you have re examined the details i hope you do not have any more bad dreams god bless Marriage Handfasting Chair Strap-on dildo Same-sex marriage Scenes from a Memory Knots Landing Eastern Orthodox Church Milton H.
