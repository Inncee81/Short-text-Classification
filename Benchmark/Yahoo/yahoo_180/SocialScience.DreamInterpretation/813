trying to keep someone out of my thoughts and they end up starring in my dreams have this aquaintance of mine who keeps starring in all of my dreams and i have no idea why we haven't spoken much lately and i would understand why this is happening all the time if they were constantly on my mind but they are not as a matter of fact i'm sort of trying to put this person out of my mind and leave them in the past somehow they creep into my dreams and then i wake up going wtf any idea why this is happening thank you for all of your wonderful answers they were very insightful dreams are just sumbols created by the sub conscious to help deal with day to day problems that the mind can't handle during the waking state maybe there is something that you still owe this person or need to do in order to put this person and your relationship with them out of your mind and into the past until you figure out what it is they are going to keep coming back into your dreams do you owe them an apology was there a promise you made them and then didn't keep you need to sit down in a quiet are where you won't be bothered and take a critical look at the relationship you had with them and see if you can't find the answer and pupt it to rest so that you can put the dream to rest Jiddu Krishnamurti Dream Unconscious mind Socrates Milton H.
