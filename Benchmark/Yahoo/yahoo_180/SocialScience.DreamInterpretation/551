does this dream mean anything lately i have been having dreams where i am in a situation where i want to scream like one i was being chased and attacked by an older man and one where i found someone who had hung them selfs at a sorority house but when i go to scream in my dream its like i cant and nothing but i muffled whisper comes out could that mean anything a big fear of mine is being defenseless in a life threatening situation could that have something to do with it everyone feels scared of being defenseless that's part of life i have had similar dreams and so have many many other ppl seeing in a dream that you cant scream for help means that you are anxious or scared of something in life maybe theres an event that makes you fear a person or a waking life situation you feel helpless and not very powerful Scenes from a Memory Salad Fingers Escape from New York Dream Scream (film) The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Cordelia Chase Death Comes to Time Children of Dune Lucid dreaming Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Anxiety Sin City Miss Saigon Son Goku (Dragon Ball) W.I.T.C.H.
