really long dream interpretation my family and i think some of my friends i didn't know any of these people but i seemed really close to them in that way i think watched a tv programme about world war one on the tv then me and two other boys teenagers who i would class as my cousins decided to make a play about the film using war memoriblia we were in the middle of this when i looked at my cousin walking down towards the living room when my boyfriend david was walking behind him i seemed really surpised because in real life he has gone on holiday recently to france i think i gave him a hug i'm about sure but i remember not giving him a kiss he joined in with our play then i dropped a piece of memoriblia that was really important i remember it being beige in colour and it smashing like pottery would i remember one of my cousins shouting at me and i felt embarassed in front of david becasue of this i was worried what my family would think and i thought that they would shout at me then david said he came to pick up his xbox games i think it was xbox and picked them up in a bag from under the kitchen sink there weren't many games in there two it looked like maybe three it was a smallish bag but anyway he didn't stay long and i was upset that he was going to go again this all took place at my dad's old house in eccles which we have moved out of two years ago i think so it wasn't recent but i still miss it sometimes even though i only stayed there once a week next i wouldn't let david leave without a proper kiss and i think he was reluctant at first becasue he had to go but after about three times of me asking him he took me to the corner and gave me a really meaningful kiss but that wasn't the first time we'd kissed that night like that i remebered then on his way out he said he loved me really meaningful we went out of the house into the dark where david's family was waiting in the car david got in and the car's headlight shone on me as if david's mum wanted a look at me becasue she has never seen me before i waved and smiled and pursued to look for my family's car i turned the corner and then i saw the back of my family's car speeding off down the road david's family's car didn't move so i figured that they were still watching me so i remember feeling really stupid turnig round and walking back in this dream i had a vision of david's mum asking me if i wanted a ride home but i was going to refuse because i thought it would be cheeky they didn't ask me in the end though i walked down towards david's family's car and remember feeling embarassed becasue of the clothes i was wearing a beige coat tights and some black shoes probably due to the costumes in the play i remember feeling like a prostitute and all of these worries were of what david's mum would think of me she was the one who was driving so i immiediately thought that she would be the enpowering one in the family plus in real life david does as she says the cars in this dream were small and ford like my family's was red in colour and david's family's car was a really dark colour but i presumed would be green or blue in sunlight david's family didn't seem bad people though according to dreamcrowd to see your own family in your dream represents security warmth and love consider also the significance of a particular family member or the relationship you have with them our dreams are full of symbolism with their messengers being all different types of people it is very common to dream about our friends these are individual that are emotionally valuable to us and we learn about ourselves through them dreams are very rarely prophetic thus whether your dream was good or bad don't expect it to come true this dream is more than likely attempting to bring up uncomfortable feelings that you have about yourself or others remember uncomfortable does not necessarily mean bad dreams are created by our own thinking processes our own thoughts conscious or unconscious create dreams thus the mind that created the dream also knows its meaning try posting your dream on dreamcrowd for a free interpretation Shaggy dog story Social rule About a Boy One Tree Hill (TV series) The Shining (film) Friends The Ashlee Simpson Show The Catcher in the Rye Jon Secada Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Knots Landing Poker jargon Time Out of Mind Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Care Bears Sin City The Amber Spyglass Cliff Richard Father's Day (Doctor Who) Neighbours Miss Saigon St. Elmo's Fire (film) Little Britain 2000 Australian Grand Prix Blonde on Blonde The Star Wars Holiday Special Marilyn Monroe The Inside 1957 World Series Hall & Oates Kodocha The Invisibles Humphrey Bogart Milton H.
