what does it mean when i keep having dreams with people chasing me and trying to kill me i always have dreams where there are people trying to kill me or my family and i keep having to escape in different ways last night i had a dream where there were mobsters trying to kill me and i had to change my name and move country i couldn't stop moving otherwise they'd kill me i'm being chased chase dreams often stem from feelings of anxiety in your walking life the way we respond to anxiety and pressure in real life is typically manifested as a chase dream running is an instinctive response to physical threats in our environment often in these dream scenarios you are being pursued by some attacker who wants to hurt or possibly kill you you are running away hiding or trying to outwit your pursuer chase dreams may represent your way of coping with fears stress or various situations in your waking life instead of confronting the situation you are running away and avoiding it ask yourself who is the one chasing you and you may gain some understanding and insight on the source of your fears and pressure the pursuer or attacker who is chasing you in your dream may also represent a part of yourself your own feelings of anger jealousy fear and possibly love can assume the appearance of threatening figure you may be projecting these feelings onto the unknown chaser next time you have a chase dream turn around and confront your pursuer ask them why they are chasing you one may be consumed by their own anger jealousy love or self destructive behavior for example you may be drinking too much or exhibiting open hostility toward others around you you may subconsciously be threatened by these actions which have been jeopardizing your relationships and or career your dreams are a way of calling attention to these self destructive actions a more direct analysis of chase dreams is the fear of being attacked such dreams are more common among women than men who may feel physically vulnerable in the urban environment these dreams are inspired by fears of violence and sexual assault in which we are so over exposed from the media the violence that the media portrays magnifies our fears and how at risk we all are Domestic violence Borderline personality disorder Post-traumatic stress disorder Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Anxiety Narcissism Rape Sigmund Freud Hikikomori God Emperor of Dune Anger management Obsessive-compulsive disorder Karen Horney Fathers' rights Homophobia Transactional analysis Dog Panic attack Anorexia nervosa Strategic management Pontiac's Rebellion Psychoanalysis Darth Vader EastEnders Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix BDSM Paranoia Agent Out-of-body experience Second language acquisition Simone Weil Yom Kippur War Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Daredevil The Shining (film) Chapterhouse Dune Clinical depression Hip hop rivalries Enneagram Unconscious mind Hulk (comics) Macbeth Sleep Te Kooti's War Cordelia Chase Characters of The Sandman Human Zoophilia Social psychology A Course In Miracles Gestalt therapy Free trade Kain (Legacy of Kain) Emotion One Tree Hill (TV series) Jean Grey On Her Majesty's Secret Service Bene Gesserit Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Tag Transsexuality Animal communication Battle of France Existentialism Mulholland Drive (film) Antisocial personality disorder Charmed Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Infantilism Autism Maison Ikkoku Buffy Summers Motivation Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism The Death Gate Cycle Media and ethnicity Grief Refugee Nuclear warfare The Brothers Karamazov Boston Public Gender role Lupin III Jealousy 2003 Invasion of Iraq Procrastination Columbine High School massacre Anger Capital accumulation Risk
