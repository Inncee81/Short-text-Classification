if someone has blocked your incoming call what would it sound like for me i have someone that iam trying to reach and everytime i call it either goes straight to voicemail or it has a half of ring then goes straight to voicemail i am wondering if they have restricted my calls and if so does dialing override their restriction it doesnt matter if they have my information my other question is i was able to leave a messege on their voicemail through calling my voicemail and putting it in as a mailbox number it was sent successfully but half an hour later it said that their voicemailbox was full iam wondering can this mesege of telling me its full not actually be true and this it is indeed a form of restriction from my number if your number has been restricted you will get a message that says the person you are calling will not accept calls from your number generally cell phone numbers cannot be blocked if you are going straight to voice mail or getting half a ring then voice mail more than likely they have they phone turned off if you received a message that said the box is full it is exactly that so many people have left messages and the person receiving them has not checked their voice mail to free up the space hope this helped GSM services UK telephone numbering plan Telephone numbering plan Call centre E-mail Virgin Mobile Skype Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Gmail Vertical service code Private branch exchange Caller ID United Airlines Flight 93 Social rule Voice over IP Phonetic (service) North American Numbering Plan Short message service Telephone exchange E-mail spam Poker jargon United States Postal Service Telephone FidoNet Modem Telephone number Musical Instrument Digital Interface Twelve Monkeys Telephone tapping Internet fraud Stopping e-mail abuse Morse Code Canadian federal election, 1993 Mail Internet Crossword Speech synthesis Volleyball United States House of Representatives Tag IP Multimedia Subsystem Canadian Senate Network Switching Subsystem Sudoku Yahoo!
