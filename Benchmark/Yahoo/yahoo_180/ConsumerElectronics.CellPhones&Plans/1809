does anybody have a virgin mobile switch back i am getting one tomarrow if i pass my drivers test and get my learners permit i need to know all the pros and cons of this phone probably one of the best web browsing experience you can get with a prepaid phone check your myspace on the go embeded with aim so you can keep up with your friends on the go qwerty keypad makes texting web browsing and iming a lot easier an above average quality camera games can be played at faster speeds compared to other virgin phones sleek black and silver look with illuminating blue keypads small comfertable and not as bulky as the sidekick ii makes a cool bleeping sound when you flip the phone up and down pretty cool tools such as stopwatch calender calculator even a friggin flashlight that uses the camera's led flash lol trust me it came in handy the keypad is pretty small so you may have to look a lot when you type and use your fingernails somtimes when aim has not been used in a couple hours or so and you get an im from sombody aim will automaticly log you out causing you to loose the im you recieved which can really be a pain in the ass for some wierd reason it loads not even half of your buddy list though this may have one of the best web browsing on a prepaid phone its still not perfect some sites may become pretty jumbled up or have you do a lot of scrolling to get to where you want if its a large page such as sombody's profile with a lot of stuff in it but it doesn't cause too much of a nuesance just like any other virgin phone if you plan on going out into the boonies forget it you would catch hell trying to get a signal the battery life has a lifespan of a housefly make sure you charge this phone up everynight or everytime it isn't in use because the battery can go out in a days time if you use it to surf the web or text or im phone feels kind of wierd talking through since its a little bulky from the front the friggin keyguard which is about useless this is my biggest complaint about the phone you may put it on when you stick in your pocket thinking it'll be safe but once you start doing a lot of moving the button combonation could still be unlocked causing you to accidently push all of your buttons and messing things up like making calls to bogus numbers like or making a new contact i have about contacts accidently made i hope they can find a better feature to prevent this maybe a real hold switch like what the ipod has or the psp if you use this as a myspace go kinda thing just remeber that you can't reply or send messeges or anything with it for some wierd reason when you submit your messege or comment it takes you to the myspace search page i guess the search button's links get caught up with the submit ones i hope that gets fixed though i wish the camera flash was stronger though conclusion all in all this is a very good phone that does have its flaws its really addicting texting surfing the web and checking your myspace iming your buddies and what not it has the great virgin phone services included too and if you sign up from today till june th you'll get aim for free for a month then you gotta pay a month after that so in conclusion if you're looking for a good sidekick ii alternative and don't want to dish out over and mess around with contracts then this phone is definatly for you i always wanted a phone that has the features as the sidekick but cheaper and here it is even though it does has it flaws you still won't be completly disapointed in it Virgin Mobile Mouse (computing) Gmail Danger Hiptop IPod Poker jargon
