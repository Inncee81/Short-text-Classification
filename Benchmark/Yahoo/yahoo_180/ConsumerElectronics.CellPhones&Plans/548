do you like verizon wireless i just ordered a cell phone from verizon switching my current provider are they as great as they say they are i have had their service since about late early before they were even verizon i had gte mobilenet and i haven't had one problem with their service the only problem i've experienced recently was when my daughters month old lg cherry chocolate became possessed started dialing on it's on scrolled through different features on its own etc verizon's policy under the year warranty was to provide me with a refurbish phone which in my opinion was total b s since the phone was purchased new at almost and it was only months old couldn't get them to budge with it i took it upon myself to contact lg directly lg said they would fix it when it was sent back fixed i asked what the problem was and they said the keypad was defective once i activated the phone again i found out from verizon that it was a completely different serial number from what we had purchased come to find out lg gave us a brand new phone as that is what verizon figured out through the serial number it pays to go direct but with that said that is the only complaint i have ever had with verizon their service is great customer service is great phones are great large variety network is great i can't say enough good things about them and their insurance plan isn't bad either a month and you pay a deductible for another phone if your phone is lost stolen damage destroyed etc and you can do this no more than twice in a or month period my friend bought his wife daughter each a samsung slider phone through cingular when it was still cingular now it's at t i think they have some sort of identity crisis and they would not provide insurance for this model of phone verizon does not discriminate against the phones you can purchase insurance for any and all new phones as long as it is done within the first days of purchasing the phone good luck and i hope you enjoy your new phone verizon Verizon Wireless Verizon Communications Sprint Nextel Corporation BlackBerry Vodafone Cingular Wireless Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act UK telephone numbering plan T-Mobile 9-1-1 Telephone numbering plan GSM services North American Numbering Plan Virgin Mobile Push to talk Auto insurance Advanced Mobile Phone System Telephone Insurance Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Emergency telephone number Mobile phone Toll-free telephone number Telephone booth Directory assistance Global System for Mobile Communications SBC Communications AT&T Surveillance Private branch exchange Vertical service code Ocean's Twelve Wal-Mart Warranty Telephone exchange Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Speech recognition Modem IP Multimedia Subsystem Phone sex Tesco Data retention Annuity Phreaking Network Switching Subsystem International Mobile Subscriber Identity Telephone company CDMA2000 Automatic teller machine Voice over IP Electronic commerce Universal Serial Bus Broadband Internet access Treo 650 Hard disk Area code 703 Mergers and acquisitions Evolution Data Only The Amazing Race Life insurance Bluetooth Gmail Internet fraud 2003 North America blackout Heinkel He 112 Wheel of Fortune AT&T Wireless Citigroup NorthwesTel Telstra Q-Telecom Digital photography W-CDMA Social rule Great Depression Microeconomics Credit card Cable television Treo Direct marketing Digital AMPS United Kingdom corporation tax Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?
