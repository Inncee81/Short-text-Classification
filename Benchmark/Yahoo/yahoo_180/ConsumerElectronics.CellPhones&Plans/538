is there anyway to store phone numbers to my sim card without doing it individually i have a razr with at t and i'm trying to store my phone numbers to my sim card the phone is breaking and i got it on for a few minutes and i don't think it will stay on long enough to do each individually anyone know how to do a mass transfer to my sim yes you can copy all to your sim with the razr you have to access your address book by going to menu and then address book you cannot do it by simply pressing the down button because that just skips right to the phone numbers by going to menu first and then address book you will be able to scroll down to the option that says copy then choose copy all to sim if it asks you to merge or overwrite choose merge that's it Danger Hiptop IPod The Sims 2 Gmail Windows XP Telephone tapping Global System for Mobile Communications Windows 2000 AmigaOS Bluetooth Emergency telephone number GSM services Gramophone record Verizon Wireless Smart card Network Switching Subsystem Nintendo DS Secure Digital card Subscriber Identity Module Password Screenshot The Sims 2: University PDP-8 ITunes E-mail Option key Floppy disk The Amazing Race ITunes Music Store System/34 Super Mario Bros. 3 Hash table PlayStation Portable Address book The Sims Virgin Mobile Beatmania IIDX System 7 (Macintosh) System/36 Octopus card Mac OS X v10.4 N-Gage Identity theft Pie menu Palm OS The Inside Data retention MetroCard Fischer Random Chess Mouse (computing) Pok__mon Ruby and Sapphire DVD Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Surveillance CPU cache Computer Address Book (software) Winning Streak Associative array Revision control Digital rights management Final Fantasy (video game) Australian electoral system Computer virus IBM PC keyboard MSN Messenger Wi-Fi Enterprise content management Walkman Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Microsoft Windows Linux Spam (electronic) ZX Spectrum Internet fraud Copy protection Telephone numbering plan Digital photography Common User Access Flat file database Medical prescription Phreaking Dance Dance Revolution History of computer and video games Pump It Up NTFS Payphone Q-Telecom Whois Apollo Guidance Computer DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Commodore 64 Plame affair MapleStory Windows Mobile HTML element Poker jargon Filling station Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Windows Vista
