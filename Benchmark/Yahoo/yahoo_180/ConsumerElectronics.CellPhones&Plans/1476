i just got a sidekick and i dont wanna switch to t mobile is there any way i can keep the phone and stay with sprint i currently have a palm treo you should have done your research before you bought it you can't use a sidekick with sprint or any other cdma carrier sprint's phones and network are cdma which doesn't use sim cards the sidekick is a gsm phone which requires a sim card in order to work they are two completely different technologies and are not compatible with each other if you want to use the sidekick you'll have to switch to t mobile as it is only for t mobile one person mentioned cingular but the problem with that is you would have to get it unlocked and that is very hard to do t mobile can't even get an unlock code for the sidekicks even if you managed to get it unlocked it is pointless to use it with a different gsm carrier since the data servers the sidekicks use are only accessible through t mobile Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Verizon Wireless Treo 650 Code division multiple access W-CDMA Telephone tapping Mobile phone Cellular network Telephone numbering plan T-Mobile Sprint Nextel Corporation Smartphone Bluetooth Network Switching Subsystem Vodafone Treo General Packet Radio Service Push to talk Advanced Mobile Phone System Cingular Wireless Danger Hiptop Wireless network International Mobile Subscriber Identity Voice over IP Virgin Mobile GSM services Evolution Data Only Wireless Application Protocol Global Positioning System Computer network N-Gage Radio clock Surveillance AT&T 3G Wi-Fi Emergency telephone number Tungsten Handheld Mobility management Short message service International Mobile Equipment Identity IP Multimedia Subsystem Linux Handspring IS-95 Modem Smart card 9-1-1 Telephone Palm OS Subscriber Identity Module Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Q-Telecom Nordic Mobile Telephone The Sims 2 Digital AMPS Nokia Windows XP Federal Standard 1037C GPRS Core Network Treo 600 Internet Mobile phone radiation and health Speech recognition Skype Speech encoding Flash memory Battlefield 2 Multimedia Messaging System Turkcell Secure Digital card Windows 2000 High-Speed Circuit-Switched Data GSM frequency ranges IEEE 802.11 Electronic commerce Symbian OS Hard disk The Sims 2: University WiDEN Telstra Telephone exchange Computer Telecom New Zealand Password Radiolocation Personal digital assistant Borland Research In Motion Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing Data retention 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Digital rights management Radio Base Station Subsystem
