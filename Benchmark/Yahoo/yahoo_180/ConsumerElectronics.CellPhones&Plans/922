is there anyway to delete the locked pictures and ringtones on my phone i have a razr through centennial and all the wallpaper and ringtones that came with it our locked anyway to get rid of them yup but it probably isn't easy it depends on the phone and how the data is locked but either they are write protected or they are on a read only chip so either you would have to get a os that can change file permissions for the phone or change the chip or you could try to change the data that reads the ringtone that is so that the data the chip sends is reinterpreted somehow by the replacement os Virgin Mobile Musical Instrument Digital Interface Ring tone CPU cache Read-only memory Virtual memory Bluetooth Verizon Wireless HP BASIC for OpenVMS Short message service Trusted computing Mobile phone Wireless Application Protocol Flash memory Gmail Modchip Surveillance Floppy disk Memory (computers) Windows 2000 Vodafone Japan RISC PlayStation Portable Password MDAC CPU design Btrieve Computer Microsoft Jet Database Engine Embedded system Backup Mach kernel Billboard magazine Copy protection Original Amiga chipset Enterprise content management Morse Code Computer wallpaper USB flash drive Digital rights management Telephone tapping Super Nintendo Entertainment System Secure Digital card Commodore DOS Malware File Allocation Table Atari 8-bit family Danger Hiptop Redundant array of independent disks Integrated circuit Read-copy-update System/36 IPod System/34 Digital photography FidoNet Octopus card Commodore 64 Files-11 Dynamic random access memory Computer security Cache Burroughs B5000 Commodore 128 NSA encryption systems Chmod Data retention Linked list Buffer overflow E-mail Autostereogram Blog File system Modem Computer storage Apple II family Everything2 C programming language Telephone Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Code division multiple access Forth programming language Pretty Good Privacy Telephone numbering plan Digital camera Global System for Mobile Communications PaX Java programming language Hash table Lock (computer science) Debugging British national identity card Sweety the Chick Pirate decryption X86 assembly language File system permissions Panama Canal MAME Poker jargon Smart card
