good mobile phone nokia navigator is this a good phone besides the gps i know about the gps is there anything else good about it if you don't like this phone can you reccommend another nokia navigator bad wrong design the volume camera and my own key buttons are wrongly designed and therefore hard to use manipulate the same goes for the keyboard's buttons that could be bigger if the slider opened a little bit more sliding the front cover to access the keyboard normally turns the gps on because your fingers slide and hit that button plastic of bad quality not good to touch gets greasy with fingertips or face's moisture not fancy at all the same goes for the display celular antenna bad placed it gets covered by your hand when you hold the phone blocking the signal bad wrong firmware software engineering you should be able to enter the navigator program without activating the gps receiver battery discharge time would improve greatly while setting up a route consulting maps changing navigator's settings etc it should be possible to hear navigational instructions through the phone's loudspeakers while talking on the phone by bluetooth you need to drive with bluetooth switched on so you can legally answer a call while driving in my country at least but this way you have to carry your bluetooth device in your ear all the time to hear the gps's tutoring it's not practical or safe to activate deactivate the blutooth and connected bluetooth device everytime you want to answer make a call you should be able to activate more then one map simultaneously with the delivered in maps it isn't if not how do you plan a trip from france to germany or hear the instructions nokia or route forgot about the people that leave near another country when chosing navigator navigate contacts locate for a correct portuguese address like this r do chafariz dto street door number floor you receive the message no search results please check your text string if the address is incomplete like this r do chafariz which means no floor information useless address from a database point of view everything works as supposed anyone has a solution already crashes symbian os problem in days to restart the phone you need to take the battery out most of the time it is happening with some consistency when i don't use it for quite a time hours and then receive or make a call case aparently everything is working except for the sound to have it working again you turn it off and on reboot and it gets back to normal case the phone gets totally stucked no way back through menus no reaction to keyboard input nothing so the only thing you can do is to take out the battery and restart reboot again so it gets back to normal improving firmware software engineering route should improve its maping and route calculation at least for the iberia and uk maps the provided information and algorithm route calculation planing is most of the time dead wrong or a bad choice to say the least route still has a long way to go you could use the phone's inboard gps receiver to gather satellite information to different software hardware applications many users would find many uses for lots of applications and devices battery capacity is to small for this phone's consumption specially while navigating please improve its capacity after all this is nokia's navigator other major flaws route was not the best choice except for the graphics tomtom's symbian navigation software maps are miles ahead in speed of calculation and accuracy of route planing Computer IPod Tungsten Handheld GSM services Modem Amstrad CPC Redundant array of independent disks N-Gage Opera (web browser) Musical Instrument Digital Interface CPU cache IBM PC compatible Atari 8-bit family PlayStation Portable Password CPU design AmigaOS System/36 Digital circuit Floppy disk Universal Serial Bus ZX Spectrum Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Geographic information system Palm OS Central processing unit Hard disk Apollo Guidance Computer Morse Code Danger Hiptop Windows XP Voice over IP Poker jargon PlayStation 3 Mach kernel Enterprise content management X Window System Verizon Wireless Oscilloscope Debugging History of the graphical user interface Slide rule Telephone tapping Expert system IPAQ Software testing Calculator Cheating in Counter-Strike Smartphone Telephone exchange Search engine optimization DVD Volleyball Database management system Hearing aid Domain Name System Apple Newton Copy protection Nintendo DS Social rule Booting Extreme Programming Computer software Database ZigBee Wi-Fi Commodore 128 Beatmania IIDX Speech recognition Surveillance Hash table Linux Automatic number plate recognition B-47 Stratojet Screenshot USB flash drive Navigation Battery (electricity) Pump It Up Thread (computer science) 9-1-1 Synthesizer TGV Avalanche Airbus A380
