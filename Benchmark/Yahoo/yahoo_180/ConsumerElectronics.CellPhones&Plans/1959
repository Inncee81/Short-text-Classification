need info about the old lg cherry chocolate hi i need some help for my cell phone choice the old lg cherry chocolate is it worth getting what problems have u had and why do u think it happened i don't want to waste money this is my first phone and is it a good choice thanx my daughter has this phone and yes it is sensative but you can adjust the sensativity she is a teenager very hard on things including phones and so far it has been pretty durable and has withstood the droppings bumps bangs in a backpack from binders books etc the only problem that it had was after months it would dial on its own when you pushed the slider up it would scroll through the various functions on its own come to find out it had a defective keypad once in a while things slip through the cracks and the quality control quality assurance departments do not catch it trust me i worked for a manufacturing company and saw this happen every now and then verizon wasn't too helpful on this matter as the phone was months old and all they wanted to do was send us a refurbished phone lg however had me send it in to be fixed they said they replaced the keypad and got the sand out of the phone not sure how that happened guess i should ask my daughter lol and they sent it back come to find out they gave us a brand spankin' new phone all done at no charge like i said it was ony months old when all this started happening so it was still under the manufacturers year warranty purchasing insurace at a month is also worth it but since the phone replacement by lg she has had no problems whatsoever it works great gets great reception etc it even reads her mb mini sd card the new chocolates can read a mb mini sd card and there are a few other features as well if this is the phone you want i would say get it if you don't like it you can always return it for another phone in my town there is an independent verizon reseller they don't call themselves verizon but they are an authorized verizon dealer and they don't sell anything but verizon and they have a day return policy when i purchased a phone through verizon online they also had a return policy i can't remember if it was days or days but either way they told me if i didn't like the phone i can return it as long as it was within their return time and i did return it and got a full refund of my money so go ahead and test drive the cherry chocolate if you want to and like i said you can adjust the sensativity level it's pretty durable good luck IPod Poker jargon The Amazing Race Vodafone Nintendo 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Bluetooth UK telephone numbering plan Verizon Communications Atari 8-bit family Atari ST Sprint Nextel Corporation Telephone Konica Minolta Internet fraud 2000 Australian Grand Prix BlackBerry Telephone booth Password Ocean's Twelve Warranty Telephone numbering plan ZX Spectrum Digital photography Monopoly (game) Pretty Good Privacy Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Virgin Mobile Intellivision IBM PC compatible Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Mobile phone Social rule Gramophone record Plastic Mattress Public-key cryptography EastEnders Microeconomics Emergency telephone number Credit card RuneScape quests Modem Universal Serial Bus R.
