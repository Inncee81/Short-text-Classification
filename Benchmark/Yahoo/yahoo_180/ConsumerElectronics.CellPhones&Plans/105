if everyone in the house has a cell phone is a house phone even necessary the answer is it depends on your personal level of comfort and security you may find that you get a great cell phone signal at your house and you don't really ever need a different phone however if you have kids or famiy that depend on you and or if you live in an area that is prone to any type of disaster you may want to have a land line for safety purposes consider that during a disaster natural or otherwise cell phone towers may be down or overworked leaving you unable to make a phone call land lines for phones on the other hand are often underground and may be less susceptible to disaster disruption although of course the lines can still become overcrowded during an emergency also if you are trapped in your house say during a storm without power your cell phone battery may eventually go dead but your land line may still work just fine so you may want to consider keeping a land line as a potential alternate phone line during an emergency if you do so also consider getting a corded rather than cordless phone for this purpose an old style corded phone you can get one for under will work even if the power is out unlike a cordless because the phone company actually sends a small amount of power through the phone line that makes your phone work you don't have to keep the corded phone hooked to the line all the time you can have a cordless phone on the line and keep the corded phone around just in case good luck Telephone Mobile phone Surveillance Bluetooth Cellular network Cordless telephone Battery (electricity) Voice over IP Telephone tapping Toll-free telephone number Telephone exchange Air traffic control Energy development Code division multiple access Social rule Mouse (computing) Insurance Radio Mobile phone radiation and health Global System for Mobile Communications Nickel-cadmium battery Leukemia Cancer GSM services Liquid crystal display Lawn mower Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Drowning Burglar alarm Foodborne illness Call for help Protoss Amateur radio Modem Universal Serial Bus Spinal cord Transmitter Microeconomics The Five Doctors Rail transport Disaster Telephone numbering plan Traumatic brain injury 2003 North America blackout Short message service Electrophysiology Solar car Natural disaster Broadband Internet access Emergency preparedness Craps Diode Parachute Citizens' band radio Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications Gravity 7 July 2005 London bombings Phreaking Air-raid shelter Ironing Autonomous building Communication during the September 11, 2001 attacks Telephone booth Cruising (maritime) Headphones Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Ultra high frequency Geomagnetic storm Flood Jack plug Action potential Domestic AC power plugs and sockets BlackBerry The Suffering (game) Traffic light Fuel cell Solar cell Thermal power station Drill Third rail Insulin Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) Donald Neilson Naruto jutsu Bicycle lighting Decompression sickness Armored Core Storm surge Urinary incontinence Capitalism Menstrual cup National Weather Service Ocean's Twelve Renewable energy 9/11 conspiracy theories Stem cell Hamster
