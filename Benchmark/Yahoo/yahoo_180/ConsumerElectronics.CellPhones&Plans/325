buying a sidekick or on ebay basically what im asking is if the phone will work with my current plan from tmobile even thought they say you need to buy the unlimited package with the sidekick i can't afford that right now since i don't have a job yet so i just want to use it with my current plan i don't want to have to try and get through tmobile while i'm buying it and them saying oh you can't have it if you dont pay for the unlimited so i wanted to buy a used one off ebay to avoid that and for the cheaper price is that possible yes it will work but you will not be able to text im or surf the internet which really defeats the whole purpose of the phone which has a qwerty keypad right all you will basically be able to do is call and listen to the mp player which only holds songs if you dont buy a memory card for it warning i suggest you not use ebay to buy this phone not downing ebay becuase i use it a lot but i have a sidekick and things have gone wrong with it and i've been able to call t mobile everytime a problem occured and get a new one as long as i returned the old one the reason i ve been able to do that is because i bought it from a t mobile authorized dealer well ebay is not an authorized dealer and if something goes wrong with the phone guess who you cant call to get a new one t mobile you will be stuck without one and quite frankly the phone is great but it freezes camera stops working etc and u want to be covered get it through t mobile honey or you will have a major loss Mobile phone Neopets Surveillance Live 8 Short message service Microeconomics Internet fraud Poker jargon Virgin Mobile Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?
