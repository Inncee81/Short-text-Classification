what if you peel of the water damge sticker from your cell phone because it was damaged if you were to show up with a razr at a verizon store because its only working on and off lately but you just peeled off that red sticker because you know with it there you cant get any thing from them so instead of there being a red sticker or a white sticker there just isn't a sticker there at all under where the sticker was is just a white spot now would this possibly work what angle would you take when they inquire about it not know anything about there ever being a sticker say that you guess it came off any advice would be appreciated and it's too late to dry the phone its just been a gradual thing and now it's hardly even working thanks in advance for all your help btw this is a verizon phone for a verizon store i'd say to peel it off either way because if its there then you know your not getting anything anyway after you peel it off go to them and show them it say its gradually stopped working and explain why say like it started having problems turning on or whatever and then when they do find that the sticker is gone say 'i have no idea i never even knew that that thing was there or you could say i have no idea what thing your talking about and i can assure you that im certain that its never gotten wet' but dont say anything about it getting wet until they ask or they will know that you knew that the sticker was there for when it gets wet the worst that can come from that is they say no im sorry without the sticker we cant give you a new one but if you do leave it there then you know they arent going to take it so theres no harm in trying to bluff it out Verizon Wireless The Inside Calvin and Hobbes Plame affair Ron and Fez Battery (electricity) Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Opportunity rover Shaggy dog story Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Fire fighting Mobile phone Robert Peel Theodicy Sprint Nextel Corporation The Suffering (game) German car number plates N-Gage Social rule Apple Francis Crick Opie and Anthony Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma The Jim Rome Show Badly Drawn Kitties 2003 North America blackout Where's Wally?
