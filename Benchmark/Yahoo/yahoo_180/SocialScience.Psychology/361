why are die hard fans of something never happy with the thing they love awful title but what ever i have noticed that people who are really into something be it a movie a band a tv show what have you are never happy with anything that is with it recently such as any time a band releases a new album the die hard fans always hate it any time a tv show starts a new season the die hard fans always hate it a specific example the simpsons movie the die hard fans hate it but i bet they will be the first in line to buy it on dvd but then a few years pass and suddenly the things they once hated now are classics albums movies seasons from a tv show all become the good old days while everything new is trash why is that that should be has to do with it recently i should proof read these things dunno man i've been a die hard simpsons fan since i was and i saw the movie on opening day and loved it i guess people always set their expectations way too high video games my personal favorite leisure time activity is a prime example more specifically the grand theft auto games the medias favorite whipping boy gta came out and everyone loved it gta vice city came out and most fans of were impressed after all it offered so much more two islands to explore times as many weapons motorcycles and helicopters it was great gta san andreas came out and a good bit of the fanbase was happy an rpg like stat system and even more room to play around with gta coming out this october the expectations are overwhelming if the new version doesn't have approximately times the area of the previous game totally new sets of weapons hours of gameplay and a whole plethora of new vehicles then gamers everywhere will be outraged because it's the same game with better graphics people always want more whether it can be delivered or not maybe i could've done without the rant but at least it's a decent example Grand Theft Auto (series) Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories Grand Theft Auto (game) Rockstar North First-person shooter Xbox Hot Coffee mod Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles PlayStation Portable Computer and video games Grand Theft Auto Advance Claude Speed 50 Cent Grand Theft Auto 2 Nine Inch Nails "Weird Al" Yankovic Rush (band) Final Fantasy Computer role-playing game Def Leppard Chicago (band) Final Fantasy VI Paul W.
