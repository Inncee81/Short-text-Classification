help i accidentally ran over a stray cat and killed it i had no idea it was hiding under my car and when i backed out of my driveway i hit it the poor little thing never made a noise but twitched something awful for about seconds and i can't get the picture out of my head i can't stop crying what can i do thanks for all the words of comfort so far the kitten was a stray and we already have too many pets so we couldn't keep it too but we let it stay around because a friend of ours said he might take it i wish he had come and gotten it sooner the weather is so hot here we felt we should bury the kitten right away and i never thought to check for a microchip and my daughter volunteers at the shelter and it still didn't occur to either of us to do that why didn't i think of that the first day we found it darn you poor thing i am so sorry this happened to you it sounds like the little kitty did not suffer the fact that the cat did not move when you started up the car tells me that the cat may have already been sick injured or dying animals often ingest anti freeze and get sick and die you may have put it out of it's misery i am a great animal lover and even i know that we are not going to be able to check under our cars every time we get in to make sure no one is under there it just wasn't your fault i nicked a raccoon once who ran out in front of me and last year almost ran into a squirrel i know both times i was upset for quite awhile again it sounds like it went very quickly please don't blame yourself release the little kitty to heaven and ask for some kind of message from the universe to help you understand take care roc Cat Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Time Out of Mind Shaggy dog story Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Pitaten Knots Landing The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Friends The Amber Spyglass EastEnders Sin City 2000 Australian Grand Prix One Tree Hill (TV series) Scenes from a Memory Father's Day (Doctor Who) Grandview, U.S.A.
