what can i do to change my attitude towards women what do i do to make an about face as to how i see women all my life i have seen all women as being made of sugar and spice and everything nice but now that i am middle age i have this feeling that i should change this way of seeing women but how do i do that any suggestions some are good and some are not some aren't pretty some are hot some are selfish some are kind some think of others and treat them as they would want to be treated some don't think at all women are just people who are assembled differently than men treat a woman as a friend don't think its a woman so i have to adjust who i am or what i feel being yourself will make the relationship much easier if it becomes a relationship if it doesn't so what at least you'll know you didn't disguise who you really were in order to gain her attention because if you do that the relationship's main ingredient becomes stress and that becomes tiresome and will eventually lead to failure my suggestion is to relax and not think so hard about how to interpret them take them at face value while paying attention for consistency in their behavior and opinions let yourself be seen for who you are and find someone who can be comfortable doing the same Theory of conduct Gender role Humphrey Bogart Ex-gay Women in Islam Fecal incontinence Domestic violence Alignment (role-playing games) Friends The Critic Homophobia Procrastination Evil Boston Public Rum Aesthetic Realism Abortion EastEnders Anal sex God Emperor of Dune Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Social rule Strap-on dildo Milton H.
