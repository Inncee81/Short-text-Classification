help i'm so homesick i've lived in the u s since i was a kid but during the summer i went to burma in asia where my whole family and roots are i stayed there for months and i've never been happier unlike the u s i didn't feel presured to be something else i was just me and got to stay in the house i was born in sit on the swing i got for ny nd b day met the people who supported me to study abroad and spend time with my cuzs who are now the best friends i've ever had i miss everything and i really really miss my big family everything i hear and see reminds me of burma i have'nt stopped crying and can't eat or sleep what can i do the emotions you feel are understandable it is not easy to be away from the people and places you love the first step is to recognize that while that is how you feel right now not eating and sleeping does not change anything more likely fatigue and unhappiness will makes things even more unbearable when can you go back is that a goal you can set for yourself while you determine that you need to get into a routine to keep yourself occupied and functioning that means keeping busy getting out with friends expanding your social circles and finding things to love here because the reality of it is you are here at this moment suffering because you are not somewhere else does not change that reality it just makes it more intolerable so find what there is to love about being here focus your energy on that and getting on with your life start to look at what it would take to get back to burma and reconnect good luck The Amber Spyglass Jon Secada Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Pitaten Leo Wyatt Social rule The Time Machine EastEnders About a Boy Aerial (dance move) Shaggy dog story Kodocha Avenue Q Miss Saigon Emo A Course In Miracles One Tree Hill (TV series) Happiness Lucid dreaming Knots Landing Sleeping Murder The Contender (television series) Oh My Goddess!
