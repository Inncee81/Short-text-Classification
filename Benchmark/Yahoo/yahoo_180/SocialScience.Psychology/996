what should i write from a military wife i work from pm to am i want to change my hours to pm till pm the reason being is because i get depressed when everyones sleeping and im awake and vice versa my husband is over in iraq and im feeling alone but my boss will not take that for a valid reason i want to write her a letter stating why if that doesnt work im going to my doctor how do you think i should word it give her work related reasons why it would be beneficial for you to work the early shift explain things in a tune she can understand business will you be more productive in those early hours because you won't be feeling as badly would you be better at communicating with co workers because you will have a more positive outlook resulting in a pleasant work environment which helps increase productivity if there still isn't a place for you in the earlier shift it might be time to look for something that does accomodate your schedule so that you aren't as miserable as you seem to be also talk to your doctor about whether you are suffering from a mild depression brought on by your husband's absence understand that employers hear all kinds of stories about what employees need but sometimes just putting it in a less personal light and helping her understand where she company can benefit from you working at your maximum potential may be enough to open the door to a dialogue about what works for both of you good luck Clinical depression Labour economics Daylight saving time Insurance Capitalism Microeconomics Hearing impairment Humphrey Bogart Bipolar disorder Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Transactional analysis Economy of the United States Sleep Theory of conduct Magical thinking Prostate cancer Traumatic brain injury Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Labor theory of value The Shining (film) Surplus value Reaganomics Keynesian economics Anorexia nervosa Strategic management Inflation Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Principal-agent problem Ra (board game) Narcolepsy Chronic fatigue syndrome Extreme Programming Phoebe Halliwell Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Psychosis Reiki U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Religion Plame affair Sant Thakar Singh Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Unemployment benefit EastEnders Shaggy dog story Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown) Autism Dyslexia Contract Philosophical skepticism Socrates Philosophy of space and time Past teachings of Prem Rawat Cyberspace Economic history of Japan Sydney Riot of 1879 Methamphetamine Days of our Lives Asperger syndrome Poker jargon Productive and unproductive labour Empathy Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Free trade Dualism (philosophy of mind) Marshall McLuhan Pitaten One (Voyager episode) Another Side of Bob Dylan New Deal Technocratic movement Altruism Social psychology Public good Peter Singer Supply and demand Aristotle Sexual orientation Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Social rule Obsessive-compulsive disorder Customer relationship management United States Postal Service Current teachings of Prem Rawat Singlish Ten Commandments Externality Aesthetic Realism Fiddler on the Roof Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Trade union Lucid dreaming Simone Weil Fibromyalgia About a Boy Sweatshop Objectivist philosophy
