help me please before you get judgemental please hear me out last night i had a vision that me and my dad were in a horrible car accident he died on the scene and i survived and i woke up in the intensive care unit i was in a coma for months and my crush was waiting for me he said he was happy his girlfriend was safe then i asked about my dad and all he said was he didn't then i start crying bith in real life and in the vision then it stops and i'm drenched in tears laying on my bed no this was not a dream i was awke and fully aware of what was going on around me and yet i was fully there inside this vision what do you think this means do you think it'll really happen should i tell anyone or get help my dad was driving i can't legally yet visions such as you describe usually happen just before going to sleep or upon waking so they are sort of like awake dreams the reason they happen at the time they do is that the conscious boundaries are loosened we don't have our conscious guards up and dreams or visions that resemble dreams can happen in that space you didn't say how old you are but i'm guessing you are an adolescent adolescence is a time when individuals are emotionally separating from parents making new and deeper friends outside of the family and discovering who they are in the process of all of this death is the ultimate separation of course and my guess would be that this is what your dream is about not real death but separation it's interesting that you spent two months in a coma deeply affected by the separation yourself your new partner was there when you awoke and the tears yes separations are difficult even when you're taking on a new and wonderful stage of your life in a hugely exaggerated way if you suspect that your dad will have a hard time separating in the way that you need to one solution is to have him killed noooo not really it's all metaphoric remember then he will let you go you might be interested in learning about lucid dreaming which it sounds like you're capable of ck it out on wikipedia or somewhere ps don't worry about your dreams visions coming true they are not prophetic it's important metaphorically but that's all and when it seems like a dream came true by coincidental results the dream did not cause the event so relax and enjoy your powerful dreams and let them help you know your unconscious it's a great gift if you're interested in other teen topics you might like my website www tandemjourney org l on Out-of-body experience Dream Lucid dreaming One Tree Hill (TV series) Social rule Scenes from a Memory Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Jon Secada Consciousness Shaggy dog story Traumatic brain injury Futurama (TV series - season 5) Philosophical skepticism God Emperor of Dune Milton H.
