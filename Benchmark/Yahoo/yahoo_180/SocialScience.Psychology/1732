wife in love with jesus when i tell my wife i have always adored you she replies i know you have and you want me to adore you too well you're the most wonderful husband in the world but i can't adore you because i adore jesus then she gets all teary eyed and looks to heaven and starts talking about her love for jesus etc she also says stuff like i love you but i love jesus more and when it comes to material possesions all of which i have brought home as the only bread winner in the family she calls them blessings from jesus i know it sounds petty but it's hard to have your spouce telling you she loves another guy more than you and giving him credit for your work especially when that other guy is god why do so many people personify god and then set him as a rival to their spouce god is not a human being god is not one of us god is not the cute guy down the block anyone else have this problem great answers here on both sides of the isle thanks she doesn't say she doesn't love me she just puts all love on the same sliding scale and she injects it at the worst time i've become conditioned to not seek any emotional support from her because that's when she gets into this overall the relationship would seem great but there's no honest emotional connection with someone who views you as her temporary husband until jesus returns her whole church and family is this way and slowly getting worse over the years i'm the outsider which also feels weird years but i was too busy working to pay the bills to notice how deep this all ran i feel like while i was working she developed a life that put me on the outside and the only way in is to be one of them like joining the body snatchers now i'm in my 's and retired early to enjoy life and she wants to sit home and go to church i can't believe you have let this go on for so long there is obviously some issue with your self esteem that you have been married to this person for so many years and have continued to provide so much for so little in return as for your wife it sounds like a well devised cop out Eastern Orthodox Church Sant Thakar Singh Avenue Q Mary, the mother of Jesus Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Justification (theology) A Course In Miracles Marriage John Howard Yoder Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Salvation Sola fide Rich Mullins Unification Church Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Church of Christ, Scientist Meaning of life Great Apostasy Soul God Friends Shaggy dog story Catholicism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Eucharist Ten Commandments Trinity The Amber Spyglass Piccolo Junior Saga Roman Catholic Church Fiddler on the Roof Babe Ruth Origin belief Polygamy Christian eschatology Anne Rice Immortality Theodicy Idolatry Philipp Melanchthon Sant Mat Time Out of Mind Opus Dei Transubstantiation Sin Miss Saigon Heaven Book of Isaiah Christian views of Jesus Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Book of Mormon Urantia Resurrection of Jesus The nature of God in Western theology EastEnders Friedrich Schleiermacher Community of Christ Holy Spirit Transactional analysis Messianic Judaism Christian anarchism Blessed Virgin Mary Narcissism Theory of conduct Bishop Summa Theologiae Evil Alan Campbell (pastor) Trimurti Maison Ikkoku John the Baptist Social rule Sabbath Criticism of Mormonism God Emperor of Dune MACHINA/The Machines of God Angel Sanctuary Sinfest Fundamentalism Adore Past teachings of Prem Rawat Rapture Baptism Israel ben Eliezer Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Human sexual behavior
