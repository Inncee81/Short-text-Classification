in anger why do the people shout loudly anger is a psychological response to any stimulus that threatens social or actual survival increased adrenaline is the body's response to anger anger can be in response to the actions or comments of an employee a boss a spouse a politician or the government et al basically any external action or comment that an individual perceives as potentially threatening causes anger that includes stupid mistakes made by the individual himself for instance hitting your thumb with a hammer forgetting to signal in traffic and thereby nearly causing an accident or even misspelling a word while typing this each stimulus represents a threat to the individual's survival even if that stimulus is created by the person himself social indoctrination replaces the natural urge to fight physically with the urge to swear or shout this is the body's reaction within socially acceptable limits we learn from experience that physical violence usually has too many negative consequences yet the body must do something with that extra adrenal energy shouting is a reasonably safe outlet for the adrenal energy produced in response to a survival situation the action of shouting releases some of the excess energy and simultaneously sends a survival message to others watch out i'm angry and have extra strength right now don't do anything to provoke me because i'm mad my body is in survival reflex mode shouting serves several purposes safely releases the extra adrenal energy produced by anger sends a warning message to others indicates an emergency urgency level to alert others so they can help or stay out of the way focuses the angry individual's mind on the source of anger just as a baby alerts its mother by crying loud vocal sounds are a natural response to any survival threatening stimulus as we mature experience and social indoctrination teach us that physical action often results in negative survival coefficients as a result shouting serves as the safety valve and survival response to anger Anger Scientology beliefs and practices Martial art Stress (medicine) Domestic violence Internet troll Social psychology A Course In Miracles Traumatic brain injury Psychosis Milton H.
