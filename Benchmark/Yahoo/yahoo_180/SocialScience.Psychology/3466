do you know those people who never show any emotion my grandfather never shows any emotion and i asked my dad if he ever got angry and my dad remembers only one time when he was or when his dad was going to spank him dont you think that there is something wrong when someone holds in all their emotions to that extreme even to the point where they dont even show exctiment about someone to me it seems selfish to a certain extent its not fair to the people around them that they cant share how they feel to the people they supposedly love its almost like you have to guess how that person is feeling let me know what you think or if im off base it just doesnt seem normal to me and i think it actually hurt my dad in the long run my dad is a lot like my grandfather in showing no emotion for the longest time i wasnt really sure if my dad love me or not he never has really said it when i was little he would come home from work and just take a nap and i wouldnt really see him no hugs no i love u's all three of my sisters have problems now and my mom even thought of divorced come to think of it my grandmother is an alcoholic so relationships arent that great when people hold in their emotions its not fair to the other person who wants to share their feelings some people see emotions as a bad thing they think people might somehow 'get inside them' or that it makes them vulnerable to display feelings to others in anyway people of older generations certainly felt this way the further forward in time you go the more freedom you see i think this is has come with both trial error and a better understanding possibly also it has come with some breakdowns in society its likely that your grandad was either brought up that way or he suffered some kind of ordeal in his life that caused him to close up many victims of any kind have different coping mechanisms Social rule Fathers' rights Fruits Basket One Tree Hill (TV series) Saved by the Bell Father's Day (Doctor Who) Pitaten Evil Intelligence quotient Futurama (TV series - season 5) Narcissism Love Polyamory Asperger syndrome Transactional analysis Happiness Charmed Vulcan (Star Trek) Neighbours Coercion Goodness and value theory Love Hina main characters Jon Secada Days of our Lives Grief Doug Domestic violence American Psycho Henry Fonda Nicomachean Ethics Dead Like Me Simone Weil Sex and the City Human sexual behavior Hollyoaks Phoebe Halliwell Babe Ruth Grandview, U.S.A.
