where the heck is the sense in life i mean a person spends his her first years learning then another years working then retires and dies am i just plain cynical or does anybody find this totally senseless it's good to think about these things what bothers me is that some people go through life without ever seeming to ask 'why ' it's not a question of despairing just simply evaluating your life so far and the time that remains there is a verse that reads 'teach us to number our days aright' so its important that we do something meaningful with our lives that will count for eternity because i believe that we are eternal beings and if you thought you were going to have a life assessment by a supreme all powerful judge jesus at the end of your life then how would you try and live Goodness and value theory Salvation A Course In Miracles Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Summa Theologiae God Justification (theology) Trinity Christian eschatology Resurrection of Jesus Holy Spirit Predestination Sin Merit Moral relativism Angel Religious Society of Friends Sola fide The nature of God in Western theology Meaning of life Godhead (Mormonism) Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Philo El (god) Evil Soul Immortality Eternal return Four Quartets Hell Al-Ghazali S__ren Kierkegaard Bhagavad Gita Supreme Court of the United States Urantia Original sin Social progress Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Endowment (Mormonism) Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Gospel of Thomas Reincarnation Athanasian Creed Abrahamic religion Qiyamah John Howard Yoder Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Force (Star Wars) Scientology beliefs and practices Book of Mormon Sant Mat Bible and reincarnation Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Presuppositional apologetics Perseverance of the saints Religion Creationism Ludwig Wittgenstein Charles Grandison Finney Theory of conduct Jewish eschatology Jewish principles of faith Immanuel Kant Son Gohan God the Father Love Current teachings of Prem Rawat Sabbath Problem of Hell Existence of God El (Canaanite god) Binitarianism Drama Nirvana Heaven Rapture Religious views of suicide Incarnations of Immortality Chosen people Confucius Martin Heidegger Past teachings of Prem Rawat Kosas Monotheism Emanuel Swedenborg Consensus decision-making Tao Te Ching Socrates Ethics Origin belief Sermon on the Mount Abortion debate Israel ben Eliezer Roman Catholic Church Theodicy Reinhold Niebuhr Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Phaedo Paul of Tarsus
