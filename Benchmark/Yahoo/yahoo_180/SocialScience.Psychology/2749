why don't the psychics on courttv's psychic detectives solve high profice murders natalee jon benet nicole natalees case was on haunting evidence but that show seems be a hoax me now there is a complete difference between psychic detectives haunting evidence psychic detectives is from the police detectives department point of view this show only highlights murder missing persons cases that were actually solved by enlisting the help of psychics i know there are real psychics out there but i wouldnt believe that show i saw natalee's show and i didnt really believe it they kinda just kept repeating everything the authorities had told them but they probobly try not to do any high profile cases becasue if it ever is solved it will be all over the news and if the psychics were wrong well then their goes the show Court TV Parapsychology Jack the Ripper Detective O.
