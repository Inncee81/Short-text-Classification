i use to be schizophrenic about my teacher in taiwan i wish someone will tell me reassuring words like forget is there a proper way to forget certain people that had an affect on my life the affect was imaginary and yet real the real part was that she talk to me a little bit the imaginary part was that i thought she was like a god to me dude if it's really doing your head in every time you hear her voice turn it to white noise and everytime you see her face imagine a picture frame around it and imagine the picture going totally white once you've done this a few times your brain will go onto auto pilot and do it automatically so after a while you won't be able to remember what she said or what she looked like the only question is before you embark on this road is it what you really want Rich Mullins Empathy Dream Philosophy of language Theory of conduct Schizophrenia Hearing impairment Ontological argument Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Autostereogram Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends Prank flash Autism Milton H.
