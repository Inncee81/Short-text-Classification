a curious question my exs mother has decorated his home and even has a key to his home comes by frequently when he is not home and she even used to do his laundry before he had a washer and dryer is this normal he is we ahre a child that is how i am affected his mom is the ruler over our child if you get my drift hi i had the very same problem but it was 'my' mother that was interfering no this isn't normal in our way of thinking but it's rather just being 'nosy' and seeing what's 'going on' then making up an excuse such as 'doing the laundry' so they don't get blamed for the other now in some cases they mean well but if she is anything like my mom it's primarily being nosy and seeing what they can find and if there's something wrong then they gripe and let you know about the problem or issue i had to let my mom know that one just doesn't come into ones house uninvited i'm sorry but that's invading ones space i told her that it's being very inconsiderate on her part i can see if your ex was having difficulties and needed some assistance but 'come on' he's yrs old i think he's old enough to take care of his own responsibilities and household chores is he the 'only child' good grief if you aren't careful his mother is going to start 'ruling the roost' and you won't have any control over your child you might need to talk to her or your ex concerning this matter it's one thing being the 'nanna' but it's another when the grandparent interferes with the parents influence over the child good luck with your situation and have a great day Fathers' rights Social rule Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Pitaten Kender Calvin and Hobbes Kodocha Cindy Sheehan Abortion debate Grief Humphrey Bogart Malcolm in the Middle Shaggy dog story Laura Schlessinger Futurama (TV series - season 2) The Critic Infantilism Milton H.
