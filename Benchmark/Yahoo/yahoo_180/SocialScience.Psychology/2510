how to forget a person who we are in love i am in love with someone but i dont know much about him and he lives far away about hours driving from my house he doesn't want to come to visit me we are friends and he told me to move over there omg i am so sad and need some advices to forget him he said he doesn't want to have gf now and he's a nice person so i will not meet someone else just to forget him first of all dont forget him you say you love him so how is it posible to forget him you cannot forget people you can loose interest in them and go ahead but what so ever you cannot forget them the moment they interact with you they make their impression in your minds and stay there forever its our mind that decides when to bring ahead the impression according to the situation and importance of a person so instead of forgetting him try to meet new people that way you will meet someone whom you can give more importance that the boy you are thinking of right now that way you will feel nice and happy hope this helps Pitaten Social rule Kodocha Friends Avenue Q W.I.T.C.H.
