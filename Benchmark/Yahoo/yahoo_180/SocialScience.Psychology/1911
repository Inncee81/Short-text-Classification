what do you know about pain suffering would you help someone to committ suicide would you inject medication to a patient to speed up the end of their life to end their suffering wow i come from a lot of different experiences of this type of question when i was my daddy took his police special revolver with his own packed bullets hollow core and after i'd been the last one to see him alive and i went and stepped into the shower to go to my new job mom was in the other room and hadn't gotten up yet to go to her job he put it to his right temple and pulled the trigger i went into shock couldn't get into the shower for months didn't make my new job that morning obviously mom didn't make it to hers for a couple of weeks gee thanks dad very hurt i also was around a dear friend in hs who had a girlfriend who falsefied and lied that she was pregnant she was not but before we all knew he felt so bad that if she had been he goes and gets his daddy's revolver goes out to the county fairgrounds in dekalb county ga at the age of and kills himself then about a year afterwards my best friend's neighbor's father walks outside in their back yard takes his best shot gun sticks it in his mouth and well you know the rest so stories of personal suicide now i worked with an older gentleman whose wife had died of cancer he didn't want to live even though he had brand new baby girl grdchild tells me in confidence that because he just found out a year after wife died that he now had cancer that i've asked my doctor to give me as much morphine as he can to send me to my wife what was i supposed to do he loved her with all his heart now next scenario i've been through the hospice training program here in richmond va if you had someone close as months away from death's door who absolutely wanted to go what would you do it's a gray area depends on legalities of each state and what if anything the family members want or if there's a dnr order do not recuscitate and if they've been revived of times or not lots of ifs ands or buts i personally would just have to be there at their side but no i couldn't in all conscience pull the trigger button on an i v god can only make that call suicide is the ultimate sin by all christian standards yes i know lots of entertainers and martyrs do it and think or don't think nobody or everybody will miss them my personal tragedy is my father never got to know his beautiful grandchildren because he was so stressed out nor his lovely little great grandson oh and one more thing my maternal grandmother was severly shrunken up we were not able to be with her in her last years but my uncle mom's brother was and ofcourse he was closest when she was near death well they took her to northside hospital in atlanta ga once and this little pr k of a doctor there decides that it would be best if we tried everything to revive her to give the family a little more time with her my mother was furious she was so small i'm ' '' and and she was my size from a very stately woman of ' down to ' and lbs she didn't even know who was in the room but by god that little twerp revived her and then we had to move her to another nursing home very sad then we were on our way down to see her and as we were on the road she died before we arrived for vacation and we ended up at a funeral the whole rainy week even wrote a painful song about it called i never said goodbye because that's what my mother said about it broke her heart so there you have my take on suicide even with all the troubles in life their suicides reinforced for me one big thing for every door that closes another one will by the grace of god open if daddy had just waited everything would have worked out and he wouldn't have had to worry about a dddddd thing mrs t chesterfield va Shaggy dog story Sin City One Tree Hill (TV series) Humphrey Bogart Kurt Cobain Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Kodocha Marilyn Monroe Charmed The Inside Tupac Shakur Days of our Lives Friends Miss Saigon Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Blood on the Tracks Pitaten Good Times Fancy Crane Fred Phelps Social rule Daredevil Neighbours Calvin and Hobbes Night (book) Rosa Parks Mother Teresa Babe Ruth Elvis Presley Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stomach cancer The Catcher in the Rye Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Phoebe Halliwell Childbirth Columbine High School massacre Jon Secada The Shining (film) Cindy Sheehan Lee Harvey Oswald One Piece minor characters Ben Johnson (athlete) Great Teacher Onizuka Blonde on Blonde Something Positive Melanie Wilkes Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina W.I.T.C.H.
