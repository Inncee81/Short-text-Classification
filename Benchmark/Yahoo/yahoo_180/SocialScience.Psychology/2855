what does it mean when this happens lately i've been getting a lot of feelings many more than usual that seem to be accurate about certain things i don't understand this but they are things that some certain people know and i couldn't have known unless i was there which i wasn't i also keep getting these religious dreams that are somewhat confusing but not bad at all what is this something else odd a bit ago i had this dream that i visited a friend of mine in the dream i was wearing this white dress and standing in her doorway i wear a t shirt and shorts to bed not a white dress but she told me that she could swear she had a dream of me standing in her doorway with that white dress i had never told her of the dream what does this kind of stuff mean and yes i've seen a doctor i thought it was mental illness but i was told all is normal what else could it be we all have the ability to pick up very subtle clues about life that sometimes get caught in our subconscious this fact accounts for your premonitions and for the fact that you and a friend had a common dream which is not that unusual for people who are close and who share common experiences if you get into a lot of detail you and your friend will discover that there were indeed many differences in the dreams you had as to the religious dreams they pretty much can be attributed to the same ability to pick up subtle signals but in individual cases the dreams take on a religious character based on experience or some sort of impact that religion may have made previously on you or those around you its all very normal but it does point to the human mind as being absolutely amazing Theory of conduct Milton H.
