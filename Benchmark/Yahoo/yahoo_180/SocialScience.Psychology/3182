mental breakdowns help please i am suffering from gad ptsd depression i have been told by my old counselor i had a mental breakdown at one point about months ago i think i might be on the brink of one i feel so totally overwhelmed stressed im really upset and cant stop crying i dont cry often i cant sleep headache omg just uhm really overwhelmed i have been taking care of my sisters very bad puppy every single day and night for weeks i have major tests and my family is talking to people from our past that they should just forget about i cant handle doing any of this anymore my tests are weeks late this dog wont listen and my family doesnt seem to understand that them talking to these people has been very bad for me i was doing better i was i feel back to square one tell me exactley what the signs and symptoms are of a mental breakdown thanks there is no such thing as a 'mental breakdown' or a 'nervous breakdown' instead psychiatrists use the term 'depressive episode' but you already know you are clinically depressed it's coming back to haunt you because it has been left untreated the longer you don't take medication for it the more frequent your depressive episodes will be and the longer their depth and duration you are screwing with your long term health as far as the tests go go to your doctor get him or her to prescribe antidepressant medication and get a future dated doctor's note stating you are too ill to take the exams as far as your nutty family is concerned perhaps you can stay with relatives in another city for awhile get out of there maybe you can take the puppy with you but i don't understand why your family has left it's care entirely to you it doesn't seem like the family is at all interested you might need to give the puppy away to a family that is willing to invest time in training and caring for it good luck Clinical depression Post-traumatic stress disorder Chronic fatigue syndrome Medicine Prostate cancer Psychosis Bipolar disorder Psychiatry Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Traumatic incident reduction Stroke Pitaten Anorexia nervosa Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Psychiatric hospital Childbirth Hypoglycemia Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Borderline personality disorder Clomipramine Antidepressant Addiction Mental Health Act 1983 EastEnders Combat stress reaction Fibromyalgia Panic attack Psychoanalysis Anxiety Multiple sclerosis Traumatic brain injury Transsexuality Electroconvulsive therapy Friends Stomach cancer The Ashlee Simpson Show Scientology beliefs and practices Social rule Schizophrenia Narcolepsy Charles Darwin's illness Dog training Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Psychopharmacology Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor Autism Kodocha Jam (TV series) Suicide Urinary incontinence Migraine LSD Procrastination Milton H.
