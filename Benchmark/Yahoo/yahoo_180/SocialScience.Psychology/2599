who are you describe yourself do you know yourself well i am fairly smart though not very logical and kind of ditzy i'm better with intuitive things such as language art understanding i mean i'm not talented the social sciences if you ask me to solve a riddle or do algebra i'll probably have a meltdown i also tend to mess things up at work due to a lack of logic i have a keen sense when it comes to emotions and the measure of a person i understand situations i've never been in fairly well and often know what emotion someone is going through before it shows on their face or leaves their lips i have a hard time getting to know people because i see so much about them in the first few minutes or few encounters i think i'm very selfish weird coming from someone who's a bit of an empath but there it is i care about what others go through but it doesn't change what i want or need and sometimes i'll completely ignore others to get it however i'll do anything for a real friend if the need is dire even if it means i don't get what i want or need i have many psychological issues going back to of course my childhood people tell me i need help or that the way i look at the world isn't right and i know it's true but i don't particularly want to be freed from these issues i'd love to lose my phobias and earn a little self esteem but there are other problems that i can't imagine living without it scares me to think of myself without them physically i'm a mess but the only way that has anything to do with who i am is how it affects my personality and psyche basically low self esteem refusal to accept compliments and it somewhat contributes to my social anxiety i could go on and on but i really don't feel like it lol suffice it to say i know my faults and my good points fairly well i'm not someone who can see the rest of the world and yet not see herself Narcissism Goodness and value theory Theory of conduct Phobia Social rule Mathematics Philosophy of language Transactional analysis Kim Possible Logic Objectivist philosophy The nature of God in Western theology Homophobia Empathy Philosophy of mathematics Economics Asperger syndrome Science Randomness Theodicy Procrastination Psychoanalysis Obsessive-compulsive disorder Psychotherapy Epistemology Neuro-linguistic programming Social psychology Ethics Karen Horney Antisocial personality disorder Soul Religion Scientific method Human Autism Carl Jung Economic inequality Altruism Sigmund Freud Prisoner's dilemma Psychology Sexual orientation Second language acquisition Franz Boas Microeconomics Happiness Friendship Humphrey Bogart Negation Scientology beliefs and practices Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Where Mathematics Comes From Enneagram Motivation Bernard Williams Alignment (role-playing games) Determinism Augustus De Morgan Transsexuality Ranma __ characters Drama Philosophical skepticism Reality Aesthetic Realism Bertrand Russell Coercion Supernatural Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Dog Lie David Hume Ontological argument Art Michel Henry The Smoking Room Borderline personality disorder Cyberspace Philosophical Investigations Stoicism Modal logic Jumpstart 3rd Grade Francis Hutcheson (philosopher) Law of value Culture Probability Polyamory Cultural relativism Panic attack Reincarnation Simone Weil Arguments for and against drug prohibition Unemployment Infantilism
