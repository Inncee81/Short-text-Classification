my child is and has down's syndrome she has been diagnosed with adhd and odd oppositionaldefiantdisorder she currently takes focalin and risperdal for her current diagnoses she has always been quite a bit to handle i will explain when something isn't right she pitches a fit wont talk to anybody throws herself around most of the time i let her pitch the fit she causes quite a scene in public but for the most part i really don't care about the fits but at home i feel like i'm walking on eggshells with her her language is at an month old level her cognitive is at a year old level she understands quite a bit it's her way or no way usually she ends up pitching a fit someone mentioned to me asperger's syndrome i'm not sure about that either she is a picky eater she has to drink pediasure and takes vitamins daily so that she can get the necessary calories each day i am at my wit's end with her her older sister has down's syndrome too and is diagnosed with add her older sister was molested at the age of when younger sister was only serious responses only her father was bipolar he is deceased now when the oldest was looked at by a physician from her molestation she was looked at too everything looked fine there is a huge waiting list to see psychologists or psychiatrists in the area so i'm taking her to her dr who diagnosed her with adhd and odd to see if he has any suggestions that appointment is this wednesday morning any advice or suggestions or any way i can handle this would very much be appreciated yes i'm asking for ways to help handle the situation first of all you should never allow a general practisener to diagnose mental disorders because they are only briefly trained in doing so in comparison with a psychiatrist second your daughter downs is probabley the key reason she is acting the way she is not because she has a variety of mental disorders i wanna know why the hell she is taking risperdal at the age of that is extremely disturbing and you should get many opinions before allowing your child to take an anti psychotic medication i believe overall you and your daughter are being taken advantage of by your doctors children who don't have downs very very rarily are ever diagnosed with a psychotic disorder as for the odd and adhd your daughter must be looked at from the stand point of a person with downs not as a child without downs odd is usually only doagnosed in older children and adhd is something that is very hard to doagnose even with non downs children i think what you need to do is stop taking advice from the doctor s who has been diagnosing your daughter and wait if you must to see a respectable psychiatrist in your area i know the waits can be very long but it is for you and your daughters own good if you continuue doing what you are doing i know your daughters behavior and health will only get worse trust me on this Asperger syndrome Clinical depression Bipolar disorder Autism Psychosis Controversies in autism Schizophrenia Psychiatry Chronic fatigue syndrome Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Involuntary commitment Autism epidemic Dissociative identity disorder DSM-IV Codes Mental illness Psychoanalysis Post-traumatic stress disorder Borderline personality disorder Medicine Procrastination Prostate cancer Autistic spectrum Gender identity disorder Anorexia nervosa Pedophilia Mental retardation Drug abuse Terri Schiavo Autism rights movement Antidepressant Traumatic brain injury Breastfeeding Stomach cancer Methylphenidate Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Down syndrome Traumatic incident reduction Antipsychotic Psychiatric hospital Hikikomori Theory of conduct Epilepsy Stroke Psychology Psychotherapy Fibromyalgia Alzheimer's disease Anti-psychiatry Mental health Pervasive developmental disorder Milton H.
