what is the underling motive ego low self esteem i just moved and met one of my new neighbors with in the first few minutes she started trash talking the other neighbors saying they were nosey gossips the next day she came over and was trash talking her friend to me saying what a slob she was and a mooch the day after that she was telling me that this same friend of hers was jealous of me which i didn't buy at all seeing as though i hadn't really met her i said oh yeah well we should invite her over here so she can get to know me better she made excuses as to why that would be a bad idea mostly having to do with the fact that this friend has unruly kids which i found to be untrue it has been a few weeks since i met her and now she is back with her friend and more than likely trash talking me what causes people to act this way i never could understand it mostly low self esteem people gossip about others problems because that takes the focus off their own and to keep a friend from abandoning her she probably doesn't want you and her other friend to get close out of fear that one or both of you will push her out of the picture the other thing is it sounds like she's laying a foundation with you that she's the only one you can trust in that neighborhood sounds like she wants to draw you in close because its probably likely she's not well liked in the neighborhood and by getting to you first she can convince you that she's not all that bad and that everyone else has the problems thats just the way it seems to me Maison Ikkoku Friends Social rule Garfield Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Meat Loaf The Ashlee Simpson Show Nicomachean Ethics Hey Jude About a Boy Humphrey Bogart The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie James T.
