whats am i what is my personality can anyone relate dont believe in god or any religion i have no morals i believe that a person should get the most out of life because you only have one life to live im very shy and im very self conscious about my appearance i work out and i keep myself in good shape i value my life more than anything else but i would save someones life in a second i am obsessive about things and i always do what ever it takes to get exactly what i want despite how it effects those around me most people see my actions as obsessive are going to far out of the way to get what i want but i just see it as necessary i think everyone should get what they want as long as it doesnt effect me the term narcissist comes to mind possibly a hedonist someone who believes that pleasure is the most important pursuit of mankind at times even at the expense of others the term machiavellian comes to mind also as these folks tend to take a more detached calculating approach in their interaction with other people they tend to believe most people are concerned only with their own well being and to depend too much on anyone else is foolish they believe some of the most efficient ways to achieve a goal are to use deception rewards promises flattery and even punishments to manipulate others into doing their bidding there are many other terms however none are flattering and all suggest a certain level of sociopathy or psychopathy those who relate well usually crowd our prisons are drug dealers take advantage of others are ruthless etc the interesting thing is that your self description is self contradictory you want to get what you want out of life for example regardless of how it affects others and yet you would save someone else's life in a second maybe the real issue is that your still confused about your identity and struggle in relationships as most people with this description will hope this helps Machiavellianism Goodness and value theory Narcissism Friedrich Schleiermacher Scientology beliefs and practices Sant Thakar Singh Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Psychosis Capitalism Mind control Objectivist philosophy Soul Causality Human nature Magical thinking S__ren Kierkegaard Moral objectivism Theodicy Coercion Sola fide Infantilism David Hume Inflation Nicomachean Ethics A Course In Miracles Immortality Alignment (role-playing games) Art Simone Weil Empathy Justification (theology) Gross domestic product Utilitarianism Theology Human sexual behavior Drug abuse Addiction Divine grace Altruism Summa Theologiae Sigmund Freud Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Religion Capital punishment Cannabis (drug) Western philosophy Morality Predestination Supply and demand Economic inequality Second language acquisition Moral Politics Autism Psychoanalysis Philosophy of language Arguments for and against drug prohibition Ontological argument Drug addiction Social justice Witchcraft Asperger syndrome Obsessive-compulsive disorder Philosophy Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Phaedo Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Evil Sin Economic anthropology Universal pragmatics Love Hedonism Consciousness Narcissistic personality disorder Database Intellectual property Theory of conduct Economics Magic (paranormal) Consensual crime Francis Crick Prisoner's dilemma Supernatural Artificial consciousness Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Philosophy of business War Magic (illusion) Abortion debate
