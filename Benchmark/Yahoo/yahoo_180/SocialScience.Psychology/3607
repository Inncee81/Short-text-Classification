who gets the whole concept of the one and only god whats the point to be honest i think god is just something someone created to keep humans under control for example like police or laws its ridiculous devoting all your life to one person if he created you did he create you to worship him if so how arrogant and selfish i believe in science over god any day mate well i don't think anyone has the answer since we aren't god but i believe god is love god made everyone and is in everyone our purpose is to connect and be one paradoxically through our individual specialized gifts and personalities you can come to god through complete trust and faith which is impossible for imperfect humans to have without god ironically basically life is not about our individual selves and egos life is about working together to contribute to the oneness we are all the same yet we have different quirks those who are the most unhappy are probably the most selfish or those with the least faith that's not everyone though pride ego selfishness gluttony is the sin of all sins all other sins are just forms of individualism and a committment to the self at the cost of oneness Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Summa Theologiae Trinity Bah__'__ Faith Justification (theology) Urantia Friedrich Schleiermacher Evil Sin Sola fide Free will Infant baptism Jewish principles of faith Salvation S__ren Kierkegaard John Howard Yoder Reinhold Niebuhr Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Opus Dei Eastern Orthodox Church Baptism Meaning of life A Course In Miracles Brahman Duties of the Heart Religion Maimonides Pantheism Roman Catholic Church Revelation Israel ben Eliezer Sant Thakar Singh Sikhism primary beliefs and principles Repentance Virtue Theodicy Religious Society of Friends Christianity Divine grace Supernatural Objectivist philosophy Sri Aurobindo Heaven Original sin Satanism Philipp Melanchthon Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Predestination Virgin Mary in Islam Enneagram Jewish views of religious pluralism Emanuel Swedenborg Integral yoga Adi Da Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Prisoner's dilemma Sinfest Oneness Pentecostal Merit Hindu philosophy Love Patriotism Smartism Creationism Seven deadly sins Grimke Sisters Church of Christ, Scientist Satan Bah__'__ teachings Simone Weil Eucharistic discipline Nontrinitarianism Book of Mormon Alchemy Indulgence Swami Vivekananda Hinduism John Wesley Fasting Theory of conduct Confession Fallen angel Religious pluralism Judaism Goodness and value theory Coercion Religious conversion Ethics in the Bible Ten Commandments Gnosticism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Property (ownership right)
