isn't a curious mind the sign of an intelligent mind can somebody be highly intelligent and not be curious enough to ever ask any q's and doesn't it mean that if you never ask a q you are either brain dead know it all or find out somewhere else are those'top contributors' w zillion points and only q's asked are those people actually embarrassed to ask something because i wonder things like this does it make me an idiot not to worry about the points if you pick a best answer to your q and sign in for days it's 'paid for' if i see a top contributor and he she's got points i think to myself wow they must be pretty knowledgeable my first reaction is to see their q's i believe a persons q's are just as revealing as their a's ah they don't want to reveal see i asked and i was answered it all starts with asking aq i agree with you completely you can definitely tell more about a person's intellegence by the way they ask questions than the answers they may have posted or pasted i am always dissapointed to look up someone i think of as smart only to find they never ask questions i think the main reason is they don't want to reveal things about themselves and they know asking a question reveals more than giving an answer and yes unfortunatly a lot of answers are only doing so for the points not because they put any intellectual stock into the ya thing i'm level and you can see that i ask almost as many questions as i post and yes i have a very happy life outside my computer Plame affair Theory of conduct Social rule Samuel Goldwyn Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Meaning of life Past teachings of Prem Rawat Psychology Soul Objectivist philosophy Philosophy of language Joke Karl Rove Socrates The nature of God in Western theology Current teachings of Prem Rawat Coming of Age (TNG episode) Expert system Datalore (TNG episode) Piccolo Junior Saga Intelligent design Knots Landing Consciousness Supernatural Philosophical skepticism Cognitive science Technological singularity Surveillance Ben Johnson (athlete) W.
