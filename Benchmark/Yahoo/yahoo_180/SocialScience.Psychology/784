guys who want women to always tell them they're the best i've been out with a guy who really looked out to have ego boosted with recognition that got on my nerves a lot it bored me for example he was talking about himself in a good way and was kind of waiting for me to confort his sayings to agree that he was the best in different situations about different aspects of him it was a lot about him 'showing off' his assets i know that it is really great when someone treats us well and recognize our forces and qualities but to 'promote' them personaly and to wait for a confirmation that seemed weird to me not all guys do it but what does it say on their personality or maturity honestly it doesn't say a lot for either their personality men have something called the little wang syndrome of men walk around with a gripping fear that they are in someway inadequate to another man and thereby they need recognition and positive feedback to whatever ego benders they decide to go on despite the fact that i believe a huge margin of men suffer from this we're not all bad i have a tendency to go on an ego bender from time to time myself everyone does it either consciously or not but there's a fine line between someone who needs a little esteem boost and the obvious parallel to this personally i believe that a person's maturity has little to do with these ego benders but it's definately a personality fault if it's to the point where they need to have their ego stroked on a daily basis Transactional analysis Theory of conduct Bene Gesserit Futurama (TV series - season 5) Microeconomics Narcissism Divorce Friedrich Schleiermacher A Course In Miracles Stroke Dualism (philosophy of mind) Wang Mang Futurama (TV series - season 2) Free will Sigmund Freud Protoss The Fairly OddParents Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Traumatic brain injury Goodness and value theory Cerebellum Philip J.
