how do you have a lucid dream whenever i have a dream i never actually know i'm having one untill i wake up i've heard that when you have a lucid dream you're aware you're dreaming and you can do anything you want what's a good way to have one i've been having lucid dreams infrequently for the last few years it's not easy as you need to realize that you're dreaming in the dream which doesn't always happen it helps to ask yourself am i dreaming while you're awake and if this becomes a habit you're bound to ask while you're dreaming at some point drinking and most drugs kill your dreams so try to be sober when you're trying to have one while you're sleeping you have rem periods about every hours with each rem period becoming longer as the night goes on rem sleep is when you dream and a good practice if you're serious is to set your alarm to wake up in the early morning maybe hours before you normally wake up get up for at least hour but no longer than hours and then go back to bed this is the best time to remember your dreams because normally you will go directly into rem and if you concentrate on recognizing that you're dreaming when you go to sleep you might have a chance normally when i realize that i'm dreaming i become lucid to make sure that you're really dreaming try to fly this can be really fun or something else that you wouldn't normally be able to do once i'm sure i'm dreaming my dreams normally become sexual and i basically can just call out for whoever i want and they just appear in front of me then i do whatever i want to with her no wining or dining just straight to it probably not the best way to spend my dreaming time but for me this is the most fun after a lucid dream i feel like i'm on some kind of high for the next few days it is the best feeling in the whole world and definitely more people should try it my second favorite thing to do when dreaming is flying it is unbelievable Dream Out-of-body experience Sleep Philosophical skepticism Narcolepsy Insomnia Rapid eye movement Sleep paralysis Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Urinary incontinence Knots Landing Shaggy dog story Time Out of Mind Hypnagogia Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Milton H.
