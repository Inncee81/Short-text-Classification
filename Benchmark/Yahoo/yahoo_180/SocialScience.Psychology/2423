how do you deal with a overly defensive person my mom is a very nice person but she is extremely defensive making it very difficult to communicate with her about things she does that bother me she has a strong tendency to get something on her mind and once she does she will not stop pressuring until she gets her way everyone in my family realizes this and have mentioned it to her but she refuses to admit it and instead tries to rationalize her behavior it drives me crazy anyhow i'm grown and live out of state but there are things that she will not let go if someone doesn't agree with her she will back off for the timebeing but she will definitely try to bring it up again in some way when she feels she can how do you deal with someone that won't take no for an answer and at the same time is very defensive i think i would say something along the lines of do you feel like i'm attacking you because i'm not meaning to make you feel that way but there will be times that we don't agree it doesn't mean that i love you any less it means you raised me to be my own person and that's what i am no matter how many times we discuss this i still will not agree with you so why don't we talk about something else because i don't want to argue with you i don't know if it all needs to be said at once like that or broken up and used at different times but that's about how i respond to my family members who i don't agree with but who enjoy arguing Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Theodicy Pok__mon Live!
