do people in general become happier with age i heard that as people reach or so they learn to cope and are more able to handle life's problems it's like they don't care anymore is this true i'm so i guess i'm qualified to answer this one people don't necessarily become happier they become more settled life's little problems that we had growing up are gone for the most part we are done paying for children we are either retired or thinking about it i retired after years years ago and the stresses of the job are no longer such a bother for me not having to get out of bed at am every weekend day and drive through an hour's worth of horrific traffic is an extremely gratifying experience the part i don't like about being over is that we get a lot of sicknesses that young people do not get our bodies tend to move slower because it now hurts to move around and a lot of us can't move around as well as we did years ago there is however an inner sense of peace when you reach and over my finances are better except i now pay for different kinds of medications i didn't have to have when i was younger didn't even need them till last year getting older has it's fantastic moments and it's not so fantastic moments just as every age does but there is one thing that improves with age if you are lucky and that is done between people in a bedroom most of the time anyway it is much more pleasurable now then it was when i was in my 's and 's i think men finally get it when they reach their 's they finally realize that some things in life are worth doing slow and easy Pitaten Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Social rule The Amber Spyglass 2000 Australian Grand Prix Goodness and value theory Avenue Q About a Boy Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Current teachings of Prem Rawat Happiness Piccolo Junior Saga Milton H.
