need help wanting a job in psychology field i love psychology and the whole idea of figuring out what makes people the way they are fascinates me but my problem is i've already got student loans because i went to school for a certified medical asst and decided that's not what i want to do kinda late anyways what types of jobs are there available in psychology not necessarily a psychologist or psychiatrist exactly but something that would not require as much schooling and money as i already have loans and don't want to be like by time i can work due to massive amounts of schooling i'm now and what sort of degrees any help is appreciated thanks trust me i have been there i studied psychology and then found out that social workers have a much better chance of getting a job they also have a greater scope within their jobs if i had my time again i would become a social worker Education in the People's Republic of China Psychology Graduate school Anarchism and society Psychologist Unemployment Psychotherapy Psychiatry Epistemology Social work Social psychology Ethics Infantilism Medicine Psychology of religion Asperger syndrome Student loan Nurse Education in the United States School accreditation Reparative therapy Transactional analysis Software engineering Intelligence quotient Labour economics Scientology beliefs and practices Science Anti-psychiatry Divorce Sexual orientation College admissions Mortgage Anarchism and capitalism Transsexuality 401(k) EastEnders Carl Jung Doctorate Adult attention-deficit disorder Capital accumulation Economics Bipolar disorder Ex-gay Affirmative action Western philosophy Coercion Efficiency wages Unemployment benefit Division of labour Parapsychology Secretary Political economy Economic inequality Education in Germany Historian Drug abuse Drug addiction Librarian Abortion History of the People's Republic of China (3/4) Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder School counselor Past and present anarchist communities Pedophilia Rudolf Hermann Lotze Principal-agent problem University of Szeged Class in the contemporary United States Juris Doctor Labor theory of value Skilled worker Near-death experience Procrastination Anarchist economics Dissociative identity disorder History of economic thought Homosexuality and medical science Chinese University of Hong Kong Psychometrics Electrical engineering Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Psychosis Personality psychology Medical school Anti-intellectualism University of Maryland Baltimore County Mental illness Education in Portugal Homophobia Social Credit Developmental psychology Insurance Second language acquisition Theodore Kaczynski Competition Warsaw University Trade union Simone Weil Schizophrenia
