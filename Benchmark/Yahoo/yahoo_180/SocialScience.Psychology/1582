i am concerned i migth be bi polar i'm not sure if my behavior is normal b c of the stressors i have in my life or if i have a diseas i have a muilti cultural marriage which is daily stress adn compromise and two very active boys at home with me my husband and i are also very religious i have ups and downs but since i have been religious i have been mroe emtoionally stable and rational my son is yr and i suffered from anxiety off and on with post partum i am better now but i don't really believe in meds so i tried to heal naturally through diet and exercise also we had a big lifestyle change when we moved to a diff state and my hubby had two jobs i was alwasy at hom with the new baby and a hyperactive yr old what would be the difference between stress and a disorder being bi polar is a form of depression and is an imbalance in your system which can be corrected with medication it is a serious condition which can be made worse with stress but i would think that your situation is just plain old ordinary stress due to the conditions in your life you have two little children have made some life changes and have had some anxiety after the birth of your children if you are concerned you can be tested and your doctor will be able to diagnose your condition diet and exercise and some vitamins will help you with the stress meditation and prayer can also be effective i would suggest that you try to have a day out just for you and maybe a friend getting some you time will make a difference even if it just to go somewhere quiet and read a book moving to a different state is a challenge when you have two little ones a husband who is always working and many responsibilities give yourself a break and do something fun and relaxing i wish you well Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Post-traumatic stress disorder Stress (medicine) Chronic fatigue syndrome Anxiety Meditation Bipolar disorder Coeliac disease Multiple sclerosis Folic acid Anorexia nervosa Dieting Adult attention-deficit disorder Tocopherol Hypoglycemia Controversies in autism Hypertension Schizophrenia Psychosis Asthma Autism Prayer Carpal tunnel syndrome Obesity Insomnia Stuttering Medicine Tai Chi Chuan Infantilism Homophobia Acne Breastfeeding Migraine Vitamin C Hypnosis Diabetes mellitus Psychoanalysis Childbirth Charles Darwin's illness Fibromyalgia Alzheimer's disease Psoriasis Osteoporosis Atherosclerosis Prostate cancer Sleep Combat stress reaction Procrastination Alternative medicine Osteoarthritis Psychiatry Dissociative identity disorder Paget's disease of bone A Course In Miracles Agoraphobia Obsessive-compulsive disorder Medical analysis of circumcision Traumatic brain injury DSM-IV Codes Narcissism Antisocial personality disorder Cancer Psychotherapy Hikikomori Asperger syndrome Nutrition Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder Down syndrome Neurofeedback Philipp Melanchthon Second language acquisition Borderline personality disorder Obstetrics Sickle-cell disease Terri Schiavo Anemia Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Fecal incontinence Homeopathy Alcoholism Kundalini Health insurance Defence mechanism Anti-psychiatry The Beach Boys
