with this iq can i get very far in astronomy i love astronomy i would love to take it when i get older that's why for my a level studies i have to take mathematics chemistry and physics i'm good at chemistry and very terrible at mathematics and physics infact i think i'm the last in class i recently did an iq test i got a i don't think it's so bad but i doubt it if it's good enough for astronomy sometimes i ask myself if i'm wasting my time trying to do things i'm not good at because no matter how hard i try to be good at math and physics i end up frustrated cause i'm just not good but i badly want to do astronomy what should i do move on to another field or hold on even though i have a chance of failing and ruining my entire life oh yeah i did it online since we don't have them in our schools first of all where did you take this iq test if it was online disregard it online tests are not real or scientifically valid and many of them have for educational or entertainment purposes only written in the fine print if this was a real iq test then the psychologist giving it to you should have explained that there are many different tasks making up a whole iq test and that your overall score is just a general indicator of how well you did on the whole instrument however you might have done better on specific subtests that are more relevant to astronomy in any case a falls in the above average range which means that statistically speaking your score was higher than roughly of the population i am not aware that academic programs require a certain iq they are more concerned with your grades in school and how well you perform on academic achievement tests if you are not so good math or physics try to think about why this is ask your teachers what you can do to improve your grades or scores get a tutor if you can that kind of thing if your dream is to be an astronomer go for it Intelligence quotient Grade (education) Mathematics SAT Physics Graduate school Science Education in Romania GED Education in the People's Republic of China Education Astronomy A-level Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Graduate Record Examination Education in Taiwan Stuyvesant High School Education in the United States Philosophy of science Sex and intelligence Reliability engineering Advanced Placement Program ELO rating system Numerology Standardized testing Education in Hong Kong Psychometrics Western philosophy IB Diploma Programme Logic Pitaten Scientific method Homeschooling Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Master's degree Education in Singapore Overclocking Gymnasium (Denmark) Epistemology History of science Affirmative action Unidentified flying object Autism Contract Race and intelligence Randomness Specified complexity Aristotle Theory Philosophy of mathematics Prostate cancer Juris Doctor Modern geocentrism Large numbers College admissions Software engineering Creation-evolution controversy Intelligent design movement Education in Germany Hubble Space Telescope Emanuel Swedenborg Gravity Hogwarts subjects College Gifted Experiment Physical science Social sciences Second language acquisition Rasch model Martial art Education in Australia Economics Philosophy of language String theory Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Burkhard Heim Computer science A New Kind of Science Law School Admissions Test Hunter College High School High school Charles Peirce Charter school Planetary nebula Physician Polarization Education in France Harrow School
