do i really look that different from what i see in the mirror every time i take a picture i look totally different then what i look like in the mirror i look all nice in the mirror but in pictures not all i look weird when people look at you person to person are they seeing the you that is seen from a camera or more like the you that is in the mirror i've took some pictures of people with a camera and noticed that most of the times they looked a lot better in person this sometimes ruins my self esteem because the camera makes me think i loom that bad in real life so what you see in the mirror is what you look more like in real life and to other people don't worry about that that's what happend to me it's all to do with the position of your mirror if you're mirror is near a light bulb you'll look more stunning because you're seeing you're self in colour it's different in the camera because it doesn't have the same lighting you see your self in the mirror and that's how you look also some people have photographic face which means they're face is appated for the camera Single-lens reflex camera Camera Surveillance Technicolor Taxi Driver Filter (optics) Photograph Telescope Image Autostereogram Leica Mirror Pinhole camera View camera Traffic light Stereoscopy The Ashlee Simpson Show Theory of conduct Cinematography Shutter speed Road-rule enforcement camera Color temperature Paul Is Dead Digital photography Reflecting telescope Video camera tube Schmidt camera Schlieren photography Digital camera Kylie Minogue Konica Minolta Social rule Parallax Apollo moon landing hoax accusations Narrator Street photography Cliff Richard Goatse.cx Holography Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Shaggy dog story F-number Photographic film Color Lauren Bacall Boom Town (Doctor Who) Light Opportunity rover Canon T90 Piccolo Junior Saga Photography Contax Flash (photography) Aberration in optical systems Panoramic photography Closed-circuit television Photojournalism Macro photography Motion capture Night (book) Impressionism School bus Pure Pwnage Gaze Current teachings of Prem Rawat Digital single-lens reflex cameras Film Marilyn Monroe Spidey Super Stories Hubble Space Telescope Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas The Mirror Crack'd Apollo 8 Stanley Kubrick Optical coating Cinerama Avenue Q Shen Gong Wu Sampling (music) Mojave people Buckingham Palace Traditional animation Citizen Kane 50 First Dates Late Night with Conan O'Brien Broken News Television November (film) Ocean's Twelve Sunset Boulevard (1950 film) Discworld gods Sunglasses Sundial Hiberno-English David Hockney Dichroic filter Real Love (song) The Inside Photographic lens Rocko's Modern Life
