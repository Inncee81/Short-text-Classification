shy on the bus hi i usually very confident in a crowd like in class street but every time i go in a bus all confidence suddenly dissapear i start feel shy and uncomfortable i just always look down i cant look around coz i felt nervous if someones made eye contact with me is there any tips to feel more free thx the bus is a very unique situation you're probably sitting right next to someone you have never met before try offering a smile or a complement every time someone returns your friendly gesture you'll gain confidence and you'll probably make their day too start right when you get on by saying hello to the driver and thank him or her when you get off the bus hopefully you can build your confidence in any situation when you can conquer your bus fears good luck Social rule Shaggy dog story Hitchhiking Sharon Tate Haven (TNG episode) W.I.T.C.H.
