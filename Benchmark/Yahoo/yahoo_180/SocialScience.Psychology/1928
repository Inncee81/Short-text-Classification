how do you forgive yourself for the mistakes you have made i've been really down on myself lately for all of the ways that i fail if you genuinely try to be good how can you not be discouraged when you fail to meet your own ideals in response to the example of children learning to walk my mom says that i had a toy that would allow me to hold on while i walked behind it and i used it until i was sure i could walk on my own without falling she says i only fell maybe one time after i started to walk on my own it was not my mother who instilled this in me they did have high standards but did not berate me or punish me for failing etc i think that i have a natural predisposition for perfectionism if the walking situation is any indication brilliant question too often we are the most harsh on ourselves we can forgive and love anyone and everyone but our own selves it is you who has to love you and put yourself first if you can not forgive and accept yourself how can anyone else you lead the way you set the example then and only then will you feel content and accept yourself and love yourself and that love will be in your aura and emanate all around you you must have that self acceptance in order to have a balanced and content life A Course In Miracles Summa Theologiae Capital punishment Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Sin Narcissism One Tree Hill (TV series) Homosexuality and Judaism Theodicy Socrates Incarnations of Immortality Taoism Ethics Simone Weil Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity About a Boy Pitaten Shaggy dog story Trish Stratus Dune (novel) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Lincoln-Douglas Debate Divorce Dogville The Brothers Karamazov Kodocha EastEnders Salvation Forgiveness Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Roman Catholic Church Jewish principles of faith Sola fide Charles Dickens LaVeyan Satanism Humphrey Bogart Consensus decision-making Human nature Who is a Jew?
