how do i convince my friend that sex is not the answer to her problems she has decided to lose her virginity she has been depressed for a while over her situation in life and i think she's looking for a temporary fix to her problems like sexual pleasure i think it will only leave her feeling empty and alone in the end as one does with any addiction i feel that a sex dependency will probably be just as bad for her as is a drug or alcohol dependency can you offer me some advice to convince her otherwise any way i can show her that there are other alternatives to improving the quality of her life please let me know if there's anything that can help her feel better thanks just explain that there are millions of couples out there that have sex on a regular basis and are completely unhappy with their lives happiness comes from within and comes from being happy with yourself no outside pleasure makes a person truly happy in fact i think that's one way you can liken it to an addiction immediate gratification is something that excites you or makes you feel like you are happy but it is fleeting and short lived this requires you to continue immediate gratification to keep that feeling going however ultimately you run out of things to excite you and in the end you have emptiness true happiness is long term are you who you want to be do you want to be more than just okay do you want more out of life to get more out of life and to go down the path of who you want to be you have to work on your self health you have to get okay with who you are and take steps to improve your life part of it is hard work and refraining from immediate gratification just for the rush and part of it is discovering your interests and what motivates you deep down true happiness will only come when you can say this is how i want to live and this is who i want to be ask her who are the people she admires the most in her life ask her the qualities she admires about them ask her if she feels going down her current path she will emulate those qualities and become a person she admires my wife and i waited until marriage and we were at an advanced age mid thirties people thought we were crazy and people were astounded and yet those same people admired us for it too there is no question that we are far happier with ourselves this way Happiness Goodness and value theory Infantilism Sexual orientation Human sexual behavior Nicomachean Ethics Drug addiction Theory of conduct Narcissism Knots Landing Scientology beliefs and practices Sadism and masochism Methamphetamine Current teachings of Prem Rawat Transsexuality Clinical depression Ethics Social rule Meaning of life Divorce Child sexuality Utilitarianism Abortion debate Bernard Williams Addiction Sexual abstinence Rape Boston Public Sexual addiction Sexual dysfunction Drug abuse Bradley Nowell Obsessive-compulsive disorder Arguments for and against drug prohibition Sant Thakar Singh Laura Schlessinger Stomach cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Prostate cancer Motion picture rating system Altruism Ken Keyes, Jr. Brave New World Neighbours Social justice Pitaten Sex and the City Paraphilia Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Aesthetic Realism Religion Days of our Lives Pedophilia Friends Scientific method Marriage Objectivist philosophy EastEnders Sex education Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Red Hot Chili Peppers Property (ownership right) Borderline personality disorder Motivation Procrastination The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Medicine Consensual crime 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Sharon Tate Legal aspects of transsexualism Microeconomics Cancer Vernon Schillinger Alexander Technique Leadership Merit Psychiatry 1957 World Series Education in the United States Kurt Cobain Voter turnout Safe sex Eastern Orthodox Church Self-harm Computer chess American Psycho
