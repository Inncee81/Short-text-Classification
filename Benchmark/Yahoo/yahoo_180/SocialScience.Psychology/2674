last year to make it count i'm about to be a senior in high school and i'm so unbelievably lost and overwhelmed the first years i totally wasted on being afraid and scared afraid of rejection and fear of the unknown everyone at one point or another i'm sure wants to be popular and well known and feel wanted and for a while i always had that mindset that those are the people i need to hang out with and its odd because i've had so many opportunities but i let them go because i was to shy and scared to be the real me when they were reaching out to me so they thought i was stuck up or too good and here i am about to be a senior and i dont know how to let this crazy fear go and how to just live my life and be remembered how i want to be i need to change everyones impression of me to show them the real me because if i havent showed them anything else how would they know all i know is i cant waste my last year doing nothing i need to fulfill my high school life and show who i really am and experience and live you can't make all these changes now try to be a little less shy there will be a lot of common problems that your classmates will be sharing like college entrance exams and college choices this year will fly by if you are going on to college that is a place where you can start without carrying around all those perceptions from the previous years Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an A Course In Miracles Single Transferable Vote Grade (education) Hikikomori High school The Ashlee Simpson Show Education in Germany Pitaten The Contender (television series) Kim Possible One Tree Hill (TV series) Alex Ferguson Poker jargon Time Out of Mind Education in Portugal Charmed Jon Secada National Certificate of Educational Achievement Saved by the Bell SAT Education in the People's Republic of China Honey and Clover Panic attack Hunter College High School Maison Ikkoku Unidentified flying object Strategic management Daredevil G-Man (Half-Life) D.N.
