as a researcher you ask a question on yahoo answers you pose the question to the user community to get a feel for a general response a general interpretation another researcher comes along and takes your question and targets it to a select group what would you say the chances of skewed findings are in each group please expalin your rational sounds like a question i had in my statistics courses in graduate school i'll help you a bit first of all when you present your question on answers you're already skewing your results because answers is not a statistically reliable of valid cross sample of any population so you've already skewed and screwed your results secondly you haven't said whatever you have or haven't done to prove whether your question is statistically reliable or valid and if so to what degree that's very important once you've considered those two issues whatever another researcher does isn't going to skew anything any more than you already have by presenting your question untested for reliability and validity on a very skewed population as presented on answers so whatever another researcher does is of no concern to you unless your question here is just to get a theoretical answer and not based on a situation in fact but theoretically if another researcher takes your unproven question and presents it to another target group it's just adding one skew onto another thereby making the whole issue moot and if the other researcher hasn't validated his target group well then i've just wasted a whole bunch of time answering a question that is totally useless anyways gee i'd love my research professor to read my answer i'd get ten points and maybe a higher grade on my class but that was years ago so i'll just be happy with points and feel blessed if i get any more god bless you Graduate school Normal distribution Parapsychology Determinism Species Standardized testing Psychology Randomness Amnesty International Goodness and value theory Scientific method Intelligent design movement Second language acquisition Expert system Cult 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, exit polls Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Scientology beliefs and practices Philosophical skepticism SAT Logic Bayesian inference Software engineering GED Intelligence quotient Creationism Case study Model (economics) The Skeptical Environmentalist Monarchy in Canada Statistics Intelligent design Jacob Neusner G__del's incompleteness theorem Jumpstart 3rd Grade Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Doomsday argument Education in Portugal Many-worlds interpretation Autism Opinion poll Wikipedia Grade (education) John Lott Theory of conduct Prices of production Simone Weil Psychometrics Creation-evolution controversy Qualitative psychological research Biology and sexual orientation Experiment Franz Boas AIDS reappraisal Peter Singer Race and intelligence MP3 Jeopardy!
