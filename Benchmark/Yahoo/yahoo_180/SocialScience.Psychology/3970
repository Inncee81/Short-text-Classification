circadian rythyms is that the answer and why alot of times when i want to wake up at a certain time earlier than normal i set my alarm clock but i ll also fall asleep repeating over and over in my mind wake up at say am and most times i usually do generally like min before why a form of self hypnosis maybe let me rephrase if it is circadian rythyms than does that come from s of millions of years of evolution and knowing instinctively on some primeval level the patterns of the universe such as seasonal changes the continual cycle of sunset and sunrise is all that information genetically imprinted in our dna or something more recent like the development of a hour cycle for counting days thats subconsciouslly planted in our minds and having nothing to really do with genetics the fact that you repeat the time over and over may show that it is self hypnosis as you go to sleep you pass through several layers of trance Circadian rhythm Insomnia Hypnosis Narcolepsy Unconscious mind Delayed sleep phase syndrome Milton H.
