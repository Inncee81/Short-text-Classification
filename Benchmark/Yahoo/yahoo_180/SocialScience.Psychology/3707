serious question for a change how is a person suppose to react when they find out a loved one has cancer before someone starts to worry or look for a punch line my sister had colon cancer fortunately it was easily handled with minor surgery and now shows to be completely clear i saw the original scope images and never even considered anything worse than that ok then when she told me all i could think was possible medical and surgical scenarios i know that what i told her including descriptions of the most common procedures calmed her by taking the fear of the unknown away however i felt no more emotional attachment than i did for the patients i worked on in surgery in the past now that i know that she's doing well it is really bothering me that i stayed so calm even when alone i feel like the normal response would be to get upset angry something any thoughts when i found out my husband had cancer i was an emotional wreck on the other hand when i told my brothers about my heart conditions they reacted the same as you i even had to have several surgeries i guess the answer would be that everyone reacts differently to all situations some people show no emotions while some overreact you probably had the upper hand in this one you stood strong without making her worry more Prostate cancer Transsexuality Intersex surgery Stomach cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Medicine Cancer EastEnders Autism Milton H.
