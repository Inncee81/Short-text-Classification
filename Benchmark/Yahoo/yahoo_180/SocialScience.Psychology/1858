why are people hurtful to others just b c they may be in a situation that doesn't seem all that bad i have noticed that when people are in a dilemma that others do not gage as a true problem they become cruel and very hateful towards the person why is this for example let's say someone was offered a new job and they needed to decide if they were willing to relocate and essentially start a new life some silly people begin to respond back by stating oh you poor baby how rough of a time this is for you and so on and so forth could someone explain to me why some people respond in that manner the reason someone may responde to another in that manner is simply because they are getting the good job and a choice in life while the other person may not be they would come at you with a comment like that because they are jealous or simply mad at the fact that the person gets a choice in life and takes it for grandated while the mean person would jump at a chance like that there are many reasons why a person would react in such a way and these's are only a few i hope this helps to answer your question vanessa Social rule Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Abortion debate Expert system Goodness and value theory Theory of conduct Scientology beliefs and practices Monty Hall problem Theodicy Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Prisoner's dilemma Altruism Simone Weil Ethics Whose Line Is It Anyway?
