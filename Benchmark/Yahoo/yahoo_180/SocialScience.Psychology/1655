did anyone in uk watch that thing on btk last night on channel im really in to reading about various serial killers btk is one that has interested me the most though because of the weird ways he went about things i thought before i watched that that i knew all that happened in the case but it turns out that theres loads that was missed out in the books and other programmes i have watched i found it really interesting to learn why there was so many years between his killings did anyone else notice how much extra stuff there was i did watch it but i hadn't heard of him before it was definitely an interesting programme his name btk is actually one of the most disturbing things i've ever heard plus he's a relatively 'normal' guy involved in church and scouts and whatnot it just goes to show that sometimes you should trust your suspicions about people what weird things did he do was he particularly ritualistic Dennis Rader The Inside EastEnders Shaggy dog story Sharon Tate Monster (manga) Bad Wolf Scenes from a Memory Serial killer CPU cache The Lovely Bones The Demon Headmaster Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Wichita, Kansas Kim Possible Time Out of Mind Spidey Super Stories Conspiracy (TNG episode) God Emperor of Dune Hey Jude Milton H.
