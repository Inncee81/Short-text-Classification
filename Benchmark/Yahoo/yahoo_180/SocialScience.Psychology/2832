abuse in childhood is it normal for a person who was physically and emotionally abused by a parent to blow hot and cold in relationships is it because they lack trust and feel unworthy how would someone deal with this so that it didn't ruin future relationships and how could i support this person that is pretty normal behaviour for someone who has suffered abuse you are absolutely right about the feelings of unworthiness the only way to deal with this is through therapy cognitive behavioural therapy is the absolute best for this it teaches the sufferer to look at how their thought patterns affect their behaviour and then teaches them how to change it any therapy can be helpful but cbt generally is much quicker sessions sometimes and far more effective if you want to support this person you need to get them to see that there is another way and that cbt or another form of therapy could really help explain to them that you do not want to see the abusers win and that by the abuse they heaped on causing this behaviour they are continuing to ruin that person's life and that that isn't fair that the sufferer can be free of this you should also make the sufferer aware that they have a choice and that if they chose to deal with it however painful the journey may be they will eventually be free of the effects of the abuse not the fact it happened if they chose not to deal with it that they are making a choice to stay the same as they are however badly they have been abused and however much compassion you have it is not right or fair for them to project their feelings of unworthiness onto you or anyone else this is damaging to everybody in particular to the abused person themselves this can be sorted it can take a while and can be really painful but it is incredibly liberating and hugely strenghening and empowering think about it abused children are vulnerable certainly but they already posess huge inner strength for getting through it in the first place the abused person firstly needs to understand that the abuse was not their fault it is always so much harder when children have been abused in any way by their own parents as children naturally feel defensive of their parents and for a time as young children we all have the idea that our parents are perfect the abused child therefore feels the problem must be inside them that they are not worthy of being loved and cared for as normal children are the truth is that the parent failed the child that the problem was in the parent and their inability to resolve their own conflict and emotional lacking and not to project that onto their child you can support someone going through this but only if they are willing to get help if they are not eventually they will drive you away thus fulfilling their own inner belief that they are worthy of nothing and no one counselling of any nature can be traumatic as the memories surface and the realisation of things surrounding that but look at it a little like a broken leg broken really badly but no medical attention was given so the leg bone heals itself but awkwardly not cleanly giving the leg problems pain mobility issues in the end the leg has to be re broken which hurts but it can then be set properly the bone can fuse properly leaving a healthy leg with little or no pain that can walk properly its the same with therapy the abused person's gp is the best place to start and it is best if the sufferer can be as open as possible with the gp both about the abuse and about the effect it is having on their life and behaviour this is important so that the gp can bring about an urgent referral some of the waiting lists are incredibly long if you have had no joy or answer after a couple of week chase up the referral and do so until you have an appointment if you have the money private cbt therapy will ultimately prove far more effective and much much quicker you could find a recognised therapist from the internet or word of mouth perhaps your gp could even recommend one by all means support the abused person tell them that you will help them get the right help for them that you will sit and listen to how they feel and if necessary what happened to them but do make it clear that it is not your responsibility to take the pain that person can sometimes inflict upon you do not become their emotional punch bag no matter how sorry you feel for that person it is not right for anyone to treat anyone else badly just because they are hurting inside make it clear you will not tollerate unreasonable behaviour and that if you are subjected to any you will remove yourself from the situation until that behaviour changes and stick to it believe me this is one of the kindest most supportive things you can do for this person if they start hitting out at you and you feel uncomfortable about it do not enter into arguements or discusions just tell them that you do not like the way they are behaving and have done nothing to deserve it so you are going home out for a walk and will check in on them later then follow it through it won't be easy and it must not be said in anger but firmly and with compassion it may take two or three times but very quickly the person will learn that that behaviour will not get them what it is they need or want at that time and they will stop it at least for a while do not be swayed by comments like you don't understand its alright for you you don't know what its like being abused maybe not but that is no excuse for you to be treated like that i wish you all the best and it can be sorted so that person can have successful relationships on every level cbt would be the best way but all talking therapy is likely to be beneficial providing the counsellor is well trained
