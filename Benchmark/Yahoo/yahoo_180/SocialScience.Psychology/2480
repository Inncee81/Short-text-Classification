when did the phrase less is more become rational i just hate it when you see tv ads with this phrase as if it makes sense what do you all think the first time i heard this was in the context of sales advertising or marketing that sometimes the less you say the more effective it is because it has more impact and the less you have in an print ad the more clearly it stands out and is read instantly instead of skimmed and ignored you involve the listeners or readers more readily instead of dominating or tuning them out with too much information two other examples in scriptwriting it leaves more to the viewer and also to the action to tell the story instead of being overweighted with too much preachy dialogue prime example compare the first script of the matrix where the script and dialogue were very tight and condensed vs the later scripts where whole paragraphs were recited to the audience in emails and forums like this one sometimes longer answers dilute the points whereas shorter answers can make the point more effectively Advertising Screenplay Screenwriting Poetry Plame affair Superhero Machinima Propaganda Little Britain Digital photography Anime I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Trademark Seinfeld Prayer Jumping the shark Storytelling Irony Fox News Spam (electronic) Whose Line Is It Anyway?
