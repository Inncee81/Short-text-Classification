life's little problems i'm a yr old male i've been going threw depression for about a year now the pills my doctor gave me don't seam to help drugs help a little i'm well aware that's self medicating i've had suicidal thoughts a lot the only thing that seams to help is constantly going out if i keep moving my thoughts don't catch up with me this past week has been my best week despite the fact that i got fired i've been out with my friends every day going to clubs getting drunk seeing old friends getting high playing video games all day whatever it seams to me that dull or repetitive life makes me sad i have to work because that's impossible to get by in this day and age but i know i'll just get worse and worse as i have been so far there's always the possibility of just marring rich but there's no way i'll get that this way idk any ideas i have no interest in religion i've dealt with many kinds and i believe they're pointless i don't get any enjoyment out of helping anyone i find enjoyment in destroying other peoples life though going out alleviates your unhappy mood it is only a temporary solution you need to understand why you are experiencing depression and suicidal thoughts in the first place and then focus on treatment and prevention i believe the best way to understand your feelings is through therapy but therapy doesn't always have to involve two people yourself and a total stranger sometimes just sitting alone in a quiet area and analyzing the problems and prospects of your life can be just as productive i'm also and i deal with anxiety and moodswings but for me the best therapy has always been journal writing it forces me to be candid about my emotions along with therapy talk to your doctor though medication isn't effective in everyone it's best to keep an open mind to the various types of treatment available also you can visit webmd com and other health sites to learn about new and current medications for treating depression just remember to talk with your doctor about which medicine is best for you lastly find a good support system compassionate friends and family members are always helpful to have by your side during this difficult trial in your life also if you like seek spiritual support sometimes faith can provide an extra boost of courage good luck Prostate cancer Bipolar disorder Medicine Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Antidepressant Meditation Psychoanalysis Psychotherapy Stomach cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Transsexuality Stuttering Alternative medicine Psoriasis Anxiety Autism Sigmund Freud Theory of conduct Reparative therapy Borderline personality disorder Diazepam Electroconvulsive therapy Schizophrenia Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Cognitive therapy Psychiatry Urinary incontinence Traumatic incident reduction Suicide Multiple sclerosis Post-traumatic stress disorder Traditional Chinese medicine Stroke The nature of God in Western theology Social rule Psychiatric hospital Ex-gay Cancer Palliative care Church of Christ, Scientist Unemployment Insomnia Self-harm Neurofeedback Traumatic brain injury Magical thinking Transactional analysis Clomipramine Procrastination Alcoholism Asthma Hypnosis Quackery Controversies in autism Milton H.
