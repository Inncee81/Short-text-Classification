what does it feel like to be a genius am i a natural genius no but i m working on being a genius through skill any ways to natural geniuses only born with it photographic memory included when you work out a problem like the following math problem two cars are traveling in the same direction on a road the car that leads is traveling at miles per hour the other car is traveling at miles per hour how many miles apart will they be minutes before the faster car catches the slower on what goes through your mind i know you ve been asked this before and you most likely said something like it just happens well think back on that answer and elaborate on it can you picture things clearly in your mind and how clearly is it a tv screen with bad reception or the senses d participation or a clear plasma tv screen when you close your eyes does the thoughts have a pleasant sensation a natural high do you need cues when you think intensively like sounds or nose twitch i mentally picture things at a focus but my research suggests that natural genius use more of a peripheral mental vision like speed reading is this how you think do you have an anxiety about thinking so deeply like i do this is a serious question imagine you are describing the sensation to an actor thanks for your insight since the meaning of the word genius is somewhat relative to the context in which it is used i will assume you are referring to those gifted in math science or spatial reasoning it feels a bit like gulliver's stay among the lilliputians while they may feel normal and not completely alone they can feel lost among others of considerably less stature it is a bit like being alone among many or as yogi berra said nobody goes there anymore it's too crowded imagine laughing at things others cannot find humorous being fascinated by the boring doing well what others cannot do at all imagine a life governed by masses of people who may never understand what you find to be elementary rather than being surrounded by people who can relate to your experience you would find both adoration and envy in great abundance think of a statue being pulled down by ropes on both sides it is no wonder that people of genius can have a tenuous grip on emotional stability for these reasons people of genius are directed into the company of others of similar gifts and guided toward some form of accomplishment a harnessing of their talents in a way that gives back to society there can be camaraderie and rivalry and there will be plenty of opportunities to be useful as well as to be used both will be keenly felt and the pressure can build for these reasons a genius needs a way to relax even the opportunity to act stupid depending on the circumstances neither may be understood or forgiven those who wish to achieve and retain recognition as a genius must exist ironically as the object of much study under the microscope of the less fortunate it is no wonder that so many escape to desert isles of surf and mint juleps edit btw miles since the will travel in the half hour the will travel sorry i forgot to answer earlier but i just skipped past it to the central point of your question i solved it by visualizing the road the cars the speed the time and doing the math in my head it's a dimensional problem based on a dimensional scenario that adds the th dimension of time genius as assumed for this example is way beyond this but involves the same thing on too large a scale for average people to mentally process when the problem is divided into too many segments it becomes more difficult to visualize and the solution vanishes hence the need for photographic memory in this case many problems are easier to demonstrate with chalk on blackboard or computer graphics but it is so much easier to manipulate in the mind if suitably equipped savants or computers might process this without visualization as we know it arriving at the solution sooner but perhaps never visualizing the problem in the first place showing the broader applicability of genius if that helps double edit i re read your question and you are correct about genius getting credit for the hard work of peeling away the layers of an onion if you have the mental easel on which to sketch and are willing to do the hard focused work of digging for truth you can be recognized as a genius it helps to have some of the intuitive skills of a savant but is not required what is necessary is a settled state of mind not unlike a chess board on which the pieces stay in place rather than being blown about by the winds of chaotic thinking chaos breeds its own flashes of insight manifested by other forms of genius particularly the artistic in the form of an open ended collage or kaleidoscope that suddenly makes sense freeze framed musical genius is also recombinant utilizing a fantastic collaboration of aural visualization and memory literary genius requires the ability to recycle phrasing and post it on a mental cork board rearranging for spontaneity and effective communication so that the original thoughts are recreated or amplified in the reader as if they just occurred political genius captures the zeitgeist of the moment giving a powerful voice to what others cannot find the words to say making it resonate and motivate business genius makes a product appear to be more valuable than the price no matter how high providing access to desire maybe you can post a question on the different types of genius and the y a crew can respond with their favorite examples Philosophy of language General
