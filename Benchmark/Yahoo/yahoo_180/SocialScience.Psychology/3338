what is the psychology behind eye contact eye contact seems to be some sort of primal instinct what is the psychology behind it and should it be manipulated for our own purposes here's a few examples i've encountered i am a boss of several spanish speaking men at a restaurant they are constantly staring me down i feel like they are trying to intimidate me when i test the waters and stare back at them it just gets very awkward a homeless man was asking everyone downtown for money when he asked me i made direct eye contact and said no sorry he wouldn't go away so testing the waters i held eye contact with him and would not break it the scene escalated to the point where he was on the verge of getting violent should you make eye contact when harrassed when i make eye contact with my dog she lowers her head and cowers submissively with these examples it seems like eye contact is some sort of primal instinct and draws similiarities between humans and other species so any insight this is psychological when you look directly at those people it shows them you're not afraid but i don't know your face expression which also means a lot my advice at the restaurant when they stare you down go and talk to them try a few words in spanish communicate with them you will notice a big difference about the homeless that was also psychological you were probably well dressed clean and shaved and he was homeless and in an inferior position asking you for money and he probably thought you did have a buck to help him and you just didn't want to and when you maintained eye contact you gave him an opportunity to let his anger of the world out about your dog you trained him well hahahaha Social rule Ocean's Twelve Darth Vader The Shining (film) The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Sapir-Whorf hypothesis Aikido Haven (TNG episode) Diving Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Poker jargon Dead Like Me Glossary of partner dance terms Milton H.
