what to do when an adult uses a child to manipulate you my ex is bipolar and a pathological liar our relationship was always rocky at best the individual issues are unimportant he left his daughter with me when we split up about years later for several months when i asked what his intentions were he sent her to live with his aunt in co that lasted mos or until they asked for support from him he got her back and was able to take care of her when he had a room mate but has leaned on me heavily since their falling out i get frustrated and angry sometimes i feel so bad for her and i think he uses it to his advantage i have had her for the majority of the time over the last mos he now needs me help him with taking care of her before school and whn i asked if there were any other options he did what he alwys does and turned it around on me like i am so mch btr off than he is and what do i want him to do quit his job he doesn't pay the sprt for our child gether how do u not let smbdy use a kid to pull ur heart strings hi lucky sounds to me like your ex uses his disorders to his advantage by laying responsiblity for things on you that should be done by him seems to me like he's milking the cow as far as it will go and you should immediately put a stop to it i know this is difficult because children are involved and you must consdier how they play a part in this firstly i would have a serious discussion with this man tell him you'll break off all contact and refuse to help him if he doesn't wisen up tell him to get help with his issues and most importantly tell him to be a good father to his children he needs to start pulling his weight at some point after all have you ever thought about how long you can keep going carrying the burden of his child and your own child and your own life and job all on your own let him know he better start taking responsiblity and pulling his weight and if he doesn't why don't you let go for a bit too and see how he reacts when all his demands aren't being met personally i would disenage from this person if he's not willing to change becasue he's doing more harm than good i would take the two kids and leave him find someone who's more invested in you the kids and your well being as a unit good luck and i hope things get better for you Social rule Equine conformation The Contender (television series) Pitaten Knots Landing EastEnders Tenshinhan Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Avenue Q Consensus decision-making Too Short a Season (TNG episode) About a Boy Piccolo Junior Saga Theory of conduct Miss Saigon Bipolar disorder Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Shaggy dog story Kodocha Clinical depression Procrastination Humphrey Bogart Incarnations of Immortality One Tree Hill (TV series) The Shining (film) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Critic Sin City Phoebe Halliwell The Death Gate Cycle Borderline personality disorder One Piece minor characters Breath of Fire III The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Beavis and Butt-head Haven (TNG episode) Infantilism Jam (TV series) Edward Gibbon Wakefield Anger management Dancing at Lughnasa Continuation War Fathers' rights Professional wrestling holds Mary Jane Watson Abortion debate Escape from New York Milton H.
