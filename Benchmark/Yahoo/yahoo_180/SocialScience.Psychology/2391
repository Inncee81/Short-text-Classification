are you a competitive person do you always have to win be the best type a personality i great question rena i have been through this i used to feel totally miserable if i couldn't be in whatever i took up i remember to have wept like girls for hours when i lost my first rank in th standard final exam life taught me a lesson much later i suddenly realized that i was missing a lot because i was always wanting to top or win often i would not join an activity just because i didn't have confidence to top there would always be a worry lest i should slip to number two i never took risks willingly and thus lost on huge opportunities i am of the firm opinion now that wanting to compete is different from wanting always to win the former comes from wanting to improve or excel the latter is in fact a negative idea of never wanting to lose at any cost and the price paid for this is invariably higher than the gain if any in any case in my current dictionary peace and happiness come before success or top notch Supply and demand Microeconomics Knots Landing Alex Ferguson Education in the United States Natural monopoly Bryan Robson The Contender (television series) Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 The Apprentice 2 2000 Australian Grand Prix Norway national football team Economic rent New York Giants Star Ocean: The Second Story Oxford English Dictionary One Tree Hill (TV series) Privatization Minimum wage $ale of the Century Infantilism Hyperinflation Milton H.
