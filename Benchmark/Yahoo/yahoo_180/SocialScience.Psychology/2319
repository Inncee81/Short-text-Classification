how can i learn to talk to poeple with more respect i seem to come across as a very rude person to say the least i am extremly blut with my words i want to learn to come across as being nicer and kinder but one thing i did notice is i only come across like this when i am talking to someone that has given me the impression that they are not confident in themselves it seems with people like this i just walk over them and don't respect them i don't realize i do it any advice or help jolicart now i don't feel so bad you described me to a tee i have zero tolerance for stupi folks you are correct i need to just beaware of my tones at all times thanks for being truthful it's good to know i am not alone nopetohope well said thanks well if you are anything like me you do not have much tolerance for stupid people being nice is a struggle for me everyday i get along just fine with my family and selected number of friends but anyone outside of that usually puts me in a bad mood the advice that was given to me was to put myself in the other person's shoes i do not know their education level upbringing etc therefore i should not get upset when they do not know something that is so obvious to me i force myself to be nice and i am always aware of my tone constant awareness of your words and tone is what will help you the most Social rule Theory of conduct Singlish Scientology beliefs and practices Milton H.
