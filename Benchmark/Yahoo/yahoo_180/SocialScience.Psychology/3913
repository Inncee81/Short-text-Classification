how do you handle people who make passive aggressive statements to purposefully piss you off other than opening a can of whip ass i want to really show them that i dont need to result to childish behavior to do anything that if i have an issue with somebody i talk it out and resolve it i am trying to stay out of the way make myself invisable and just let the comments pass but i gotta stand up for myself someway any ideas please only serious replys when someone is passive aggressive with me i have radar for it and usually just avoid them permanently but when i find myself trapped with them like at a dinner party and they say something to make me look bad i just smile lean into the person next to me in a comical good natured way loud enough for everyone to hear and say i won't believe half of all the things she says about you if you promise not to believe half of all the things she says about me ok then lift your glass or your jaw in a jovial way and smile really big at the target she'll get the point and crawl away they always do Social rule Poker jargon Shaggy dog story Goodness and value theory Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Tag U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Anger management John Major Kasparov versus The World Oral sex Punk ideology Contract Notable lines in the Star Wars series Moonraker The Catcher in the Rye Ron and Fez German grammar Pitaten Bill O'Reilly (commentator) Garfield Mojave people Gray Wolf Rose (Doctor Who) Modern naval tactics Radar Toilet humour USS Tunny (SS-282) Social psychology Sonar Terri Schiavo Conspiracy (TNG episode) Phoebe Halliwell Sydney Riot of 1879 Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Free will Swingout Jennifer Lopez Professional wrestling throws Ten Commandments English grammar Intelligent design movement Humphrey Bogart Homophobia Craps The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Colony in Space Aerial (dance move) Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Bah__'__ Faith and Science Coming of Age (TNG episode) The Shining (film) Sinfest The Invisibles Rick Santorum Ruy Lopez Big Brother (USA TV series) Eric Cartman Internet troll September 11, 2001 attacks timeline for the day of the attacks Theory of conduct Teen Girl Squad Theodicy Big Brother UK series 6 Hearsay Have I Got News For You Ethics Plame affair Blonde on Blonde Autism Human sexual behavior Politics of the Republic of China Bringing It All Back Home Nimzo-Indian Defence Battle of Leyte Gulf Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Futurama (TV series - season 5) George Galloway Profanity Kender The Empty Child Everything2 Rush Limbaugh Hip hop rivalries Punk-O-Rama Justification (theology) Traumatic incident reduction French Defence Missouri Compromise The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy The Marshall Mathers LP Non-aggression principle Phaedo Consensus decision-making Polish September Campaign Action potential Hearing impairment Chen Shui-bian Shen Gong Wu
