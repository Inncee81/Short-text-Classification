how can i be tested to see if i am gifted is there a test that possibly i could recieve from my therapist whom could i speak to to get this test if there is one i do not mean sound full of myself but ever since i was a toddler i have been far more advanced academically then other children my age i'm at the moment i have also had still have many emotional issues and have a horrible temper i hear that gifted children usually do talk back and have short tempers is this true is it possible that i could be gifted are gifted children usually bad at a certain thing but extremely brilliant at another how can i figure this out please help me could you please reply with some links to other websites as well any other help would be great thank you so much peace ahem while i was in my old school they advanced my two grades because the work was too easy don't be rude jeeze somebody's grapes are awful sour today huh i'm not saying that i am i'm merely asking how i could be tested to see if i am please don't bite my head off your therapist may know where you can get tested for being gifted you can also talk to your school you would probably have the test administered at school or by a psychologist trained to give these tests as far a gifted children having emotional issues and short tempers sometimes this might be a characteristic since they tend to experience things a bit more intensely than the average person but it might have absolutely nothing to do with it some gifted children are gifted in one area say langauge or math but many are pretty even across the board it really varies having extreme difficulty with learning most things but being incredibly gifted in one area would make someone a savant lots of people associate that with a form of autism not that this has anything to do with your situation it's just background info that had to do with what you were describing just talk to your therapist or some school officials and get tested if you want to a good palce to start if you want a result quickly would be an iq test i was tested for being gifted in st grade and i got the iq test for that i also matched up with every sign of giftedness they had on their little checklists down to being really bothered by clothing seams and tags so maybe there are more tests they would have given me if they weren't sure there might be other tests it's accepted that kids who get iq tests over are gifted there might be exceptions anyway just go from there most importanly if the tests tell you you're not gifted that doesn't matter these tests only measure a few types of intelligence and it sounds like you're really intelligent or motivated or both anyway Gifted Autism Asperger syndrome Education in the United States Dyslexia Autism rights movement Social rule Controversies in autism Intelligence quotient Philosophical skepticism SAT Education in Romania Reparative therapy Second language acquisition Theodicy Milton H.
