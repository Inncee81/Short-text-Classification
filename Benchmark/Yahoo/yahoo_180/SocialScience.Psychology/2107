how do you defend an experimental study without a control group for people in the field of psychology we did an exprimental study in which we did a comparison between two experimental groups we did not have a control group how do defend that theoretically nothing to defend it is just that you have to limit the generalizability of your interpretations what you have found in your study pretains to those two groups the question is whether you can say something more than that in other words generalize your findings to people everywhere if you do then you will have to consider the implications of a lack of a control group perhaps you have some indirect way to suggest what the performance of a control group would be other similar studies common sense but keep in mine it is just speculation since the control group was not exposed to the same experimental conditions in general control groups a very very valuable but not always practically possible in a experimental design most good write ups include a self critique of a study or more accurately a way to design a study in the future to expand your current efforts e g to include a control group good luck Franz Boas Ethics Science Causality Hypnosis Experiment Second language acquisition Nuclear power Biology and sexual orientation Software engineering Philosophy of language Psychoanalysis Theology Deconstruction Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Information warfare Mind control Extraterrestrial life Cultural relativism Opposition to cults and new religious movements Race and intelligence Cognitive science Model (economics) Fuel injection Parapsychology Sea level rise Black hole Capitalism Psychosis Martial art Contract Big Bang Randomness Logic Law of value Bernard Williams Neuro-linguistic programming Consciousness Determinism Biology Theory Physics Scientific method Economics Principal-agent problem Intelligence quotient Capital accumulation Transformation problem Physical cosmology Computer-supported collaboration Western philosophy Behaviorism Brain Cult Prices of production Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Engineering Immanuel Kant Cognition Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Atheism Brainwashing Infantilism Motivation Social psychology Evidence-based medicine Burkhard Heim History Aikido Cold fusion A Course In Miracles Philosophy of perception Reality Esperanto as an international language Sociology Hermeneutics Free will Critical theory Case study Sigmund Freud Fair use Philosophy of science Artificial consciousness Physical paradox Sociocultural evolution Religion Education Many-worlds interpretation Philosophy Autism rights movement Autism Central processing unit Extreme Programming Postmodernism Goodness and value theory Aristotle Developmental psychology Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation)
