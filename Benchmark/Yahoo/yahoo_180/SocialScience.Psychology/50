this issue has compelled me to ask what are your views on abortion why do you feel this way p s look at my answers to previous questions on this issue especially the what's going on tonight question and you'll see where i stand with this i think it's interesting how strongly people feel about this issue and how closed minded people seem to me about others' opinions bc they feel so strongly what do you think either way i don't pass judgement what's more important life or their own wants this is why this issue interests me so much just to throw something out there so a child that is unwanted is supposed to suffer later in life because the mother decided not to get an abortion but makes her child feel unwanted his whole life and tortures him with abuse and neglect what's better having him survive this his whole life with possible psychological consequences or abort him interesting no and another thing there are sooooo many unwanted children in this world that are already up for adoption is it right to have adoption as an easy out too i know for me it would be way harder to carry my baby months and give birth and give it up then not go through the experience to begin with very well put tinman just me exactly so this is my point about the whole thing people automatically think that women like me who are pro choice are 'evil' or don't love children the way they're supposed to but clearly i made my point that i could not do it and i'm not doing it i'm almost months pregnant and am a single mother due to the father's choices and i'm taking responsibility in my case for my actions interesting no but my case for abortion over neglect is for parents who abuse their children expose them to drugs rape like in a drug home and neglect no proper care these parents obviously don't care about their children and obviously didn't bond with them the way a responsible parent would sometimes abortion is an intelligent and viable choice early in the pregnancy it should never be used as a birth control method as you said an unwanted child usually if not always is a wounded child a child whose mother does not have the resources to provide for her him is a deprived child there was a recent book wherein the authors maintained that roe v wade and subsequent legal abortions did not bring into this world a whole bunch of boys and girl who would have been unwanted or deprived at best and traumatized victimized and full of self other hatred at worst these authors concluded that as far as the crime rate was concerned it was much lower because there weren't a bunch of young adults with grudges against mom and the world as can be expected they took a lot of heat and criticism for their guarded and caveated conclusions it is pure evil to call a young lady a murderer simply because she did what was right in her sight and for her own survival i am incensed about so called christians and their busy body judgments about matters that are none of their concern as one of my fave bumper sticker says don't believe in abortion then don't have one Theory of conduct Laura Schlessinger Domestic violence Pro-choice EastEnders Adoption Religion and abortion Hillary Rodham Clinton Partial-birth abortion Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Divorce Infantilism Friends Fathers' rights Days of our Lives Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Motivation Child sexual abuse Ethics Satanic ritual abuse Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Simone Weil Plame affair Breastfeeding Transsexuality Appeal Knots Landing Cult Ted Kennedy Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Birth control Gender role Anti-abortion movement Abortion in Canada Theodicy Pregnancy Serial killer Miscarriage Mother Teresa Evil John Roberts Supreme Court nomination and hearings Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Alignment (role-playing games) Sexual abstinence One Tree Hill (TV series) Sex education Democratic Party (United States) Objectivist philosophy Zoophilia Polyamory Hollyoaks Eugenics Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Dissociative identity disorder Ten Commandments Feral child Children of God American Psycho Deprogramming Mind control Human rights in the United States History of sex Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism The Inside Kurt Cobain Economics Incest History of British nationality law Teenage pregnancy Biology and sexual orientation Animal rights Controversies in autism Second language acquisition Postpartum depression Charmed Childlove movement Supreme Court of the United States Project MKULTRA Sant Thakar Singh Drug abuse James Bulger Childbirth Child abuse Daredevil Free will Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
