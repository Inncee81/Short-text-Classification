what is ur psycological opinion my man and i have some problems although we were both born in england his family are muslim he however doesn't practice my belief is that you accept an individual as they are and when we first met over a year ago i told him that i have a 'western' lifestyle although he accepts this he's worried about what his parents will think they live overseas and are due to come visit soon he said that if we go to a restaurant he would not want me to drink a glass of wine in front of them he also said that he doesn't want me to admit i am an atheist my reaction was why can't you accept me as i am in front of them just because i enjoy a glass of wine it doesn't make me an evil person i refused to live a lie in front of anyone and asked him to accept me as i am he ended up in tears saying he was confused and didn't know what to do cos he loves me but wants to make them happy too i suggested that perhaps he marry someone of his parent's choice or be his own man and be with a woman that makes him happy tired of it all i asked him to leave today he texted me to say he needs to sort himself out and won't stand in the way of my happiness shall i wait to see what happens or just move on it's a shame cos we both love one another but i don't see why i should fundamentally change who i am for anyone he's willing to accept you until mummy daddy come to town well sounds like he's going to have to choose between pleasing the parents or growing a spine could be a growing experience Shaggy dog story Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sexual orientation Infantilism Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Yoko Ono Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Pitaten Alcoholics Anonymous Humphrey Bogart Muslim ibn Aqeel Knots Landing EastEnders Fiddler on the Roof The Contender (television series) Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Eastern Orthodox Church French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Marriage The Death Gate Cycle Abortion debate Past teachings of Prem Rawat Meaning of life Social rule Divorce Plame affair Simone Weil Sin City Kodocha Sharon Tate Ocean's Twelve Avenue Q Haven (TNG episode) The Critic Sant Thakar Singh Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Jam (TV series) Justification (theology) About a Boy Creationism Le Malade imaginaire Time Out of Mind Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Transactional analysis The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Theodicy Human Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Incarnations of Immortality God Emperor of Dune Liam Gallagher Religious conversion Sydney Riot of 1879 God Current teachings of Prem Rawat Alois Hitler Dead Like Me Mummy Mother Teresa Jiddu Krishnamurti Atheism W.I.T.C.H.
