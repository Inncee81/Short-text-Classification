i want to hear your opinion y r some pple pathological liars recently i stumbled upon a question it referred to a previous question so in trying to understand i looked at the persons profile and saw numerous questions one question had a predicament of being poor another of being rich another of being pregnant almost ready to give birth whereas the week before a question was posted saying how this person was a virgin it got me thinking why do some ppl feel such a need to make up insane stories and furthermore why do some ppl thrive on guilt pity envy and jealousy i am not just talking of this answerer but ppl in general im curious at ur take on this i think compulsive lying stems from in most cases an overwhelming and constant sense of insecurity amongst ones peers a need to be congratulated admired adored respected or seen as special there is also the biologists understanding in which one can look at the animal world and our own and see that lying or bluffing are perfectly good tools for the acquisition of mates and status there are some theories i have heard which point to an imbalance in compulsive liars in which their brains see lying as a perfectly natural and viable device i like both these theories and think there is something meritous in both observations and i think that when it comes to our peers we have to be tolerant of compulsive liars to an extent and understand that they lie without premeditation it is something they do without thinking Lie Asperger syndrome Abortion debate Human nature Appeal Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Autism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Karen Horney A Course In Miracles Soul Narcissism Intelligent design Philosophy of language Cult Obsessive-compulsive disorder Conspiracy theory Serial killer Human Creationism Psychosis Science Dyslexia Religion Deconstruction Consciousness Immortality Socrates Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Philosophy of mathematics Clinical depression Cognitive science Goodness and value theory Theodicy Origin belief Bertrand Russell Rat Park Sigmund Freud Judicial functions of the House of Lords Problem of universals Controversies in autism Ethics Person Free will The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Child sexuality Gender identity Psychotherapy Psychology Dualism (philosophy of mind) Scientology beliefs and practices Hearing impairment Atomism Iago Psychology of religion Scientific method The Catcher in the Rye Creation and evolution in public education Saruman Friends Aphasia The Brothers Karamazov The nature of God in Western theology Zoophilia Shaggy dog story Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Knots Landing Adult attention-deficit disorder Sharon Tate Simone Weil Ontological argument Bernard Williams Stuttering Homosexuality and transgender Motivation Peer review Biology Robert Oppenheimer Exploitation Summa Theologiae Objectivist philosophy Aesthetic Realism Cyberspace Stomach cancer W.
