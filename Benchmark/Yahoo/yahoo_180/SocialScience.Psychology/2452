how can i change having a distorted body image i can't take looking in the mirror and see what i do im a male ' pounds and when i look in the mirror all i see is a guy that needs to loose weight how can i change this im tired of seeing what i do in the mirror three things would help seek professional help really this is going to be weird at first because normally men don't have such severe body image problems but if you actually tell a doctor or counselor exactly what you told us here there are therapies that can help you with the body image problem mainly things you can do to control your internal self talk about your body find new friends who don't emphasize appearance so much i'm not saying the friends you have are bad but right now you need to hear it from other people real people live and face to face that you're not even remotely fat that you are in fact skinny as a rail and could really use a bit of meat on your bones and you also need to hear that it doesn't matter really that people like you for you not your reflection in a mirror and yes you won't believe one word of it at first which is why you need many people telling you this over and over and over again until the truth sinks in it's called a reality check five feet eight inches tall at pounds is skinny for a young girl if you think you are fat at this point it is a delusion get some exercise get yourself around people who think in terms of function seriously stop looking at a mirror and start looking at a stopwatch if you like track field events or a stack of weights you lift get yourself in the habit of seeing yourself in terms of what you can do and not how you look it seems simple but it can be the hardest thing to do because you won't be able to do a lot at first which is why you will need buddies who understand at least a little and can help you celebrate your early small victories i hope this is helpful and remember this is in some ways a fairly serious delusion that is a threat to yourself you could end up killing yourself by starvation if this is allowed to go on unchecked so do something pick at least one item from the list above and get started today that is the least you can do but honestly at this point you will need to attempt all three if you really want to make progress Equine conformation Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Theory of conduct Milton H.
