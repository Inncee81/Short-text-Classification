is it bad to be negative okay im not hardcore negative but im pretty negative i usually think about the bad things that can happen to me or other people my friend thinks thats a really bad thing because she said i will never be able to enjoy anything if i keep being negative but my theory is im only negative so that i can be prepared for all the bad things that come to me in this crazy wacko world and if a positive thing happens to me then i can be more thankful i mean think about it this is what i do i plan a trip to california and i think what if the plan crashes what if it rains in california what if theres a major heat wave and if nothing happens then im thankful that it didnt happen is it bad to be like this should i change i'm not comfortable with the words good and bad in this context of course it's a good idea to be aware of what negative things can happen but only if this allows you to prevent the negative things if you are worried about the possibility of a safe falling out of a window when you walk in the city that is a useless waste of your brain cells and then your friend has a point where is joy in your world view when can you sit down and look at the sunrise and just totally enjoy it if you're worried about the possibility of a mugger sneaking up behind you while you're looking at a sunrise you're missing something important there is a point at which you need to just let go of your worries and let things be negative things may happen this is a fact but beyond doing normal things to prevent this worrying about it is not helpful Theory of conduct Happiness Humphrey Bogart Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Meme Goodness and value theory Shaggy dog story Grunge music Paul Feyerabend Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Jon Secada Twelve leverage points Transactional analysis Spidey Super Stories Ethics Social rule 2005 Belgian Grand Prix About a Boy Mojave people Futurama (TV series - season 5) The Star Wars Holiday Special Teen Girl Squad God Emperor of Dune Inflation Avenue Q Transsexuality Kasparov versus The World Scientology beliefs and practices Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Hardcore punk Infantilism Milton H.
