am i loosing my mind hi guys lately whenever i see a digital clock we only have these at home i am keep seeing three or four same number for example pm am pm etc etc this happens pretty often about of the times when i look at the clock to see what time it is what is this mean i sometimes believe superficial stuff so would anyone know waht this possibly mean should i just not worry about it i hope some person would help me what's going on thanks oops i meant superstitious haha thanks it's quite possible that when the clock shows an odd time like or because of the insignificance you don't remember or take note of it this is the same reason that some people say i always get stuck in a long line when there is no line it's insignificant see what i mean either way if it has been happening it is probably just a coincidence unless of course khronos has it out for you and i think superstitious not superficial is the word you're looking for Time Out of Mind Max Martin CPU design I Want to Hold Your Hand Saga (band) Asperger syndrome Social rule W.
