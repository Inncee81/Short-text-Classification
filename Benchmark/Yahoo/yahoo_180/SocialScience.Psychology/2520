why do we hurt the ones we love is this just a selfish act in all of us and at somepoint we hurt someone around us it just usally ends up being the people closest to us and therefore those that we love that we hurt i ask this because someone who i met online and had several great chats with we were gettign along great and i got so upset yesterday for no good reason and sent her a horrible email now i've ruined it all i wouldn't expect her to forgive me because i have destroyed the trust and it wouldn't ever be the same again but why did i do it i don't understand why i got so emotional is it easier to be angry online is that the problem also probably quite importantly we both suffer from depression i think i've just made her problems much worse i've said my apologies but i don't think we can even be friends again now it isn't because we love ourselves more it's because the other person loves and cares for us if you sent the same e mail to someone you didnt love they probably wouldnt think twice about it don't be hard on yourself if you both suffer depression and you have sent your apologies i am sure she will forgive you as she knows that you are a depressive good luck and get things back on track soon xxx ps we all do it depressive or not selfish or selfless Theory of conduct Social rule Anger management John Howard Yoder Prisoner's dilemma Humphrey Bogart Pitaten Fruits Basket Evil The Beach Boys God Emperor of Dune Shaggy dog story Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Alignment (role-playing games) One Tree Hill (TV series) Theodicy Babe Ruth Jon Secada Altruism Friends EastEnders Solar Element Saga Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Knots Landing Piccolo Junior Saga Clinical depression Kodocha Bernard Williams Great Depression Transactional analysis John Berryman Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an A Course In Miracles Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Love Alcoholics Anonymous Hearing impairment Etiquette Oh My Goddess!
