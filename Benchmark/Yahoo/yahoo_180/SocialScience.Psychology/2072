ever had a dream where you can fly whenerver i think of it i always remember that song if i could fly i'd take you up i'd take you into the night so on yes whenever i dream of flying i can soar high and peacefully having the ability to go anyplace i wish and it gives me a wonderful sense of freedom perhaps since reality can often be so heavy god allows us to find peace and freedom from that reality when we are asleep The Amber Spyglass Dream Philosophical skepticism Lucid dreaming Cliff Richard Out-of-body experience W.I.T.C.H.
