you shouldn't judge a person by their looks but don't you find their weight a good predictor of behavior some might think i'm a monster for posting this that's up to you maybe you know lots of monsters the truth is in social situations i have found that my friends and my family members change their behavior as they lose or gain weight it is not a monstrous thing to say that as most people gain weight they tend to be less outgoing yes i think it is a good predictor it may not be a magic ball that gives you the perfect determination of someone's behavior but in many cases it can be telltale in inferring one's actions i also think the behaviors vary by gender ouch i just felt the future thumbs down coming to give an example i know a lovely heavy set woman we are just getting to know each other as colleagues and when we had a business lunch at a buffet i already knew that she would have less on her plate than anyone else why because she was aware that she was the thickest woman there and didn't want to fulfill any preconceptions she thought we may have had of her in contrast i knew that one of the larger men was going to have a lot on his plate he seemed resigned and comfortable with himself and gave an aura of hey you can see i didn't get this big eating salad i know its generalizing i know its not full proof and i hate that someone is probably making a potentially false prediction about my behavior based on my weight but i think the idea has merit Shaggy dog story Sexual orientation CPU cache Newcomb's paradox Gender role Theory of conduct Garfield Ethics God Human height Social rule Branch predictor Microeconomics Biology and sexual orientation Theodicy Physical attractiveness Neuro-linguistic programming Evil Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Human sexual behavior Free will Species Philosophy of language Socrates Homophobia Autism Infantilism Determinism Binge eating disorder Supply and demand Calvin and Hobbes Transsexuality Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Logic Predestination Friedrich Schleiermacher Intelligent design Bisexuality Altruism Domestic violence Social psychology Soul Paradox Plame affair Sola fide Coercion Summa Theologiae Vacuous truth Milton H.
