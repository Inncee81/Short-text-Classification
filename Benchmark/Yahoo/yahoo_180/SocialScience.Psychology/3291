is anyone interested in science anymore when i was in school years back my real only interest was history and i could never even think of developing an interest in science probably because it was too difficult to be learning a complete new language and at the same time dealing with scientific projects etc after decades of reading everything and anything available i developed varied interests among them science and also want to learn the answer to things that appear to have no explanation but somehow feel that most people are not really interested in finding out anything new or simply don't care about why some things are the way they are is it just me who gets this feeling dying children are very interested in science when children become terminally ill they desperately want to know everything they can in a hurry about this world before they leave it that's what i do i privately teach a special science curriculum that provides dying children with a satisfying understandable grand overview of what we know so far about the universe and nature Science Education in the United States Software engineering Homeschooling Rudolf Hermann Lotze Education Graduate school Asperger syndrome Teach the Controversy Intelligent design movement Psychology Anthropology Supernatural Geography Education in Portugal Scientific method Logic Autism Bah__'__ Faith and Education Classical education Meaning of life GED Intelligent design Waldorf Education Franz Boas Theory of conduct Religion Physician Education in the Republic of Ireland Creationism A Course In Miracles The Subtle Knife Education in the People's Republic of China Aesthetic Realism Reincarnation Atheism Mathematics Creation science Richard Feynman Immanuel Kant Church of Christ, Scientist Social rule Epistemology Librarian Philosophy of science High school Novel History of science Medicine Education in Hong Kong Nurse Philosophy of language Human Evolutionary creationism Rudolf Steiner SAT Past teachings of Prem Rawat German student movement Motivation Creation and evolution in public education Falsifiability Determinism Leo Strauss Sant Thakar Singh Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Incarnations of Immortality Second language acquisition Developmental psychology Magical thinking Education in Germany Education in France Education in Japan Teacher Chinese University of Hong Kong Atomism Open access Gravity Androgen insensitivity syndrome Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Duke University School of Medicine Traumatic incident reduction Deconstruction Current teachings of Prem Rawat Public policy Experiential education Francis Crick Dyslexia Master's degree Sexual orientation Friedrich Schleiermacher A New Kind of Science Milton H.
