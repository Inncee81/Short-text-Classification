is the cloud nine game similair to hypnosis did u ever play cloud nine when u were little i would with people and my one friend would have trouble waking up from it and sometimes she would shake and bang her head on the ground when we were able to get her out of it she would say she didint remmeber anything she did it a few times and quit casue it was scarring her so do you think that cloud nine is somehting like hypnosis or do you think its something else is it not like the chocking game at all i know they maybe call it that now nothing is cut off they just lay down with there eys closed rub there temples and you guide them calmly though clouds and ask what they see it sounds like the deadly game some kids have been playing recently in which you cut off the blood supply and oxygen to the brain and actually kill brain cells in the process which is why she didn't remember anything she is literally passing out no it is nothing like hypnosis and is extremely dangerous and rather stupid to do Hypnosis Blood (computer game) Traumatic brain injury Stroke Fist of the North Star Characters of Naruto Naruto jutsu Lightning Methamphetamine Shaggy dog story Sin City Drowning Naval mine Carbon dioxide One Piece minor characters Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Abduction Phenomenon Treehouse of Horror XV Intracranial pressure Vegeta Bob and George Darken Rahl Stem cell Milton H.
