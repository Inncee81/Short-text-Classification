have you ever tried to become an alcoholic on first glance this may seem like a stupid question maybe it is years ago i was watching my friends sister who would come home from work light up a cigarette and have a few glasses of wine i already smoked so i thought hey she seemed really relaxed and then i tried to get into the habit of drinking every night after work so what im asking is have you ever deliberately tried to get yourself into a bad habit in an effort to immitate somebody else by the way i know this was a silly thing to do i am just curious and bored it was years ago and it lasted for a few days lol don't worry i seriously am just asking questions out of curiosity i thought i was too skinny when i was and i wanted breasts like my sister who weighed more so i drank a milkshake every day to gain weight i overdid it and have never been able to lose it all again wish i could go back and do it over Shaggy dog story Social rule Australian words Breastfeeding Nineteen Eighty-Four Sharon Tate Futurama (TV series - season 5) EastEnders Mojave people Kurt Cobain Liam Gallagher Columbo Caffeine Moonshine Tea Dead Like Me Milton H.
