how can i stop myself from caring too much i do know that people have lives outside the net thats ok with me i do have friends best friends in real life and not negleted them as far as i know but on here the computer yahoo answers i have found myself caring deeply about a few people on here but i am not happy my reasons if you upset them its not like you can try and make up with them as you can with a real life friend because they can block you and or change their email addy name if something bad happens to them like they are no longer part of the mortal coil you wont ever know i used to know this guy years ago online he had aids i still think about him anyway how can i separate these feelings for people that i wont ever be meeting for real i feel depressed thinking about it now and close to crying and this girl i used to talk to she was afraid of her boyfriend she and i used to talk everyday then suddenly she stopped coming online never stop thinking about her and wondering if maybe there was some way i could've saved her you can't stop caring becasue that is your nature you have friends online and they are every bit as real as the friends you have outside don't forget for every letter word and sentence that you read online there is a real person typing them in at the other end in real life you encounter ppl who 'touch' your life and you wonder what became of them when you suddenly stop seeing them and you have no way to find out unless of course you know someone who knows them a network of friends just like you have online but even in real life you can't always repair the damage that is done to a relationship ppl can ignore you in the street and even move to get away from you the answer to how you seperate your feelings is to know where your stuff ends and theirs begins you cannot take responsibility for every little thing that happens to someone else if you can have some small impact on their lives that's as much as you can hope for and recognise that no matter how much you try you are not going to get everyone in the world to like you some ppl will hate you for no other reason than because they can it is unrealistic to expect even most ppl to like you so long as you like yourself because that is the one person you can't get away from then everyone else who likes you too is a bonus p s how do you know you'll never meet us for real i'm buying my train ticket as we speak Friends Avenue Q Theory of conduct Pitaten The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Social rule Milton H.
