borderline personality disorer panic attacks and the sopranos so i'm not a psych student or anything of that nature but i've done a little reading and have experiences with panic attacks i do know that hollywood and the entertainment industry tends to falsify mental illnesses but sometimes they get it right as foolish as it seems to me to ask about information from a tv show and a drama nonetheless my question is can panic attacks really make a person pass out i'm terrified i'll pass out when i panic and have even had everything go fuzzy or even nearly blind but never have a i passed out is it possible to fall over like that and tony soprano's mom one of his lovers and his sister probably are they really what a borderline personality can be like i just started watching a few months ago on a e and have seen about episodes including the end of season all of season and half of season i think irina and gloria two of tony's girlfriends are borderline personality disorder i missed season one and most of so i will have to buy the dvd so i didn't see a lot of his mother i think is his sister janice is less so definitely gloria is a classic case The Sopranos Alias (TV series) Bipolar disorder Charmed Borderline personality disorder Friends Blue Heelers Agoraphobia EastEnders Alignment (role-playing games) Dissociative identity disorder Tony Soprano Shaggy dog story Psychology Days of our Lives The Ashlee Simpson Show Happy Days Monk (TV series) American Dreams Six Feet Under 24 (television) Sydney Bristow Titanic (1997 film) Clinical depression Sally Ann Howes Gabriel Batistuta Treehouse of Horror V The Brady Bunch Good Times Once and Again Another World (TV series) Species One Tree Hill (TV series) FoxTrot Chuck Cunningham syndrome Seinfeld Sex and the City Poker jargon Starfleet ranks and insignia Neon Genesis Evangelion Memento (film) The Contender (television series) Anxiety Family Guy Dallas (TV series) The O.C.
