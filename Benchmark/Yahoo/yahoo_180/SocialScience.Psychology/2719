can i change my personality i am happy with some aspects of my personality but others i hate and i think they have deep roots in my pyschey can i change the bits i dislike and how serious answers please you can only change certain aspects of your personality we all do it throughout our life the experience is leading us to changing certain things and there are certain things that you could change quicker than others depending on life style people that you go out etc but really to change your personality entirely or radically the answer i guess is no we are born with a genetic laguage that you can not choose pick or change is the same with changing your family you may change members you may get new members but you can never change your biological parents or siblings it works the same it depends really on what is bothering you u could try and adopt new routes to avoid certain things and u may succeed it very much depends on whats there that u want changed really you are definitely one big step forward as you realise what needs changing which means that you know yourself fairly well which is a fab thing u are the only one able to asses the extend of how much and what u could change about yourself the motivation is the key but also think the support you are getting will help making a difference good luck and believe in yourself good stuff Species Human Theory of conduct Evolution Adoption Rich Mullins Goodness and value theory Extreme Programming Karen Horney Nature versus nurture Altruism Abortion debate 2000 Australian Grand Prix Current teachings of Prem Rawat Family Social psychology Moral objectivism Social rule Androgen insensitivity syndrome Gender role Meaning of life Cryptanalysis Wheel of Fortune Utilitarianism Creationism Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Nicomachean Ethics Shaggy dog story CPU cache Inheritance (computer science) Soul Password Happiness Family name Economics Transactional analysis Shit EastEnders Napier's bones God English grammar Transsexuality Software engineering Aesthetic Realism Brave New World Quantum computer W.
