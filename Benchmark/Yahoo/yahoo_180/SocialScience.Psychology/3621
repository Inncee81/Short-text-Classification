how do you get over a game that is really addictive i'm really addictive to this game online which i've been playing for at least months it's been hurting my eyes and my parents are really worried about it so i tried to quit it for at least four months but it's been driving me crazy nothing at home interests me the television is not working i don't want to read for another two hours and everyone's busy so i can't even chat with my friends there's nothing to do outside and my family is too busy right now to take us out to fun places i want to play it so bad but feel would feel guilty if i play it this soon what should i do to stop obsess over this online game i stopped playing everquest when my life became too busy for me to have time to sit down and play anymore i didn't even want to i just didn't have the time to justify the subscription cost and i hated letting my in game friends down when they were expecting me to sign on only to never see me online anymore so i finally gave it up now that i've gotten a bit more time in my life my boyfriend and i have picked up world of warcraft and i'm enjoying it a lot but i never want to play if i have other stuff that needs done first i think the biggest reason to play is it's something to do with your free time you're human your eyes are going to deteriorate naturally anyway any kind of computer use is probably going to contribute to that but you can't go through life being paranoid and never using a computer because of it just means you need glasses one thing you could do if you're really adamant about not playing is to write fan fiction stories based in the world of whatever game it was you played i always enjoyed writing but never had anything to write about and once i started playing everquest all these story ideas kept popping into my head so you could write and be creative that way and still enjoy the game by writing about it and if nothing else just find more hobbies and things to do to fill your time the more busy you are the less time you'll have to think about the game you're not playing MMORPG Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Social rule Kodocha Avenue Q EverQuest Douglas Adams 1957 World Series Max Martin Pure Pwnage One Tree Hill (TV series) Neopets EastEnders Fight Club Computer role-playing game W.I.T.C.H.
