he said 'i don't care i can't take it anymore ' my ex and i have stopped speaking to each other and i've been much happier since i wonder how he is and if he thinks of me but i know it's better this way he's dateing my best friend and thats a long story i had a dream last night that he and i were at a basball field at sometime around three am and it was like between third and fourth base we were sitting on a bench and i saw his face and he looked at me and said 'i don't care i can't take it anymore' and started makeing out with me as you can imagine the relationship ended badly so my feelings and opinions of him aren't that great and i wonder what this means i remember while i was kissing him in the dream that my heart wasn't in it like thats what i was thinking my hearts not in this this is wrong i got up and walked away from him and went into a diner kinda like one from the 's or 's and then i woke up i don't have feelings for him anymore and thats another long story just that he can't care about who i am now and i can't forgive him for what he did to me i can in time but he can't even accept who i am to be a friend i really thought he was the last one for me and most people will say your too young to be in love but i don't think so it happens when it does but i can't understand why this pops up now when my feelings are gone is my mind telling me something i don't know or just reinstateing it or maybe someone can just tell me what this dreams means that would be appreciated too it was him that initiated the break he said i wasn't there when i told him when i graduated life would get hard he knew i wasn't gonna be so available he lives not even of a mile away from me he has my email both of my numbers he knows where i worked and in three months he contacted me three times he's dateing my best friend because he thought i didn't want him anymore when he went with me to get my tattoo done we were supposed to talk about it us getting back together and he thought because i didn't say anything i had changed my mind so in my mind he started comeing up with the reasons that i'm not good enough i tried to be his friend since the break up just because it would be harder on my friend to be in the middle i tried five times i think i know there was at least four and it never worked they both asked me before they got together if i was ok with it and i was furious so i said yes it was fine but i was hurt it's been a long months getting over him it's your subconscious' way of reaffirming that you've made the right decision to move on with your life you said you walked away from the kiss that you thought that it was wrong perhaps a part of you was wondering if you've made the right decision maybe you didn't realize it at the time but perhaps a part of you did because as you said you thought he was the last one in your dream your mind has put all the pieces of the puzzle together and given you the answer you wanted all along confirmation that it's best if you moved on with you life and forget as best you can about the person who caused you pain it's a sort of closure mentally it should get easier to put thoughts of him aside after this hope that helps good luck Shaggy dog story Jon Secada Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Theory of conduct Kodocha Humphrey Bogart Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Time Out of Mind Social rule Cliff Richard One Tree Hill (TV series) Blood on the Tracks The Amber Spyglass Milton H.
