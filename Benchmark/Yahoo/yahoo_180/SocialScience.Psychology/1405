what do you think i can do i need help i'm and i have been abused when i was very young my life was so bad i felt much better as soon as i just talked to a friend of mine about years ago now i'm a different person this is the point my girlfriend and i have a great relation great sex but she told me about her sexual experiences she had several partners i don't judge her but i think what i missed because i was so afraid of everything i didn't do the things that a teenager usually do and i'm more jealous of it than disappointed i think that it's going to affect our relation because of me and i don't want to lose her what do you think about it i'm sorry if my english isn't good but i'm learning thanks you should really seek therapy for dealing with your abuse you said that you felt much better after you told a friend imagine how much more better you'd be if you had someone trained to help you with this and your girlfriend should understand if you tell her it makes you uncomfortable to hear the details of her past sex life remember it's in the past and there's nothing to be done to change it there's no reason to be bringing it up now if it's hurting your relationship One Tree Hill (TV series) Theory of conduct Polyamory Human sexual behavior Infantilism Transsexuality Traumatic incident reduction About a Boy Pedophilia Social rule Ex-gay Milton H.
