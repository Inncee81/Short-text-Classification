i think my friend has a personality disorder so ive been procrastinating about asking this for a while he moved away from his our friends that live in a hood for lack of a better word and now he hates them because they were neglectful manipulative deceitful and disgusting but what im thinking is that he never through himself into any situations and he sat off to the side if you know what i mean so all summer hes had no friends because for a whole semester he was easing up on becoming friends with new people hes been watching a lot of anime we're asian friends he knows that anime isnt real but he believes in parallel worlds and says that life would be a lot better if it anime was life so to me thats morose ignorance and a tiny hint of schizophrenia he also thinks highly about himself but is very antisocial to people he doesnt know does sound as if this guy is having some increasing psychological issues and he probably does need some professional investigation but there isn't much you or any of the others can do in that direction as he would certianly not be very receptive if you tried to get into that subject with him quite honestly with all the bad stuff that we have been getting to hear about in the past few years with some kid who has been acting weird suddenly going right over the edge and going on a rampage i'm not sure i'd want to hang around him any more if i were in your shoes Procrastination Psychosis Antisocial personality disorder Evil Autism Married... with Children Ed, Edd n Eddy Narcissism EastEnders Teen Girl Squad Theory of conduct Stuttering Pok__mon Live!
