how do i hold my head up high and smile when i really am crying inside well you can only be as happy as you allow yourself to be for example if some one close to you dies you could go into depression and not talk to anyone for a year or you could understand that dieing is the way of life and then get on with yours don t spend your life being upset think about what it is your crying about and then get out a piece of paper and write down all the reasons why that shouldn t be making you sad when you re older and you look back on your life don t you want to think about how much fun you had and not how much you were crying just try to stay positive and if you cant make your self be happy then you might have depression and if that s the case then i suggest going to get help depression medicine can help a lot and it will make your life better well good luck Pitaten Social rule Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story The Shining (film) About a Boy Scenes from a Memory Kodocha The Ashlee Simpson Show The Smoking Room Kender The Amber Spyglass Friends Jon Secada Happiness The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe The Emancipation of Mimi Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Miss Saigon Laguna Loire The Catcher in the Rye Bart Sells His Soul Avenue Q Bernard Williams Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Current teachings of Prem Rawat The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Minor characters in Morrowind The Contender (television series) Characters in the Smurfs Charles Darwin's illness The Midnight Sun Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind I Don't Wanna Cry Clinical depression Time Out of Mind The Beach Boys Samuel Goldwyn My Life as a Teenage Robot Care Bears Anya Jenkins Shit The Marshall Mathers LP The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Blonde on Blonde Vanilla Ninja Zhao Yun Le Malade imaginaire Knots Landing Tennessee Williams Chess strategy and tactics Columbine High School massacre Bipolar disorder Teen Girl Squad The Beatles discography Year of the Spider True Crime: Streets of LA Poker jargon Highway 61 Revisited The Inside Piccolo Junior Saga Theodicy Smile (album) Missouri Compromise Nico Robin L'Arc-en-Ciel Great Depression John Lott Reservoir Dogs Brian Wilson Another Side of Bob Dylan Sting (musician) Stroke Edward VIII of the United Kingdom Richard Rahl Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Aerial (dance move) Deconstruction Ra (board game) Kurt Tucholsky Karma Anne Rice Raisins (South Park episode) Don Rosa Carrie Jacobs-Bond John Berryman Keynesian economics K' Frankie Laine Yami no Matsuei The Drifters Phoebe Buffay's songs Wallflower (comics) Stan Laurel Sheryl Crow Noel Gallagher Cliff Richard Ben Jonson Gregg Alexander Magical thinking
