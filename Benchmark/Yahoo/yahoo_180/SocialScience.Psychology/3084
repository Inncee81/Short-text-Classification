why and how is it when you are dreaming about something and suddenly theres a sound but your dream has been building up to the nosie take last night i was dreaming about something and then all of a sudden there was a baby and i knew it was just about to cry and i was waiting quite a bit for it to cry and it did but then i woke up and there was actually a baby crying in the next room which i could hear maybe this isnt the best example ive had loads more but i cant really remember them its like you know what noise is going to happen next hmmm why and how thanks x that happened to me before i'm no scientist but my guess is that the noise gets processed into your head while you're sleeping dreaming and i guess to your prior knowledge you know what a baby is like before crying and your brain displays that image in your head assuming that you woke up soon after the dream baby cries my guess again is that your brain plays that image in order for your subconscious brain to catch up to the outside reality world when you wake up again this is just what i think others here have more scientific explanation than me Out-of-body experience Shaggy dog story Dream Lucid dreaming Jon Secada Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Telepathy The Shining (film) Philosophical skepticism Unconscious mind The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) House of M Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Cognitive science Sleep Scenes from a Memory Futurama (TV series - season 5) What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?
