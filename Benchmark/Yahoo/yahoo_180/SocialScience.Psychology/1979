was this old hag syndrome it was about or in the morning my door was closed and my window was closed i was facing my window and i woke up to something jumping up and down my bed something was jumping on the side my back was facing i could feel it jumping i couldn't turn over and i couldn't move basically i could open my eyes i tried to look for a shadow but saw nothing i also couldn't hear anything usually you could hear the ac working or the fish tank's filter running but there was dead silence so i tried to scream but nothing came out it was over in about seconds does this count as old hag that's the old hag syndrome something like of the population has experienced some form of it at least once my neice just recently got scared out of her wits by it so i ended up reading up on it a little apparently it is a natural paralyzed state that your mind uses on your body to keep it from acting out your dreams which is why if you awake abrubtly you cannot move and some of your senses are messed up it can last a few seconds up to a minute on average but can feel longer when you're in that transition state of dreamland and reality or it could be a demon or witch of some kind who are we to say in this age of reason i personally like the ancient supernatural explanation better it's more fun Lucid dreaming Out-of-body experience Sin City Shaggy dog story The Subtle Knife Phoebe Halliwell Milton H.
