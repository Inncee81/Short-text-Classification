i don't think i need the therapist anymore earlier i was feeling really awful crying my eyes out for no real reason couldn't get up to do anything but after y answers a magazine nap i was awakened by the therapist i called earlier but at this point i had forgotten about what happened and she unintentionally reminded me although i'm trying to convince myself if i can be strong the first time then i shouldn't let it bother me anymore i'm really annoyed actually i was awakened by my nap to have someone ask me what was wrong but i know she was just trying to help and i'm sure she called back because i probably sounded so terrible in the message earlier the depression is on and off it seems after some people interaction i can usually go on ive wanted to see a therapist for some time now but i think this will just make things worse after i've seemed to bring myself up what do you guys think sorry if this is confusing and pls no mean or unnecessary answrs i would just prefer some supportive guidance thanks guys i don't want to feel like i'm wasting her time yet she said she'd call back with a session date for tomorrow should i decline there are times i feel im in a slum for too long days without leaving house yet other times i seem to be able to bring myself up but maybe it's a false high i don't know will it make it worse please don't think you are wasting the therapist's time you are as worthy as everyone else it is good that the therapist heard you when you were very upset and also that she knows you have the ability to lift yourself up therapy is a good idea because you say that you've wanted to seek therapy for some time the problem with depression is that it is not always acute and we cope and then decide that we really don't need help but later it becomes more acute and we wish we had the support if you go ahead and make the appointment i think it will give you some much needed personal care this forum just doesn't have that personal component Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Milton H.
