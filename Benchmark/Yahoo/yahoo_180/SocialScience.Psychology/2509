life future plans objectives i'm a very difficult person to be with i cant find someone i can relate to i like to enjoy life but unlike my friends i do plan for the future but again unlike them i just can see myself stuck at a school desk then my family mum dad and aunt are always interfering that i should continue studying since my eduation is not to be thrown away i got o levels or what you call gces my plan for life is still unclear i'd like to travel and it seems that everyone is against me my family friends etc they say that i won't cope without education and without them but i'd like to see different cultures people socialse with other people i dont like to get stuck in one place life is too short to do that i don't know what work will be good enough for me actually i've always dreamed since yrs old of being a pilot but again i've got astigmatism and i dont think i'd be accepted and my family says it's too damn risky is there som here like me any suggestions when i say that i cant relate to my friends is cause most of them yr olds like to party date and so on it's not that i dont like to party but twice a month is enough to party my idea of weekend is resting and to stop from daily routine then about datng i haven't found that person i can actually relate myself with i think i must chage category since and yr olds seem too childish when i say that i cant relate to my friends is cause most of them yr olds like to party date and so on it's not that i dont like to party but twice a month is enough to party my idea of weekend is resting and to stop from daily routine then about datng i haven't found that person i can actually relate myself with i think i must chage category since and yr olds seem too childish scarlett i relate to everything that you are saying you feel like i did years ago as i got out of high school i thought that i needed to go to school because everyone told me i should i didn t relate to kids my age guys my age i had to live a lie in order to make myself parents happy let me tell you my story in a nut shell i went to college right out of high school because i had wanted to be an architect since i was school living away from parents friends was very overwhelming for me on top of everything with each passing or shall i say not passing class i was faced with the realization that my childhood dream did not match my ability i ended up dropping out of school and then meeting a great guy whom i married i am now nearly and married years i found a job that i really liked and worked very hard and was very successful then i started to feel like i was wasting my god given gifts i am very intelligent as you seem to be i realized that i had to do something for the greater good of man so two years ago i decided to go back to school i took a class through my community college to help determine my major i have a gpa and i love school i am leaving this morning to drive ways across the country to pursue my major the best resource i have going back to school is years of real life experience it was hard to disappoint people by leaving school when i was young but you will never be able to please everyone as i look over your question i see your interest in traveling and seeing other cultures if you decide to pursue and education sociology might be a good field if you don t do college maybe the military would be good my husband was in the air force and even though he didn t pilot a plane he got to fly on one and travel around the world lastly i think i will say you are young and you will make mistakes those mistakes will define who you are and give you great stories to tell when you get older i do not regret the path that i am on because it is the life i chose for myself life should be a journey and not a destination so go out and live it even if it isn t the life someone else would choose good luck to you EastEnders One Tree Hill (TV series) About a Boy Pitaten Kodocha Shaggy dog story Humphrey Bogart God Emperor of Dune Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Social rule Avenue Q Friends Knots Landing Education in the People's Republic of China Phoebe Halliwell W.I.T.C.H.
