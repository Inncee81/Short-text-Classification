how does a person get self confidence and not fake it for just a moment i tend to have moments of self confidence however i see others on a daily basis that no matter what situation they are in they are confident how can i get that everyday without worrying in every situation if i will measure up everything from my job my kids sports school my weight the way i dress and look i always feel someone is out doing me and i feel less than them comparisons are tedious you shouldn't compare yourself to anybody but yourself you should always try to be the best person you can be which means being yourself and doing what you love to do you should compare yourself from time to time to older versions of yourself and ask questions such as these am i a better person than i was a week ago am i doing what i like to do are you working harder towards a goal self confidence doesn't come easily to everybody nevertheless in order to be truly self confident you have to trust yourself trust who you are you have to be confortable in your own skin for instance consider this hypothetical situation you like classical music by mozart whereas most people today like rock pop rap hip hop etc you can either tell your friends you don't listen to the music they do or you can lie and tell them you do listen to rock and pop the first choice would show you are confident because you are confortable with who you are you accept the fact you might be different with regards to your music taste but you like that music and there's nothing wrong with that the second choice shows you aren't confident because you like to give yourself a different image in front of your friends to be confident means you have to have trust trust in yourself just stop worrying about what other people do how other people look or how confident other people appear to be learn to trust you instincts your personal choices your personal tastes etc after all you are independent and unique and you are responsible for yourself nobody can tell you what to do and nobody can bring you down unless you allow them to again don't compare yourself to other people and just concentrate on being a happy and loving person or whichever type of person you choose to be good luck Social rule Goodness and value theory Theory of conduct Singlish Shaggy dog story Kylie Minogue Current teachings of Prem Rawat Popular music Music genre The Emancipation of Mimi Donovan Transactional analysis Theodicy Aerial (dance move) Doomsday argument Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Unemployment Hip hop music Sharon Tate Past teachings of Prem Rawat Expert system We Belong Together Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pitaten Nicomachean Ethics Music Polyamory Epistemology The Contender (television series) Hip hop rivalries Hip hop culture Happiness Plame affair Predestination Gender role 2004 Republican National Convention Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Jumping the shark Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Authentic performance Margin of error God Emperor of Dune Jennifer Lopez The Adventures of Pete & Pete Surveillance Utilitarianism Philosophy of language Missy Elliott Music radio Sola fide Humphrey Bogart Piccolo Junior Saga Garth Brooks About a Boy Milton H.
