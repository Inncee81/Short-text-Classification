please help put yourself in this scenareo your gf decides to move where you live to be with you cause you both wanted it and also for her to see if she could have better luck to find a job where you live so she does moves out with you and she finds a job and she is happy on the other hand she is totally in love with you and even though she has a job where she is happy with she doesnt really care about it as much as she cares about you for her if you break up she will just go back to her town cause you are and were the main reason why she moved away from home now you are in a situation where you just lost your job u dont really know what do you want exactly and that is giving you a lot of stress so here you are y o unemployed dont really knows what he wants guy with a gf who cares and loves you who dreams to one day share a life with you but also wants to see you happy and support you with whatever you want to do but who desires to know from you whats next do you see both of you as a couple and also you know that if you guys break up she will be gone but don t that you don t really know what do you want yet so all of this is giving you a lot of stress and putting you and your gf in a stressful situation she feels like she is giving everything and she is being patient to you so she thinks she deserves to know what is going to happen with both of you but she is aware that you are not in the best situation to come with a plan so my question here is would you be able to break up with her or would you start doing things and behaving in a certain way to push her away so she will be the one breaking up does this girl should do as much as wants and can to work things out with him since she really loves him and anything else you want to add to this confuse and in love girl thanx you seem to point out things where going well with this couple until he lost his job now he doesn't know what he wants now she's not certain if he wishes to break up with her now she's thinking of throwing all out the window well i would suspect for him it is a mid life crisis nothing to be surprised of when becoming unemployed at that age it's almost natural to not know what you want after that specially if that job was not a professional job he has to take decisions but before he must get over the blow and stand up again start all over again at that time he can't think of breaking up with her though he is pissed with himself and takes it on her on the other hand she seems to be an easy going good for laughs no fuss girl great to have around until things go wrong because then she can't handle stress and doesn't really know how to take control of situations that's serious matter maybe that's why kids are not an issue she likes to see movies with a happy ending and she is worried she's not in one so don't leave him we guys are not happy all the time but when we are mad it's not always against you think about it again when he's back in his feet Social rule Friends Avenue Q Pitaten Theory of conduct Characters in the Smurfs Atomic Kitten Humphrey Bogart Kodocha Jon Secada Knots Landing Time Out of Mind About a Boy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an 2000 Australian Grand Prix The Ashlee Simpson Show Transactional analysis Milton H.
