i found a idea ok the title was huge but to get to the topic i found a way to memorize stuff how many of u have a favorite song just pretend u raised ur hand how many of u can sing it word for word cause u got a ipod or some thing that u listen it with since it is your favorite chances are u will listen a long time so that means it will get engraved in your head just pretend we do the same thing but what ever u want engraved in your head ok to put in simpler words you will listen to what u want to memorize in your ipod and sooner or later it will get engraved in your head it is a known fact that people tend to recall songs verbatim when set to music rather than be able to quote something from text just by reading and memorizing it next time you need to remember something set it to your favorite tune you will be better off and happier that you remembered it no ipods intended Empire Burlesque Roxette Tao Te Ching Apple Computer Time Out of Mind IPod Gramophone record Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Beatles for Sale Theory of conduct She Loves You Musical mode ITunes Love and Theft I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue ITunes Music Store RISC I Want to Hold Your Hand Mixtape Hey Jude God Save the Queen Rich Mullins Carnatic music Jon Secada Boards of Canada Social rule Jorge Luis Borges Song Marching band English grammar Timpani Phish Devil Mnemonic John Cage Book of Mormon Philosophy of language Meaning Self Portrait Podcasting Capoeira Storytelling National Public Radio Klezmer 50 First Dates March (music) Linguistics and the Book of Mormon Film soundtrack U2 (band) "Weird Al" Yankovic South Park MP3 Past teachings of Prem Rawat Quotation Slashdot subculture IPod shuffle Nashville Skyline Joy Electric The Who American Pie (song) Chess John Peel Blackfoot music Monty Python (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction StarCraft: Uprising Blood on the Tracks Dixie (song) The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan NBA Finals Shot of Love Filmi The Times They Are A-Changin' Popular music The writing of Principia Mathematica Live Aid Donna Summer Simplified Chinese character The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Kat__ Lomb Karaite Judaism CDC 6600 Bouncy techno Have I Got News For You The Star Wars Holiday Special Queen (band) Another Side of Bob Dylan The Jam Voodoo Jack FM Tone (linguistics) Tony Bennett Shaggy dog story Disc jockey The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Quizbowl Music Microeconomics
