this is sooo weird i met a girl this summer that was staying next door with her grandparents for a couple of months i saw her around and she looked totally familiar but she had never been in this area before i met her one day and she asked if she had met me before and i said no but she looked really familiar too we started hanging out a lot and she got me into the band my chemical romance we talked a lot about them later one night she slept over and we were up in the attic trying to sleep my sister used to stay up ther so it was all finished off anyway we were trying to draw a gun and a rose as soon as we put the pencil to the paper we felt a heavy stabbing feeling it stopped after about mins then we felt our hair being tugged on we tried to ignore it and started talking about mcr we were talking about gerard way and frank iero and how we had become so much exactly like them and when we talked about them we smelled smoke because they both smoke and drink continued soon so we were all freaked out and then we were thinking the same things and seeing the same random pictures in our heads of mcr realted things there was one of a man in his s a little girl and a medium sized black dog in front of an old building old picture we went down into my bedroom and tried to sleep in there we woke up the next day and were talking yet again and we both felt like we had met mcr before like when we were about and it had to do with playing kickball we had earlier that week watched a video of mcr playing kickball we watched it again and it was soooo friggin scary familiar i am just wondering if it is possible that we could have known eachother earlier in life and lived with mcr for a little while if not why could we be having these strange occurances that's freaky Friends Sin City Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Inside The Ashlee Simpson Show The Shining (film) EastEnders Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban James Hanratty Milton H.
