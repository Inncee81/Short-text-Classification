my son is afraid of heaven and i can't help him my yo son has been extremely afraid of heaven for years now more acurately he is afraid of eternity we believe and teach our children that there is indeed a heaven we will one day be in and i have told him that heaven isn't a place with alot of time but a place outside of time days and hours and minutes won't be realized the way they are here this does not help him at all i've reminded him that the very nature of heaven is that it is a place without pain or fear so it would be impossible for him to experience eternal terror there he just continues to say think about it it will just keep stretching on and on and on always the same forever and it freaks him out i realize this may seem to be simply a religious issue but i think it is more psychological he should not be obsessing over this unable to fall asleep some nights because of the thought of it what should i do i take it seriously but sometimes i can't help but feel like it's getting ridiculous i have tried letting him talk it out and trying to reassure him in different ways i've also suggested talking to someone about it but he is embarrassed he thinks going to talk to someone would mean there is something wrong with him he's going into jr high and doesn't want to admit to these feelings to anyone other than me and my husband i can understand that nobody wants to be labeled or feel they are being dragged off to a shrink for admitting a fear as an adult i know that counselors and therapists can be valuable and helpful but to a kid it is a mortifying thought but i am almost at the point of making him do it anyways since he isn't growing out of this but how would i do that i do not want this to turn into a religious debate i don't feel that i could make up a description of heaven that would satisfy his fear and since i don't believe heaven is a made up place i wouldn't think of doing that anyways we do not teach them that heaven is a place where we sit around in limbo or a place you go if you are good we do teach that it is a place with no more fear no more pain no more death no more crying to the person mentioning analytical thinking you are right on the money he is very analytical like me and concepts he can't grasp bother him for me realizing that time is a physical property that won't exist in heaven has helped me do away with the mental picture of endless days going on forever and ever i can't comprehend the absence of time but that knowledge has been enough for me to stop trying to wrap my brain around eternity it isn't so easy with him obviously if you're child is a right brained child then it's possible that he is having his first existential conundrum the difficulty is one part of the brain is sophisticated while the other part is undeveloped i believe one of the worst things you can do is address it intellectually because he will believe that you don't understand the part he's struggling with this may or may not be true he may actually see something that you're not addressing this happens quite often with intelligent children the best thing that can be done is to give him room and not always alleviate the fears let him work it out on his own attempts to adjust his perspective even for his own good will drive him him to dig in his heels and exacerbate the fears one of those fears will also be of alienation and a sense of isolation if people repeatedly prove to him that he's alone because no one understands again you may or may not understand but he has to arrive at that conclusion on his own check out existential depression and fears in gifted children Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an A Course In Miracles Religion Immortality Milton H.
