i miss having a garbage disposal do they work with a septic tank crazy enough i lived in government housing for yrs while i went to college i had a garbage disposal in my apartment and loved it its the only thing i really miss about living in the welfare apartments now i live in a small town and have a new septic with an aeriation thing on it will i be able to attach a garbage disposal to my sink without problems or should i just get used to not having one i am the only person who lives here the septic company gets paid to service my septic tank which is the reason i quit flushing tampons down the toilet a couple of strings got caught in the aeriation motor not cool and very embarrasing just adding my cents you should find out how large your septic tank is too basically the point is to only put things in there that will break down the easiest even look at the toilet paper you buy and no you can't flush those flushable wipes we had one in our last house which and we never had issues with it and yes i had a garbage disposal basically throw the big stuff left on the plate into the garbage especially things that don't break down like egg shells and perhaps coffee grounds and rinse the rest away into the garbage disposal we had to pump our tank after years it depends on usage and size of tank we have a family of and do loads of laundry so right there is just a lot of water going through the system gotta be careful about that too but really they are no headache it cost between to pump ours it was for a bedroom house Autonomous building Menstrual cup Toilet paper Japanese toilet Sewage treatment Brewery Tampon Plumbing fixture Thermal power station Cruising (maritime) Diaper Composting toilet Siphon Filling station Domestic water system Energy development Euphemism Poker jargon Sin City CPU cache Shaggy dog story Flush toilet Waste management Water supply Garbage collection (computer science) Urinal Sewer Transformer Sento Glossary of firefighting terms Objective-C Sanitary towel Kitchen Greywater Phoebe Buffay's songs Oil platform Vista Way Nuclear power Fuel cell Garbage truck Hydrogen economy Dustbin Pit toilet Dormitory Water purification Coffee Dishwasher Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Theory of conduct Aerosmith Dry cleaning Tank truck Toilet humour Australian words Canadian English Textile manufacturing Futurama (TV series - season 5) Dialysis Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster The Commons Inkjet printer Carburetor Hard water Bidet Cable television Humphrey Bogart Friends Wind turbine Rebreather Reference counting Wastewater Kimberly-Clark Corporation Procter & Gamble Landfill House music Shock Redundant array of independent disks Married... with Children Chatham Square King City, Ontario Marine aquarium Seismic retrofit Paul Martin Molotov cocktail Sea-Monkey Hydroponics Sewage Lisp programming language Ammunition Abortion Home repair Handloading E85 Self Portrait Water Health insurance
