should i lubricate the chain on my garage door opener i recently installed a new craftsman hp garage door opener the maintenace section of the manual says to periodically lube the door hinges but says nothing about the chain is this an oversight if not what should i use is wd acceptable ok here is the gold answer no do not lube the chain reason being it doesn't need to be for one when you lube the chain it will eventually drip on your door leaving a perfectly straight line down the center of your door unless of course you want a black line on your door for two unless you have water standing or dripping in your garage the chain is pre oiled at the factory and doesn't require any more third and final is when you use oh lets say white lithium grease when the repair man being me gets kinda irritated because now he has to wipe all that off yes you do want to lube your door rollers hinges bearings springs for this use a spray lube with a silicone in it wd will do the job but it is not a lubricant it is a penetrant so it dries things out if you use a good lube once a year will do just fine any further 's e mail me Lubricant Strap-on dildo Thermal power station Grease (lubricant) Personal lubricant Manual transmission Fire extinguisher Drill bit USS Swordfish (SSN-579) Irrigation Lithium Cruising (maritime) Menstrual cup Anchor Door Colony in Space Two-stroke cycle Biodiesel Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Jam (TV series) Coffee Carburetor Glossary of firefighting equipment Eastern Orthodox Church Roller chain Friction USS S-38 (SS-143) Oral sex Drip irrigation Shaving Wire Chainsaw Fire fighting Code: Lyoko Blood Simple Anal sex Seismic retrofit Ford Mustang Printmaking Air-raid shelter Glossary of nautical terms Intravenous therapy Seismometer Nuclear weapon design Radio controlled airplane The Champions Nuclear power Internal ballistics Bipolar disorder Filling station Monty Hall problem Traffic light Avenue Q USS S-36 (SS-141) Outpost 2 Burning Man Wood Windows XP Drag racing Wood carving Airbag Bicycle chain Upholstery Copyleft Violin Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Edsel Chico and the Man Babbitt metal Turbocharger De Lorean DMC-12 Textile manufacturing Alkane Phil of the Future Floppy disk Volleyball Heinkel He 100 Bladderwort Volkswagen Type 2 Mercedes-Benz 300SL Bay Area Rapid Transit Revolving door Masturbation Glossary of firefighting terms Galileo spacecraft Lionel Corporation Chess terminology Hair conditioner Great Pyramid of Giza Molybdenum disulfide CatDog Dishwasher Wayne Corporation Siphon SS Morro Castle Seinfeld Moisturizer Muslim ibn Aqeel
