solar wind power has anyone installed solar panels wind tubine on the roof of their house yet my utility bills have increased yet again and i'm thinking of taking the plunge i was wondering just how much power these alterative systems can supply lay mans terms kettle tv computer tumble drier washing machine heating or will it be just a few light bulbs once a week can you make a profit by selling power back to the grid any positive coments would be greatly apprieciated there grid tie and non grid tie systems depending on what you desire to install a grid tied system is tapped into the power lines and feeds your unused energy back to the local power company for a credit balance on your electric bill a non grid tied system would not sell back your unused energy to the power company but would instead be a closed end system for your own use in this type of system you would want to have extra storage capability so as not to waste any captured energy the most efficient solar panels on the market as of current are efficient at capturing energy however new cells have just been invented that are as much as efficient meaning you can use less of them to be just as efficient also saving space grid tied systems will usually cost you k while non grid tied systems would cost you less to install your savings may differ depending on how many panels you install versus how much energy you consume so it's hard to estimate your monthly savings typically witihin grid tied systems your electric bill will be less than a month and you should be able to power everything in your home dryers washers refrigerators air conditioning heating etc Solar cell Solar panel Autonomous building Wind power Future energy development Energy development Hybrid vehicle Hydrogen economy Electric power transmission Air conditioning Vacuum tube Fuel cell Transformer Power station Incandescent light bulb Grid energy storage Electric motor Nuclear power Solar power satellite Distributed generation Dairy Manitoba Hydro Electrical wiring Furnace Ocean thermal energy conversion Laptop Alcohol fuel Welding High-voltage direct current Diode Battery electric vehicle Spacecraft propulsion Sun Biodiesel Stirling engine Oscilloscope Fan (implement) Lighting Passive solar Three-phase electric power Alternative fuel Thermal power station Japanese toilet Pebble bed reactor Energy storage Washing machine Energy Policy Act of 2005 Electric boat Electric power Electrical generator Electricity meter Political economy Digital photography Turbocharger Colonization of the Moon Sewage treatment Alternating current Renewable energy development Tidal power Hydroelectricity Computer Brewery Optical fiber Steam engine Kitchen Urban heat island Nuclear power phase-out National Weather Service Tire HVAC Spark plug Microeconomics Hydrogen vehicle Nuclear reactor Hard disk Split phase Cruising (maritime) Electric vehicle Gas turbine Geomagnetic storm Embedded system Fusion power Economy of Russia Petroleum Monopoly Explosive material George Westinghouse Energy Electricity generation Credit card Natural gas
