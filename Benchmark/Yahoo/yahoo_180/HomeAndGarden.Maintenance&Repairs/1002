outside a c condenser noisy my a c condenser unit outside is sometimes very noisy lately what might be the cause it's about years old and was cleaned about years ago how much can i expect to pay to replace the condenser the condenser fan motor bearings could be going bad or the hub on the fan blade is coming loose from the fan itself or the worst senerio is that the compressor could be going bad if the compressor is noisier at times than at others could mean that the compressor is going bad or the capacitor could be going bad causing it to work harder at times this is something you need an hvac tech to come and check and do a load test on your compressor and check your fan balde and fan motor Jet engine Air conditioning Gas compressor Thermal power station Fan (implement) Electric motor Turbocharger HVAC Tire Motor oil Rolls-Royce Trent SR-71 Blackbird Dodge Neon Turbofan Pebble bed reactor Supersonic transport Gas turbine Refrigerator Paul W.
