i moved in with a so called dishwasher that well does not work he had it looked at and its no good i told the guy to tell the owner and he said ok well no problem but how long does he have to give me a new or working dishwasher it said diswasher included i don't know if you could hold him to a dishwasher that works if you want a dishwasher then confront the landlord but be ready for a confrontation that could bring bad feelings between you and him dishwashers are relatively cheap and nothing to put it if the one that's there doesn't worn and cannot be repaired than a new one should be put it i don't think you have anything legal to stand on though but like i said that's up to you don't expect any favors in the future from him if you go after him Textile manufacturing Theory of conduct Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) 1957 World Series Shaggy dog story Dishwashing Good Morning, Vietnam Extreme Championship Wrestling Major appliance Poker jargon The Ashlee Simpson Show Social rule Scottish clan Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Morphology (linguistics) Wonderland (McFly album) Friends USS Angler (SS-240) God Emperor of Dune Joke Humphrey Bogart The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Avenue Q Kasparov versus The World Futurama (TV series - season 5) Daredevil Time Out of Mind Charly Garc__a Slow Train Coming EastEnders StarCraft Episode VI Kurt Angle Pitaten Prior restraint Destry Rides Again Heavy Metal (film) Craps Current teachings of Prem Rawat Coming of Age (TNG episode) Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Goodness and value theory Hal Trosky The Devil Wears Prada Bill O'Reilly (commentator) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Kitchen Undergrads Professional wrestling slang Boston and Lowell Railroad Michael Garibaldi The Karate Kid, Part III Aerial (dance move) Plame affair AmigaOS Fecal incontinence Breath of Fire III Gundam W G-Unit: Last Outpost Taxi Driver Fahrenheit 9/11 Salmiakki Koskenkorva The nature of God in Western theology Charles Peace Marilyn Monroe Meat Loaf W.
