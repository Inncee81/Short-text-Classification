can i use a tub faucet on a sink i really like a tub faucet and the matching sink faucet is different can i use the tub faucet on the sink we are building a house and the holes are not made in the granite yet well you can but their are a few things that are different on tub and sink faucets most bathroom faucets are in center but there are in center faucets as well all need three holes all tub faucets that are deck mount not on the wall are three hole and in center the important thing is how they connect to the water lines some are solder type and some are threaded it's a bit hard to solder under a sink with such tight spaces so i would use a valve with threaded connections the center hole used for the spout is sometimes bigger then the outer holes check that also the spout on a tub valve is also longer and bigger than a normal bathroom sink valve make sure it doesn't come out to far for your sink it also allows more water flow which could cause water to splash out of the sink other than that it should work but i would still consider a valve that was meant to be on my bathroom sink if its in a kitchen then no it wont work Plumbing fixture Kitchen Sento Soldering Tire Drill bit Textile manufacturing Transistor Seismic retrofit Diode Dishwasher Screw Bidet Carburetor Poker jargon Spark plug Glossary of firefighting equipment Japanese toilet Metalworking Rebreather Irrigation Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Space shuttle main engine Residual-current device Brewery Solder Thermostat Printed circuit board Siphon Drilling and threading Toilet The Brady Bunch Electrophysiology Trombone Scuba set Brazing Solar cell Dormitory Customs and etiquette of Japan Two-stroke cycle Ship Basement Water polo Passenger car Diving suit Tin can Top-bar hive Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Urban beach Thermal power station Urinal Wrench Team Fortress Classic PCB layout guidelines Vacuum tube Earring Dishwashing Washroom Flush toilet Mercury 4 World Trade Center Steam (content delivery) Chevrolet Corvair engine Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Furnace Dymaxion house Jackass: The Movie Hogwarts Floor Directory Casting Cruising (maritime) Blackjack Novelty (locomotive) Naval mine Floppy disk AMC V8 engine Campfire Tales Fecal incontinence Baby bottle Heart Apollo Command/Service Module Cheyenne Mountain Toilet paper Apollo 15 Glossary of partner dance terms Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Hamster Dundas Square Diving cylinder Stonehenge Gristmill USS Drum (SS-228) Strap-on dildo Star Trek Customizable Card Game
