ok let me try again inside unit on a c and heater needs to be replaced sq ft house story anyone know the average cost this is just the inside unit that needs replacing the a c guy is telling me the inside cooling coil is rotted from improper cleaning from the previous owners we have a home warranty but the a c guy told me the whole inside unit will need to be replaced because of the age of the system approx years meaning the whole inside until needs replacing the outside compressor is fine so average cost anyone the home warranty will only cover up to people i just want someone to tell me the average cost to replace the inside unit that is all i need i apologize but i don't need advice about nd opinions or the home warranty i need to know how much it's a rheem southeast usa electric heat and air i'm in sc the outside unit is a condenser i guess it doesnt have a heat pump your not getting the answer because it's difficult to say a sq ft house is pretty small and shouldn't require a coil that would cost the installer to usd including labor markup and costs for the refrigerant and disregarding that you might live in a high cost of living area where contractors charge more for service and if your system used an obsolete type of refrigerant it should cost to usd however there are a few other considerations like distance to travel and location of the unit if its difficult to get to it'll cost more it seems that we immediately distrust the contractor mainly because we've been burned by them in the past i would talk to a few other companies if it is the coil gone bad they should be able to braze the holes Air conditioning Refrigerator Solar power Thermal power station HVAC Thermostat Phase change heat pump Tesla coil Heat pump Furnace Fossil fuel power plant Diesel engine Home repair Spark plug Transformer Welding Ocean thermal energy conversion Heat exchanger Swamp cooler Wind power Gas compressor Energy development Loudspeaker Stirling engine Carburetor Heinkel He 100 Soldering Toyota Prius Cray-1 Internal ballistics Turbocharger Kitchen Mars Exploration Rover Motor oil Brazing Refrigeration Spacecraft propulsion Vacuum tube Stove Drill bit Hydrogen economy Incandescent light bulb Natural gas Internal combustion engine Solar cell Trans-Alaska Pipeline System Dairy Vacuum Tire Electric motor Supercharger SR-71 Blackbird Jet engine Laserdisc Ford Ranger EV Torpedo Steam engine Printed circuit board Three-phase electric power Electrical wiring Brewery Relay Basement Chevrolet Corvair Microphone Turbojet Pebble bed reactor Wind turbine Haloalkane Oscilloscope Gas absorption refrigerator Electricity meter Wood fuel Bass guitar Mattress Warranty IPod Solar panel Alternating current Tank Bleed air Magnet Cruising (maritime) Elevator Apollo 13 Refrigerator car Casting General Dynamics F-111 Carbon dioxide Hydrogen vehicle Windows 2000 Irrigation Sega Saturn Samovar Inkjet printer Train Geothermal exchange heat pump Gas tungsten arc welding Wire
