how do i determine which wire is hot when both wires from the ceiling box are black be very careful here i am assuming this is an older house because in newer wiring jobs there would be a white black and green or bare wire if it is old wiring then the insulation could be brittle from age and crack or peel off and come into contact with the box or directly with you and be a shock hazard or short out and be a fire hazard if you don't have a volt meter then you could pickup a non contact voltage detector at the hardware or building supply store and use it instead you would need to make sure the wires aren't connected to the light fixture or at least that the light bulb was removed and that the wires are spread apart from each other then switch on the wall switch and hold the non contact voltage detector near each wire and the one that is hot should cause the detector to light up or beep you can use a volt meter to measure if there is voltage on one wire or the other however you will need to have a grounded wire or grounded ceiling box in order to do that if there is a wall switch for the light then it will need to be turned on when you are ready to check for voltage you need to either take out the light bulb or disconnect the wires from the light fixture then set the volt meter to measure ac voltage and touch one lead to the bare wire and the other lead to the grounded wire or box the meter will show you if there is any voltage there in the us you should be measuring about volts ac if there is voltage on both wires then you have a problem with the wiring like maybe a short somewhere that needs to be fixed if this is an old house then you might not have a ground wire or grounded box in which case the volt meter will only tell you if you have voltage across the two wires but not which one is the hot wire in this case you can either run a wire to a grounded metal item like a metal water pipe to use for the ground wire in the previous measurement method Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Incandescent light bulb Transformer Circuit design Electrical wiring Overhead lines Thermostat Oscilloscope High-voltage hazards Volt Fluorescent lamp Lighting Residual-current device Spark plug Welding Ground and neutral Vacuum tube Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Transistor Fire fighting Ground (electricity) RS-232 X10 (industry standard) Lineman (occupation) Light-emitting diode Thermal power station Potentiometer George Westinghouse Ultraviolet Solar power Stage lighting Digital circuit Electrical wiring (UK) Earthing system Spark gap Split phase Gas metal arc welding Electricity meter Naval mine Circuit breaker Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Fuse (electrical) Tesla coil Three-phase electric power Electrophysiology Third rail Voltmeter Antenna (radio) BS 1363 Electrical resistance Rail terminology Lightning Universal Serial Bus High-voltage direct current Electricity Bicycle lighting Distribution board Electric motor Central processing unit Action potential Mercury-vapor lamp Lightning rod CMOS Ceramics Phantom power Alternating current Glossary of firefighting equipment X-ray Electric power transmission Solar cell Street light Transmitter Loudspeaker Current (electricity) Analog-to-digital converter Impedance matching Windows XP Wind power Linear particle accelerator Fusor Decibel Overhead powerline Conductor (material) Fan (implement)
