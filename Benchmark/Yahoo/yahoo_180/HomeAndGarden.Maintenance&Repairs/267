who's at fault me or my plumber i had a leak in a pipe in my front yard my plumber said it was a leak in the pipe that runs from the main valve at the perimeter of my house to my house he said because of the concrete and landscaping rather than fix the actual leak it would be easier to install a new pipe from my house to the main valve essentially bypassing the original leak that sounded reasonable so i said ok he did the work now there is no water going to the sprinkler system in my back yard the new pipe in the front yard made it so no water flows to the back yard my plumber says you never told me you had sprinklers in the back yard i feel like he is the professional and should know that there may be other pipes involved i have no idea how the piping system under my house works or is laid out who is right a homeowner is not responsible for knowing how his plumbing is connected especially underground the plumber is a professional and should have considered the possibility and investigated before proceeding with a recommendation underground connections are common the plumber as any profession should make his work good even if he has to eat his own mistakes you could be a gentleman by understand that it was an honest mistake and help him defray the cost http brassmein com http g proboards com Irrigation Siphon Plame affair Seismic retrofit Kitchen Hydraulic machinery Fire Sprinkler Domestic water system Flush toilet White House Plumbers Debugging Home repair Fire hydrant Glossary of firefighting terms Glossary of firefighting equipment Watergate scandal Basement Rail terminology Burglar alarm Water supply Carburetor Jean Charles de Menezes Rebreather Locomotive National Kidney Foundation Singapore Plumbing fixture Two-stroke cycle Autonomous building Containment building Water hammer Sewer Software bug Anchor Scientific method Diving regulator Dundas Square Turbocharger Tire Thermostat HyperText Transfer Protocol Electrical wiring High-voltage direct current Residual-current device Ethics Vacuum tube Geodesic dome Renewable energy Solar power Common Unix Printing System Water supply network Fire alarm control panel William Murdoch Soldering Steam (content delivery) Energy development Novelty (locomotive) Hydropower Insurance Computer Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Coronary circulation Three Mile Island Roof and tunnel hacking Pipe organ Construction Extreme Programming International Phonetic Alphabet Urinal Collapse of the World Trade Center Mach kernel Cray-1 Space shuttle main engine Sydney Riot of 1879 Spark plug Supercharger Heat Home improvement Chatsworth House Dalek (Doctor Who episode) Scientology beliefs and practices Scuba set Hydraulic ram Sleeve valve Ocean thermal energy conversion Big Dig Logic Property (ownership right) Glossary of American football Dodge Neon Newcomen steam engine Marching band Sailing Web server Japanese toilet Skateboarding trick ROF Bishopton Jet engine Air brake (rail) Windows Vista
