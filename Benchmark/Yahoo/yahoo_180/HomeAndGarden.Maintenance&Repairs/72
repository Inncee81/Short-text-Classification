is it better for the air conditioner vent to be opened or closed my air conditioner has the option of having the vent open or closed or i guess in between but which one makes the room cooler i don't know i am guessing you mean the open closed switch on a room air conditioner that switches it between using outside air and recycling indoor air because if you're talking about a central ac vent open means you get air and closed means no air i use the open position on my room ac if it is relatively dry outside and not over i flip it open to get some fresh air in at least once a day in any case for a short time i flip it to open if the house got stinky from cooking i don't allow smoking in my home if it's very hot and or humid outside closed will keep your house cooler dryer and your ac won't work as hard HVAC Air conditioning Fire fighting Diving suit Swamp cooler Hot air balloon Table tennis Carburetor Thermal power station Cheese Wheel of Fortune Betting (poker) White phosphorus incendiary Scuba set Climate of the United Kingdom Autonomous building Radon Kitchen Solar power Aerial (dance move) Skateboarding trick Thermostat Sausage Air pollution Monty Hall problem Sauna Marathon (computer game) Cannabis cultivation Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?
