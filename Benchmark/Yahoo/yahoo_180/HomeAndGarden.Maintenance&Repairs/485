should do it by our self i know we can do it so guys please help give me some links to get info how to do it and need tips from your experience too and for supplies home depot or what what is the best store for supplies thanks a lotttttttt in advance star promise for help but more then that my blessings for you all i watch home garden tv and diy channel a lot but its my bad luck that dont remember any program about it checked there isnt any program schedule in this month about it on these channels one of my friend she doesnt know how to do but she told me to rent a machine sand and buff then paint so wanted to know in details and what kind a paint any name any brand please help hello i personally refinished all the floors in our older home as well when you say polish are you lookin' for just a protective finish or do they need to be 'resurfaced if just a finish is all you need then i recommend a trip to lowes paint dept ask for the mgr they will have the most training in this area they should be able to direct you to the best paste wax product for you needs however if they are needing to be resurfaced and they don't have stain damage the easiest way is to use a 'stripping agent' it's like a glorified nail polish remover my preference is one made by jasco it's called furniture refinisher comes in a wood grain gallon sized can used to be able to get it at orchard supply hardware if you can't find it at the store or online my second recommendation is a similar product made by formby s that is also a furniture refinisher you'll also need a few pkgs of steel wool comes in varying degrees of coarseness i recommend to oo for the stubborn areas you'll need at least to pkgs of each grade of steel wool whatever you don't use you can return i find it to be easier to return 'after' the project is done not somewhere in the middle of it i hate interruptions anyway your steps will be dip steel wool in old bowl of f r solution just like you would a scrub brush if you were cleanin' the floor spread ot the solution in a circular motion let it sit and soak for a minute or two this will loosen any old varnish from the floor as you begin to 'scour' the gunk will start to get trapped in your 'pad go over the same are with the next grade of steel wool following the same procedure then wipe with rags or paper towels i use the viva ones because they are the most absorbant when you have done these steps for the whole floor then you need to take a clean rag and using the solution pouring a little on the areas of the floor at a time then wiping with the clean rags you may have to change rags often to getoff any leftover residue it's like a rinse cycle let that dry for i'd say at least six hrs depending on your humidity once it is somewhat fume free you can apply a minwax stain if you want to alter the shade if not then i recommend either a wax polish or a sealing polyurythane finish it comes in a variety of sheens from matte to high gloss you just brush it on with a clean quality fair sized brush this product comes in gallon cans just like paint you can find it at either lowes or home depot i think it's made by minwax or flecto either one will do just be sure to look for the one that's made for floors it's a polyurythane follow the directions on the can you can also get backup info at lowes wish i were there to help get ya' started it is alot easier than most people think oh yeah make sure to pick up a couple of those disposable white respirator masks and be sure to open the windows for ventilation an to speed up the drying time hope this
