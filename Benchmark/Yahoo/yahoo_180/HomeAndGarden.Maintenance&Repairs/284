what size of ac needed sq ft home and what is the difference between electric strip heat and a heat pump please probably ton if you buy a heat pump system it will include the outdoor compressor unit and the indoor air handler fan the outdoor compressor acts as both an ac and a heater a heat pump is simply an ac that has a reverse cycle however if you live in a climate that has very cold winters i would not recommend a heat pump at certain low temperatures a heat pump can not generate enough heat to heat your home properly the indoor air handler has electric heat strips for backup these are very very inefficient and use a huge amount of electricity if you live in say pensacola fl a heat pump would be perfect for you but if your winters are cold youshould go with a natural gas furnace for your heat the gas furnace and fan for the ac are both contained in the same unit Thermostat Air conditioning Ocean thermal energy conversion Solar power Jet engine Fossil fuel power plant HVAC Diesel engine Thermal power station Gas compressor Autonomous building Phase change heat pump Furnace Axial compressor Motor oil Stirling engine Refrigerator Temperature Power station Turbocharger Gas turbine Supercharger Carbon dioxide Steam engine Explosive material Heat Renewable energy Turbojet Heat pump Transformer Energy development E85 Entropy Nuclear power Carburetor Gas absorption refrigerator Geothermal exchange heat pump Alcohol fuel Internal combustion engine Pebble bed reactor Turbofan Portable stove Aquarium Water (molecule) Heat engine Central heating Natural gas Coal Incineration Welding Open hearth furnace Peltier-Seebeck effect Wind power Basement Three-phase electric power Vacuum Thermocouple Lighting Gasoline Swimming pool Cogeneration Water vapor Vacuum tube Global climate model SABRE Town gas Combined cycle Apollo 13 Plasma (physics) Hydrogen Three Mile Island Phase (matter) Hydropower Powder metallurgy Deep lake water cooling Sewage treatment Wood fuel Ford Ranger EV Fan (implement) Two-stroke cycle Gas metal arc welding Space manufacturing Bleed air Fusion power Water Radon Radioisotope thermoelectric generator Steam locomotive nomenclature Electric arc furnace Environmental concerns with electricity generation Enriched uranium Energy Brayton cycle SR-71 Blackbird Soldering Refrigeration
