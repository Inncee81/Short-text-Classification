i am looking for a fuse on my kenmore dryer to replace the thermal fuse has no wires attached the dryer quit and would not start after a load was done my girlfriend said a repair man replaced the fuse in it a few years ago when the dryer quit she said it was in an obvious place but i cant locate it the thermal fuse has no wires attached to it right now so i dont think its even hooked up i am wondering if it has fuse box somewhere that i am overlooking it she seems to think it was in a panel similar to car fuse box any help would be appreciated sounds like the repair man may have bypassed the fuse to fix the problem it seems to me if you remove the panel under the dryer door then look straight back towards the back of the dryer next to the vent piping there will be an overload possibly with a reset switch and a temp control relay check there bro also right where the vent starts under the drum near the motor there maybe a reset button Fuse (electrical) Relay STS-61 Residual-current device Elevator Oscilloscope Circuit breaker Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Combine (Half-Life 2) Loudspeaker Thermal power station Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Embedded system Switch Thermostat Renewable energy Fire alarm control panel Nintendo Entertainment System Transformer Seismic retrofit Space Shuttle external tank Dodge Neon M16 (rifle) Electric motor Professional wrestling match types Solar power Modchip Arcade cabinet Carburetor Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Wood carving Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Rail terminology Tank Chevrolet Camaro Fan (implement) Glossary of firefighting equipment Pickup truck Anchor Gliding Capacitor plague Burglar alarm Tire Universal Serial Bus Episodes of Lost (Season 2) X10 (industry standard) Trapping AIM-9 Sidewinder Diving suit Ring circuit BS 1363 Telephone exchange De Lorean DMC-12 24 Hours of Le Mans The Ark in Space High-voltage direct current Sonic the Hedgehog (16-bit) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Poker jargon Potentiometer Wire wrap Cruising (maritime) STS-114 Car body style Airbag Electronic amplifier Androgen insensitivity syndrome Ethernet Phreaking Autonomous building Japanese toilet Pinball Apollo Guidance Computer Atari 8-bit family STS-43 Programmable logic controller 2000 Australian Grand Prix Upholstery Windows XP Ford Thunderbird System 7 (Macintosh) Hydraulic machinery F-101 Voodoo Object Desktop IMac Nintendo GameCube The Dalek Invasion of Earth Roof and tunnel hacking Modem Climbing equipment Floppy disk Electricity meter Hamster TARDIS Windows 2000 GunZ The Duel M60 machine gun
