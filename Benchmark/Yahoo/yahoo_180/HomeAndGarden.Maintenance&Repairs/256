what do cobwebs have to do with radon or any other issue that would make a home more desirable a friend of mine sold their house in an area where i know they got a very low and unfair price for it the realtor putting it on the market insisted they not wipe away the cobwebs in the basement because she said it proves there is not a radon problem maybe the realtor thought the cobwebs show that there is ventilation in the basement which would vent radon gas buildup unfortunately that would also show that the basement is drafty which would be a negative mark against the house i suppose they could also have thought the spiders were like the canaries used in mines to be the first indication of the presence of deadly gases but that sounds kind of stupid since the spiders could probably survive a nuclear blast like roaches so a little radon isn't going to faze them it sounds like your friends needed another realtor it would have been better for them to have removed the cobwebs so the place looked clean and had radon testing performed to prove there was not a radon problem radon testing is an inexpensive test s h that homeowners can do themselve or they could call in a home inspector to do it if they want more credible result Radon Uranium Nuclear power Lung cancer Real estate broker Carbon dioxide Welding Environmental concerns with electricity generation M16 (rifle) Iraq and weapons of mass destruction Web crawler Ionizing radiation Lebesgue integration Insurance Natural gas Blood (computer game) AMD Thorium The Time Machine Explosive material Background radiation Land mine Autonomous building Hydrogen peroxide Heinkel He 100 Audiophile Mortgage Lunar Prospector Nuclear reactor Home repair Terran (StarCraft) Year of the Spider Search engine optimization Theory of conduct HIV test Fred A.
