toilet wont flush any idea on how to fix this how much water should be in the tank you haven't given enough info to really address this since you asked how much water should be in the tank i assume the toilet works when you push down the handle but won't flush clean leaving residue in the bowl if this is the case then get a bucket or large pan and fill it with water pour the water directly into the center of the bowl pour it quickly but stop pouring if the backs up if the bowl is not stopped up the water will evacuate quickly taking anything in the bowl with it if it doesn't flush then it is clogged at least partially if this is the case get a toilet auger a ' long snake with a piece of rubber tubing on it which keeps the toilet from being scratched the auger goes up into the trap and can be twisted and pushed in and out until you clear the blockage if the toilet doesn't operate at all when you push the handle then take the top off the tank and look inside there are two things in the toilet one the ballcock lets the water in it usually is on the left side of the tank and has some sort of float on it the other is the flush valve and it lets the water out into the bowl if you push the handle and nothing happens follow the handle inside the toilet and see if it is attached to the flapper or wire and chain ball over the flush valve if not replace what's not attached as for the first idea toilets have a finely tuned water flow from the tank to the bowl as the water is allowed out of the tank it comes to the bowl through small holes under the rim these are designed to cause a swirling action that helps evacuate the bowl if the toilet is old these can get clogged with sediment and need to be cleaned out use a pipe cleaner or something small to push into each hole use a small mirror to help you see the holes i hope this helps with your problem if not please be more specific about what's happening Bong Carburetor Siphon Drill bit Urinal Japanese toilet Thermal power station Internal ballistics Toilet paper Rebreather Electrophysiology Trombone Menstrual cup Toilet humour Seismic retrofit Sewage treatment Hydraulic machinery Brewery Coriolis effect Vacuum tube Two-stroke cycle Casting M16 (rifle) Tire Solar power Naval mine Urinary incontinence Plumbing fixture Domestic water system Chevrolet Corvair engine Firearm Diving regulator Dairy Motorcycle Coffee Professional wrestling match types Timpani Autonomous building RISC Chainsaw Poker jargon Textile manufacturing Thermostat Irrigation Knife Windows XP Fire fighting Samovar Glossary of nautical terms Canal lock Carbon dioxide Diving suit Sento Vacuum Elevator Hamster Strap-on dildo Opportunity rover Snorkel Amateur telescope making Apollo Command/Service Module Home repair Water polo Maple syrup Tractor Smoking pipe Steam engine Plastic Cat Four-stroke cycle Krag-J__rgensen Sewer Panama Canal Locks Borehole Cruising (maritime) Semiconductor device Energy development Pile Sin City Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Computer CPU cache Piccolo Junior Saga Baby bottle Mach kernel Septic tank Pinball Water turbine Second Battle of the Atlantic Oxy-fuel welding and cutting
