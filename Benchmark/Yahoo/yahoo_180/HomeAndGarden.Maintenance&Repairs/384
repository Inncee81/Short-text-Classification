fridge giving off fishy smell from outisde back fridge about yrs old fishy smell coming from the back outside somewhere there is at the bottom a black metal box and onto a plastic thing clipped on it has a dome wit something inside and above it is where the condensation water drips onto on the plastic around the dome liquid has collated and is like a mukky yellow colour and black food bits how do you clean this ive been told not to touch it cos it could be the acid stuff the inside of the fridge has been cleaned a cpl of times with bicard and the hole isn't blocked im wondering if the yellow stuff is causing the smell the black domed thing is a compressor this is what pumps the gas around the system and creates the cooling effect inside the fridge the plastic thing on top is the vapouriser tray when condensation builds up inside the fridge or it defrosts the water runs into the tray and the heat generated by the compressor gently evaporates the water away unclip the tray and wash it out clean the inside of the fridge paying attention to the drain fitting replace the tray and put the clips back on while you have the fridge pulled out i also suggest that you brush or hoover off the pipework at the back of the fridge this is called the condenser and the part of the refrigeration that expells the unwanted heat from inside the fridge and the cooling system in answer to some of the other answers if the fridge is still getting cool inside it has not got a gas leak and if gas was escaping from a fridge of that age it would have a strong nutty smell secondly electrical wiring or electrical components burning out do not smell of fish they have a burning smell Bong Air conditioning Solar power Phase change heat pump Natural gas Printed circuit board Autonomous building Dairy Motor oil Sulfur Gas absorption refrigerator Brewery Fractional distillation Fossil fuel power plant Soldering Fire extinguisher Fire fighting Carbon dioxide Casting Plastic Thermal power station Thermostat Water (molecule) Ocean thermal energy conversion Tofu Haloalkane Town gas Hydrogen peroxide Evaporation Vacuum Coffee Hydrogen economy Jet engine Hydrogen Basement Cray-1 Kitchen Energy development Pebble bed reactor Furnace Hydroponics Glass Heinkel He 100 Titanium Internal ballistics Poker jargon M16 (rifle) Electrical wiring Glossary of firefighting terms Textile manufacturing Phase (matter) Drill bit Steam engine Tire Refrigeration Geodesic dome Bread Alcohol fuel Stirling engine Seismic retrofit Spark plug Dry cleaning Home repair Turbocharger Ozone Swamp cooler Vacuum tube Swimming pool Knife Petroleum Fuse (electrical) Explosive material Ester Hand grenade Polyethylene terephthalate Mercury (element) Cruising (maritime) Water vapor Turbojet Heat Milk Japanese tea ceremony Computer cooling Breathing gas Incandescent light bulb Renewable energy Origin of life Naval mine
