my zanussi washing machine leaks when filling up help i have checked for blockages and cannot find one any ideas would be welcome i just checked the hose no kink break i took the top off the machine no visible problems there checked the door seal a slight crack on this is this what it could be if so is it easy to replace okay further inspection done no crack on the door seal the leak is coming from underneath the machine so i guess a seal is broke or there is a pump hose problem everywhere else seems intact it's difficult to know what to put here as the machine has always been fine keep putting suggestions to me though points up for grabs if we take what you say literally that it leaks when filling up and not at any other time then i would say take the top off and look at the short rubber pipe that runs from the water solenoid valve where your external blue red pipe connects to the soap box where you put the soap powder this is the only hose that is only pressurised when filling up also look at the big convoluted rubber hose which carries the water soap powder mix from the soap box into the tub the tub is the big round stationary part that holds the water inside which the drum is mounted water soap powder mix runs down this hose into the machine when filling only both of these can be inspected by removing only the top panel of the washing machine these are the only two places where you will find water only while filling if on the other hand you are misleading us and in fact the machine continues to leak once filling is completed then that's another story and you'll have to look underneath to find the source of dripping water maybe you will see why it is important to be as accurate and specific as possible when asking these kinds of questions go on put some effort into it additional information now you're on the right track stand the machine on some blocks so you can look underneath while the machine is filling up you will see where the water's coming from and you can replace the relevant hose seal or part forget cracks in the drum tub or other catastrophic failure my bet is it'll be something simple and yes you can do it yourself then you'll have done it yourself and you don't need our help well done Casting Hydraulic machinery Menstrual cup Diving regulator Glossary of firefighting equipment Fire extinguisher Textile manufacturing Bong Electrophysiology Cruising (maritime) Glossary of firefighting terms Irrigation Glossary of wildland fire terms Fire fighting Combine (Half-Life 2) Seismic retrofit Rail terminology Dairy Siphon Washing machine Flush toilet Dishwasher Borehole Poker jargon CPU cache Dialysis Vacuum tube M60 machine gun Coffee Rebreather Mach kernel Diving cylinder STS-61 B-47 Stratojet Dishwashing Bullet Fire hydrant Home repair Drill bit Plastic Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Scuba set Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory M16 (rifle) Novelty (locomotive) Energy development MS-06 Zaku II Handloading Skateboarding trick Japanese toilet The Time Machine Pebble bed reactor Intravenous therapy Brewery Steam engine Thermostat Dodge Neon Slot machine Suppressor Naval mine Soap opera Mercury 4 Laundry Sento Condom String theory Vacuum cleaner Oscilloscope Heinkel He 100 Pump Loudspeaker Table tennis Diamond Space disaster Collision detection Customs and etiquette of Japan Diseases of the honeybee Spark plug Elevator Fast bowling Headlight Krag-J__rgensen Fujian tea ceremony Radar War of the Worlds (2005 film) Top-bar hive Typewriter
