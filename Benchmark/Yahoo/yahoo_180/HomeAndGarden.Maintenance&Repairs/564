my option regarding rebuild fences with neighbour my neighbour wants to rebuilt the fence between our houses which i don't completely agree what my choices are i think its stupid to require of the cost and share ownership its kinda like shared driveways its almost guaranteed to cause problems how much to spend what materials what color it is going to be major conficts and yes you can try to work it out and perhaps it will but some people are just set in their ways not to mention who gets what side facing their yard and when it needs fixing how do they split the bill what if they want to do it themselves but the other wants a contractor if theres problems with the fence who calls the contractor what if after the construction begins who does the contractor listen to soo many questions i would write to the city certified mail or take it up there personally get the name of the person who is in charge and tell them the situation if they want a fence built let them assume the cost and make sure it is properly set back away from the property line called a setback if the fence is on the property line write and request what they call a variance this will allow you to use property which it was not originally set for and they must set the fence back a certain amount of feet from the property line this is the best way and you are more than likely to get along with the neighbor allot better by each getting what they want everything in these days must be in writing and you have to keep notes now that you got whos in charge call couple days later and talk to this person ask him what can be done if they won't grant you a variance request a public meeting so you can be heard if that person dont' get you somewhere then write to their boss keep going until your satisfied yes this is work but will save aggrivation in long run i doubt there will be problems with grant to variance but better prepared than not if you do decide to go with the fence get everything in writing regarding my questions above dont assume nothing Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Poker jargon CPU cache Risk management SCO-Linux controversies Bush v.
