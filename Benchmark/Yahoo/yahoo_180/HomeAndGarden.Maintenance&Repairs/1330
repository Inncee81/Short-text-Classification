what is better metal tile roof or light weight tile roof my house has shake roof we plan to reroof this summer please let me know advantages and disadvantages of metal tile vs ceramic lieght weith tiles thanks there are clay concrete and wood cement fiber roof tiles but i am not familiar with ceramic unless you are referring to the ceramic granules that are used to surface some brands of metal tiles metal tiles are durable cost efficient and light weight the ones with the ceramic granules will reflect more heat than the crushed stone ones but the ceramic colors will fade more than the natural stone clay tiles are light weight and will last a lifetime unless broken from impact but you will pay dearly for the real clay clay is the color of the natural soil that is is made from so the color doesn't fade concrete is very heavy and is usually painted so the finish eventually weathers off and you see the typical gray concrete color coming through since the concrete is so heavy most structures require added support to firm up the roof deck there are lighter weight concrete tiles available but these are made with wood fiber filler and break very easily most structures will need framing support added for these also for the best price metal tile is a very good choice and most will have a manufacturers warranty for years Roof Ceramics Seismic retrofit Pottery Casting Masonry Tile Straw-bale construction Pavement (material) Knife Plastic Aluminium Natural building Plaster Drill bit Upholstery Aggregate (composite) Architecture of the California missions Titanium Glass Wood Deck (ship) Asbestos Sewage treatment Wind turbine Basement Uranium Reinforced concrete Light-emitting diode Corrosion Kitchen Welding Lithium Autonomous building Bicycle frame Geodesic dome Silicon Anchor Golf club (equipment) Stucco Leather Concrete St Albans Cathedral Portland cement Graphite-reinforced plastic Japanese art Internal ballistics Cookware and bakeware Binoculars Construction Xanadu House Light-frame construction Suspension bridge Space Shuttle program Ra (board game) Opportunity rover Incandescent light bulb Epoxy Bicycle lighting Alcohol fuel Pebble bed reactor Drainage Solar cell Wayne Corporation Solar power satellite Alhambra Turbocharger Stereoscopy Inflation Passive solar Radio controlled airplane Cubic zirconia Fireplace Lighting Boat building Robot Master Dental brace Japanese architecture Fiberglass Inkjet printer Ship Furnace Microeconomics Carbon nanotube View camera Diamond Bong E85 Timber framing
