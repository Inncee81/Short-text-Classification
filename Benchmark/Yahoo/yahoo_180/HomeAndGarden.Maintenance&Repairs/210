door repair i had to kick down a door that was secured by the door knob lock and now the wood is split up and down on the inside what is the best way to close the split there is also some damage on the outside the wood is cracked right by the door knob what is the best way to seal up the cracks if all else fails and i have to buy a new door how much would it cost for the cheapest door if you can find all the pieces you can glue it back with carpenter glue however wouldnt' suggest it you already broke the security behind the door it won't take much of anything to break it again and if this is a door that is an entry door i strongly recommend replacing you can seal up the cracks with a paintable latex caulk or wood putty then paint it more likely will still show the signs of being broke though i new interior door is about at home depot lowes it is a prehung door which means all the jambs stops hinges is included its not rocket science to install a door but its not childs play either at least to get it to come out like it should the cost on installing the door would be about depending on area and the supply and demand Harp Door Violin De Lorean DMC-12 Seismic retrofit Drill bit Carpenter bee Carnivorous plant Radio controlled airplane Wood carving Plastic Upholstery Bus models used in New York City Transit Wind turbine Welding Internal ballistics Combine (Half-Life 2) Black Mesa Research Facility Air-raid shelter Pebble bed reactor Electrical wiring Locked room mystery Toyota Prius Cello Buckingham Palace The Ark in Space Mattress Asbestos Elevator Naval mine Poker jargon Bulk vending Windows XP Password cracking The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Dodge Neon Saw II Rathfarnham Doctor Who (Enemy Within) George Costanza Electricity meter Fire fighting Bone fracture Thermal power station Window Roof The Citadel (Military College) Windows 2000 Emergency preparedness Jumpstart 3rd Grade Airbag Microeconomics Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Columbine High School massacre Continuation War Heinkel He 100 Cremation Dairy StarCraft Secret Missions Oscilloscope Ocean's Twelve BMW M5 Tire Cryptography Safe-cracking Hydrogen economy Screw Colony in Space Guqin Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Extreme Programming Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Traumatic brain injury Model aircraft Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Illegal drug trade Metroid Prime Menstrual cup Petroleum Space Shuttle program Space Shuttle Columbia disaster The Doctor Dances Embedded system Solar power Diving cylinder Knife PaX Doorknob Norbert Wiener Hard disk Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, manga or movie only characters Woodworking The Shining (film) World War II Waking the Dragons Vacuum tube Time and the Rani The Champions Aerial (dance move)
