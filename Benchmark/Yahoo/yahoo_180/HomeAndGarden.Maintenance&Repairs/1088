blinking exterior home lighting is driving me crazy i have three light on my rear garage that blink like they are on some sort of timer they go on for about sec and then off for never varies there is apparently no switch for these lights either i'm going to install a switch but i would first like to know what is causing them to flash i have access to the rear of the lights but don't see anything that might be the cause i've changed out the bulbs from what i can see by tracing the wires in the attic there is nothing there either they are coach lights i've looked at them pretty close and i do not believe they are triggered by motion or dusk dawn but since there seems not to be a switch that would make sense i have put in standard incandesent w and w compact flouesents bulbs and they both turn off and on the same way the garage has its own breaker box and they still do this even with everything turned off they three light turn off and on together thanks for all your suggestions great i found the sensor it was located near an eave on the back of the garage and i can hear it cycling adjusting it didn't do anything but i'm going to swap in a new one and see if that does the trick if these are automatic lights that come on at dusk i would suggest that the cause might be the light sensor that turns the lights on is malfunctioning or the lamp light is providing feedback to the light sensor and turning the lamps off and then the cycle repeats the thing that suggests that is the constant second interval you noted that is the darkness turns the lamp on the sensor sees the light from the lamp and turns it off the darkness turns the lamp on etc with a second response time with all the lights cycling at the same time it sounds like one sensor controls all so you should probably try to locate the sensor in the system and see if maybe it has been moved away from it's proper position Traffic light Automotive lighting Headlight Mouse (computing) Street light Fluorescent lamp Stage lighting X10 (industry standard) Bicycle lighting Switch Lighting Incandescent light bulb Eye Sensor Electric motor Embedded system Floppy disk Transformer Apollo Guidance Computer Railway signal Seismometer Airbag Relay M16 (rifle) Cannabis cultivation Musical Instrument Digital Interface Movie projector Enigma machine Burglar alarm Oscilloscope Hall effect Circuit breaker Amstrad CPC Elevator Bubble Bobble Daylight saving time Helicopter Inertial guidance system Nintendo Revolution Dimmer Thermostat Rotor machine Digital camera Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Residual-current device Electrophysiology Mercury Atlas 6 Carburetor Alternating current Magnetic core memory Armored Core Super Nintendo Entertainment System Light gun Digital Light switch Light pollution General relativity Keyboard technology Light-emitting diode Special relativity Altair 8800 Color Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Ignition system Federal Standard 1037C Combine (Half-Life 2) Brain Transducer System/34 Manual transmission Compact fluorescent lamp Oxygen sensor Film Electrical wiring Security lighting Cloaking device Motion capture Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawk Shaggy dog story TGV Star Destroyer Phoebe Halliwell Digital photography Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Windows 2000 Light Wire wrap Steering Drag racing
