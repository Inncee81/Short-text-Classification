weathertron to ritetemp thermostat change problem i purchased a ritetemp c thermostat and tried to hook it up last night and found i had too many wires i looked on their website today and saw that i will need to purchase the c because on my old thermostat i do have an emergency heat setting so i guess that means i have a multistage heat pump i still have a couple wiring questions though my old thermostat is a weathertron doesn t have a number i labeled the wires i unhooked from it and they are r o g y x b w so now i am looking at the diagrams for the c and i don t see any that have all of r o g y w and since i have both o and b i should tape off o correct lastly i can t find any information on what x is please help it ll be awfully hot at my house tonight if i can t get it hooked up after work heat pumps are tricky i wouldn't replace the old t stat unless i had to to get you out of your current jam though all you need to do is hook up r g y and o if there is no o terminal on your new thermostat you need ot hook o and r together your system won't work in the heating mode like this you need a thermostat designed for heat pumps i think x might be a common to run the emergency heat light but i might be mistaken Thermostat Heat Autonomous building Solar power Electrical wiring Apollo 13 Carburetor Heinkel He 100 Joy Division (band) Embedded system Central processing unit Thermal power station Transformer Artificial consciousness Incandescent light bulb Circuit design Ironing Burglar alarm Control system Stirling engine Transistor Tesla coil Three-phase electric power Radiator Spark plug Renewable energy Vacuum tube Welding Billboard Hot 100 Telephone exchange Resistor Scientific revolution Ethernet Furnace Firefighter Process control Oscilloscope Magnetic core memory Bi-metal Rice cooker The Emancipation of Mimi Aquarium Motor oil Armored Core Solar cell Modem Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Electrical generator Switch Bombe We Belong Together Action potential Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster CPU cache Refrigerator CPU design Street-Legal Hydrogen economy R46 (New York City Subway car) Jet engine Pump It Up Gas absorption refrigerator Hybrid vehicle Cyclic process RS-232 Airport George Westinghouse Wire Tap (valve) Hydraulic machinery Trombe wall IBM PC compatible Pearl Jam Wheel of Fortune Password Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Gas metal arc welding New York City Subway nomenclature Federal Standard 1037C System/36 Glossary of firefighting equipment Tire Overhead lines Fusor Adiabatic process Reading spark plugs for racing Energy development Non-native pronunciations of English Remix Anchor TGV Electrophysiology Halting problem Capacitor 2003 North America blackout Magnet Cray-1 Steam engine Advanced Technology Attachment
