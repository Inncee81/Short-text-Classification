a question for mobile home owners with an electric furnace how does an electric furnace compare with an oil furnace both in heating efficiency and overall costs as far as efficiency electric is tops percent of the money you spend on fuel gets used to heat the home none goes up a chimney the drawback is the cost of electric power is the most expensive if you have to go electric consider a heat pump you pay to move the heat but not the heat itself it also serves as an a c in summer heat pumps are only efficient when the weather is above and dry oil furnaces have come a long way in the past few years they are much more efficient cleaner burning and lower maintenance than in the past drawback is you pay quite a bit for fuel all at one time unless you are with a company that lets you spread payments out over the season the tank can also be an issue with some folks on the up side newer furnaces can burn bio diesel as for safety oil is actually diesel fuel it must be mixed with oxygen in order to burn there is little to no danger of uncontrolled fire from diesel oil fuel dollar for dollar oil is less expensive to operate Diesel engine Hydrogen economy Solar power Coal Energy development Fuel injection Furnace Steam engine Future energy development Two-stroke cycle E85 Nuclear power Renewable energy Thermal power station Transformer Fossil fuel power plant Locomotive Alcohol fuel Hybrid vehicle Turbocharger Natural gas Carburetor Biodiesel Rocket fuel Tank Internal combustion engine Filling station High-speed rail Steel Pebble bed reactor Aircraft engine Fire Cogeneration Diesel Hydrogen vehicle Portable stove Solar cell Sewage treatment Wind turbine Biofuel Nuclear power phase-out Stove Autonomous building Diesel cycle Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Gasoline Fire fighting Wood fuel Kitchen Incandescent light bulb Carbon dioxide Cruising (maritime) Spacecraft propulsion Microeconomics Space shuttle main engine Glossary of firefighting terms Welding Automobile Fire extinguisher Cracking (chemistry) Wind power CANDU reactor Grid energy storage Iron Irrigation Economy of the United States Liquid fuels Sport utility vehicle Glossary of wildland fire terms Derbyshire lead mining history Spark plug Explosive material Air conditioning Fuel Incineration Electric vehicle Ceramics Space Shuttle program Blast furnace Apollo Command/Service Module Stirling engine Wildfire Oil price increases of 2004 and 2005 Heating oil Energy Policy Act of 2005 Gas turbine-electric locomotive Town gas Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Renewable energy development Implications of peak oil
