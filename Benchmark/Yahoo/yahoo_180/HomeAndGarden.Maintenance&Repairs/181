is it too late to replace ignition coil my lawnmower went through a long phase of running while cool then stopping when the engine heats up i didn't know what was going on at the time but went along with it now it won't start at all well it may start for about seconds and then stop i did some research and it seems i probably have a bad ignition coil so i will search for one this week before i do i'm wondering if my mower is even fixable now and if so will i be able replace the coil myself or will i need to go to a repair shop which i hope to avoid it could be the coil magneto if its an older motor it could have points under the flywheel i had a hp tecumseh motored dynamark with points would do exactally that run fine cold then die when hot and not run again till cooled off replacing a magneto is fairly easy points are a bit tougher either way the flywheel cover needs removing the metal shroud on the top of the motor its held on by a few bolts under the cover youll see where the spark plug wire runs into this 'u' shaped device next to the flywheel big round piece with fins cast in it one wire should run to the carb side of motor thats the ground wire to kill the motor if theres more then one wire comming from it and going under the flywheel its possible it has points there are one or two leads that come out by the starter those are for the charging lites system the points are hooked directly to the magneto magnetos usually dont go bad but sometimes they do usually they run around and up a local lawn mower parts place should be able to match up a new one you would need the motor numbers either on the flywheel shroud you removed or on one of the other engine sheilds has a model number serial number and code and engine type briggs tecumseh other write all these down and take to the parts place along with the old magneto points well this is tougher the flywheel will need to be pulled the large nut on the top holding it on will need to be removed a puller will need to be used its like a large bolt in the center to apply pressure then two bolts that run down into prethreaded holes in the top of the flywheel i think you could rent or borrow one from the parts place do not try prying the flywheel off with a prybar or hammering on it its a cast piece and will shatter its a press fit and can only be removed with a proper puller if you do decide to try pulling it off its an experience itll sound exactally like it breaks with a large bang but thats what it sounds like i use a c clamp to keep the motor from turning run it up to the inside bottom of flywheel away from starter teeth and let it rest against engine block there is a small key thet keeps the flywheel from turning this is whats called a 'flywheel key' do not reuse this or youll be replacing it again soon its a one shot deal i suggest when reassembling this to thouroughly clean the crankshaft end inside of flywheel keyway and put a very light amount of neverseize on those surfaces the points will be under a cover around the crank end you should bring those along as well to replace them i highly doubt its the carb or a headgasket if it were those the engine would run rough or not at all from the start kidd Carburetor Lawn mower Motor oil Bong Drill bit Internal combustion engine Screw Casting Automobile self starter Thermal power station Internal ballistics Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster M16 (rifle) Mattress Diesel engine Handloading Tire Aircraft engine controls Two-stroke cycle Ignition system Tesla coil Torpedo Welding Wire Naval mine Electric motor Lathe Thermostat Glossary of climbing terms Rail terminology Firearm Seismic retrofit Radio controlled airplane Cartridge (firearms) Poker jargon Rigging Indianapolis 500 Textile manufacturing Ford FE engine Machine gun Magnet Lightning Stirling engine Reading spark plugs for racing Loudspeaker Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Rotary engine Steam engine Glossary of firefighting equipment The Dalek Invasion of Earth Brewery Equine conformation Battery electric vehicle Knife STS-61 1957 World Series Hybrid vehicle Solar power Aircraft engine Circuit design Guitar Energy development Woodworking Fluorescent lamp Heinkel He 100 Electrical generator Jump start (vehicle) Mouse (computing) Combine harvester Hard disk Jet engine Diode Bread Connecting rod Nuclear weapon design Toyota Corolla Electrical wiring Terminal ballistics Sailing Hand grenade Electrophysiology Professional wrestling throws Flywheel energy storage Spacecraft propulsion Telephone exchange AMC V8 engine Dodge Neon Heinkel He 112 Windows XP Robot Master Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Bass guitar
