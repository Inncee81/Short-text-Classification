water pump problem our well is in the basement weird i know it run's everytime you flush the tolite or run any water at all for that matter does that mean i need a bigger one it over heated and burnt of the wires before it even got to the fuse box we only noticed once we had no water it had been running most the day as the kids were playing in the sprinkler outside i shut off the water outside every hour and let it rest for awhile as i new it was running hubby replaced that wire but i want to get a new pump i'm not sure what to even look for in price size or whatever all i know is that it is not submerged any suggestions the house was built in the 's or 's so we have no record of how deep the well is there is something wrong with the tank if it is a air bag tank then either the air setting is wrong or it has no air in it should be psi less air in the tank than the kick on pressure of your pump if your pump kicks on at psi there should be psi air in tank if pump kicks on at psi there should be psi air in tank there will be a schrader valve to check air presssure somewhere on tank looks like the thing where you put air in your tire turn pump off and open a faucet somewhere and leave it on put air into tank once air pressure stays at pounds less than kick on pressure of your pump shut off faucet and restart pump pump should come on after you run approximately to gallons of water you dont need a bigger pump but you might need bigger wire to supply power to it if your tank has an old galvanized tank it might be waterlogged and you will need to drain all the water out of tank and then restart pump you will have to do this about every three months if you have an galvanized tank Thermal power station Siphon Glossary of firefighting equipment Three Mile Island Hydraulic machinery Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Dairy Thermostat Apollo 13 Autonomous building Glossary of firefighting terms Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Space shuttle main engine Dialysis Carburetor Solar power Hydrogen economy Irrigation Rebreather Brewery Tap (valve) Fossil fuel power plant Oxyacetylene B-47 Stratojet Apollo Command/Service Module Tire Diving cylinder Water supply Energy development Steam engine E85 USS Yorktown (CV-5) Snorkel Diving regulator Diesel engine Pump Basement Newcomen steam engine Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Fire fighting Turbocharger Plumbing fixture Hydroponics Gimli Glider Space Shuttle external tank Terran (StarCraft) Petroleum Heinkel He 100 Panama Canal Mattress Vacuum Home repair Aircraft engine controls Fire hydrant Pneumatics Renewable energy Ocean thermal energy conversion Fluid pressure Novelty (locomotive) Space disaster Coffee Sento Fuel pump Battle of Tarawa Carbon dioxide Water purification Mercury arc valve Fire Sprinkler STS-114 Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Scuba diving Welding Grid energy storage Rocket fuel Refrigerator Samovar Water tower Apollo 1 Torpedo Incandescent light bulb Poker jargon Glossary of wildland fire terms Firefighter Saturn V Air conditioning Aquarium Kerosene lamp Pebble bed reactor Hydraulic ram House music Sewage treatment Second Battle of El Alamein
