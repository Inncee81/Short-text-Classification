how long should a swimming pool last april i had a jacuzzi swimming pool installed in my backyard not only were the crew who set everything up unprofessional they installed a valve upside and had to come back twice to fix the same problem after the first year of having the pool i noticed that the stainless steel plate that the eyeball of the skimmer is connected to was rusting and my pool liner was becoming very loose and wrinkly decided to call the great escape and see if they could have someone come out to fix the problem they said that there was nothing they could do because they had fired the contractors that installed my pool let's fast fwd a few years to the present i go outside to check the chemicals in the water and i step in a huge mud puddle i look down to see the outter part of my pool the part that looks like wood grain bubbling and water squirting out wtf can this be from my first pool lasted over years and this one is falling apart after what can i do i assume this is an above ground pool first and foremost stainless steel does not rust so it was probably chrome second i dunno who the great esacpe is but i assume that they are some sort of pool place and when you buy a pool from them they in turn hire subcontractors to install the pool they are responsible for the people they hire so who cares if they fired them it is still their responsibility they chose to hire the bums not you your contract is with tge not with the bums tge is responsible so what can you do first call tge back and tell them it is their responsibility just like i outlined if they decline tell them you will first contact the bbb better business burea then the local media atleast one channel usually has a crew that pounces on people who do crappy work then contact jacuzzi and tell them of tge's unscrupulous behaviour in selling servicing warrantying jaccuzzi's product and last but not least you will contact a lawyer which you know without a doubt it is a courtcase that you will win and in turn tge will provide you a new pool at their expense plus pay all attourney fees if they still buck up and say screw you do what i just told you to do and show some fangs oh and by the way you should have your swimming pool papers somewhere if u didn't throw them away which will tell you the brand model and warranty info pools all vary in warranties i don't know of any with less than a yr manufacturers warranty this does not cover labor warranty tho Swimming pool Welding Knife Drill bit Tire Mattress Bretton Woods system Sauna Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Solar power Carburetor Corrosion Steel Gas metal arc welding Brewery Passenger car Tag Motorcycle The Apprentice 2 Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina ITV Microeconomics Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Poker jargon Copyleft Universal Serial Bus Apple Computer Grey market M16 (rifle) Dairy Fire hydrant Thermal power station E85 Body piercing Cookware and bakeware 1919 World Series United Kingdom corporation tax Digital photography Wayne Corporation Insurance Dodge Neon Keynesian economics RMS Titanic Futurama (TV series - season 5) Road-rule enforcement camera The Amazing Race TSMS Lakonia Apollo 8 Efficiency wages Diving cylinder Topps Jackass: The Movie Wal-Mart Elevator Cranford, New Jersey Krag-J__rgensen Modding Hydrochloric acid Land Rover Heinkel He 112 Charles Ponzi Action potential Siphon Publicly funded medicine Hydraulic machinery MDAC Trademark Information Services Procurement Library IPod Titanium M60 machine gun Stage lighting Sento Pioneer Zephyr Dishwasher Plastic Hydrogen economy Make money fast Viva La Bam IBook Public policy Douglas DC-8 Mercury 4 Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Economy of the United States Diving Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Handloading
