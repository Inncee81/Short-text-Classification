induction cooktop blows internal fuse i have acquired a used kenmore induction cooktop from someone that says the two small burners work fine but when he turns on the larger burners they blow the small a fuse inside not the fuse in his house i haven't hooked it up to our wiring yet which meets the requirements for this cooktop and i haven't looked inside it yet what do you think the problem could be so i know what to look for could his wiring have caused it his house is of an era that used aluminum wiring and may have not had the required dedicated a circuit bad power module bad capacitor something specific to induction cooking technology should i check for something in particular before i hook it up to my house and see if the larger burners work here anybody have similiar problems with an induction cooking unit thanks i suppose i should add this unit has two power modules with one small and one large burner going to each module i don't have a manual but i do have a parts diagram and parts list and the previous owner gave me extra fuses the fuses he gave me do match the ones listed on the part list so it's probably not an improper fuse of course there may be a short circuit in wiring to the big burners it is possible though that the fuse is of the improper rating if the fuse blows when the burners are not turned on it must be a short circuit it could be in the feed to either or both burner switches or the branch to one burner switch if it does not blow when only one burner is turned on but does on the other you can guess where the trouble is if it blows only when both are turned on it is likely that the fuse is of too low a rating Fuse (electrical) Electric motor Circuit design Thermal power station Electronic amplifier Electrophysiology Antenna (radio) Portable stove Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Tesla coil Gas metal arc welding Vacuum tube X10 (industry standard) Stove Capacitor Loudspeaker BS 1363 Thermostat Circuit breaker Transistor Poker jargon Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Fluorescent lamp Switched-mode power supply Web crawler Alternating current Atari 8-bit family Apollo Guidance Computer Integrated circuit Nuclear weapon design High-voltage direct current Furnace Welding Inductor Nuclear fusion Incandescent light bulb Digital circuit Internal ballistics Solar cell Modem Computer Operational amplifier Central processing unit CMOS Jet engine Printed circuit board Cookware and bakeware Buffer overflow Electrical generator Floppy disk Dimmer National Electrical Code (US) Diode Spacecraft propulsion Perl Capacitor plague Series and parallel circuits Amiga DVD Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Ethernet CPU cache Apollo 13 Dynamic random access memory Kitchen Battery (electricity) Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Firearm Hydraulic machinery Optical fiber Telephone exchange Internal combustion engine Microphone Action potential Logic gate Cray-1 IBM 1620 Cerebellum Advanced Squad Leader Residual-current device Relay Space disaster Phase-shift keying Motorcycle Wind turbine Railgun Hot air balloon Lightning ITU-T Electric power transmission Lineman (occupation) Electrical wiring
