how cold should the air be coming out of an air conditioner vent of a central hvac unit the temperature of the air coming out of the vents should be somewhere from to degrees colder than the room air temperature anything less than degrees and your unit will not cool your home anything over degrees and your unit will freeze up most units are only capable of putting out to degree air when the temperature in your home reaches degrees HVAC Water (molecule) Air conditioning Temperature Autonomous building Climate of the United Kingdom Thermoregulation Thermostat Solar power Severe weather terminology (United States) Frost Swamp cooler Hot air balloon Fog Deep lake water cooling Dodge Neon Ice Degree Fahrenheit Degree Celsius Vacuum Diving suit Furnace Ocean thermal energy conversion Urban heat island Fire fighting Hyperthermia Refrigerator Radon Refrigeration Global climate model Ozone depletion Water vapor Weather front Hypothermia Peltier-Seebeck effect Convection Sea ice Heat index Little Ice Age Explosive material Ozone hole Thermal power station Weather lore Temperate Liquefied natural gas Polyethylene terephthalate Ice cream Thunderstorm Relative humidity Geyser Temperature inversion Eocene Terraforming Climate of India M16 (rifle) Atmospheric circulation Cloud El Ni__o Axial compressor Fan death Carburetor Phase change heat pump Global warming Data center United Technologies Corporation Younger Dryas Bleed air Jet engine K__ppen climate classification Lake Wind chill Insulation Adiabatic lapse rate Cryogenics Fuzzy logic Renewable energy The Day After Tomorrow Computer cooling National Weather Service Room temperature Automobile emissions control Carburetor heat Absolute zero Hydrogen peroxide Engine cooling Central heating Pyroclastic flow Sauna Warm-blooded E85 Robot Master Spark plug Ice core Permafrost Sun Planetary habitability Scramjet
