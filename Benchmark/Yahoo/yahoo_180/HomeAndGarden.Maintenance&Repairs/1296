he added freon gas into my home ac and charged me how do i know if the charge is reasonable or not my keeprite home ac didn't work properly the service guy came and replaced a v capacitor and charged me canadian dollars then he added freon gas in from psi to psi and charged me he said the price for freon gas is psi in addition he charged me labor for about hours work in my home i felt ripped off a simple search finds that a similar capacitor is about any one can tell me the price of freon gas in similar situation as a non technical guy in need of ac service how do i know if his charge is reasonable or not can i complain to his company and get some money back please help the freon is r in fact the didn't complete the fix it started to work and stopped after one or two hours after several hours i started the ac again and it worked for another one or two hours then stopped the service guy came again reversed the turning direction of the colling fan looks like it is finally fixed thanks for all answers my point is how customers know the charges parts are right or not in that situation if you spend an hour to search the price on the net you will be charged for another because the service guy is on site waiting for you the time to ask this question was before the work was done perfect in theory but not practical you have to pay just for the guy to come and you have little knowledge and little choice to turn down his estimate i simply asked a question that how would a customer know if the charge is reasonable or not some a c guy started getting angry or scared this only reminds us that we can not trust them honest people would welcome these questions i do services and i know if you are not open and fair you do not get trust btw the company i used is air tech in toronto richmond area i would leave you to judge it was fair or not something doesn't sound quite right especially about the freon fyi freon is just a brand name for refrigerant since you're canadian r is still a very popular refrigerant there and systems will be manufatured in the us with r until the year and mostl likely unless your a c is over years old r is the refrigerant used if it's over that in age it could be r and r is extremely expensive depending on how low the charge was in your system the price he charged may not be too far out of line you also don't say if it's a window unit or a central system the average going rate in the us for labor on hvac systems is to us per hour i don't have the exact conversion rate handly but i'm guessing to canadian wouldn't be to far off so if he worked about minutes that labor charge would be about right as far as the capacitor goes one about the same isn't the same as one exactly the same if you still feel like you got ripped off call the servicing company and ask them to explain the charges in detail Haloalkane Microeconomics Labor theory of value Air conditioning Cray-1 Theory of conduct FairTax Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Circuit design Inflation Extreme Programming Explosive material Supply and demand Tax GED Dirac equation Gross domestic product Refrigerator Social rule Surplus value Time Out of Mind Mutual fund United Kingdom corporation tax Capacitor StarCraft Episode VI Labour economics Normal distribution Poker jargon Traumatic incident reduction Windows XP Coming of Age (TNG episode) Insurance Publicly funded medicine Ammonia Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Friends Law of value Many-worlds interpretation Expert system IP (complexity) 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, vote suppression Avenue Q Identical particles The Amazing Race Economics Unemployment Diving cylinder Flat tax Electrophysiology Plame affair Shaggy dog story Kyle Broflovski Euro CPU design 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Philosophical skepticism Wheel of Fortune Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics) America Online The Price Is Right North American Numbering Plan Capital accumulation Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Microphone Domain Name System Ben Johnson (athlete) Keynesian economics Audiophile CPU cache The Apprentice 2 Efficiency wages EastEnders Prices of production Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Economy of the United States Social Security (United States) Goodness and value theory Modem Episodes of Lost (Season 1) E-mail spam Health insurance Computer HVAC Wal-Mart Atari 8-bit family Capitalism Belief revision Rebreather Citigroup Game programmer High-speed rail Refrigeration Windows Vista Road pricing Mortgage Fluorescent lamp
