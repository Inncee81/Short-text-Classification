can i fix an alternator to a fan and let the wind charge a v battery i have an allotment with no electricity supply so i use v batteries for power i want to find some way of charging the batteries without having to take them to a mains supply a gas power generator be good but if you really need wind power you would have to have a pretty big type of fan to catch the wind and a big belt on the other end should not be that hard to wire it up just like it is on car but i dont think it would be charging alot so you would need quite a few battaries to charge at one time but sure ive seen it before if you have a lot of wind your cool Battery (electricity) Energy development Hydrogen economy Electric motor Thermal power station Solar power Wind power Renewable energy Transformer Thermostat Locomotive Lead-acid battery Vacuum tube Toyota Prius Fan (implement) Circuit design Three-phase electric power Internal combustion engine Welding Hybrid vehicle Electric boat Lithium ion battery Gas metal arc welding Fuel cell Turbocharger Grid energy storage Future energy development Radio controlled car Electroshock gun Electricity Static (superhero) Power station Hybrid Synergy Drive IPod Uninterruptible power supply Alternative fuel Hydropower Cruising (maritime) Nickel-cadmium battery Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Torpedo Tesla coil Alternator Solar car Laptop Bicycle lighting Volt Arc welding Wind turbine Windmill Welding power supply Hydrogen Mercury arc valve Gas turbine Hydraulic machinery Autonomous building Automobile ancillary power Electric locomotive Switch Gas tungsten arc welding Diode Energy storage Ford Ranger EV Electricity meter Nuclear reactor Nuclear power Electric vehicle Wire Fossil fuel power plant Capacitor Supercharger Plastic Stirling engine Electricity generation Third rail Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Power supply Jennifer Lopez Machine gun Bass guitar Railway electrification system Hydrogen vehicle Second Battle of the Atlantic Model aircraft Solar cell Manitoba Hydro Aircraft engine controls Future of the car Direct current Airsoft Geomagnetic storm Electric power Resistor Honda Insight Natural gas Drill
