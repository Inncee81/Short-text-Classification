why do electric currents and sockets get hot a nicer answer when electricity passes through anything there is a certain amount of resistance the force that it takes to make the current run through this resistance is the voltage if there is higher resistance you need a higher voltage water is a good conductor meaning that there is less resistance and is better than air a human body is also a good conductor because of the water in us a copper wire is very good and gold is even better but there is still a level of resistance when anything in the world encounters resistance the force behind it creates heat as that object is forced through you can feel the heat on your hands when you rub them on your pants same thing that is why copper becomes hot and people receive burns when electrocuted make sense oh and when the news says that someone got zapped with say volts you need to know the amount of current or amps to really know what that means current is what kills you that is what stops your heart the voltage is just the punch behind it it hurts but without the current you should live through it it only takes a tiny tiny bit of current to kill you but you can live through a heck of a lot of voltage Volt Circuit design Capacitor Electrical resistance Electric shock Transformer Incandescent light bulb High-voltage hazards Electricity Current (electricity) Fuse (electrical) Solar cell Split phase Resistor Electrical wiring Welding Lightning Hall effect Electrical generator Tesla coil Electric motor Decibel Peltier-Seebeck effect Conductor (material) Action potential MOSFET Three-phase electric power Superconductivity Ceramics War of Currents Voltage drop Ampere Ground (electricity) Circuit breaker Diode Alternating current Spacecraft propulsion Vacuum tube Operational amplifier BS 1363 Battery (electricity) Inductor Electric power transmission Printed circuit board Electrical element Impedance matching Third rail Mains electricity Thermostat Thermal power station Wind turbine Ohm's law Residual-current device Fluorescent lamp Water (molecule) Electricity meter Microphone Transistor Electric chair Oxygen sensor Internal ballistics Central processing unit Gas metal arc welding Solar panel Ozone Fossil fuel power plant Lightning rod Electronic amplifier Electrometer Wire Electroshock gun Pok__mon Abilities Corona discharge Titanium George Westinghouse Directed-energy weapon Energy development Copper Theory of conduct Charles Wheatstone Renewable energy Loudspeaker Direct current Lineman (occupation) Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets RS-232 Light switch Piccolo Junior Saga Bicycle lighting CPU design Nonconductor
