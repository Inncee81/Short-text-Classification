how do i maintain an adt house alarm my mother has just moved into a bungalow fitted with an adt alarm installed by a previous occupant who never used it it appears to be fairly new she called in adt to remove a detector form the kitchen so the dog may sleep there and install a panic alarm however when the surveyor called he said that adt would charge to per month to maintain the alarm she had an alarm in her previous property that was checked once a year at a cost of c are there companies in the essex area that will check and make adjustments to an adt alarm without my mother signing up to an expensive long term cvontract i note from your previous questions that your mother is elderly i would make an approach to your local police crime prevention officer and perhaps also to a local office of age concern they may have some useful advice on reputable alarm locksmiths in your area many alarms are totally unsuitable and just too sophisticated for elderly people for a variety of reasons the complexity of codes the time delays the key pads etc you can get large button size pads for example i do not know the details of the adt product but lots of alarms that have or require an angineer monitoring call out to reset them are capable of being programmed to be reset by a householder them selves in this case by you on your mothers behalf depending upon how technical you are if you can get hold of the installation book it might tell you how to get back to the factory default settings and you can follow the re programming instructions yourself i will not tell you how on this open site if need be a once and for all payment might enable an alarm fitter to use the existing sensors etc and fit a new more appropriate control box and key pad there are sensors on the market that are pet friendly they are set depending upon the height and weight of the dog so that they do not activate when the animals move around but still activate when an intruder enters this is useful as the dog can move around as freely as you want acting as another deterent there is some benefit in monitoring for elderley but it comes at a cost perhaps it would be worth asking about a 'red alert' panic button which people can wear round their neck and press for assistance this works via your phone and is useful if people are prone to illness emergencies do not underestimate the simple benefits of a door chain and persuading your mother to use it properly when i say properly a door chain should not normally be left on all the time as if it were an extra door lock instead it should be put on before opening the door fully to calllers it shouldn't be left on othertimes or at night because in an emergency helpers will be hindered in gaining access in some areas the local authority will maintain a register of key holders to record your details for a call out police forces nowadays do not routinely respond to house alarms without additional evidence of a crime in progress hence the selling point for the monitoring companies but you can get systems that will dial a phone number eg yourself or friend when activated and also ones where you can dial into your own home and listen in for any unauthorised presence Fire alarm control panel Elevator Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Windows XP Mouse (computing) UK telephone numbering plan Combine (Half-Life 2) RFID Telephone numbering plan Microeconomics Traffic light Atari 8-bit family Trademark Embedded system Password Daylight saving time Surveillance RISC Computer CPU cache Palm OS Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Tax GSM services Insurance STS-61 Commodore 128 Phreaking Floppy disk Carburetor Public domain Annuity Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Expert system Credit card Glossary of firefighting equipment Urinary incontinence Cheating in Counter-Strike United Kingdom corporation tax Windows 2000 Compiler optimization Copyright North American Numbering Plan Public-key cryptography Columbine High School massacre Oscilloscope Mach kernel X86 assembly language Pretty Good Privacy Dog System/36 Closed-circuit television Information Technology Infrastructure Library Global Positioning System CPU design Automatic number plate recognition Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Drill bit Residual-current device Skype Telephone tapping Unemployment Donald Neilson Weight training Digital photography Enterprise content management C plus plus Hash table Lock picking Visual Basic Euro Crime prevention through environmental design Japanese toilet IPod Free trade Apollo Guidance Computer Gmail Medicine Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Bluetooth Password cracking Information Services Procurement Library Mattress Copy protection Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Nuclear proliferation Colony in Space Chess terminology Violin
