lawn mower troubleshooting i have a murry lawn mower with a hp briggs and stratton that is years old when i start the mower it will get up to normal rpm for about seconds and shut off i have fresh gass in it oil level full and a new air filter i use a small bit of seafoam in the gas every so often to keep the carb clean it seems to be a fuel cutout but i dont see a filter anywhere anyone have any advice on what i should do next i have worked on cars for years now and small engines are a bit new to me i have way too much man pride to take such a simple engine to a repairman so you can kindly save those types of replies these b s engines are pretty simple so if you think there is a fuel problem there are really only a couple of things that could be wrong clogged fuel line unlikely clogged carb or stuck float the carb is pretty simple and even a non gearhead like myself was able to figure it out there are only a cope of pieces to it and it is easy to figure out what could get clogged once you get it open the float is a little piece of plastic that regulated the gas flow into the bowl so if it gets stuck gas flow will be slow or stopped Carburetor Bong Lawn mower Motor oil Turbocharger Diesel engine Two-stroke cycle Toyota Prius Briggs & Stratton Thermal power station Kart racing Gas turbine Floppy disk Steam engine Internal combustion engine Transmission (mechanics) Battery electric vehicle Fuel injection Biodiesel Four-stroke cycle E85 Jet engine Dialysis Fire fighting Radio controlled airplane Ford Windsor engine Porsche 911 Fossil fuel power plant Space shuttle main engine Supercharger Hybrid vehicle Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster 2000 Australian Grand Prix Emission standard Embedded system Portable stove Apollo 6 Plastic Manual transmission Automobile Motorcycle Fuel efficiency Sewage treatment Dodge Charger Chainsaw Turbojet Spark plug 24 Hours of Le Mans Drill bit Rebreather Pulse jet engine Energy development Chevrolet Corvette Gramophone record Tank Formula One cars Hydrogen economy Combine harvester Diving regulator Locomotive Scuba set 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Switch Chevrolet Corvair engine Space Shuttle program Stirling engine Diesel cycle Golf Water Gas mask Fluorescent lamp Formula One regulations Carbon dioxide Diesel Safety engineering Toyota Corolla Drag racing Filling station Model aircraft Space disaster Explosive material Digital circuit De Lorean DMC-12 Nuclear reactor Thermostat Electric motor Traffic light Swimming pool Alcohol fuel Chevrolet Small-Block engine Electrical generator Power station 2-stroke power valve system Hard water Hydrogen vehicle Wankel engine
