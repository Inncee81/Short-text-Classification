is it possible to cover old worn out concrete path with a sharp sand cement mix i have an old concrete path that is worn out can i render over it with a sharp sand cement mix without it cracking or blowing or should i dig it all up and start again something i dont wont to do because it will create alot of clearing up the only way it can be done is use sbr available from any builders merchant which is a resin which is mixed with normal cement dab this on the concrete with a brush and when it has changed colour slightly apply the new mix tip only apply small parts at once with the sbr as it will pick up on you really quickly but i would advise on diggin it up as it will be a more permanent job have fun Casting Drill bit Reinforced concrete Concrete Pottery Anchor Building material Stucco Pavement (material) Combine (Half-Life 2) Portland cement Diving Bong Volleyball Construction RuneScape quests Mortar (masonry) Straw-bale construction Loudspeaker Electric motor Paint Thermal power station Steel Concrete mixer Sandstone USS Vestal (AR-4) President (game) Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve Radio controlled airplane Glass Amber Soldering Wood Lincoln Highway Electrophysiology History of the Panama Canal Sewage treatment Stonehenge Roman road Second Battle of the Atlantic Air-raid shelter Pozzolana Asphalt concrete Knife Aggregate (composite) Use of poison gas in World War I Adhesive Woodworking Sand casting Lightning rod Tattoo Upholstery Ceramics Illegal drug trade Drawing Road Color Geodesic dome Sento Silicon Natural building Paul Is Dead Corrosion Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Cavitation Christmas tree Extreme Programming Canadian dollar Land mine Plastic Technicolor German grammar Floppy disk Vacuum tube Shotcrete Pozzolanic ash Rail tracks ITV Carburetor Isaac Brock Internal ballistics Paintball Gramophone record Winning Streak Dental brace Perfume Naval mine Geography of Canada Neopets Sand Fossil Naruto jutsu Swimming pool Painter and decorator Brazing Battle of Iwo Jima Repouss__ and chasing
