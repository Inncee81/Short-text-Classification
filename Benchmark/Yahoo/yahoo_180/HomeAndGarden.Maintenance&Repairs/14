how can i unblock my kitchen sink this isn't a straightforward block the waste water from the sink flows into the washing machine next to it i set the washing machine to 'drain' and it sends the water back to the sink i have put down one bottle of sink unblocker which has reduced the water level i have poured a second bottle of sink unblocker down the sink which i shall leave overnight if this doesn't work i am going to get some caustic soda and put that down the sink any other ideas please i want to try and avoid getting in a plumber because they are so expensive your sink pipes are blocked with soap powder and grit which is in soap powder you can use all the chemicals you want but they will not move this type of blockage if you can remove the trap under the sink or take out a peice of pipe to get into a streight run of pipe and get a drain spring from b and q or a plumbing store and push down the spring and rotate it it will break up the deposits and they will flush through with water j r s environmental services Sewage treatment Domestic water system Plumbing fixture Kitchen Bong Siphon Menstrual cup Water purification Sodium hydroxide Sewer Rebreather Japanese toilet Energy development Flush toilet Hard water Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Carbon dioxide Thermal power station Internal ballistics Brewery Autonomous building Water Dialysis Urinal Plastic Textile manufacturing Dishwasher Hydraulic machinery Sulfuric acid Washing machine Drainage Laundry detergent Acne Coffee Drill bit Bread Glossary of firefighting equipment Cruising (maritime) Bulk vending Cocaine Tea Soap Diseases of the honeybee Basement Eggerland series Dishwashing Blitzball Wario Naval mine Soap bubble Dundas Square Compiler optimization Mattress Fire extinguisher Toilet Solar power Tap (valve) Carbon dioxide sink CPU cache Piccolo Junior Saga Futurama (TV series - season 4) Oplan Bojinka Sodium Toilet paper Home repair Fossil fuel power plant Portable stove Equine conformation Carburetor Seismic retrofit Agar plate Drain cleaner Tattoo Ship Hydroponics Dam Casting Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Glass Soldering Cannabis (drug) Hydropower Mach kernel Potassium hydroxide Bottle Derbyshire lead mining history Coriolis effect Single malt Scotch Ocean thermal energy conversion E85 Fountain Sento Dredge Eutrophication Waste management Toilet humour
