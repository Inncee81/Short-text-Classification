mysterious sprinkler geyser yesterday i woke up and found that water war shooting out of a sprinkler line and flooding my yard i shut off the main water valve and inspected the area finding a few holes in the line i went to home depot to buy a patch came back turned on the water to make sure i'd be patching the right section and nothing i turned on the system to full pressure and still nothing the entire system works fine and there isn't a leak in sight what's up with that if you found holes during the inspection they are still there so replace the section of pipe sorry but leaks don't heal at least not permanently Irrigation Carburetor Glossary of firefighting equipment Fire Sprinkler Tire USS Tunny (SS-282) Three Mile Island Firefighter Fire hydrant Thermal power station Home repair Glossary of firefighting terms Rail terminology Furnace Bong Flush toilet Energy development Containment building Siphon Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Casting Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Rebreather USS Vestal (AR-4) Eggerland series Spirit rover Unterseeboot 505 Steam (content delivery) Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Screw Diving regulator USS S-37 (SS-142) Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Thermostat Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Hurricane Rita Space shuttle main engine USS Triton (SS-201) Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Combine (Half-Life 2) Fossil fuel power plant RMS Titanic USS Washington (BB-56) Geothermal areas of Yellowstone Apollo 13 USS Yorktown (CV-5) Steam engine Tier One USS Pennsylvania (BB-38) Dam Oxyacetylene USS Wake Island (CVE-65) USS S-44 (SS-155) Air brake (rail) Flamethrower Two-stroke cycle Sleeve valve Russian joke Newcomen steam engine Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 March Geyser Hydraulic machinery Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Borehole USS Whale (SS-239) USS S-5 (SS-110) Water supply Naval mine USS Indianapolis (CA-35) Great Lakes Storm of 1913 USS S-35 (SS-140) Rose (Doctor Who) USS Wichita (CA-45) Electrophysiology Floodgate 2nd Canadian Infantry Division Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Uilleann pipes Seismic retrofit Cruising (maritime) Bob and George USS Wahoo (SS-238) Jefferson Parish, Louisiana Half-Life Diesel engine Team Fortress Classic Springfield 1903 rifle Columbine High School massacre Tag The Amber Spyglass The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie The UN Security Council and the Iraq war Diamond enhancement History of rail transport in Ireland Zerg Panama Canal Locks Space disaster Manifold vacuum Kitchen
