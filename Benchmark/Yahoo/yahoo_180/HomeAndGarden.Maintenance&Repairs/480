how can i access my central a c's evaporator to clean it i know where it's located but it's inside a sealed sheet metal box there are screws on one side of the plenum but the pipes running to the evaporator from the outside unit prevent me from pulling it open the air coming out of the vents isn't as cold as it used to be and i've cleaned every other part of my a c except for the evaporator it's never been cleaned for the years that it's been there i can only imagine how much dirt and dust is on it if your unit is years old you owe it to yourself to replace it a high efficiency system will save you on your electric cost for example if your cooling bill is per month then by replacing it you save per month however if you want to just clean the coil if it is in a closet upflow you will have to remove the front cover of the cased coil slide the coil out and then using hydrofloric acid spray the coil from the under side then rinse the acid off with water it works best if the coil is removed taken outside and cleaned however i think you are wanting the least expensive way out if the coil is located in the attic horizontal cut a hole in the transition and clean it with acid again rinsing it with water be careful with the acid it will burn your skin and eyes if it gets on you however it has been my experience that coils of this age range usually develop a freon leak after they have been disturbed a licensed service company will usually do this for good luck but it may not be cooling well for other reasons as well for example a dirty air filter coils outside are dirty or it is low on refrigerant best of luck Air conditioning Carburetor Brewery Thermostat Haloalkane Thermal power station Refrigerator Loudspeaker Solar power Mattress Drill bit Bong Soldering Incandescent light bulb Transformer Spark plug HVAC Hard disk Naval mine Autonomous building Furnace Motor oil Irrigation Vacuum Stove E85 Fossil fuel power plant Phase change heat pump Ocean thermal energy conversion Welding Casting Dry cleaning Heinkel He 100 Cray-1 Fluorescent lamp M16 (rifle) Bass guitar Internal ballistics Glossary of firefighting equipment Ammonia Floppy disk Ozone depletion Battery (electricity) Textile manufacturing Asbestos Swamp cooler Nuclear power Tesla coil Energy development Solar cell Smoke-screen Ozone hole Vacuum cleaner Wire Hydrogen peroxide Gramophone record Door Hard water Air pollution Sento Electric motor Two-stroke cycle Fuel injection Galileo spacecraft Professional wrestling throws Naruto jutsu Menstrual cup Ice core Seismic retrofit Soap Tire Home repair Cathode ray tube Fume hood Vacuum tube Screw Tattoo Motorcycle Internal combustion engine Rocket fuel Hydrogen economy First aid Flush toilet Printed circuit board Body piercing Pebble bed reactor Hydraulic machinery Inertial guidance system Shampoo Cartridge (firearms) Tofu Fire fighting Diving suit
