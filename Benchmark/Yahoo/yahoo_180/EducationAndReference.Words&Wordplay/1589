i tried to comment on the question asking about the phrase see you later a good question i thought my answer was when i first moved to yorkshire from cheshire years ago this annoyed me too but it is a nice way of saying that i want to see you again but i am unsure as to when later in this phrase refers to an indeterminate time in the future and is a friendly statement ps i also found the word fresh confusing as in cheshire it meant either being forward with a member of the opposite sex or refreshingly new however in yorkshire it refers to anyone having had a few too many to drink but not yet actually under the table nice question and at last my question is have you found any other confusing amusing regional differences in the use of the english language ps i'm sure you can imagine some embarrasing situations where people have misinterpreted one's use of fresh i know there must be even stranger conficts with words by region go for it around leeds sheffield the term 'while' means 'until' so i'm going off to see me mam while sunday means i'm going to see my mum and will stay until sunday but when the late british rail put up signs at level crossings that said do not cross while lights are flashing well you can imagine Dago Offensive terms per nationality Wifebeater (slang) Indian English Newbie Pejorative Transgender Use of the word American New Zealand English Canadian slang Commonwealth English Spell checker Low Saxon language Basque language Nigger Bandung Mormon Gay American and British English differences Political correctness Tsar Chucky Pancamo Hate speech Indonesian language Gay slang Masoretic Text Prison African American Leet Latin alphabet Slovak language Womyn Magic (paranormal) Kareem Said Italian language Tetragrammaton Politics of C__te d'Ivoire Family name Security guard Fake etymology Vernon Schillinger Gringo Alternative political spellings Allah Dictionary Speech synthesis Two-Spirit Non-native pronunciations of English Church of Christ (Mormonism) Magic and religion Gaikokujin Wog Alternative words for British English spelling Father Mulcahy English plural EverQuest Australian words Mixed-breed dog Midrash D'oh!
