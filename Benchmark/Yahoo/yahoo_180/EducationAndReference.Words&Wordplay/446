what should i name my domain for a personal site blog i want something related to stars i originally wanted 'adastra' because that is part of the tattoo i want to get per ardua ad astra and it means a lot to me but unfortunately it is already registered i then thought of having 'tothestars' which is the english trnslation of 'ad astra' but it seems a little awkward typed out and i generally prefer one or two word domain names another suggestion is 'etoile' which is the french word for 'star' but i don't actually speak french and someone pointed out that etoile is very similar to toilet some other ideas i had were 'aquilla' or 'elphinus' which are both names of constellations but i know nothing about astronomy so it is a little random finally i thought of 'illuminate' which is a nice word but not very original and not related to stars either suggestions or other things i could search for to find a nice name related to stars a line from a song i love is we watched the stars crash into the sea so that could be used but shorter luna now there's a big star Trademark Klingon language Expert system Chinglish Meaning of life Avenue Q Quotation Names of large numbers Constellation Philosophy of language The Star Wars Holiday Special Royal Air Force English plural Astronomy Moon Amateur astronomy Zodiac Theory of conduct Paul Is Dead Black hole Euphemism Luna Lovegood The Ashlee Simpson Show Ursa Major The Emancipation of Mimi Solar system O Canada Alpha Centauri Whose Line Is It Anyway?
