what's a hallow as in harry potter and the deathly hallows i know hallowed can mean holy or sacred as in hallowed be thy name and my dictionary tells me that the verb hallow means make holy which makes sense but what is the noun meaning i believe all saints' day st november is sometimes also called all hallows' day hence hallowe'en the eve of all hallows' day being the day before so does that mean a hallow is a saint i don't intend to read the potter book so maybe someone who has could enlighten me i have read the book and in it it refers to the 'deathly hallows as being items of magical significance it is described as a wizard style fairy tale or fable the hallows themselves are a stone a wand and a cloak all which are of great advantage to the owner so i guess in realtion to the dictionary meaning that you mentioned they are holy to the wizarding world as they are symbols of power and make the owner stonger hope that helps a bit Errol Flynn Lara Flynn Boyle Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale) The Adventures of Robin Hood (film) John Barrymore Quinton Flynn The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex Edge of Darkness Roddy McDowall The Aviator Lili Damita Robin Hood Anita Ekberg Moustache Cinema of Australia Cam Clarke Padraig Flynn Port Coquitlam, British Columbia Police The Relapse The Dawn Patrol Dodge City (1939 film) Irish people Chicago (2002 film) Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal Olivia de Havilland Humphrey Bogart The Lady from Shanghai Michael Flynn Flint Roger Moore Bene Gesserit Adventure film Newport Beach, California Flynn effect Actor Midnight Run Santa Fe Trail West Hollywood, California Michael Curtiz Australian Crawl Wyatt Earp San Simeon, California Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex Liam O'Flynn James J.
