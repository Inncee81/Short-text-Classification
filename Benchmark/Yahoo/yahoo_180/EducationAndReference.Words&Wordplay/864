where did the word ok come from what was the story behind it thank you well there are a lot of thereoys the choctaw theory in the american choctaw indian language there is a word okeh which means it is so it is likely although i can find no hard evidence that this word was used in some american communities in the early th century there is a report that andrew jackson during the battle of new orleans in learned of this choctaw word liked it and used it woodrow wilson also preferred this etymology and used okeh when he approved official papers his use led to this particular form being picked up by okeh records the name of a series of popular phonograph records mencken as well as hot dog stands shoe shining parlours and more the andrew jackson libel theory some time around seba smith was accused of libel in claiming that andrew jackson endorsed a pronouncement written by his literary secretary amos kendell with ok amos the details are not very clear but it is possible that what was really written was or meaning order recorded however one newspaper reporting on the matter presumably some years later said that the letters ok had been adopted as a sort of democratic part cry and were fastened upon their banners this does give at least some credence to the idea that ok was at least in familiar use prior to the wolof theory like choctaw indian the wolof language spoken in senegal and the gambia formerly the gold coast has something like okeh to mean an emphatic yes it's more like waa key in reality wolof has given american english a number of words perhaps through the african slave trade such as juke honky to mean a white man hipcat or hepcat meaning a jazz enthusiast jive and even dig as in to understand although it should be noted that there is nowhere near universal agreement on these it is likely that okeh appeared in early black american spoken slang the other languages theories yet more languages have similar sounding words for yes or it is so liberian has oke and burmese has hoakeh for instance yet again it is possible that these examples crept into american use in small isolated areas at some time prior to the indian chief theory keokuk was an indian chief after whom keokuk in iowa is named his admirers sometimes referred to him as old keokuk he's all right and the initials ok came to mean the same thing the orl korrect theory the internet fashion for condensing phrases into abbreviation certainly not new the s saw a rise of quirky abbreviations for common phrases which for some reason seems to have been particularly popular in boston isbd was used to mean it shall be done rtbs for it remains to be seen and sp for small potatoes it went further with ky used to mean no use know yuse and an article in the march rd edition of the boston morning post saw this produce ok short for all correct orl korrect this is the earliest published appearance of ok that has so far been found the richardson theory william richardson recorded his journey from boston to new orleans in his diary transcriptions of the diary show arrived at princeton a handsome little village o k and at trenton where we dined at p m although in some have proposed that this showed the use of the expression in the original manuscript shows that this was actually part of some alterations that may have been added by richardson or someone else possibly even after when the term had come into common use another possibility is that the writing is of a h referring to a handsome but there are many objections to this theory the th century theories several claims have been made to have found appearances of ok have in th century manuscripts in one instance notes queries points out that the will of thomas cumberland in is shown to use ok but more careful scrutiny shows that this is more likely to have been the initials of the scrivener books published in and also have ok included but apparently as nouns the text of one have with you to saffron walden by thomas nashe the british author goes martin is guerra brown a brone bill barrow a wheelbarrow ket a knight h n referring to henry nichols an o k as mencken states in his supplement to the american language the meaning here is unfathomable the old kinderhook theory martin van buren was standing as the democratic presidential candidate in he had acquired the nickname of old kinderhook he was born in kinderhook new york on march the democrats opened the ok club in grand street new york city based on the initials of van buren's nickname the expression ok soon became the watchword of this club and in that same year a democratic newspaper equated the initials with the strivings of the party to make all things ok the cockney orl korrec theory the times in had an article reporting that it was of cockney origin the author remembered its use as an abbreviation for orl korrec when he was a boy in the late th century however this post dates its first appearance by many years the french theory during the american war of independence french sailors made appointments with american girls aux quais meaning when they were berthed at the quayside this theory was put forward by britain's daily express newspaper in the finish theory the fins have a word for correct and it is oikea in a article someone at the cleveland public library suggested that this may be the origin the british parliament theory the same source as the cockney theory the times in pointed out that some bills going through the house of lords had to be read and approved by lords onslow and kilbracken and they each initialed them producing the combined initials ok the anglo saxon theory several centuries before its first appearance norwegian and danish sailors used an anglo saxon word hogfor which meant ready for sea this was frequently shortened to hg which in turn would have been pronounced hag gay the literary theory laurence sterne was a british author of the th century and in his book a sentimental journey published in he uses the emphatic french form of yes o qu oui in an anglicised pronunciation oh key the phrase was used by some to express affirmation the schoolmaster theory in a letter in the vancouver sun in it was pointed out that early schoolmasters would mark examination papers by adding the latin omnis korrecta which was sometimes abbreviated to ok the ship builder theory early ship builders would mark the timber they prepared and the first to be laid was marked ok number meaning outer keel no the telegraph theory early telegraph operators abbreviated everything to reduce the amount of work needed they would use gm for good morning ga for go ahead and so on in tatler in the observer suggests that they also used ok this doesn't stand up at all as the telegraph post dated the first written occurrence and it is almost certain in my view that they adopted ok rather than inventing it the scottish theory we've all heard the scottish expression och aye an author in the nottingham journal in suggests that ok is simply an adaptation of this expression the scottish expression derives from och meaning an exclamation of surprise and aye meaning yes and has been in existence since perhaps the th century the old english theory in early england the last harvest loads brought in from the fields were known as hoacky or horkey it was also the name given to harvest home which was the feast which followed the last loads brought in the satisfactory completion of harvest was therefore known as hoacky which was soon at least according to an article in the daily telegraph in shortened to ok the prussian theory the times printed a suggestion that the prussian general schliessen fighting for the american colonies during the war of independence was properly given the title oberst kommandant all his orders were initialled ok the greek theory probably the earliest suggestion comes from the greek the two greek letters omega and khi appear in a work called geoponica in ad as being a magical incantation when repeated twice against fleas the railway theory obediah kelly was an early railway freighter he is known to have signed bills of lading with his initials ok and in railway circles ok came to mean that something had been authorised the war department or cracker theory during the civil war the us war department bought supplies of crackers from a company called orrins kendall their initials appeared on the boxes and as the crackers were of a particularly high standard the letters ok became synonymous with all right this theory was originally put forward in a publication called linguist from the horace mann school for boys in new york although it has subsequently appeared in a number of other publications the multitudinous other theories during american politicians used the term frequently and dreamt up many absurd and often pointed origins out of kash out of kredit out of klothes all became identified with van buren's campaign and on the floor of the house of representatives a congressman from illinois suggested it meant orful kalamity these are only some there are a lot of them hope this helps nick Crossword
