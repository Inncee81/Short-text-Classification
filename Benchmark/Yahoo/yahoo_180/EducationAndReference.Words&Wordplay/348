how did the question mark originate the question mark also known as an interrogation point query or eroteme is a punctuation mark that replaces the full stop at the end of an interrogative sentence it can also be used mid sentence to mark a merely interrogative phrase where it functions similarly to a comma such as in the single sentence where shall we go and what shall we do but this usage is increasingly rare the question mark is not used for indirect questions the question mark character is also often used in place of missing or unknown data history the symbol is generally thought to originate from the latin qu stio meaning question which was abbreviated to qo the uppercase q was written above the lowercase o and this mark was transformed into the modern symbol citation needed another hypothesis about the origin of the question mark proposes that it originated in the th century when it appeared as a point followed by the curved portion written slanted similar to the tilde citation needed lynne truss attributes an early form to alcuin of york truss describes the punctus interrogativus of the late s as a lightning flash striking from right to left the name question mark was coined in the late s the point has always indicated the end of a sentence the curved line represented the intonation pattern of a spoken question citation needed and may be associated with a kind of early musical notation like neumes citation needed an american superstition that movies or television shows with question marks in the title do poorly at the box office has made many studios shy away from the punctuation mark this has caused many works to be retitled when adapted for american cinema such as the book who censored roger rabbit which was retitled who framed roger rabbit without the question mark for the big screen citation needed Punctuation Quotation mark Apostrophe (mark) Latin alphabet Tilde Diacritic International Phonetic Alphabet English grammar Comma (punctuation) Cyrillic alphabet Full stop Finnish grammar Who Framed Roger Rabbit CPU cache Chinese language Esperanto orthography Binomial nomenclature Arabic alphabet Philosophy of language Dash German grammar Crossword Many-worlds interpretation Singlish Bracket Proto-Indo-European language Exclamation mark Greek language Tone (linguistics) Grammatical mood Tetragrammaton Speech synthesis Biblical canon Abbreviation Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Perl Roman numerals Chinese character Romanian language Braille Kanji New Testament 0 (number) Variable Starfleet ranks and insignia Korean language Capitalization Hyphen Documentary hypothesis Klingon language Slash (punctuation) Relative clause Hiberno-English Glossary of partner dance terms Infinity Spanish language English verbs Gender-neutral language Vowel Fair use XML ISO/IEC 8859 Acronym and initialism Egyptian language Trigonometric function Australian English HTML element Names of numbers in English Z Second language acquisition Bible Japanese language Question Care Bears Varieties of Arabic Scientific method New Zealand English Taiwanese (linguistics) Tamil language Lisp programming language Hiragana Pinyin Literature The Prisoner Ligature (typography) Hangul Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation)
