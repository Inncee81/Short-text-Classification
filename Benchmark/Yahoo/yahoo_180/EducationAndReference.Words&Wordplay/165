can anyone help me to understand the figure of this lady she was tall and built in the conventional places it was in a novel when the author described the lady as built in the convertional places what did he mean he wanted to say that the girl was born in a ordinary place my first guess might not be correct because when you see a person you do not need to say or guess where she he was born did the author want say that the girl's body firgure is not special not special hot not special big or small just a ordinary looking lady which one is right thanks thanks to people who who had answers my questions your answers are so out of my expection on earth conventional places means breasts hips bottom as i read from answers so could i decode this english expression as conventionally focused female body parts by male because conventional actually means something ordinary in this way if we go back to to the sentence i posted the author in fact ignored one word before built it should be well built the sentence could be re write as the lady is well built in her places where male would love to check to peter s hey i am serious for every question i posted here don't laugh at me i am trying to learn english and i regarded every one who is serious with my question as my teacher i'm pretty sure that the conventional places are the hips buttocks and breasts on a woman hourglass figure Philosophy of language American and British English differences Joke Japanese tea ceremony Buttocks Wheel of Fortune Gender-neutral language Kurt Cobain Sharon Tate G__del's incompleteness theorem Gender role Diana Ross Lie Scientology beliefs and practices Brassiere Fictional character Have I Got News For You Singlish Meaning Asperger syndrome Little Britain GED African American Vernacular English German grammar Mary, the mother of Jesus Crossword Prolog Hentai AFI 100 Years series EastEnders Whose Line Is It Anyway?
