can you create a story using these lyrics from various songs you look at me and i begin to melt when the thunder is crashing up above tell me the words i never said let me know the wonder of all of you now i know that i've to hold me and to hide me for the fifth time today my six year old son daniel asked me mom when is winter going to be here i want it to snow trying to stay patient i replied back i know you do dear but when the thunder is crashing above us we only get rain it won t be long now now i know that i ve been secretly wishing for the snow to stay away but i couldn t help remembering how much i loved playing in the snow as a child daniel was no different he loved building snowmen women forts and tunnels just like i did what child doesn t a couple of weeks later the weather turned cold and the next thing i knew daniel was jumping up and down screaming mom mom it s snowing it s snowing needless to say he wanted to go out so i helped put on his boots coat hat and mitts and off he went as the days went by the snow continued i thought it would never stop looking out the window fed up with it already because i wasn t a child anymore i said out loud darn i wish this wretched snow would go and never ever ever come back i hadn t realized daniel was standing listening to my tone of voice and words please tell me the words i never said i thought quickly to myself but i knew i had by the crushed look my son was giving me i never realized how much he truly loved the snow until i saw the few tears trickle down his face oh daniel i said hugging him i m so sorry i m just tired how about you playing with your toys for awhile while i have a short nap then i ll go out and play in the snow with you daniel seemed pleased with that and off he went while i lay down i drifted off into a land of inter beauty beauty i had forgotten about i walked through the sparkling snow where no one had walked yet as i looked ahead of me i saw all kinds of snow creatures was i seeing things maybe they were snow mirages and the sparkling stuff had got to my eyes but as i got closer i realized they were real there was a least a dozen snow people and five small snow animals they smiled at me as i stopped and gazed at each one of them hello said the bigger snow person needless to say i was a little startled did i really here it talk hello he repeated oh my gosh i was hearing correctly hel hel hello i stammered back each one of them was looking at me i stood there realizing i had come across something very few people got to see in a far more excited voice i said let me know the wonder of all of you i couldn t believe i was talking to snow people well started the one who had spoken first i m marcus this is my wife cindy these ten wee ones are our children and those five are our pets oh i m so glad to meet you i m marylyn can i stay for awhile we al talked for ages but as the sun became brighter and it did seem a little warmer they all looked frightened all of a sudden each one of them looked up at the sun and pleaded when you look at me and i begin to melt i know my time is getting shorter here please don t destroy us yet it was like an individual little prayer asking for help then they all turned to me and continued if you were to hold me and to hide me in a frozen land i could live forever it was another individual prayer only it came to me this time what was i going to do i couldn t help and hold them all my heart was breaking because i didn t want to see them melt right before my eyes think i scolded myself what what what do you want me to do a little voice said is it time to get up yet mom there was daniel looking down at me yes my dear it s time for us to go out and have some fun but let s go sleighing o k daniel ran for his coat as i thought about my dream i tried shaking it off but as foolish as it was i wasn t ready to build snowmen or happy creatures yet i didn t want to see them go but sliding with my son would be fun after all The Shining (film) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Amber Spyglass Humphrey Bogart Street-Legal Sin City The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Kodocha One Tree Hill (TV series) The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) StarCraft: Uprising Milton H.
