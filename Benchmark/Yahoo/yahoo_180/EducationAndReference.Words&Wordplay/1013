i need a third idea can you help me with this sentence the charater is telling an old lover something to this effect i want you to know that i am still here i still care about you i am still here if you should ever need me upon rereading it i realize it is redundant but i need a third sentence using the word still i suppose she could be saying i will always or i continue to but i don't think of her as eloquent just passionate you could shift the last still from the speaker to the auditor and push the last still a bit further into the last sentence i assume you're saying that you have to use still times once in each sentence if you move the second one to the end of the sentence that maximizes the amount of space possible between each and sounds a little more formal which is the tone if you aren't going to use contractions such as i'm i want you to know that i am still here i care about you still i'm here if you still need me and always if you ever need me Shit Cunt Patrick Star Queer as Folk (UK) Hiberno-English Shaggy dog story The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular The Jim Rome Show Singlish Atomic Kitten Euphemism Lisa's First Word Japanese dialects Profanity Idiot Mnemonic Fark.com Ren and Stimpy Leet Angels in America Trailer Park Boys Thom Yorke Australian words Paris Hilton Expletive KMFDM Kyle Broflovski Relative clause Spanish profanity Mystery Science Theater 3000 Predestination Irony Shooting Stars Justification (theology) Groo the Wanderer Queen (band) The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Names of God in Judaism Baldrick Political correctness Single certification Old Tongue Father Ted Internet slang Sex and the City 2 Stupid Dogs Treehouse of Horror V The dozens Deftones Punk ideology Futurama (TV series - season 3) The Wildhearts New Zealand English Otaku The Angry Beavers The Price Is Right Fuck MAD Magazine Four-letter word Noel Gallagher Gerund Notable lines in the Star Wars series Kodocha Don't Phunk With My Heart Year of the Spider The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars Blackadder Witches (Discworld) Radio Yerevan The Father, The Son, and The Holy Guest Star The Catcher in the Rye Sharon Tate Maid Marian and her Merry Men Esperanto grammar Pejorative Hip hop collaborations Yiddish words and phrases used by English speakers Liam Gallagher Anagram Poker jargon The Shawshank Redemption GWAR Mike McCready In-yer-face theatre Haruka Tenoh Catch phrase Mr. T $pringfield Hungarian language Jay and Silent Bob Adjective Nazi Punks Fuck Off!
