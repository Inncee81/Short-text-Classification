where did the word toilet originate from americans use bathroom even tho theres no bath half the time i like wash room that makes sense but toilet is it like blood let maybe urine used to be toi it comes from the french toilette which referred to grooming and cleaning in turn that came from toile which was a cloth on which stood a mirror and a wash basin hence you still come across vestigial terms like eau de toilette and toiletries the toilet then developed into a separate room with a mirror and washbasin for personal grooming and washing of hands and the face it was normally separate from the lavatory where you went to urinate and defecate in the th century the use of trains became widespread at first toilets and lavatories where kept separate you would do your business then go to another room across the aisle to wash your hands but eventually to save space and reduce costs the two rooms were merged there wasn't enough space to have lavatory and toilet written on the door so just toilet was written as a consequence what are actually lavatories are now commonly called toilets posh people may still correct you if you make this mistake Dutch language Non-native pronunciations of English Received Pronunciation New Zealand English English English Pinyin American English Slovak language English language Regional accents of English speakers Indonesian language General American Czech language Greek language Phoneme French language Polish language Canadian English Spanish language Dictionary Italian language English phonology Quebec French Latin alphabet Australian English Hiberno-English Indian English Acute accent Japanese language Lithuanian language Southern American English Welsh language New York-New Jersey English Slovenian language Swedish language American and British English differences R__maji History of the English language Chinese language Rhotic and non-rhotic accents Tone (linguistics) Finnish language Scottish English British English Hong Kong English Hypercorrection Portuguese language Speech synthesis Trap-bath split Boston accent Diacritic Korean language Writing system of Spanish Southern Athabascan languages Cot-caught merger Hebrew language Standard Mandarin Mispronunciation Dialects of Mandarin Tagalog language Vowel Shibboleth Yorkshire dialect and accent Formal written English - regional differences Old English language West Country dialects Hungarian language Jamaican English Cantonese (linguistics) Scottish Gaelic language Newfoundland English D'ni language Arabic language Spelling reform Esperanto Grave accent Singlish Circumflex Ojibwe language Acronym and initialism Headphones Moldovan language Danish language German language Languages in Star Wars California English Old Irish language Second language acquisition Dialect Welsh English Estuary English Finno-Ugric languages Spanish dialects and varieties Scouse Tatar language Finland-Swedish Hindi Sanskrit Hawaiian language Lingala language
