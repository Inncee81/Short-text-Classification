where can i find bill james' baseball abstract and all of his following books i don't care if it's first edition i just want to read all of his baseball abstracts even if there's a online site with all of them on there to read that would be fine too it's true the first three or four years were home printed on a mimeograph machine i have heard but never pursued it that if you call up bill's wife in lawrence kansas and ask to buy copies she will photocopy them or print them out something and mail them off for a small fee this is rather old and unverified information james really should make them available the in print abstracts or ' through are out of print and still tricky to find but check ebay now and then or your local used bookstores you might luck out when i read at the behest of a friend so convinced i had to read it he bought me a copy the abstract well it was an epiphany a thunderbolt i started loving baseball even more because i began to understand it better Photocopying Publishing Mimeograph machine Copy protection Amazon.com Bill James Book Killian documents Book collecting Internet fraud Open access Legal research Publication of Darwin's theory Monopoly (game) PHP Religious Society of Friends Baseball Copyright Advance fee fraud Tool (band) Textbook Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Xerox Comics Our Gang Oxford English Dictionary Sabermetrics Negro league baseball William S.
