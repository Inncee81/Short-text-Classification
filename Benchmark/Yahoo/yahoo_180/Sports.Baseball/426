i don't understand something about a baseball stat if a batter hits a grounder to shortstop but the shortstop bobbles the ball the batter makes first is that considered a hit since he did make it to first example yesterday the cardinals had straight hits i believe braden looper hit a bunt pitcher had it but bobbled it looper makes it to first and its considered a hit according to the score card wouldn't that be an error or does it count as an error and a hit whenever there's an error whether it be a pop fly or grounder sounds confusing but i'm confused it becomes the judgement of the official scorekeeper as to whether it was fielded cleanly enough and easily enough to where the pitcher should have been able to make an out anywhere i didn't happen to see the play but the scorekeepers are generally correct however the play can always be reviewed later and changed to an error Baseball Baseball statistics Baseball scorekeeping Softball Sandy Koufax 2004 World Series 1957 World Series 2005 World Series Bunt Satchel Paige Perfect game World Series Box score (baseball) October 4 in baseball Tris Speaker No-hitter 2004 American League Championship Series 1919 World Series 2003 World Series Shortstop Home run Baseball positions Braden Looper Lou Gehrig Pitcher Boston Red Sox Baseball Stars Detroit Tigers Hank Aaron October 22 in baseball Chicago Cubs Stolen base San Francisco Giants St. Louis Cardinals Los Angeles Dodgers Babe Ruth October 13 in baseball Pete Rose October 17 in baseball Baserunning Mike Schmidt Batting average Bubble Bobble Interference (baseball) Ty Cobb Squeeze play (baseball) New York Yankees October 10 in baseball History of baseball in the United States October 7 in baseball Major League Baseball television contracts 1987 National League Championship Series Mike Scioscia Out (baseball) Sabermetrics Origins of baseball First baseman Volleyball Curse of the Billy Goat Reggie Jackson Alex Rodriguez 1986 National League Championship Series October 14 in baseball Houston Astros Pedro Mart__nez October 19 in baseball Oakland Athletics October 28 in baseball Derek Jeter 1991 World Series Omar Vizquel Dead-ball era Toronto Blue Jays Cincinnati Reds Montr__al Expos Red Sox Nation Nolan Ryan Orlando Cabrera Switch hitter Jerry Coleman Catcher Bert Campaneris Kickball October 27 in baseball Wrigley Field October 25 in baseball Andr__s Galarraga Infield fly Dave Concepci__n Negro league baseball 1986 World Series Kirk Gibson San Diego Padres Fenway Park Chico Carrasquel
