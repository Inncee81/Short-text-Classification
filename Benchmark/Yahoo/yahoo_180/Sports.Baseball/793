highschool baseball vs highschool softball i am a high school softball player going into my junior year and i've been playing varsity since my freshman year we are better than my school's baseball team who has their own fair amount of district champs and semi finalists only we have more and we have state championship titles our last one in ' we have the most appearances at the final four than any other school in the state of maryland so this proves that we are as good if not better than the baseball teams then why are we forced to wear rubber or plastic spikes on our cleats while the baseball players are allowed to wear metal in metal cleats you get soooooo much more traction when running and in rubber and you're playing the outfield and it's wet you slip so much easier that if you were in metal does anyone else think that this is total crap i just wanted to add i understand the whole face mask issue and have no problem with it because i have seen someone and have been nailed in the head with a pitch in which my face mask prevented it from breaking my nose softball pitching is thrown at an upward angle and we have riseballs which baseball doesn't and we're closer to the pitcher so i have no problem with face masks because baseball is simply more popular then softball the high school probably cares more about the baseball team than the softball team yes it is unfair but that's life i think you should write a letter to you're school or district to explain why you think the cleats are unfair Baseball statistics International League Pitcher St. Louis Cardinals Detroit Tigers Oakland Athletics Major League Baseball Tris Speaker Dice Seattle Mariners Reggie Jackson Toronto Blue Jays San Francisco Giants World Series Babe Ruth 1957 World Series Chicago White Sox Laws of cricket Fielding (cricket) 2004 World Series Baseball cap Sandy Koufax Baseball bat Volleyball Playoff Baltimore Orioles Hank Aaron Fast bowling Starting pitcher Boston Red Sox Stolen base Golf Georgia Institute of Technology Cincinnati Bengals Houston Astros Montr__al Expos Cincinnati Reds Table tennis Professional wrestling match types Satchel Paige Curling Mike Piazza Violin Batting average Lacrosse 2005 World Series San Diego Padres 2004 College World Series National Football League No-hitter 1919 World Series Horseshoe Origins of baseball Kirk Gibson Rounders Ty Cobb 1981 baseball strike November 2 in baseball 2004 American League Championship Series Atlanta Braves Arizona State University Hit by pitch Washington Nationals Baseball Stars Home run Major League Baseball All-Star Game Pittsburgh Pirates Ice hockey Jennie Finch New York Mets Pete Rose Knickerbocker Rules Welding October 14 in baseball October 16 in baseball Walter Johnson Gramophone record John Smoltz Dave Concepci__n University of Arizona Interference (baseball) American football Dick Williams Derek Jeter October 20 in baseball Paintball Harmonica Texas A&M University
