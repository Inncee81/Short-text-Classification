adam greenburg i don't know if any of you cubs fans remember adam greenburg but he only made one major league appearance and in his st at bat he got hit in the head in he hasn't played baseball since anyone know what he plans to do next ever coming back to baseball what a great story that was the pitcher that hit him was actually the cousin of one of adam's teammates one of the cubs pitchers i think anyway the pitcher that hit adam has since quit baseball his life has seriously been affected by the event it was pretty interesting yes as others have said adam is in the royals system this season i hope he makes it back he was a highly touted prospect who had a very unfortunate thing happen to him interesting you should ask though Chicago Cubs Baseball October 4 in baseball St. Louis Cardinals Sammy Sosa World Series Detroit Tigers Major League Baseball All-Star Game Seattle Mariners Toronto Blue Jays New York Mets Batting average No-hitter Lou Gehrig Sandy Koufax November 4 in baseball Satchel Paige 1957 World Series Cap Anson Babe Ruth Negro league baseball 2005 World Series Don Mattingly Wrigley Field Major League Baseball Boston Red Sox Ty Cobb Philadelphia Phillies Alex Rodriguez Pittsburgh Pirates Tris Speaker Chicago White Sox Kerry Wood (baseball player) October 1 in baseball Home run Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Babe Ruth's Called Shot San Diego Padres Oakland Athletics November 1 in baseball Pedro Mart__nez October 3 in baseball Dave Kingman Don Hoak Reggie Jackson 1919 World Series Barry Bonds Hank Aaron International League Major League Baseball television contracts Baseball Stars Florida Marlins September 28 in baseball Tim McCarver Pitcher New York Yankees Stan Musial Red Sox Nation Minor league baseball September 20 in baseball Jimmie Foxx 1985 World Series Jerry Coleman Don Newcombe October 15 in baseball Gabby Hartnett October 9 in baseball Atlanta Braves June 8 in baseball Perfect game San Francisco Giants Interleague play Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1946 Joe DiMaggio Ernie Banks September 6 in baseball Manny Ram__rez September 22 in baseball Dick Williams Softball Hee Seop Choi October 27 in baseball Curse of the Billy Goat Mark Prior Robin Ventura Carlos Zambrano National League Nolan Ryan June 14 in baseball October 26 in baseball Grover Cleveland Alexander June 2 in baseball
