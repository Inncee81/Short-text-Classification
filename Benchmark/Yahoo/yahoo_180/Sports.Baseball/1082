could someone explain to me what the hell happened to the tigers it's basically the same thing that happened last year at a different time they are perhaps the streakiest team in the league meaning when they're hot they can't be beat but if they aren't healthy and on top of their game in every sense its like playing the pirates on a daily basis the good news for them is that they are streaky and at some point hopefully after my yankees play them they will get healthy and find their swagger and their game and reel off about straight wins or win out of games or something ridiculous like that also the indians are a very young team and don't have that big of a lead plus there is so much time left in the season there really is nothing to worry about except the health issues World Series Pittsburgh Steelers Cincinnati Reds St. Louis Cardinals October 4 in baseball Cleveland Indians Pittsburgh Pirates Boston Red Sox Toronto Blue Jays New York Yankees Tris Speaker Luis Tiant 1957 World Series Reggie Jackson Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim 2005 World Series Oakland Athletics Pete Rose New York Jets Ty Cobb Babe Ruth Detroit Tigers International League Atlanta Braves October 5 in baseball Seattle Mariners Cincinnati Bengals Toronto Maple Leafs Florida Marlins New York Giants Chicago White Sox October 16 in baseball 2005 English cricket season Chinese Basketball Association Playoff Mario Lemieux Houston Astros Bowl Championship Series New York Mets Satchel Paige Pedro Mart__nez Bob Friend Cleveland Browns October 7 in baseball Richmond Football Club New York Americans Sandy Koufax Hal Trosky Hank Aaron October 13 in baseball Dick Williams Norway national football team San Francisco Giants Buffalo Bills Super Bowl XXVII October 3 in baseball Chicago Blackhawks October 17 in baseball 2003 World Series September 20 in baseball Manny Ram__rez Milwaukee Brewers Canterbury Bulldogs San Diego Padres October 25 in baseball October 15 in baseball Major League Baseball television contracts Chicago Bulls New York Knicks Los Angeles Dodgers 1925-26 NHL season Rocky Colavito October 10 in baseball Hank Greenberg Chicago Cubs Theory of conduct NBA Finals Minnesota Twins Nolan Ryan Torquay United F.C.
