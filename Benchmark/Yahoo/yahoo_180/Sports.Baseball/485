baseball rules i know pretty much everything about baseball the only thing i don't get is why do they say that its not good to make the first or last out at third base it's just one of those old accepted baseball sayings the point is that you shouldn't make the first or last out by being greedy trying to stretch a double to a triple or reach third on a single in reality you shouldn't make the first or third out by being greedy at any base but this is just the term that has stuck and it annoys me to no end when announcers repeat it Baseball Pete Rose Ty Cobb Theory of conduct Softball 2004 World Series Baseball statistics Tris Speaker BASEketball Home run Playoff Hank Aaron Baseball scorekeeping Andr__s Galarraga Shaggy dog story Major League Baseball Manny Ram__rez 1957 World Series 2005 World Series 1919 World Series Chess strategy and tactics Singlish The nature of God in Western theology Origins of baseball Poker jargon World Series Jennifer Lopez St. Louis Cardinals Epistemology Luke Appling Stolen base Major League Baseball television contracts Negro league baseball Satchel Paige Baseball Stars Sheepshead Playoff format Sandy Koufax 2004 American League Championship Series Juan Samuel Scientific method Shoeless Joe Jackson Social rule Star Trek Customizable Card Game Milton H.
