theo epstein's mistake with the trade deadline gone do you believe theo epstein made the dumbest mistake during his tenure as the red sox gm in letting a possible jermaine dye deal go i don't necessarily know the entire deal that would've have had to be made to bring dye here but i watched necn and they said the white sox would've gotten manny delcarmen and craig hansen and another player in return for dye right now the red sox need a power hitter did the bosox miss one of the biggest opportunities this season i mean hansen and delcarmen for dye theo's been one of the most aggressive gms ever and i'm finally happy someone like that can do that but do you think he botched this while dye's stats are better than drew's giving up great pitching prospects for a guy hitting is too stiff of an asking price especially since they would be renting dye for months plus the playoffs i don't think dye brings that much more to the table than drew he botched it by signing drew in the first place he is probably one of the three most overrated players in baseball World Series Red Sox Nation Toronto Blue Jays Houston Astros Seattle Mariners Sammy Sosa Babe Ruth Oakland Athletics David Wells Tris Speaker David Ortiz Byung-Hyun Kim Alex Rodriguez 1919 World Series New York Yankees Cincinnati Reds Reggie Jackson October 2005 in sports Cleveland Indians Robin Ventura Satchel Paige St. Louis Cardinals October 4 in baseball Baseball San Francisco Giants Baltimore Orioles Indiana Pacers Major League Baseball television contracts Designated hitter Miguel Tejada Kansas City Royals Florida Marlins 2005 American League Division Series October 22 in baseball Curt Schilling October 26 in baseball Ron Hansen (baseball) Hank Aaron Haywood Sullivan Bucky Dent New York Giants Texas Rangers (baseball) Pedro Mart__nez Carl Yastrzemski Pete Rose International League Detroit Red Wings Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim History of baseball in the United States Barry Bonds Detroit Tigers Dick Williams Carlos Beltr__n Shea Hillenbrand October 3 in baseball October 16 in baseball 1986 World Series Roger Clemens 2004 American League Championship Series New York Knicks 1975 World Series Hal Trosky October 2004 in sports Los Angeles Kings November 1 in baseball Ted Radcliffe Ellis Burks San Diego Padres Home run Philadelphia Phillies Gary Sheffield October 19 in baseball October 15 in baseball Mo Vaughn Kevin Millar Jeff Bagwell Luis Tiant October 27 in baseball October 9 in baseball Andr__s Galarraga Chico Carrasquel Boston Bruins Atlanta Braves New York Mets 1994 baseball strike Jim Rice
