will the rockies make the playoffs i hope they do i think it would be really exciting to see a totally new team in the playoffs i think its really neat that they've found a way to overcome the altitude problem and also win some road game it looks like they've become committed to winning hopefully they'll play a bigger role in aquiring free agents and become even better next season i think teams like this show that baseball works the way it is i actually think they will they've been streaky but they started in the cellar and have made their way up over the last two months they've got two solid starters in francis and cook and they've got some nice hitters in hawpe and atkins holliday is the star of the team a guy who will be a bona fide superstar in the coming years todd helton has lost his power but he still hits in the clutch and for a solid average for the first time in recent memory they're not an embarrassment on the road so i think they will either take the nl west or the wild card Toronto Blue Jays Seattle Mariners New York Giants Oakland Athletics Boston Red Sox Detroit Tigers Pittsburgh Steelers Playoff Pittsburgh Pirates St. Louis Cardinals New York Yankees Orlando Magic National Football League New York Islanders Houston Astros 1957 World Series NBA Finals Chicago White Sox Todd Helton 2005 World Series International League San Francisco Giants New England Patriots Los Angeles Kings Buffalo Bills San Diego Padres New York Jets New York Knicks Boston Bruins Mario Lemieux Indiana Pacers Milwaukee Brewers Playoff format October 20 in baseball Atlanta Braves New York Rangers Edmonton Oilers Toronto Raptors Robin Ventura Minnesota Timberwolves Pete Rose Red Sox Nation Major League Baseball Carolina Panthers Chicago Cubs Arizona Diamondbacks Andr__s Galarraga New York Mets Texas Rangers (baseball) Baseball statistics Baltimore Orioles Chicago Bulls Mois__s Alou Batting average Kansas City Royals Miami Dolphins Baseball Stars Sammy Sosa Major League Baseball All-Star Game Cleveland Indians Alex Rodriguez Houston Rockets Yao Ming Baseball Montr__al Expos Super Bowl XXXIV Philadelphia 76ers Satchel Paige New Jersey Nets Miguel Tejada Chicago Blackhawks Steve Nash Super Bowl XXVII National Hockey League All-Star Game Detroit Red Wings 1981 baseball strike Kansas City Chiefs Michael Jordan Fernando Valenzuela Jim Rice Wild card Carlos Beltr__n Wayne Gretzky Colorado Rockies Pittsburgh Penguins Qu__bec Nordiques NFL playoffs 2004 NBA Finals Los Angeles Dodgers Nolan Ryan Jason Giambi Japanese baseball
