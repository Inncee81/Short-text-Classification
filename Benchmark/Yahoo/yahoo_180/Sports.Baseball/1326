i play baseball and i keep getting jammed on inside pitches need help with htis problem trust me standing further away from the plate will only b worse the pitcher s will c this nibble away at the outside corner making u either take an outside strike swing miss more and or foul more balls off keep ur stance the way it is unless there's sumthing else wrong w it talk a coach just shorten ur swing but st what u need do is this go the plate of these times just stand there in ur normal stance take the st pitches no matter what key dont act like u arent gonna swing fake a swing or make the pitcher think u may swing cuz if a pitcher no's that a batter's taking straight pitches that pitcher will throw straight down the middle after this occurs if u havent struck out which u probabaly wont have quickly go through in ur head think abt the pitches where they were thrown if u do strike out wait til next at bat follow the next advice where were the locations were they all inside outside did the pitcher mix it up once u've decided where the pitches were think abt the count if its then just look for a fastball swing if u want its totally up u if its take the pitch if it looks like it will b out of the strike zone worst case scenario the pitch will break strike if it looks good swing away if can just tell that it will b a ball take all the way if its ur in a bit of trouble but not as much as the pitcher thinks u think a good pitcher will not throw a pitch near the zone on a count if he she no's u cant hit inside she'll he'll most undoubtedly throw a fastball inside if he she doesnt no where u can or cant hit she'll he'll probably still throw a fastball inside or a slider on the outside part of the plate depends her orhis pitches if he or she throws a slider or not take the pitch evn if u strike out ur more prepared next time as u no what that pitcher's strike out pitch is if u take straight called strikes ur coach manager will probably b angry tell her or him what u were doing tell him or her its a new approach ur taking but after that called rd go back sit down in the dugout visualize the at bat in ur mind again think abt the pitches thrown from there u can bcome more accustom ur new stragedy the best way hit inside pitches is just shorten ur swing dont try do much w the pitch stay on it but hey i had trouble hitting those insiders but ive gotten better w this approach a pitcher will c that u just wont give in the inside stuff she or he will have go more outside eventually Softball Strike zone Sandy Koufax St. Louis Cardinals Satchel Paige Baseball statistics Babe Ruth Tris Speaker Batting average Fast bowling 2005 World Series Hit by pitch Bunt Volleyball 2004 World Series Reggie Jackson Interference (baseball) Pitch (baseball) Chicago White Sox Perfect game 1986 National League Championship Series Curveball Nolan Ryan Baseball Stars Batting (cricket) Pedro Mart__nez Detroit Tigers Los Angeles Dodgers First baseman Hal Trosky Shot Heard 'Round the World (baseball) Baseball scorekeeping Stolen base Jerry Coleman New York Mets Swingout New York Yankees Andr__s Galarraga 2004 American League Championship Series No-hitter Knuckleball Cincinnati Reds Baseball slang Toronto Blue Jays Boston Red Sox Starting pitcher Greg Maddux Fielding (cricket) Vin Scully Intentional base on balls Aerial (dance move) Snooker History of baseball in the United States Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Atomic Kitten San Francisco Giants 1903 World Series International League Smokey Joe Wood Videocon Tri-Series 2005-06 Cricket San Diego Padres Switch hitter Randy Johnson Florida Marlins Kirk Gibson October 16 in baseball Hank Aaron Billy Wagner New York Giants Baserunning 2003 World Series Stan Musial Ben Sheets Frank Howard (baseball player) Professional wrestling attacks Philadelphia Phillies Bill Lee (MLB pitcher) Carlos Zambrano Squeeze play (baseball) A.J.
