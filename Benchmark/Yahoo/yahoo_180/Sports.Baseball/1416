sawx fans i've to admit i didn't watch yesterday's game but don't you think it's time to retire wakefield we should't have traded gabbard he should have been our no starter prashant shush i have been saying this for a while and some red sox fans feel the same i listen to radio here so i have no idea what you are talking about i gotta address the dude who said we should retire wake only when mirabelli gets too old wtf mirabelli isnt the only catcher who can catch a knuckleball off the top of my head i cant give examples but i know there is other knucklers in the league whos catching them also you said hes been great in his role once again wtf doug cant hit for shit im pretty sure his average is under wakes got a couple years left what hurts him is he never seems to get a no decision so he always has a good amount of losses but usually has more wins i wouldnt mind seeing him in the bullpen if bucholtz is as good as hes supposed to be did you see kason gabbards first start in texas if you didnt he lost hes not as good as the shutout game he pitched Tim Wakefield Boston Red Sox 2004 World Series 1957 World Series Chicago White Sox World Series Florida Marlins Tris Speaker Pedro Mart__nez 2005 World Series Detroit Tigers 1919 World Series Jason Varitek Knuckleball Nolan Ryan Seattle Mariners Sandy Koufax San Francisco Giants Satchel Paige Houston Astros October 5 in baseball New York Yankees October 4 in baseball Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry Chicago Cubs Texas Rangers (baseball) Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim 2003 World Series Cleveland Indians Cincinnati Reds Carlton Fisk Babe Ruth Cincinnati Bengals No-hitter October 16 in baseball International League Robin Ventura October 12 in baseball Baseball Minnesota Twins Red Sox Nation Wilbur Wood Pittsburgh Steelers October 18 in baseball 1986 National League Championship Series Los Angeles Dodgers Frank Viola Atlanta Braves October 9 in baseball New York Giants Perfect game Ted Radcliffe New York Mets October 22 in baseball St. Louis Cardinals Major League Baseball television contracts October 2005 in sports Cleveland Browns October 10 in baseball October 27 in baseball Moe Berg Jamie Moyer Oakland Athletics Pittsburgh Pirates Baseball statistics Alex Rodriguez Firpo Marberry Marius Russo Pitcher October 15 in baseball Detroit Red Wings October 26 in baseball Luis Tiant Jerry Coleman Buffalo Bills 2005 National League Championship Series 2001 World Series October 25 in baseball New York Jets October 14 in baseball Toronto Raptors Philadelphia Phillies Bill James Washington Nationals Grover Cleveland Alexander Rick Ferrell History of baseball in the United States Los Angeles Kings Fenway Park October 13 in baseball Claude Osteen Curse of the Bambino Billy Pierce Art Nehf Byung-Hyun Kim
