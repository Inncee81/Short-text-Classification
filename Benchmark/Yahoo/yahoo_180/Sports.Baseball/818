hitting styles linear or rotational linear style of hitting was the old way but rotational is the new the difference having to do with a number of things the main one in my opinion being that in linear hitting you have a little more weight on your front foot and when you finish your swing your back leg is straight almost a lunging effect in rotational you sit back on the ball all your weight on your back leg and when you swing your back leg is driving into the ball now my question is that which do you think is better since both obviously worth since linear hitting was the style for people like ty cobb babe ruth and other older baseball players but rotational is the style used by barry bonds a rod david ortiz etc rotational is better with the evolution of the game you slowly come to realize that hitters get bigger and stronger but pitchers get better early era pitchers rested predominantly on a fastball change up and on occasion a breaking ball unfortunatley they didn't have the best of stuff at the time their breaking pitches weren't refined and ended up hanging more often then not in turn you could get all you weight on you front leg because with a hung pitch its a good way to get to it before it breaks extremely late namely just before the catchers glove now with breaking pitches being an early learned tool the pitches are more devastating and more difficult to hit in turn you need to learn to hit back in your stance to deliver appropriate power keep the ball in your stance and drive with authority one of the better early rotational hitters was hank aaron and you can see the success he had Ty Cobb Sandy Koufax World Series Home run Hank Aaron Pitcher Tris Speaker St. Louis Cardinals Toronto Blue Jays Batting average Nolan Ryan Barry Bonds 2004 World Series Boston Red Sox Softball 1957 World Series Stolen base Fast bowling Reggie Jackson Baseball statistics Volleyball October 22 in baseball Perfect game History of baseball in the United States New York Yankees 2004 American League Championship Series Cincinnati Reds Pedro Mart__nez Boxing Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 October 16 in baseball David Ortiz Randy Johnson Alex Rodriguez Greg Maddux Designated hitter Baseball Stars October 4 in baseball September 20 in baseball Andr__s Galarraga Chicago White Sox Skateboarding trick Curveball Detroit Tigers Knuckleball San Francisco Giants New York Mets Manny Ram__rez Ichiro Suzuki 1919 World Series Hal Trosky San Diego Padres Chicago Cubs Wes Ferrell Batting (cricket) Baseball scorekeeping Swingout 2003 World Series Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry Babe Ruth's Called Shot Starting pitcher Los Angeles Dodgers Cricket No-hitter June 12 in baseball Yankee Stadium Ted Radcliffe Al Leiter Sammy Sosa Aerial (dance move) Wrigley Field Gary Sheffield Jimmie Foxx First baseman Laws of cricket Bunt Professional wrestling attacks Batting order (baseball) David Cone October 20 in baseball English cricket team Ted Williams Dead-ball era Mark McGwire Equine conformation Catcher Ken Griffey, Jr. Seattle Mariners Negro league baseball Fielding (cricket) Origins of baseball
