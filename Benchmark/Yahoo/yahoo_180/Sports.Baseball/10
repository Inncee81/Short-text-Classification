should there be a salary cap in the mlb there are plenty of small market teams that would have a better advantage from it were it would only hurt the two teams that have such an advantage and that is losing people from watching baseball this guy that sat by me on friday night say well we won't have a dynasties if there is a salary cap i was like so that's good keep baseball pure if the same teams buy there way in how is that fair to everyone else it's not like the real world were everyone has an opportunity to have more money they just have these owners that have more money than they know what to do with and that is what is ruining baseball sports should be fair or at least some what closer to fair i'm not saying take away all their advantage but at least make basbeball interesting to watch by giving other teams a shot at it even when teams like the tigers and indians and some other smaller markets get into the playoffs they can't buy the extra players like the red sox and yankees can i can't wait to here some of the responses for and against i see this question has been posted before a while back ago so it seems like there are alot of people for it all answers are welcomed even stupid ones and you know who you are i find it funny how the only people against them are mostly fans of big market teams in fact yankee fan was honest enough to say they wanted a salary cap the comment about getting better ownership was really stupid not everyone can find a steinbrenner coolperson you have to be the dumbest person alive there is no real salary cap they need to level it out more look at the indians they went to the world series and were still selling out during the regular season since the jake opened yet they lost mill that year in revenue if some one can explain how that is fair i would like to hear it ak ny just showed how ignorant he is he just ignores right and wrong because it will help his team typical new yorker i guess he also thinks that stars actually do anything for him what a nimrod maybe a sewer rat bit him i don't care about the ny series we lost it's over oh well it won't mean anything if and i said if we are in the playoffs and you aren't just remember these cocky responses when your crying about how nobody likes the yankees absolutely big george in ny has been buying pennants for years Boston Red Sox World Series New York Yankees Oakland Athletics Reggie Jackson Major League Baseball television contracts San Francisco Giants Babe Ruth Cleveland Indians Pittsburgh Pirates St. Louis Cardinals Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Chicago White Sox Baltimore Orioles International League Red Sox Nation Atlanta Braves Major League Baseball Ty Cobb 2005 World Series New York Mets Satchel Paige Playoff Toronto Blue Jays 1994 baseball strike Chicago Cubs Detroit Tigers National Football League MLB on FOX Houston Astros Seattle Mariners Cincinnati Reds Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry MLB on NBC Minnesota Twins Curse of the Bambino Japanese baseball 2004-05 NHL lockout Tris Speaker History of baseball in the United States Milwaukee Brewers Bernie Williams Philadelphia Phillies Texas Rangers (baseball) Baseball Florida Marlins October 4 in baseball Minor league baseball October 15 in baseball 2004 American League Championship Series 1957 World Series Damn Yankees 1981 World Series Randy Johnson New York Giants October 3 in baseball Los Angeles Kings Cincinnati Bengals Alex Rodriguez Vin Scully Fay Vincent 1919 World Series NBA Finals Home run New Jersey Nets Manny Ram__rez Social rule American Football League Curt Schilling October 16 in baseball New York Jets Washington Nationals Pittsburgh Steelers Theory of conduct November 1 in baseball Negro league baseball 1981 baseball strike Vancouver Canucks Michael Jordan Robin Ventura Pennant playoff Tim McCarver Moe Berg I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Poker jargon Los Angeles Clippers October 9 in baseball October 5 in baseball Major League Baseball All-Star Game National Hockey League
