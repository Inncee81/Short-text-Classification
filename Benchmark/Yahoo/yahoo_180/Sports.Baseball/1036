what jersey should i wear my favorite player is chase utley but he is on the dl so he won't be playing in tommrrow's game aganist the braves i have jerseys and one shirt i could pick from a chase utley jersey a jimmy rollins jersey and a cole hamels shirt usually i wear the chase jersey to the games unless cole hamels is pitching but he won't be becasue he is pitching tonight but becasue chase is on the dl idk if i should wear it or not even though he is my favorite player my mom says i should wear the chase jersey like i usually do even though he is not playing but what do you think anyjersey is fine its a phillies jersey go phillies but honestly i think utley being on the dl is even more a reason to wear utley show your support for the guy who broke his hand and then finished the game with it broken chase utley would be the mvp if he didn't get injured utley is the man and although i love rollins and hamels i would have to say utley with little question besides him howard and rowand are my favorites World Series Chicago White Sox Hank Aaron Babe Ruth Houston Astros New York Giants Reggie Jackson St. Louis Cardinals Toronto Blue Jays Philadelphia Phillies International League Atlanta Braves 1957 World Series Cincinnati Reds Tris Speaker Chase Utley New York Yankees Veterans Stadium New Jersey Nets Pete Rose Cincinnati Bengals 2005 World Series Sandy Koufax Los Angeles Dodgers Super Bowl XVII The Football League New York Mets Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Detroit Tigers Miami Dolphins Football (soccer) Oakland Athletics Randy Johnson Orlando Magic October 21 in baseball Super Bowl X Curt Schilling Greg Maddux Jerry Coleman Roger Maris Softball Los Angeles Kings Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim San Francisco Giants Satchel Paige Montr__al Expos October 20 in baseball Casey Stengel Andr__s Galarraga October 16 in baseball October 4 in baseball San Antonio Spurs Super Bowl VII Jimmie Foxx Minnesota Twins Arsenal F.C.
