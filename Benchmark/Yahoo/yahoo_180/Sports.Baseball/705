now that the yankees are back i feel the nerves of boston fans forming a collective tremble which feels like an earthquake in beantown ok ok the yanks haven't overtaken them yet but you have to admit ny's back in it to win it so who will it be besides boston and ny in the playoffs what scenarios do you foresee well i am a huge yankee fan but i honestly don't see them overtaking the red sox the yankees have the best winning percentage since the all star break and are games above they were one game under at the break and they are still games out at the moment they have been on a roll but the sox have held their own but since the yankees have pretty much caught the wild card leaders i think that they are now favored to make the postseason as the wild card in the west it looks like the angels can hold off seattle in the central the indians and tigers are battling for the division even though the indians have won of their last while the tigers have won of their last so battling may not be the best term since the indians and tigers are going in the wrong direction look for them to play the red sox in the alds cause the wild card team the yankees cant play an opponent in their own division in the divisional series that means that the angels will play boston in the alds i see another boston new york alcs showdown and this time the sox would have home field advantage as history has shown anything can happen when these two teams meet in the playoffs hopefully the curse of a rod will be lifted this season and he will perform well in october October 4 in baseball New York Yankees Cleveland Indians Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim 2005 World Series October 5 in baseball St. Louis Cardinals 2004 American League Championship Series 1995 American League Division Series October 13 in baseball International League Reggie Jackson October 1 in baseball October 7 in baseball 1957 World Series October 15 in baseball 2005 American League Division Series Houston Astros Oakland Athletics Cincinnati Reds Playoff Curse of the Bambino Derek Jeter San Francisco Giants Wild card 2004 World Series Manny Ram__rez Red Sox Nation October 9 in baseball Chicago Cubs Atlanta Braves Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry NBA Finals Dick Williams San Diego Padres David Ortiz October 10 in baseball Florida Marlins October 2004 in sports New York Mets Detroit Tigers 1986 World Series October 12 in baseball Babe Ruth New York Giants October 16 in baseball Tris Speaker October 3 in baseball Alex Rodriguez Major League Baseball television contracts Cincinnati Bengals Cleveland Browns Tim McCarver No-hitter Baltimore Orioles Pittsburgh Steelers 2005 American League Championship Series Interleague play October 14 in baseball 2003 World Series Milwaukee Brewers Robin Ventura September 2005 in sports Curt Schilling 1987 World Series Derek Lowe Ty Cobb 2005 National League Championship Series October 8 in baseball October 17 in baseball American Football League Playoff format American League Luis Tiant Philadelphia Phillies October 27 in baseball Pennant playoff Pedro Mart__nez New York Knicks Roger Clemens October 19 in baseball October 25 in baseball Buffalo Bills October 20 in baseball Rickey Henderson Paul Konerko October 21 in baseball Minnesota Twins
