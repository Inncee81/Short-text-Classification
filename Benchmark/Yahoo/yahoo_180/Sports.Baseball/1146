minor league transactions in all the years following baseball i've come to realize my understanding of how minor transactions works is lacking so here goes i know optioning a player is when a guy on the man is sent down but i sometimes hear of a player who is out of options and thus can't be sent down or kept on the man how many options are there as far as callups are concerned i think players must be on the man to be called up to the majors correct what does the phrase designated for assignment and how is that different from being outrighted or optioned thanks in advance also how can a team purchase the contract of a player it already owns and pays after three years as a pro a player must be protected on a team's man roster or he is eligible for the rule draft more on that later once he's served those three years and assuming he is added to the man roster his club then has what are called options on him when a player is on the man roster but not on the man major league roster he is on optional assignment one common misconception about the rules is that a player may only be optioned out three times actually each player has three option years and he can be sent up and down as many times as the club chooses within those three seasons when you hear that a player is out of options that means he's been on the man roster during three different seasons beginning with his fourth as a pro and to be sent down again he'll have to clear waivers yes essentially designating for assignment allows a club to open up a roster spot while it figures out what it's going to do with a player there are certain situations in which a team needs a player's permission to either trade him or send him to the minors so rather than force the player to make a quick decision the team can simply designate him for assignment while he decides more commonly a player is designated for assignment so the club can open up his roster spot while they're waiting for him to clear waivers which can take four or five days occasionally a club will designate a player for assignment while they're trying to trade him Minor league baseball National Football League Major League Baseball Salary cap Oakland Athletics International League Boston Red Sox Toronto Blue Jays Seattle Mariners Florida Marlins Playoff Baseball Major professional sports league Reserve clause 2004-05 NHL lockout National Basketball Association Sammy Sosa Chicago White Sox Negro league baseball Los Angeles Clippers Topps Cleveland Indians Contract Betting (poker) American football Chicago Bulls Los Angeles Dodgers New York Yankees New York Islanders American football strategy Toronto Raptors New England Patriots Continental Basketball Association Texas Rangers (baseball) Playoff format Major League Soccer Los Angeles Kings Pete Rose Lou Gehrig San Diego Padres San Francisco Giants Satchel Paige Volleyball Carolina Panthers Chicago Cubs Milwaukee Brewers Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim NBA Draft American Football League Draft (sports) Mahjong 1994 baseball strike Poker jargon Cincinnati Reds Indoor football Utah Jazz New York Mets Andr__s Galarraga Kansas City Royals Portland Trail Blazers Option Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Albert Pujols Houston Astros New York Knicks Blackjack Ice hockey Sandy Koufax Atlanta Braves FIFA Series Softball Umpire (baseball) Baseball statistics St. Louis Cardinals Draw poker Manny Ram__rez Contract bridge Arizona Diamondbacks Joe Nuxhall Mexican League History of baseball in the United States Branch Rickey Futures contract New York Giants The Amazing Race Indiana Pacers Norway national football team Plame affair Glossary of American football Stud poker
