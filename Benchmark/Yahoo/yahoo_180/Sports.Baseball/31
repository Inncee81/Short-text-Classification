why do so few baserunners steal home any more ty cobb did it times i'll bet if you added up the final career total of every player now active it wouldn't come out to has the game changed drastically for example were pitchers more apt to wind up with a runner on rd in cobb's day thereby making it easier to steal home or has the strategy of wait for the the big inning and the homerun become so prevalent that the steal of home is considered an unwise strategy on most occasions i think the image of jackie robinson stealing home in the world series against the yankees you've probably seen the footage of yogi arguing the call is unforgettable and the steal of home is certainly an exciting play back in the day offense was down so it would be a good idea to try anything to get a run in in this day and age you need an absurdly strong chance to make it break even for example with two out the run expectancy re with a runner on third and no outs is if he makes the steal then he nets a run and then we'd expect another for leading off an inning so if he makes it it's worth runs if he fails there are no runners on and one out a re of if he steals home successfully of the time and gets out of the time he breaks even is the breakeven mark no players steal second of the time successfully with two out the breakeven mark becomes which is still very hard to make it's a rare play because it is difficult to pull off and has high risk a better play is with runners on st and rd with out breakeven of but the odds of succeeding is higher than a raw steal of home but it's an artifact of the game such as win seasons consider it a rare occurance that shows heads up play and opportunists you need a walking lead and the stars to align right Baseball 1957 World Series Stolen base World Series Baseball statistics Poker jargon Home run Toronto Blue Jays Boston Red Sox Babe Ruth Detroit Tigers Ty Cobb Interference (baseball) 2001 World Series Pete Rose Batting average Reggie Jackson Troy Glaus Andr__s Galarraga Florida Marlins 2003 World Series Tris Speaker 2004 World Series New York Yankees October 5 in baseball Cincinnati Reds San Francisco Giants Grover Cleveland Alexander Nolan Ryan 2005 World Series October 4 in baseball Houston Astros St. Louis Cardinals Baserunning 1919 World Series Perfect game 2004 American League Championship Series International League Rickey Henderson Softball Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Lou Gehrig History of baseball in the United States Hank Aaron Atlanta Braves Pittsburgh Pirates Willie Mays Baseball scorekeeping American football Derek Jeter October 16 in baseball Sandy Koufax NBA Finals English cricket team October 22 in baseball Volleyball Chicago Cubs October 11 in baseball San Diego Padres Box score (baseball) Oakland Athletics Seattle Mariners Cleveland Indians Norway national football team October 10 in baseball October 20 in baseball Craps Dave Henderson Major League Baseball television contracts Gary Sheffield October 7 in baseball Cricket Baseball Stars October 15 in baseball 1986 National League Championship Series Manny Ram__rez New York Giants Pittsburgh Steelers Sydney Riot of 1879 Blackjack Robin Ventura 2005 National League Championship Series October 3 in baseball Pedro Mart__nez Satchel Paige September 20 in baseball Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry Baltimore Orioles Minnesota Twins October 21 in baseball
