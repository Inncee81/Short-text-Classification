why does espn have such an east coast bias when it comes to baseball i am tired of hearing about new york boston the fact of the matter and i'm sure you don't want to hear this is that the yankees and red sox make up of the marketing revenue in baseball alone i agree that it is an incredibly unhealthy balance but that's the way it is it's not east west it's what moves the dial and the yankees and red sox have the most stars and are what people want to hear about trust me i'm an angels fan and i'm bummed that my team gets undersold every year but those are the most popular teams and espn is a business out to please their consumers not an npo just look at yankees v red sox ratings against the ratings of any other game minus those that involve waiting for bonds to hit the big home run which to be consistent they covered ad nauseum on a national level it's no contest oh wait this is yahoo answers yeah man espn is like totally trying to push an agenda because abc's ceo has yankee underoos Boston Red Sox New York Yankees Home run Major League Baseball television contracts Babe Ruth San Francisco Giants World Series Los Angeles Dodgers Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Chicago White Sox Reggie Jackson Tim McCarver Oakland Athletics Red Sox Nation Alex Rodriguez October 4 in baseball 2005 World Series 2004 American League Championship Series Cincinnati Reds St. Louis Cardinals October 2004 in sports Houston Astros November 3 in baseball Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry Interleague play David Ortiz 1986 World Series Manny Ram__rez Curse of the Bambino MLB on FOX Baltimore Orioles Gary Sheffield Ty Cobb Tris Speaker Al Michaels New York Mets October 1 in baseball Dick Williams Pittsburgh Pirates Robin Ventura National Football League Atlanta Braves San Diego Padres Cleveland Indians October 22 in baseball October 19 in baseball October 5 in baseball October 9 in baseball American League October 26 in baseball Texas Rangers (baseball) Rickey Henderson October 7 in baseball History of baseball in the United States Derek Jeter Major League Baseball Toronto Blue Jays ESPN25 October 25 in baseball Seattle Mariners Trot Nixon October 15 in baseball 1981 baseball strike No-hitter October 20 in baseball October 16 in baseball Edgar Renter__a Major League Baseball All-Star Game October 13 in baseball NFL on television October 3 in baseball 2005 American League Division Series Pedro Mart__nez October 27 in baseball Baseball Curt Schilling September 20 in baseball Minnesota Twins October 10 in baseball October 17 in baseball Moe Berg September 2005 in sports Tim Wakefield WFAN (AM) October 21 in baseball WEEI Salary cap John Olerud September 2004 in sports
