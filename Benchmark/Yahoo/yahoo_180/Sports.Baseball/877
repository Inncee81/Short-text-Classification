if it could be proven that of major leaguers were using steriods during bonds' career would you still him how can you rightly say that the steroid era is any less tainted than the greenies amphetamines era of the ' s and ' s people that know will tell you that the greatest benefit of steroids is in their regenerative properties meaning barry and his ilk may have been fresher in september as opposed to non users greenies essentially did the same thing and everybody used them read jim bouton's ball four i think people hate barry because he realizes baseball owes him just as much or more than he owes it players like bonds are literally worth billions over the course of their careers to the people that have a stake in them including mlb brass like bud hands in his pockets selig i don't really like bonds myself but it seems to me in this country this great country that is afflicted by racism to its very core that has such great disparity between the haves and have nots that something else is afoot cheating is the pretense used to justify hating barry the word that got cut off is hate him keep in mind 'roids became illegal during bonds career which is akin to telling pitcher to stop throwing the spitter surely ended some careers in an era when millions were not involved by illegal i meant banned for use in baseball and there are circumstances when it isn't against the law at large for a person to use steroids therapeutically as for issues of right and wrong people wiser than us have been trying to figure that out for a long time but baseball's history suggests at least within the confines of the baseball world that what's right is what you can get away with stealing signs is a part of the game faming pitches is a part of the game sadly denying black the opportunity to play was a part of baseball so was juicing ball during ' so was collusion by the owners in the ' s it my come as a surprise to the respondent who brought up legality and right and wrong but life isn't fair and i regard baseball as a metaphor for life as for hiting each other over the heads with bats if people could get away with it they would actually they have see the south for the past years but basic human dignity prevails i hope i don't hate him i respect him as one of the best players ever in the game want me to complain about him as a person don't know him but i've heard enough stories doesn't take from who he is on the field Barry Bonds Baseball History of baseball in the United States New York Yankees Bud Selig World Series Boston Red Sox San Francisco Giants Baseball statistics Babe Ruth 1994 baseball strike Ted Radcliffe St. Louis Cardinals Detroit Tigers Hank Aaron Pittsburgh Pirates Ty Cobb Major League Baseball television contracts Softball Theory of conduct Chicago White Sox Jos__ Canseco Tris Speaker Reggie Jackson Pete Rose Pedro Mart__nez Abortion debate Rafael Palmeiro 1919 World Series Poker jargon Sandy Koufax Mark McGwire Cincinnati Reds Willie Mays Houston Astros 2005 World Series Toronto Blue Jays Minor league baseball Oakland Athletics New York Mets Washington Nationals Texas Rangers (baseball) Los Angeles Dodgers Home run Baseball Stars Ichiro Suzuki Laws of cricket No-hitter 1957 World Series Jim Bouton Batting average Goodness and value theory 2004 World Series American football Montr__al Expos Designated hitter Racism Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Troy Glaus Japanese baseball Ben Johnson (athlete) September 20 in baseball MLB on FOX Baseball (object) Glossary of American football Ted Williams Andr__s Galarraga Property (ownership right) Vin Scully Sammy Sosa Seattle Mariners November 1 in baseball Dave Concepci__n Chicago Cubs David Hume Pitcher Babe Ruth's Called Shot Simone Weil October 27 in baseball Cricket October 20 in baseball Stolen base Alex Rodriguez Shoeless Joe Jackson International League Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Atlanta Braves New York Giants October 4 in baseball Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Earned run average
