i just realized why soccer isn't popular in the u s what's your opinion on this soccer is very popular in poor rd world countries countries where they don't have the resources to buy baseball gloves bats and balls american football pads basketballs and hoops etc most americans can afford these they play what they can afford a pig's intestine they can kick around i'm being serious do you think resources have nothing to do with what sports get played in certain parts of the world it's one of the main reasons basketball is played in the inner cities must less expensive to put up two rims than to build a baseball field contact the most popular sport in japan is baseball do your research before trying to make a point artist what exactly would you classify brazil and uraguay as wealthy their per capita incomes are and respectively per capita for u s nice try though art it's just an expression calm down soccer is not popular in the u s because we prefer not to fall asleep during games rockytopron soccer is not popular in the u s before you cite the women's world cup as a sparkplug for the game tell me who won this year's wusa title nobody because the league folded two years ago because nobody was willing to drive to the stadium and pay bucks to see it you know why the ' u s women were popular because they appealed to the male libido yes they were great players but they were already mostly age and up with more yesterdays on the field than tomorrows once those players' skills deteriorated to the point that putting them out there meant sacrificing victory for eye candy the guys left the stadium and the women and young girls weren't enough of a combined revenue source to keep the wusa going it's got nothing to do with talent it's got everything to do with the fact that women alone can't keep a league going and men aren't going to watch athletic women they haven't seen in skimpy outfits over and over again and soccer outfits though showing off some fantastic legs are not skimpy is that fair no those americans male and female who are good soccer players deserve the chance to exhibit their talent in front of people willing to pay to see them there just aren't enough people willing to pay to see them in this country Football (soccer) Baseball American football National Football League Basketball Babe Ruth Major League Baseball Field hockey Water polo World Series Football Oakland Athletics Golf Australian rules football Softball National pastime Chicago Cubs Sports in Puerto Rico Topps Playoff St. Louis Cardinals Volleyball Major League Baseball television contracts Rugby football Women's football (soccer) Pete Rose Satchel Paige Wrigley Field FIFA Series Sports timeline December 2004 in sports Continental Basketball Association American Football League Sport in the United Kingdom Sport in Ireland New York Yankees Pel__ New York Giants Mickey Mantle Norway national football team National Football League Lore Los Angeles Dodgers Boston Red Sox Lacrosse Ty Cobb Minor league baseball Ultimate (sport) Salary cap Canadian Soccer Association Rugby league Toronto Blue Jays 2005 World Series Brazil national football team New York Mets Indiana State University Canadian football Tris Speaker Yankee Stadium Texas Longhorn Athletics The Football League San Diego Padres Indoor football Alex Rodriguez Indoor soccer Cincinnati Bengals 2004 World Series FA Cup Atlantic Coast Conference Football (soccer) positions National Hockey League All-Star Game Robert F.
