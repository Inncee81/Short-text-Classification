looking for solid evidence i know roll your eyes i live in philadelpha and am not a giants or barry bonds fan but i was wondering if there was any solid evidence that barry bonds used steroids if there is none what is the anecdotal evidence i'm not really looking for opinions or speculations i just heard he was never positively tested and i'm wondering what the actual evidence is so i can make my own decision and think for myself i know just humor me ok the fact that he said he took something and didn't know it was steroids is a very thin excuse even if he didn't know they were steroids he still had them in his system and thus had an unfair advantage not looking good for bb first of all he admitted using what he said he though was linseed oil he and his trainer have connections to balco as for anecdotal evidence you can look at the change in his physique and the increased surliness in his attitude after most telling is the fact that his power numbers rose dramatically at this same time at an age when it is basically unheard of for such figures to do so he had been a good power hitter before but he became an incredible one at an age when most players start to see their numbers drop not rise this was also the time when mark mcgwire and sammy sosa were getting huge amounts of attention due to their breaking roger maris' single season record sources said bonds wanted to get what he saw as his fair share of that attention he wasn't getting it based simply on being one of the game's best players as evidenced by his three mvp awards so he seems to have decided to add something to his game Barry Bonds Home run Sammy Sosa Mark McGwire History of baseball in the United States St. Louis Cardinals Jos__ Canseco Baseball Jason Giambi World Series Roger Maris Hank Aaron Babe Ruth Troy Glaus Rafael Palmeiro New York Yankees Major League Baseball All-Star Game Chicago White Sox Roswell UFO incident San Francisco Giants Rickey Henderson Larry Walker 1957 World Series Gary Sheffield Shawn Green Miguel Tejada Batting average National Football League Ted Williams Torii Hunter Chicago Bulls Oakland Athletics ESPN25 October 22 in baseball Willie Mays Lou Gehrig Pete Rose Plame affair Craps Inflation Solar cell Robin Ventura Reggie Jackson Wayne Gretzky ELO rating system One Tree Hill (TV series) The Contender (television series) James Bond Jimmie Foxx Carolina Panthers NBA Finals Blood on the Tracks Satchel Paige Alex Rodriguez Sandy Koufax Heinkel He 100 RISC Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles Married... with Children Nolan Ryan Sub-Zero Andr__s Galarraga Brady Anderson Mach kernel Amiga Power 2004 World Series Todd McFarlane Atlanta Braves Controversies in autism Ichiro Suzuki Toronto Blue Jays Glass Gross domestic product United Kingdom corporation tax Salary cap Manny Ram__rez Cleveland Browns Mike Schmidt Vince McMahon Pittsburgh Steelers Seattle Mariners G-Man (Half-Life) Bud Selig Jeff Kent Ted Radcliffe Randy Johnson Time Out of Mind W.I.T.C.H.
