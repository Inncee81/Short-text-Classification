michael vick drafted by the rockies so i read on wikipedia that michael vick was drafted by the colorado rockies in the th round of the mlb draft despite not playing baseball since the th grade first of all is this true secondly why would the rockies do this just as a joke i know its the th round by why waste a draft pick for humor yes it is true and it very possibly was more of a publicity stunt then anything else with his athletic abilities vick very possibly could have been a good baseball player but i must strongly disagree with basketball boi for a couple of reasons first of all michael jordan retired from basketball for the first time before he ever set foot on a professional baseball field second jordan was not even a good aa ballplayer and was probably only given his roster spot because of his name and the owner of the bulls also happens to be the owner of the white sox as a thank you for what he had done in his basketball career third and finally baseball is not as easy as it looks hitting a baseball is probably the most difficult skill in any sport to learn it is not a talent that comes simply based on athletic ability baseball is more of a skill sport then simply a matter of being athletic yes athleticism may help speed a strong arm etc are great abilities to have as a baseball player but they are only part of the equation if baseball was so easy that players from other sports could pick it up and play it on the highest level you would see a lot more multi sport athletes out there Minor league baseball Baseball Michael Jordan Major League Baseball Chicago Bulls Michael Vick Salary cap New York Yankees World Series San Diego Padres Deion Sanders Oakland Athletics Negro league baseball Larry Bird National Football League New York Knicks University of Miami New York Mets Andr__s Galarraga Cleveland Indians Draft (sports) Los Angeles Clippers Chicago White Sox Chicago Cubs Volleyball Ty Cobb New Jersey Nets Reggie Jackson International League Tris Speaker Boston Red Sox Philadelphia Phillies Orlando Magic LeBron James Pete Rose Equine conformation Batting average San Francisco Giants Albert Pujols Robin Ventura Jerry Krause Willie Mays Utah Jazz Lou Gehrig Babe Ruth Manny Ram__rez Tony Gwynn June 8 in baseball Baseball statistics National Basketball Association Alex Rodriguez October 20 in baseball Charles O.
