what is the history what started it of irrate mlb managers kicking dirt on umpire's shoes it's hysterically funny to see an irrate major league baseball manager going nose to nose with an umpire and then start kicking dirt on his shoes and pants i's enormously entertaining but i just wonder where that tradition started it's an odd thing to do to show your displeasure with a call hell i'd push it back to john mcgraw back when he played for the orioles in the s they only had two umps per game so players could get away with some fairly dirty tactics he carried that with him to his managerial days with the giants he may have picked it up from hanlon while in baltimore but to be honest years ago players and umpire were a lot less classy on the field then todays players fighting with fans umps spitting on umps remember how people were ready to crucify robbie alomar this all went on a lot more in the early days thankfully we have video replay and hold these men to higher standards at least while they are on camera so the worst we get nowadays is a dirt kicking tantrum Baltimore Orioles San Francisco Giants Babe Ruth Los Angeles Dodgers Major League Baseball Baseball Softball Major League Baseball television contracts World Series Roberto Alomar Sammy Sosa Cincinnati Bengals New York Mets John McGraw (baseball) Minor league baseball Oakland Athletics Boston Red Sox New York Yankees 1957 World Series Umpire (cricket) October 20 in baseball Major League Baseball All-Star Game Cleveland Indians Australian rules football San Francisco 49ers Field hockey Carolina Panthers Reggie Jackson New York Giants History of baseball in the United States 1994 baseball strike Negro league baseball November 3 in baseball 2005 World Series St. Louis Cardinals International League Philadelphia Phillies Dolphins Stadium Troy Glaus Toronto Blue Jays Baseball Hall of Fame Pittsburgh Steelers Frank Robinson Nolan Ryan Derek Jeter Seattle Mariners Sandy Koufax American football Pete Rose National Football League Lore Detroit Tigers Home run Interference (baseball) Ty Cobb MLB on NBC Mario No-hitter Casey Stengel Citizens Bank Park Montr__al Expos Laws of cricket Houston Astros Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Essendon Football Club Washington Nationals Skateboarding trick Super Bowl Tris Speaker Baltimore Ravens Luis Aparicio Tony La Russa Pants Rowland Monday Night Football Sydney Riot of 1879 Kevin Keegan Cleveland Browns Rugby union Marching band Andr__s Galarraga Tommy Connolly Cincinnati Reds October 2005 in sports
