my friend has some crazy ideas what do you think he says that an old version of vlc player has bug that allows for remote code execution i agree he also says that a single avi file is capable of holding shell instruction i get skeptical he also says that by running this avi file in this old version of vlc player the avi is capable of exploiting the bug and then reformatting the entire hard drive here is where i give him the look of disgust is this situation even theoretically possible no the harddrive can simply not be formated when the filesystem is mounted the filesystem can be forced to unmount but not on the partition that holds the system the windows program wil simply not allow it and if you manage to unmount the filesystem somehow windows wil crash instantly and reboot the computer PlayStation Portable PNG Macromedia Flash Drawing Digital image editing Digital photography Drill bit Mattress Mouse (computing) ITunes MP3 JPEG GIF JPEG 2000 Upholstery Floppy disk CPU cache Stereoscopy IPod PlayStation 3 Super Nintendo Entertainment System Wallpaper group Mac OS X v10.4 Welding Windows XP Eye Computer virus Bass guitar Mars Exploration Rover Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children Transformer Radio controlled airplane OpenDocument 2D computer graphics Screenshot Musical Instrument Digital Interface Screw Katana MAME Web page Map projection QuickTime Phase (matter) Nuclear weapon design Glacier Image file formats Nintendo Entertainment System Opportunity rover Adobe Photoshop Windows Vista Guitar Uploading and downloading Fractal MOSFET Pixel Windows 2000 Roxette Plate tectonics Rail tracks Depth of field Ebook E-mail Bloodstain pattern analysis Ra (board game) QuickDraw Knife Loudspeaker DVD Transport Layer Security Solar cell Casting Distortion Anaglyph image Copy protection Blue screen of death Paint Shop Pro Internet Relay Chat Television Geographic information system Enterprise content management Disk image Steganography Glossary of firefighting equipment Soap bubble Portable Document Format Objective-C Sorting algorithm Glass NTFS Eyepiece Memory Stick Architecture of Windows 2000 Leaf Cascading Style Sheets MDAC Rate distortion theory Mozilla Firefox
