getting my website to load someone elses website into my content box i'm having coding trouble i'm currently working on a website project for somebody and have run into a problem hopefully some of you can help me out here i have buttons set up that use the following code its all on one line and clicking on the button causes the website to load an html file within a content box i've created td class button listings onclick loadpage ' pages listings html' onmouseover changebutton this true 'button listings' 'button listings down' 'banner listings' onmouseout changebutton this false 'button listings' 'button listings down' 'banner listings' td this works perfectly fine when loading the local page 'listings html' but i want to be able to load someone else's website inside my own content box so that the user can get some information while still retaining my sites header and button set however if i change pages listings html to something like http www yahoo com i get a 'page not found' error does anyone know how i can get this to work the page not found is not what i would expect you to get so first make sure the url is correct try opening it in a fresh window just as it is in your code second and what i think you will find once you get the page to load properly is a feature of most browsers to restrict cross frame scripting you should be able to display someone else's page on yours but you will not be able to manipulate objects on the other page using script on yours third what do you mean by a content box i can't figure out from your code just where this other content is being displayed in an iframe this may be your basic problem to start there may be cleaner ways to do what you are trying to do lastly placing an onclick event handler on a td tag is bad practice in ie you can click on almost anything but many dom's do not support this behavior you are much better off handling onclick events from objects where clicking is a primary behavior e g a button more detail better answers perhaps post your loadpage function PNG GIF Web page Adobe Photoshop Macromedia Flash PlayStation Portable Sega Saturn Mozilla Firefox Image file formats Mozilla Application Suite ITunes BitTorrent Favicon JPEG EMule Gmail Goatse.cx Portable Document Format Web browser 2D computer graphics Windows Vista Common Unix Printing System Windows 2000 Sega Dreamcast Windows XP Opera (web browser) Tux Paint Resident Evil (video game) JPEG 2000 Internet Explorer Screenshot Macintosh Finder Knoppix ASCII art X Window System PlayStation 2 JavaScript GIMP Blue screen of death Perl B3ta Graphics Mozilla Thunderbird Web hosting HTML element Comparison of layout engines (graphics) Unicode Python programming language Microsoft Office Scalable Vector Graphics AmigaOS Internet phenomenon RGB color model Filename extension Google Final Fantasy (video game) Mouse (computing) File Transfer Protocol Xbox Mac OS X v10.4 Enterprise content management IPhoto XML Mac OS X NTFS Finale notation program Tagged Image File Format Object Desktop Konqueror Uploading and downloading Ebook Lemmings (computer game) Concurrent Versions System Server Exception handling Computer virus Web design Digital image editing Comparison of web browsers KDE PlayStation 3 Newline Stereoscopy Lossless data compression Novell NetWare Netscape Browser Macromedia Fireworks Gallery of sovereign state coats of arms Ajax (programming) Nintendo 64 Xbox 360 Windows Picture and Fax Viewer Microsoft .NET Proxy server QuickTime Adobe Illustrator
