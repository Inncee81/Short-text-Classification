using multiple css sheets to provide skinning of a website how what's the simplest way to use multiple style sheets to change the appearance of a website and it's logos etc based an option chosen by the visitor from a drop down selection box an example is http www vcdquality com but they use javascript to load another style which i'd rather stay away from if possible is there a way to do this purely in html without something as crude as having multiple copies of my pages with a different reference to each style sheet to create each 'skin' any links and information are welcomed oh and by links i mean specific links to a page that deals with what i'm asking rather than a generic site i've been there done that and found nothing which is why i'm asking here billyzeke your referral link spam isn't welcome expect yahoo to remove it once their support team reads my abuse report jake cigar i was actually just looking at csszengarden this very second and other sites that seem to write the location of the css file into the page from the url having never had any dealings with cgi or whatever though i'm unsure how it's done are there specific server requirements for running cgi scripts but yeah if you could help me out with a cgi script for loading the css file i'd be eternally greatful as far as i know there's no way of of stealing cgi scripts from sites is there there are a number of ways to do that in html server side scripting but all require a postback specifically they choose the item from the dropdown then press a submit button the problem you face with an html only change is that you can't make it apply beyond the current request in other words reloading the page makes the selection revert to default going to another page causes a revert to default the way javascript and server side scripting gets past that is by sending a cookie that stores the current css choice that said you can set up a simple html form with a get method that sends the page back to itself for example suppose this is index html form method get id myform name myform action index html select name css option value css txt style option option value css txt style option option value css txt style option select input type submit name submit id submit value change style form save your css as text files in the head section declare a style element style type text css style and then add this server side include code between the opening and ending tags include virtual query string unescaped the above assumes the css text files are in the same directory as the the index html file remove the spaces before the underscores i had to add them due to yahoo 's line truncation so your final style call would be like this style type text css if query string unescaped css css txt include virtual css txt end if if query string unescaped css css txt include virtual css txt end if if query string unescaped css css txt include virtual css txt end if style note that this is not very secure anyone can mod the query string doesn't have a default value and again won't hold on postback or a new page but it kind of does what you want Macromedia Flash HyperText Transfer Protocol PNG HTML PHP Scalable Vector Graphics Website Web page Macromedia Shockwave ActionScript Uniform Resource Locator Macromedia Ajax (programming) World Wide Web Web server Opera (web browser) Web design Reverse engineering Warez BitTorrent Dance Dance Revolution XSL Transformations Web template ICalendar Macromedia Flex Screenshot Casting JavaServer Pages Goatse.cx Computer graphics Common Unix Printing System Phishing Web crawler Adobe Photoshop ColdFusion Gmail Wiki OpenOffice.org Adobe Illustrator CPAN Labour economics JavaScript HTML element Flash memory XML Adobe Systems Authorware Portable Document Format Search engine optimization Domain Name System Prank flash Streaming media OpenDocument ImageMagick Macromedia Dreamweaver Flash (comics) Cross site scripting Windows 2000 Ebook Obfuscated code Blog HyperCard Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol 2D computer graphics Resource Description Framework PHP-Nuke Compiler TOC protocol Windows Vista HTTP cookie Copy protection Transport Layer Security WebDAV Representational State Transfer Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends Files-11 IPod Port numbers Macromedia Director DVD PostScript C plus plus Lotus Notes Web traffic Digital rights management Cascading Style Sheets Internet censorship in mainland China Nintendo DS Enigma machine LaTeX SOAP Wget Unix JSON Version Morse Code Copyright law of the United Kingdom
