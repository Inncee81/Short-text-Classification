which programming language should i learn i have experience in java c c and minor exeperience in perl but have not truly learned any of them i have no idea which one i should go to next to fully learn i'm not looking for which one is easiest but rather which one would be smartest to learn the first thing to consider is why do you want to learn programming being a programmer for your local community projects differs from being a programmer from apple both are naturally different than doing it as a hobby or for working freelance since i don't know anything about your circumstances i'll assume you're doing this for fun hoping it can build up into a business fair enough well or you want to have career in it alright let me tell you first and foremost that programming is regardless of what programming language you may choose by that i mean that the main concepts of programming remain the same in every language it's how you implement these concepts that makes a language different than another faster more effecient easier etc this is a major source of relief for beginner programmers since they can start out with a relatively easy language and later move on to more complicated ones depending on their conditions and circumstances one of the easiest programming language is out there is arguably basic basic is an acronym for beginners all purpose symbolic instruction code sounds a little complicated for a beginner doesn't it well i assume bill gates came up with the acronym first and then tried to work out a meaningful sentence around it anyway this is a very easy language to learn and it contains most of programming concepts but it's too obsolete some might say i sort of agree that's why many programmers in the making opt for visual basic it's a huge step from its predecessor and it works with graphics more than with actual code the huge downside is that it works solely on windows nothing else people might say it's microsoft's way of monopolizing the market and they might be quite right but i digress another fairly easy language is perl perl used to be the absolute no language for the web and it has been the no scripting language which a fancy way to say programming in certain occasions and environments for unix which is one of the greatest operating systems of all time imho smile gif it works across many if not all platforms it's versatile and can be easy to learn of worked at regularly it's totally free and it's supported with loads and loads of tutorials sample code websites etc it's still pretty much in use today but even if it wasn't it'd still be a great introduction into programming i trust some will disagree but that's my opinion anyhow since i believe many will add their own opinion about the right introductory language i think you'll have lots of choices knight but ultimately if you want to be a programmer worth the name you have to learn c sooner or later personally i think the word programmer doesn't have c in it as you go along you'll come across numerous information about other programming languages their advantages and disadvantages their uses etc and so you'll be better qualified to make an educated choice about your programming goals i personally prefer c c java but after all its your choice main thing one must be perfect in their logic trust me when i say programming is a fun ride if you're up to it just don't give up too early ok have a nice time and fun learning Microsoft Excel C programming language Brainfuck Common Lisp Computer BASIC programming language Quicksort Randomness Buffer overflow Combo
