need opinions to improve my website i have been working on a website for the last few months i would appreciate anyone who is willing to take the time to look it over as well to give me your opinion on it and ways that could improve it if it is not a place that you would purchase from other than because you are not interested in the items please let me know why so i can make any necessary changes to this site thank you again for anyone who takes the time to look the address is www cnpgifts com i would either redo the scan a jpg logo or just make it filtered text because the image you have up now is grainy and doesn't look as professional as possible i would shorten your top menu with advanced search viewcart checkout home so that the div width aligns to the div width of the main section either wrap the section below the menu in the same border which i think might be better anyway you can just border left border right it in your css or make the width of the menu a few pixels smaller to align it make the background color white the user above was right you don't want a dark site especially when your dealing with gift items less bold on everything when you bold everythign it loses its purpose your color scheme seems a little random you don't need to use every single color first text i read i see red blue green black pick a color scheme and stick to it a major positive is its all cosmetic that i've listed and wouldn't take long to change if you wanted to and mostly its the main page that i've noticed this product pages look good and you set up the cart correctly Web page HTML element BitTorrent Uploading and downloading HTML JavaScript HyperText Transfer Protocol Portable Document Format Pipeline (Unix) XHTML File Transfer Protocol Web hosting Macromedia Flash File format JavaServer Pages File system Wiki World Wide Web History of the Internet Wikimedia Commons Common Unix Printing System Internet Explorer Ebook Dynamic HTML Favicon HTML editor Google search Linked list File sharing EMule Web browser Mind transfer Markup language Newsgroup Image Cascading Style Sheets Hyperlink Website Character encodings in HTML Robots Exclusion Standard Representational State Transfer AmigaOS Hello world program MSN Groups Spamdexing Filename extension Perl WYSIWYG Document Type Definition Mozilla Application Suite Everything2 Web design Kazaa Gmail Internet pornography Lotus Notes Btrieve ALGOL 68 Mac OS X v10.4 Search engine optimization GameFAQs JADE programming language Microsoft Jet Database Engine RSS (file format) Computer virus Unicode and HTML Xanga Cross site scripting Data General Nova YTMND Windows 2000 TikiWiki Ajax (programming) CPAN TeX Web traffic Obfuscated code Wget Debian CPU cache Suprnova.org The Book of Mozilla Uniform Resource Locator Bash Internet Typeface Facebook (website) PNG C programming language Peer-to-peer Blog Warez Opera (web browser) Link spam Binary and text files OpenOffice.org Palm Sunday Compromise Metadata Disk image Google Desktop
