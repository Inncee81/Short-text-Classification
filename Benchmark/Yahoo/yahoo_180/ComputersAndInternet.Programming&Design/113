c for beginners describe the characteristics of an array declaration initialization etc and give code examples i really need help in this can someone help me out here c arrays are the data structures which can be used to store consecutive values of the same data types c arrays can be declared for all c data types viz int float double char struct char etc all the values are stored in consecutive memory locations the values can be accessed by using the position of the stored value the computer also stores c arrays in consecutive memory locations viz etc this makes the c arrays' accessibility faster unlike other data structures like linked list queue etc the access to the elements is very fast c arrays can be multi dimensional most cases a maximum of dimensions will suffice for programming that too single dimension c arrays are the commonest declaring c arrays of int type the c arrays are declared with the data type name and the number of elements inside the square brackets int var name c array of type int with maximum size the above declaration means the var name is an array of integer type the values inside this var name array can be accessed by referring to the position of their elements like var name var name etc all the c arrays are based on zero index values that means the position reference starts at and counts till the n th position so in the above array elements can be stored starting from to the maximum number of elements that can be stored or the maximum size of the c array is the values can be stored and accessed as given in the following code snippet var name var name var name printf position d position d position d n var name var name var name care should be taken while using or referring to the position of the element the position reference should not exceed the maximum size specified in the declaration if it exceeds the program will not generate any compiler errors but it will raise run time errors and exceptions declaration of a two dimensional array is also similar a great example for a two dimensional c integer array will be matrix int array matrix matrix of type using c array of int data type declaring c arrays of type float the declaration and use of c arrays in float type are the same as int the declaration is written as follows float var float a c array of float type the above declaration means the c float array contains elements starting from position till the elements can be accessed as var float var float var float var float var float var float var float declaring c arrays of type char this is one of the most widely used and problematic type of c array when an array of char is declared this char array can be used as a string with the maximum size as specified in the array declaration when this c char array is declared with two dimensions this can be thought as an array of strings char var char array memory reserved for characters char var char init c char array string example initialization without specifying the size like the above the c char array can be declared with or without initializing values c array advantages easier to declare and use can be used with all data types c array disadvantages fixed size data if the number of elements stored are less than the maximum size then the rest of the memory space goes waste if the number of elements to be stored are more than the maximum size the array cannot accommodate those new values Chmod File system permissions File system File Allocation Table Tar (file format) Filename extension Logo programming language Emacs Ls Files-11 File format Comparison of file systems NTFS Computer file Cp (Unix) Common Unix Printing System Multics Master Control Program Macintosh Finder Symbolic link Newline 666 (number) Bash Tilde Unix security Library (computer science) Ocaml Unix shell Forth programming language Berkeley Software Distribution Mach kernel Windows 2000 Python programming language Internet Relay Chat Rootkit ISO 9660 Apollo Guidance Computer C programming language Vi Windows registry Unix File System Directory SCO v.
