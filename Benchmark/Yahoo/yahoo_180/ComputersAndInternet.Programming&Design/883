computer animation programs i'm and i already have truespace animation program down but without instructions should i join a class on animation before i try to move on or what and are there any low cost or free animation programs that are better that truespace which software you use really depends on what look you're going for your budget and your current hardware truespace has been getting good reviews though i taught animation before and in my experience starting is always the toughest if you have completely no experience in animation i suggest you start with a simpler animation software like flash even just the trial version this will teach you basics of handling timelines creating objects and tool handling if you can attend a class its best that you get your foundations right this should get you through the tough starting process truespace may look simpler than other software but its just as complex from there you can learn on your own and all you have to do is refine your craft DOS Apple II family Atari DOS MS-DOS Booting CP/M FreeDOS Commodore DOS Computer virus Disk formatting IBM PC compatible File Allocation Table Disk cloning Computer file DirectX OS/2 Personal computer Microsoft Windows Optimized Systems Software Upper Memory Area Atari 8-bit family Virtual DOS machine Windows 95 File system Partition (computing) Windows 3.x Disk operating system BIOS Shell (computing) Education in Portugal Computer role-playing game Operating system Microsoft Ghost (software) PC-DOS IA-32 Filename extension Graphical Environment Manager Newline Windows 1.0 TRS-80 Color Computer Expanded memory Object file History of the graphical user interface RSX-11 WordPerfect Btrieve Cache Computer program Management information system Commodore 1541 DR-DOS Timeline of computing 1990-forward Daemon (computer software) Windows 2000 Microsoft Word DOS Plus Binary and text files Rogue (computer game) Floppy disk Doom engine Source code Computer science IBM PC QDOS COMMAND.COM Computer software Control-Alt-Delete BASIC programming language Clipper programming language Assembler Norton Commander Common User Access WordStar History of computing hardware (1960s-present) X86 DOS Comparison Hello world program DESQview Metadata Apple DOS Embedded system PaX DOSBox Turbo Pascal Windows Me Flash memory Denial-of-service attack PL/I Data remanence Mach kernel Forth programming language Batch file NTLDR File format Apple IIGS Malware Self-modifying code History of Microsoft Windows Emacs Computer
