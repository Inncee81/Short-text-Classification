when creating a website why does it appear different in ie than firefox so i created a pretty basic website for my company for a new add campaign html host ftp publish and you're done i've got one mp and pdfs linked on the site but here is my curiosity i created with nvu and published all while creating editing in mozilla firefox the site looks crisp and perfect in mozilla but when somebody opens the url in internet explorer the link sizes are all different the fonts are different sizes etc can somebody with experience shed some light on this for me i'm stumped thanks most web sites are designed for ie so mostly when i view them with firefox they look slightly odd and some bits don't work because the website is using microsoft proprietary html extensions there's nothing like a standard and unfortunately html is nothing like a standard or maybe that should be microsoft's implementation of html is nothing like the same standard that mozilla's implementation of html follows they obey the html pragmas in slightly different ways or don't obey them use different defaults for font etc so the end result is screens that can look very different viewed in ie or firefox getting sites that look the same in the two is a case of using the common html commands only and specifying everything explicitly no relying on the default values plus of course trial and error or checking which browser and offering different code for the two browsers if you want the ultimate in not the same look there are some microsoft pages where the links just don't work in some non microsoft browsers the ones i came up against were typically the 'download' button which just didn't appear on screen for netscape Serialization XML JavaScript Object-SQL mapping Objective-C Document Type Definition Macromedia Flash Self programming language AppleScript Java API for XML Processing XML Signature Object-oriented programming C programming language Microsoft .NET File format Ajax (programming) Common Unix Printing System CPU cache Associative array MDAC Markup language Translation memory Java programming language Enterprise content management Enterprise JavaBeans OpenDocument XMLHTTP XSL Transformations JSON Bluetooth Scalable Vector Graphics Component Object Model
