in visual basic why would you want to create your own class and can you give a simple example of a useful class classes allow you to combine all sorts of data and the functions you use to manipulate that data in one place so you don't have to keep rewriting it for example suppose you are a teacher you have students each student takes the same tests each student has a name each student is expected to attend rather than writing the same code over and over again to record student names scores and attendance it's easier to write the code to handle that information once and just recycle the code for each student that is it's easier to make a class and to make an instance of the class for each student for help understanding classes check this link http www dougv com blog objects classes explained in very simple terms Internet Relay Chat HyperText Transfer Protocol Direct Client-to-Client BitTorrent Mozilla Firefox Chat room Uniform Resource Locator PHP Internet Wget Domain Name System Proxy server Slackware Bersirc World Wide Web Representational State Transfer Denial-of-service attack Web server Peer-to-peer AOL Instant Messenger BZFlag Gay Nigger Association of America Forth programming language Trillian (instant messenger) Mozilla Application Suite EFnet Independent Media Center Website Opera (web browser) America Online DeviantART ICQ Transmission Control Protocol Subversion (software) Undernet MIRC script Port numbers MSN Messenger EMule Spyware MUD Comparison of web browsers I2P DALnet Transport Layer Security Virtual hosting HTTP cookie Web crawler Domain name Common Unix Printing System MAME ReactOS Irssi Freenode Squid cache Gnutella TikiWiki Internet pornography Chat Damn Small Linux MySQL Uploading and downloading Telnet File Transfer Protocol CPAN GameFAQs Microsoft Office Internet fraud Phishing X-Chat Preboot Execution Environment Streaming media Game programmer Stateful firewall April 1, 2005 Bbc.co.uk Base64 Concurrent Versions System Gmail Firewall (networking) Warez Apache HTTP Server MythTV Whois Lotus Notes Danger Hiptop IRC bot Session Initiation Protocol DeltaAnime E-mail spam User agent Sun Microsystems IRCHighway Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Stardock Central Mafia (game) Jabber File-sharing program
