is it possible for a batch file to determine if a program is loaded before continuing with the next command i want to start a program using a batch file but the program takes several minutes to load i want the batch file to wait for the program to load before continuing with the next command typically the batch file does not continue until a call has 'exit'ed if the called program returns an exit on successful completion and non on failure just add a test for the exit value COMMAND.COM Hello world program Data General Nova Extreme Programming Bash Computer virus Batch file Emacs Btrieve Library (computer science) Icon programming language Virtual memory Master Control Program CPU cache BASIC programming language Forth programming language Common Unix Printing System DOS Perl Embedded system Job Control Language Thread (computer science) TeX MUMPS Scripting language ARexx PDP-11 Emacs Lisp COM file MS-DOS RSTS/E Pipeline (Unix) Leopard tank Read-copy-update Leclerc Logo programming language Exception handling OpenTV MDAC Computer multitasking Atari DOS Structured programming Spring operating system Software testing Mach kernel Shell script AWK programming language Register renaming Ethernet IAR 80 Jet engine Web crawler Commodore DOS Windows 2000 File format C syntax Classic RISC pipeline Digital circuit Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Halting problem NeXT User interface Unix shell Domain Name System CPU design Subroutine Text Editor and Corrector Apollo Guidance Computer Blue screen of death OpenVMS RISC Casting Dice Heinkel He 112 Booting AmigaOS C programming language Addressing mode Graphical Environment Manager Sugar beet EMule CP/M Dialysis Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Digital photography JavaServer Pages Header file Microsoft .NET Project Apollo Host file Shader MVS Car handling GRASS programming language Control flow British Rail Class 42 Real-time IA-32 Instruction pipeline IBM PC compatible
