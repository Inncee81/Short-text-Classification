how form secure by captcha works how exactly captcha works lets say i've a php script and it displays html page with a form and a captcha image but when the user enter the code and hit submit how do the script verify it's the right code what data and where it compares to the code the user entered is it when the script generate the image it also create a cookie or session with that code so when the user hit submit the script can compare the user input to the data on the cookie or session but is captcha to prevent robut to hitting the script can a script to read the session and try to hit the other script to break the system one of two ways the characters generated by the captcha code are stored server side and compared when the user posts web technologies like php asp asp net java etc support the ability to store information about specific sessions server side only that can later be correlated by in memory cookies that are exchanged during requests by the browser and server the key could be encrypted and embedded with the page itself secure as long as a real encryption method like aes is used but it goes against the best practices approach of hiding any unecessary information from users regardless of whether it's encrypted or not Mouse (computing) Finale notation program Screenshot Digital image editing Minesweeper (computer game) Drill bit Cursor (computers) Mouse Scrollbar Software testing Genetically modified organism Drag-and-drop Adobe Photoshop Mouse gesture Digital photography PNG Hamster AppleScript ImageMagick Good Times Jack Dempsey GIMP B3ta 35 mm film April 1, 2005 Vim (text editor) Internet phenomenon Tux Paint Macromedia Fireworks Black Pete Fitts' law AmigaOS Snooker Apple Macintosh Aspect ratio (image) Police box Cascading Style Sheets Inca Empire Crop circle IPhoto RuneScape Random Events History of the graphical user interface Graphics tablet Boxing Multiple document interface Direct manipulation interface Joseph Smith, Jr. Fark.com Graphics Screenplay Shen Gong Wu Microsoft Paint Loudspeaker Organic farming Playboy (magazine) Irrigation Universal Serial Bus Dobermann Object Desktop IPod Letterbox Photography Digital single-lens reflex cameras Mickey Mouse Twm Flying wing Physical paradox Cardboard Grande Prairie, Alberta Cut and paste MAD Magazine Marching band Viking Age AviSynth Tourist guy Tanbo Ardour (audio processor) Genetic engineering Touchpad Griffon Bruxellois Widget (computing) Click fraud Shifting cultivation Docking JavaScript Taro GIF Kart racing Vernon Schillinger Football (soccer) field Darken Rahl Option key Maze Calvin and Hobbes Rigging Kallithea Jackson Structured Programming Graphic design Fuse (electrical)
