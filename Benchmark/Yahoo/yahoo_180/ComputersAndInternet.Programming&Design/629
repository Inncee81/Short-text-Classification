what do youn mean by array array in c programming arrays in c act to store related data under a single variable name with an index also known as a subscript it is easiest to think of an array as simply a list or ordered grouping of variables as such arrays often help a programmer organize collections of data efficiently and intuitively meaning an array is a variable that holds multiple values of the same type in c and c arrays and pointers have a lot in common also remember that arrays and pointers have a special relationship this is because arrays use pointers to reference memory locations therefore most of the times pointer and array references can be used interchangeably example for numbers it is int numbers for characters char letters example of declarations int vector if we want to access a variable stored in an array for example with the above declaration the following code will store a in the variable x int x x vector and so on if your studying bout array for it to be flexible you also might wanna check pointers scalar indexing strings and looping Hello world program Pointer C programming language C syntax Boolean algebra Exception handling Quicksort Function (mathematics) ALGOL 68 Floating point Generic programming Printf Sorting algorithm Subroutine UTF-8 Discrete Fourier transform Heapsort Fischer Random Chess Brainfuck Debugging Shor's algorithm Prolog Kolmogorov complexity Computer numbering formats Compiler optimization Associative array Quantum computer Boost library Class (computer science) Python programming language Paging C Sharp Computer Magic number (programming) Reference (C Plus Plus) Objective-C Eight queens puzzle Object lifetime Halting problem CPU cache Name mangling E-mail spam Emacs Reductio ad absurdum Trigonometric function Xor swap algorithm Identical particles Discrete wavelet transform Infinity Java programming language Probability density function Normal distribution Expert system Virtual memory Algorithm Reynolds number On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Control flow Central processing unit G__del's incompleteness theorem Wallpaper group Australian electoral system X86 assembly language Tagged union Lambda calculus Red-black tree Emulator Global climate model Luzon Functional programming Visitor pattern Datatype SHA hash functions Endianness Buffer overflow Linked list Tower of Hanoi Hash table Windows 2000 Order theory Page table Median Icon programming language Iterator NaN Resource Acquisition Is Initialization Group (mathematics) Field (mathematics) Collision detection Trombone Computational complexity theory C preprocessor Lisp programming language Thread (computer science) Analog-to-digital converter Selection algorithm Topology glossary Gmail Nuclear power
