im painting my room and i'd like to have each wall a different colour so what color's match and i don't exactly want them to be light colours maybe light colour and dark im not exactly a preppy person if you know what i mean i'd like more of a punk rockish feel for my room so if you don't know what i mean then please ignore everything that i just wrote in the details thank you in advance easiest and surest search for what's called a color wheel on the internet just type in color wheel then click on images see there in front of your eyes you'll see what goes with what colors that are across the wheel from each other create drama colors next to each other seem peaceful and it sounds like you want drama so choose a darker shade of one like plum a grayed down shade of another from the other side of the wheel and a pure shade of another like deep plum gray green and light yellow i mean if want to be absolutely sure it doesn't look preppy even the greatest of artists use a color wheel to make sure everything goes together or just look at a piece of cloth or anything a picture or anything that has colors that you like and use those colors Color theory Color Drawing Color blindness Microsoft Paint Hair color Eye color Wassily Kandinsky James McNeill Whistler Traditional animation Color space Primary color Human skin color Synaesthesia Sunglasses Camouflage Pixel Grey Lighting Mario series enemies Wallpaper group Vitreous enamel Blue Cinematography Game Boy Light-emitting diode Grace Cossington Smith Autostereogram Opportunity rover Georges-Pierre Seurat DLP Eye Pottery Garnet Plum AmigaOS Color vision Stereoscopy ASCII art Impressionism Political colour Dog Digital photography HSV color space Wood Flag of India Lamborghini Diablo Bicycle lighting Iris (anatomy) Grayscale Mouse (computing) Super Nintendo Entertainment System CMYK color model Japanese tea ceremony Photography Piet Mondrian CIE 1931 color space Billiards Pysanka Fischer Random Chess Time Out of Mind Anaglyph image Pigment Cluedo Railway signalling Computer animation Brett Whiteley Casting Textile manufacturing terminology Computer graphics Vehicle registration plate Yohoho!
