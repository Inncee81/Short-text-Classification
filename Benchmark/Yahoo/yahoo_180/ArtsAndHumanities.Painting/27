question for professional artists how do you choose what colors to use i understand warm and cool colors complementary primary secondary and teritiary colors but what is the rule when painting does every color you use need to have the complementry does every color need to be in every tone and value i use oils i know everyone says don't worry about the rules but then when you show it to someone who is a critic they say you need blue in that picture or some other color i don't mind breaking the rules but i would like to under stand them first puppy i can't take out the rules if i wanted because i can't find them i just keep hearing that there is rules it seems to be some big secret as to what they are jackie it is so refreshing to see your question and to know there is a new generation of artists who care about the rules yes indeed there are rules and you will learn them in time with your attitude and you will conquer painting just don't expect it to happen over night if you already understand complimentaries and warm cool colors you only need to learn about values the darkness or lightness of the paint and harmony and then you will know the rules well enough to break them hang in there kid it is well worth the effort Color theory Social rule Color Wassily Kandinsky Drawing Art Carl Barks Jon Secada Impressionism Paint The Ashlee Simpson Show Care Bears Lighting Jennifer Lopez Humphrey Bogart Ozone depletion Comanche Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Black Grace Cossington Smith Abstraction Theory of conduct Jeopardy!
