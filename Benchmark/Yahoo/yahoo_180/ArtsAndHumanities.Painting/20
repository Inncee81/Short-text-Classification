i have an oil painting that is signed at the bottom ferrante how do i know which ferrante it is there are more than one and i think it may be quite valuable now my husband bought it for me in it appears to be a picture of busy little street in the city with ladies in their long dresses and hats and gentlemen in their long cloaks and there is also a horse and buggy a painting won't become valuable simply because it was purchased years ago the worth depends completely on the artist and you don't know his first name if the painting was purchased from a gallery you could ask that gallery if it's still in business and if it wasn't purchased from a gallery or directly from the artist the chances of it being valuable or even original are not very good otherwise you're going to have to use google or some other search engine to pull up images by artists name ferrante and comparing the work and signatures to see if you can find your ferrante then look up the prices of that artist's work on ebay the bid prices will give you an idea what people are willing to pay for it Network effect Auction Monopoly (game) Rembrandt Art Inflation Francis Bacon (painter) Gross domestic product __douard Manet Amazon.com The Haunted Mansion David Teniers the Younger Arthur Streeton Philatelic investment Diego Vel__zquez Art forgery Poker jargon Brett Whiteley Slide rule Live 8 Internet fraud De Lorean DMC-12 Online auction business model Ra (board game) Winner's curse Surveillance Digital photography National Gallery, London Baseball Stars Leonardo da Vinci Price discrimination National Gallery of Ireland Caravaggio Solarquest Eug__ne Delacroix Mutual fund Drawing Electronic commerce L.
