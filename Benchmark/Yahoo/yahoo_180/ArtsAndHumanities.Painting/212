if i am oil painting is it ok to paint the whole background is it ok to paint the whole background red and then paint over the red with the white and the colors will not blend and my white will be its true color what im saying is is it ok to paint over a darker color with a lighter color and the dark will not show through also do you have to let it dry before you paint over the background sorry this is confusing i am used to watercolor i think its all been said thin layers to thick dark to light the only thing extra i can suggest is to mask the areas you want to be white with masking tape then do the red and let it dry for a couple of days when it is dry to the touch meaning so it won't blend with the white anymore remove the masking tape and mask the parts you want to leave red i don't know what you are painting so it is difficult to say more if you want the white to come forward more then you may want to try doing the whole thing red as thin as possible do you want a wash or something more opaque letting it dry and putting the white over it if the white is thick enough you should not have a problem anyway the most important thing is to experiment with all these suggestions yourself and see what works best because as you know personal experience is the best art teacher enjoy and the question did make sense i hope my answer did as well Paint Color Drawing Watercolor painting Wood Impressionism Acrylic paint Color theory Typewriter Diving suit Wassily Kandinsky Casting Vitreous enamel Human skin color Leather Iris (anatomy) Shroud of Turin Abstraction Paper marbling Light-emitting diode Painting Geology of the Grand Canyon area Camouflage Glass Jan van Goyen Textile manufacturing __douard Manet Philosophy of language Coffee Billiards Upholstery Opportunity rover Cocoa Japanese tea ceremony Traditional animation Rum The Wall Miniature (illuminated manuscript) Knife Wok Sushi Tempera Technicolor M16 (rifle) Social rule Plastic Rayleigh scattering Portrait miniature Pysanka Pastel Phosphorus Sun Physical attractiveness Floppy disk Tea Blue Ice hockey Tobacco Yellow Past teachings of Prem Rawat Black Chocolate Fancy rat Diamond cut Dodge Charger IPod Tofu Irna Phillips E.
