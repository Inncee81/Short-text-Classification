will acrylic paint stick to my t shirt i dont think its cotton its a stretchy material but theres no tag it fits loosely on my body i have to make a goofy t shirt and i dont have time to buy t shirt paint o acrylic works great on cotton or non stretchy fabrics the thing with that stretchy fabric is that after the paint dries and the fabric stretches the design will break where the stretch is occurring i hope you get what i m saying i don't know if i explained it correctly but that's why it will work on cotton because there's almost no stretch involved so the paint stays also if the shirt is going to be washed is very likely that some parts will come off or crack i know you said you don't have time but your best bet is the fabric paint unless the t shirt is going to be worn just the one time and not be too stretched i hope this helps you out take care Knitting Textile manufacturing terminology Textile manufacturing Upholstery Plastic Mattress Casting Fecal incontinence Shirt Menstrual cup Acrylic paint Paint Ironing Manicure Diaper Kilt Weaving Linen Leather Clothing Poker jargon Tallit Denim Rope Yarn Brassiere Gesso Cloth Kimono Paper marbling Textile Jute Tire Parachute Violin Screen-printing Polystyrene Tennis shirt Magical thinking Sword making Craps Aloha shirt Diving suit Mario Canvas Washing machine Painting Welding David Beckham Polymethyl methacrylate Skirt and dress Rugby union positions Brush Pastel Hakama Fabrication (metal) Investigation into the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 Beachwear M1 Helmet Dry cleaning T-shirt Lacquer Football (soccer) Comanche Bong Stucco Necktie Sexual fetishism Condom Rubber stamp Cotton Hypothermia Singapore Police Force Deck (ship) Sock Strap-on dildo Printmaking Hat Heracles De Lorean DMC-12 Glove Camouflage Cochineal Dress shirt Bulletproof vest Gurkha Contingent Professional wrestling slang The Game (rapper) Aerial (dance move) Flax Stocking Wayne Corporation Animal Crossing Fan (implement) Nail (anatomy) Laser engraving Gambling Karategi
