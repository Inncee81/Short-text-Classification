getting information from my camcorder onto my computer i have a sony camcorder and i don't know how to get the stuff i filmed onto my computer you don't say if your camcorder is an older analog model or a newer digital one easiest first if it is digital you should have a cable which you can use to plug it into the computer perhaps via a usb port hopefully you would also have software that came with the camera or is already on your computer that will recognize the camera and save the videos to disk it may be as easy as a file transfer since they are already digital on the other hand if the camera is analog then you have to get a device that convert the analog signal into a digital one an analog to digital a d converter turtle beach makes one as does pinnacle and several other vendors you load the software on your computer then plug the camera into the converter and start the tape the a d box converts the signal to digital and the software receives this and saves it as a file you can then go into that video and edit it Universal Serial Bus Digital photography DVD FireWire Floppy disk IPod High-definition television Sound card USB flash drive 8 mm video format Secure Digital card VHS PlayStation Portable Digital video recorder Digital cinema Digital video DV Bluetooth Copy protection Xbox Digital camera Atari 8-bit family Commodore 64 PlayStation 2 Digital Modem Nintendo GameCube Warez Nintendo 64 Professional video camera Betacam Digital rights management Sony Apple Macintosh Walkman Hard disk ZX Spectrum Computer bus PlayStation 3 Computer Charge-coupled device Mouse (computing) Compact disc MiniDisc Audiophile Memory Stick Screenshot S-VHS Telephone Embedded system Videotape Computer forensics SCART AmigaOS IBM PC Digital circuit Trusted computing Digital signal processing Creative Zen Sega Dreamcast Xbox 360 S__CAM IBM PC compatible MOS Technology SID Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Amstrad CPC Atari ST Analog-to-digital converter Telephone exchange Camera Oscilloscope SonicStage Blu-ray Disc NTSC Digital audio player Device driver Analog signal Sharp Zaurus RGB color model CompactFlash Enterprise content management D-subminiature Windows Vista Computer hardware
