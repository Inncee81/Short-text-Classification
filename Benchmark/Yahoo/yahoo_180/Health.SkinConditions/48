i use opti free replenish to clean and store my soft contact lenses but seem to have a problem even though i am on prescription meds for eye allergies i am still getting mucusy sp strings and chunks in my eyes making wearing contacts almost impossible do you think it is the opti free replenish i think i want to try just cleaning them with a contact lens soap and rinse and store them with saline any suggestions could be that you are allergic to the chemicals in replenish i had an allergy to it and after i changed to another type the symptoms disappeared you can definately try using the daily cleaning regimen with your contacts to see if it helps remember even if the doctor recommended a certain brand of solution you can still try others they are your eyes after all even after trying different solutions it could be that your eyes are just really sensitive at this time of year and maybe you should use your glasses until your allergies clear one last thing to consider is that you may have an eye infection as mucousy matted eyes are a cardinal symptom of this a trip to the eye doctor can rule this out they have the capability to check for this right in the office hope this helps Contact lens Allergy Eczema Hay fever Tattoo Chronic fatigue syndrome Medical prescription Common cold Tuberculosis Glasses Keratoconus First aid Medicine Body piercing Diabetic retinopathy Psoriasis Paracetamol Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Homeopathy Mouth ulcer Sulfasalazine Insomnia Coeliac disease Stomach cancer Intraocular lens Breastfeeding Menstrual cup Multiple sclerosis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Herpes simplex virus Cat Urinary incontinence Migraine Colorectal cancer Eyeglass prescription Food allergy Hamster Cancer Latex allergy Pneumonia Fecal incontinence Sinusitis Malaria Eye Sento Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome AIDS reappraisal Jala neti Presbyopia Basophil granulocyte Charles Darwin's illness Acne Dishwasher Addiction Rabies Prostate cancer Parkinson's disease M__ni__re___s disease Al-Razi Hypersensitivity Textile manufacturing Sunglasses Clinical depression Clomipramine Nasal irrigation Lung cancer Caving Multiple myeloma LASIK Cannabis (drug) Protein Digital photography Hard water Nutrition Aspergillosis Optometry Dog Computer virus Ultraviolet Methylsulfonylmethane Hypoglycemia Mastocytosis Urticaria Gmail Breast cancer Violin Folic acid Vulvovaginal health Autism Immunoglobulin E Halitosis Candidiasis Bicycle lighting Alcoholics Anonymous Sleep apnea
