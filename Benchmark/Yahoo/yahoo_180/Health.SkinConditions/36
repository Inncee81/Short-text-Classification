what makes mosquito bites swell up and itch i've heard different theories that they inject a type of posion as they mosquitos suck blood i've also heard it's because we're allegric to the bite i don't know if any of those are true or if there's something else entirely mosquito bites swell and itch because the mosquito injects a tiny bit of venom when she bites it's always a female they use the blood for the incubation of eggs rather than to consume the venom is there as an anticoagulant so that the blood flow does stop and she can get all she needs unfortunately it also makes us itch and for some people who are sensitive there's quite a bit of swelling as well i suppose it could be considered an allergy but the amount is so tiny that it's not a life threatening one the greater hazard from mosquito bites is disease transmission of course thank heaven for deet Mosquito Allergy Spider Malaria Anopheles Tick Snake Tarantula First aid Venom (poison) Head louse Group A streptococcal infection Mast cell Tsetse fly Tuberculosis Jurassic Park Hay fever Eczema DDT Vampire Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Shark Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Heartworm Hematophagy Rattlesnake Diabetic retinopathy Chagas disease Leech DEET Black widow spider Biological pest control Itch Flea Conjunctivitis Myocardial infarction Snakebite (bite) Intravenous therapy West Nile virus Diabetic nephropathy Plasmodium Rocky Mountain spotted fever Cirrhosis Bedbug Traumatic brain injury Platypus Ebola Deep vein thrombosis Onchocerciasis Malignant melanoma Psoriasis Anticoagulant Antivenom Decibel Scabies Hypoglycemia Bladderwort Ultimate Spider-Man Marilyn Monroe Chronic fatigue syndrome Rebreather Hemorrhoid Sexually-transmitted infection Loa loa filariasis Bird Bubonic plague Emphysema 2005 dengue outbreak in Singapore Cocaine Yellow fever Blood Lassa fever AIDS Asthma Safe sex Bombing of Hamburg in World War II Coagulation Bone marrow transplant Food allergy Scorpion Reduviidae Functional magnetic resonance imaging Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma MP3 Blood donation Hemorrhagic stroke Thimerosal Sulfasalazine Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Treehouse of Horror V Frog Wuchereria bancrofti HIV test Volcano Red blood cell Blood transfusion Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Carpal tunnel syndrome
