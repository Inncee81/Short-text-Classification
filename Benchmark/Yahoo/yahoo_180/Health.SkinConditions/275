is anyone immune to ticks my dad and i have never had a tick my sisters and mother have them all the time dad thinks it's funny to put a tick in the crook of his arm and hold it there for a long time when he unbends his arm the tick always runs away it never sticks to him we live in a very rural area and ticks are very common so never having one is rare is there something in some people's skin that deters ticks other biting insects don't bother us much either ticks love me but i am immune to potion ivy though i can sit in it for hours and it does not bother me one time my cousin saw me sitting under a tree and told me that was poison ivy and asked how long i had been sitting there and i told him an hour and was there an hour the day before and the day before that so he thought maybe he was wrong and sat beside me he had to go to the hospital he got it so bad that was when i found out i was not allergic to it when my wife and i were first married she broke out and did not know where she was getting it she was real careful one day we were walking on the side walk that i walked everyday to catch the bus and i brushed a plant out of my way and noticed my wife was no longer beside me and i was holding the plant so she could pass and saw she was freaked out and she told me that was poison ivy and i just calmly said oh i forgot to tell you i am not allergic to it she then knew how she was getting it because i brushed it ot of the way twice a day and then when i got home i would touch her arms i did not mean to give it to her i just don't pay any attention to it since i am not allergic bb Milton H.
