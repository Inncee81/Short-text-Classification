wtf weird pimple i usually have pretty good skin but the other day i could feel a little sore spot on my face and after a while it turned into a bump that looks like a pimple but it hurts pretty bad when i touch it hurts way too much to pop plus it doesnt seem to have a head its taking so long to go away it hurts and i feel gross anybody know what these weird pimples are and how to make them go away i forgot to mention that they're harder than regular pimples even before they're visible i could feel it under my skin like a little hard ball it's just a deep pimple i recommend putting oxy on it at night and then during the day a little dab of cortisone cream whatever you do don't squeeze or mess with it while there's nothing on the surface Acne 1957 World Series Sandy Koufax Psoriasis The Adventures of Pete & Pete Mattress Atomic Kitten Table tennis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Social rule Volleyball Diving Strap-on dildo Aerial (dance move) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Equine conformation Jon Secada Fecal incontinence Thermoregulation Theory of conduct Cho Chang Blood on the Tracks Professional wrestling slang Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Eczema Cliff Richard Sydney Riot of 1879 Good Morning, Vietnam Laws of cricket The Legend of Zelda series enemies Shaggy dog story Van Halen Waxing Spidey Super Stories Time Out of Mind Tina Turner The Ashlee Simpson Show Kodocha "Weird Al" Yankovic Scabies Ron Weasley Piccolo Junior Saga Massage Marilyn Monroe Goose bumps Snooker Diving suit The Shining (film) USS Harder (SS-257) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Herpes simplex virus Cleveland Browns Professional wrestling holds Tag Nine Inch Nails Fast bowling Dean Koontz Leopard Mississippi John Hurt Skateboarding trick KROQ Top 106.7 Countdown of 1985 Futurama (TV series - season 5) Smallpox Pitaten Bodyline Norway national football team Team Fortress Classic Breastfeeding Breaststroke Pittsburgh Steelers First aid Keloid Boston Public Ben Johnson (athlete) Poker jargon Mango Textile manufacturing Major League Baseball television contracts Taekwondo True Crime: Streets of LA Scar Group A streptococcal infection The Beach Boys Kimi Finster Avril Lavigne Brian the Bachelor Off the Deep End Transactional analysis Softball Eric Clapton Donna Summer K' Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Avenue Q Happy Tree Friends Invader Zim Wolfrider The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Hey Jude
