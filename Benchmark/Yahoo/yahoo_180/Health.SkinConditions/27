mole question so i have this mark on my lower back that i always thought was a birth mark but now it has little hairs growing on it gross sorry does that mean that it is a mole if so can i get it removed you can never really see it unless i'm wear a bathing suit because it is so low i think it's kind of cute though so can i just shave off the hairs sorry about the grossness thanks since it has hairs growing on it it is probably a mole you can get it removed if you want to but you shouldn't b c it would be pointless and i guess you could shave off the hairs Beard Baldness Haircut Waxing Happy Tree Friends Depilation Kodocha Pubic hair Skinhead Mohawk hairstyle Shaving Tonsure Barber Paradox Physical attractiveness Leg shaving Professional wrestling match types Joker (comics) Hair Titanic (1997 film) Swimsuit Moustache Malignant melanoma Carnivorous plant Pseudofolliculitis barbae 613 mitzvot Baldness treatments Mammal Puberty Five Ks Friends Payot Drug test Wig (hair) Hasidic Judaism Inflation Blond Violin Tibetan people Theory of conduct Joe Namath Fur Law of value Guinea pig Double bass Kurt Angle Prostate cancer Headgear Ron and Fez Dog Springfield Elementary School Brave New World Marsupial mole Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Social role of hair The Inside Adrian Mole Androgen insensitivity syndrome Jesus Calvin and Hobbes History of subcultures in the 20th century Madalyn Murray O'Hair Bathing Singlish Old Believers Dreadlocks Nudity Elves (Elfquest) Shaggy dog story The Mole Vulva Hippie Concentration The Blue Lagoon (1980 film) The Red Green Show Mole (sauce) Tarantula Dil Pickles Spontaneous human combustion KaBlam!
