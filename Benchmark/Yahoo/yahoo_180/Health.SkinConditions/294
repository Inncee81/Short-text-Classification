my year old has a rash that comes and goes in minutes he has been unwell latley anyone else experience this he had one episode of vomitting on thusday and has had very little appetite since then which is not like him at all he's been drinking plenty he has develped a transient rash in the last h its basically there one minute and gone the next one minute he looks like he is covered in tiny hives and then they dissapear anybody with info would really be appreciated most rashes in that age group are due to viral infection in fact viruses are known for causing a rash in all age groups since he's had an episode of vomiting is off his feed and not himself this is most likely what ails your toddler most viruses run their course between one and two weeks and will vanish as mysteriously as it appeared as long as he isn't running a fever above f that will not come down with tylenol and is drinking plenty of fluids he will do fine he will probably not eat much and won't really be very sociable but after a few more days will start getting back to his usual self after a few days they begin to feel more like themselves although the rash may still come and go although it's frightening the viral infections usually aren't a major problem and they bounce back pretty well of course you can always have things checked out by your pediatrician for confirmation just don't be surprised when or if the peds tells you that yes it's a viral rash and no they don't know which one is causing it and no there's nothing you can do about it except wait for his body to kick virus tail end just offer favorite foods and plenty to drink try to keep him comfortable and running about in undies or the diaper is the usual prefered way for most kids with a rash it shouldn't really bother him much unless he gets hot or sweaty if he does happen to fuss about an itch a cool water bath with either baking soda or a handful of oatmeal will usually soothe that just trust your gut you'll know if he's really sick as long as it's just the rash and off his feed he'll be okay Diarrhea Breastfeeding Pneumonia Common cold Ebola Urticaria Group A streptococcal infection Hepatitis First aid Cirrhosis Foodborne illness Coeliac disease Stomach cancer Cytomegalovirus Smallpox Hepatitis C Infectious mononucleosis Marburg virus Roseola Fecal incontinence Virus Shaggy dog story Rocky Mountain spotted fever Chronic fatigue syndrome Social rule Hyperthermia Diseases of the honeybee The Shining (film) Jackass: The Movie Antiviral drug Treehouse of Horror V Hypoglycemia Dengue fever Mosquito Fancy rat Eczema Rotavirus Yellow fever Poliomyelitis Influenza Prostate cancer Spanish flu Measles Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Electrophysiology HIV Theory of conduct Computer virus Norwalk virus group Time Out of Mind Lassa fever Hay fever Marilyn Monroe Drowning Monkeypox Haven (TNG episode) Encephalitis Conjunctivitis Paracetamol Herpes simplex virus Dehydration Syphon Filter Gastroenteritis Rubella Vomiting HIV test AFI 100 Years series Sauna Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an H5N1 Have I Got News For You StarCraft Episode VI Ex-gay Charles Darwin's illness Infantilism Syphilis Rasheed Wallace Chickenpox Meme The Amazing Race Milton H.
