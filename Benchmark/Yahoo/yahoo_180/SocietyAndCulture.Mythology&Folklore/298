ancient greek god morals the greatest god during the time zeus from greece aka jupiter in rome married his sister hera had sexual liaisons with many others and did so when disguised as various animals swan bull horse did the ancient greek romans think incest cheating and beastiality were okay great question and the things they did certainly do seem shocking but we need to remember the context of the mythology incest although it's instinctual knowledge to us that incest is wrong genetics research was not quite up to speed in b c also the greeks explained away the incest of the gods by saying that deities were free from any genetic deficiencies we would still consider it to be socially awkward because the stigma is so strong in our culture but from a purely scientific standpoint there would be nothing wrong with marrying your brother or sister if there were no genetic ramifications that being said no thank you very much their cheating hearts the men sure did get around in olympus and so did the women although not as much of course we can chalk this up to the same phenomenon that makes us love james bond even though he's such a cad the men behind the myths were not so very different from the men we know and mostly love today but without some of that social veneer that keeps their shirts tucked into their levis then as now they write their heroes doing all the things that they can't get away with themselves kill blow things up and have sex with lots of different people that's an oversimpification but if you strip away all the bravado of our hollywood action movies you'll see the same kernel of desires and extremities of human nature that fascinated the ancient greeks how different are the worst of our serial murder movies think seven with brad pitt and kevin spacey or kill bill and any other quentin tarantino movie for that matter from stories of cronos castrating his father and then swallowing his children okay this is a bit disturbing beastiality these stories were also allegorical when the gods sleep with 'animals' they are usually deities or humans who have been transformed into animals zeus turned himself into a swan for leda and a bull for europa but he was not actually either of those animals in an era when man was not as separated from nature as we are now animals held much more symbolic and important roles that doesn't mean they were actually sleeping with them well some might have been the answer to your question isn't black and white by modern standards and maybe by ancient greek standards some of their heroes were not good role models but they weren't necessarily supposed to be storytelling is not necessarily meant to reflect reality or always to serve a moral message sometimes it tests the limits of possibility and it helps us understand our humanity better by experimenting on paper with what's beyond it so let your moral qualms go and enjoy the mythology Zoophilia Zeus Origin belief Hera Human Mythology Aphrodite Greek mythology Sexual orientation Abortion debate Trojan War Dionysus History of sex Heracles Religion Human sexual behavior Homosexuality Artemis Falsifiability Religion and sexual orientation Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Marriage Science Apollo Tamriel God Reincarnation Bisexuality Goodness and value theory Hecate Iliad Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Infantilism El (god) Human nature Art in Ancient Greece Bernard Williams Roman mythology Meaning of life New Testament Sociocultural evolution Creationism Poseidon Gaia (mythology) Supernatural Simone Weil Animism Theory of conduct Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Ethics Themes in Blade Runner Horus Pedophilia Socrates Evil Pederasty Postmodernism Western philosophy David Hume Bull (mythology) Ganymede Castor and Pollux Theology Same-sex marriage Storytelling Alignment (role-playing games) Philosophy Intelligent design Determinism Europe Ontological argument Quentin Tarantino Nicomachean Ethics Predestination Joseph Campbell Rape Narcissism Sin City Philosophy of mathematics God Emperor of Dune Atheism Separation of church and state Creation-evolution controversy Cronus Cultural relativism Rhea (mythology) Incarnations of Immortality Trinity Moses
