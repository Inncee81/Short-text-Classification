got any decent ghost stories or experiences to share i shared a bed student flat in newcastle with my girlfriend at the time we used the second bedroom as a spare and there were some weird things going on there the bathroom light would switch on all by itself now this is odd but it would do it specifically when certain people walked passed not always and it did depend on who walked passed it usually happened to me and a couple of our friends i had a cat who frequently refused to enter the spare room he would spit and growl at the doorway i was once walking through the flat and 'saw' who i thought was my girlfriend in the kitchen i continued into the spare room to see my girlfriend in there working i went back to see who was in the kitchen and it was empty one morning my girlfriend was working in the spare room and i was in the front room and i heard her scream she ran passed me claiming the chair she was sitting on had moved on its own as i headed to that room banging started in that room the cat ran towards the kitchen hissing and spitting and i followed the banging through the flat to the front door one night we had been out and were met by neighbours who complained about the noise coming from our flat when i pointed out we had been out they claimed we must have left a cd on or something we let him enter the flat to check he went straight to the spare room and complained that's where the sound was coming from there was no cd player in there just a pc which had no sound card or speakers to play music and it was switchedoff he left very confused later that same night we were asleep in bed when the lights in the bathroom bedroom and passage all came on at once along with my radio then the banging started again and went through the house to the front door and that was the last time it happened apart from the bathroom light switching on and off all the time all of this is true and did happen it happened between in heaton newcastle i am fairly open minded but before this happened was a complete sceptic i always try and find a scientific answer to everything but for that sequence of events i am at a complete loss i have a degree in physics so do not generally get carried away with stories of ghosts and ghouls if anyone can enlighten me as to how this all occurred can you let me know Shaggy dog story The Shining (film) Out-of-body experience The Time Machine Blood Simple Richard Chase Eastern Illinois University Columbine High School massacre The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Kitchen Friends Aliens of London RuneScape quests Social rule The Brady Bunch Miss Saigon Silent Night, Deadly Night Sin City Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Star Wars Holiday Special Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Milton H.
