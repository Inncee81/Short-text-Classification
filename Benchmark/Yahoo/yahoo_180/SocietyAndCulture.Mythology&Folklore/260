this question may sound strange but does yahoo erase your website before posting just curious i am an intuitive psychic reader and once in a while offer a free reading about once every two months or so but i have the feeling that yahoo feels that this is soliciting and take my website off even though other websites are allowed to stay up the reason that i put my website address up is because i want people to know what i am all about and that i am legitimate not because i want them to purchase something i am offering this service for free at the time of my posting thank you if you are really worried about it you should give out your website address without having a hyperlink E-mail spam United States Postal Service Anonymity Website Spam (electronic) Parapsychology MAME Theory of conduct America Online Yahoo!
