paranormal question something may be trying to take my life when i sleep i sometimes feal a real negative force around me late at night at around midnight but more like twards in the morning anyone that can give me some helpful advice on how i can take care of this where i can enjoy my life more and have my mind on better goal orented things in my life i would greatly appreciate it again this is bothering me just give me some helpful advice thanks alot i agree with tasha however just because you feel a presence does not mean its a negative force our conscious mind tells us that if we do not know what something is it is probably bad between midnight and am most people in your time zone and surrounding are asleep so the mental plane is quieter allowing the spiritual to connect easier there are not as many distractions involving conscious thinking since this is happening during these times i would say you definitely have a spirit of some sort around you it's a posititve thing that you can pick up on this if it scares you do what tasha said burn some sage not just in the room you sleep but the entire house as well get a cross pendant wall cross whatever and put it in the room you sleep the point at which the two lines meet in the center creates a circle of white light invisible to the human eye but the spiritual can see this ask them to go to the light and leave you alone i don't feel this is a negative energy just unknown to you but i would like to mention that you having the ability to feel this is incredible not many people are that aware nowadays good luck Out-of-body experience Scientology beliefs and practices Social rule Theory of conduct Milton H.
