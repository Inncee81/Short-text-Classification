queen mary ghosts i just heard the queen mary is up for sale foreign countries are bidding on it if the queen mary is sold and towed away or to be broken down into scrap metal where will all the ghosts go i heard one guy say there are over ghosts on the ship that's alot of homeless ghosts will they stay in long beach or retire to florida i work in the spa on the queen mary yes there's some real ghostly activities there almost every day i'm there something happens movement in the empty room next to me just a few days ago i was the last one in the spa and i was cleaning up when i heard i went to investigate and there was nobody there as soon as i turned my back to walk out some bottles started rattling around on the shelf across the room needless to say i hightailed it out of there really fast as for it being towed away i doubt it most of what i'm hearing is that companies are trying to find a way to make the ship turn a profit again it needs to be refurbished really bad and there needs to be more vibrant businesses down there to draw visitors i'm not sure where the ghosts would go if the ship were to be dismanteled but i would sincerely hope they find some peace at last The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Ghost Eastern Illinois University Phoebe Halliwell The Great Louse Detective USS Trigger (SS-237) Futurama (TV series - season 2) The Death Gate Cycle Garth Brooks The Amber Spyglass The Empty Child The Doctor Dances Colony in Space EastEnders USS Walke (DD-723) Social rule Captain Thunderbolt Walt Disney World Resort Leamington Spa USS Stephen Potter (DD-538) USS Uhlmann (DD-687) Prank flash Donald Trump USS Anderson (DD-411) Mattress The Haunted Mansion Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas StarCraft: Uprising Mary I of Scotland Hampton Court Palace Charles Ponzi SS Andrea Doria Coming of Age (TNG episode) Make money fast Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Oil-for-Food Programme Swingout USS Topeka (CL-67) USS Whale (SS-239) The Dalek Invasion of Earth Royal Dutch Shell Queen (band) Knots Landing Futurama (TV series - season 5) The Caves of Androzani Mutual fund Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an I Want to Hold Your Hand The Phantom Manor Rum-running Aliens of London Miss Saigon Datalore (TNG episode) Shaggy dog story Holy Spirit Robert Walpole The Shining (film) Conker's Bad Fur Day USS Liberty incident The Haunted Mansion (film) Imperialism in Asia Manhunt (video game) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex Landing at Anzac Cove Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Manic Street Preachers Scenes from a Memory President of Ireland Sicilian Expedition USS Zane (DD-337) USS Oregon (BB-3) HMS Warspite (1913) Abraham Simpson Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 United Artists God Save the Queen BC Rail Roxette Big Brother UK series 6 The Battle (TNG episode) Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones Hollywood, Los Angeles, California I, the Jury PANICS Sydney Riot of 1879 Radio Newyork International Foreign exchange market StarCraft Secret Missions Alanis Morissette The Ark in Space Steamboat SS Morro Castle Naval mine Paramount Pictures HMS Electra (H27) USS Thatcher (DD-514) Sampling (music)
