is there any mermaid what is the most fascinating mermaid movie apart from spalsh aquamarine mermaid lagoon mermaids are very real and they have existed since time millennium and after some recent research i have found out that the cave men have crude drawing of them on their cave walls and it also show the cave man throwing spears sticks and rocks at them from high places i have also went to the freedom of information from our u s government and what got back from them was almost all blacked out and after talking to a friend of mine that does research for the u s government for almost two hours and having certain transcripts faxed to me has proven beyond all doubts that mermaids are real and our government has know about them for over years and i also agree with their reasons for not introducing that fact to the people and why other governments are doing the same and the last time a real mermaid was captured and turned over to their government was less then two months ago as for me i have always had a little doubt about their existence and what i have really read recently has now removed all doubts The Little Mermaid (film) The Little Mermaid The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Weekly World News Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch Bob and George The Amber Spyglass Kingdom Hearts II Carlsbad Caverns National Park The Caves of Androzani Peter Pan Killian documents Winona Ryder Mermaid Denzel Q.
