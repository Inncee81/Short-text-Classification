how rice cookers know when to stop how simple rice cookers ones with no electronics know when to stop cooking my cooker does a pretty good job and i suspect it is by weight because when it has no water no cover the on off button jumps back to off however if it is really based on weight then how can it know if i have a little rice with water or a lot of rice and no water i am of course talking about an electrical rice cooker it does not build any steam pressure so this is not he answer during cooking the rice water mixture is heated at full power the full power temperature cannot go above the boiling point of water f c as any heat put into the rice water mixture at that point will only cause the water to boil at the end of cooking some of the water will have been absorbed by the rice and the rest is boiled off once the heating continues past this point the temperature exceeds the boiling point the thermostat then trips switching the rice cooker to low power warming mode Rice cooker Slow cooker Thermostat Brewery Pressure cooking Solar power Rice Water (molecule) Idli Heat Boiling Steam engine Boiling point Ocean thermal energy conversion Carburetor Nuclear power Hydrogen Hydrogen economy Kitchen Phase (matter) Microwave oven Explosive material Alkane Diode Thermal power station Water vapor Temperature Bread Barbecue Spark plug Stove Helium Tofu Pebble bed reactor Ramen Plutonium Internal combustion engine Diesel engine Stirling engine Japanese cuisine Geyser Food preservation Portable stove Heinkel He 100 Fossil fuel power plant Chopsticks Soldering Glossary of firefighting terms Cuisine of Brazil Carbon dioxide Power station Energy development Gas absorption refrigerator Solar box cooker Fire fighting Alternative biochemistry Refrigerator Rice congee Transistor Autoclave Cajun cuisine Degree Celsius Welding Distillation Ice cream Avalanche Phase change heat pump Superconductivity Furnace Personal rapid transit Coffee percolator Bengali cuisine Fractional distillation Acetic acid Aluminium Internal ballistics Battery (electricity) Uranium Titanium Turbocharger Coal Water Water purification MOSFET E85 Steaming Ironing Dumpling HVAC Fluorescent lamp Rail terminology Turbojet
