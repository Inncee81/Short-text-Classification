how do you know when the employer will hire for the position you applied for when they are interviewing others usually the employer can't hire a potential employee on the spot so they may tell you that there are more interviews even if there aren't they may be doing a background check if they didn't have an opportunity to do one before your interview or they may be waiting for more applicants before making the crucial decision the best advice i can give is wait hours then make a courtesy call to the company and thank them for the opportunity and tell them that you really want the job and are excited about the opportunity it's worked for me out of interviews the only one it did no good on was a government job good luck Social rule Unemployment Job interview Background check Affirmative action Opportunity cost Walt Disney World College Program Employment agency Intern Call centre Corporate governance Time Out of Mind Wal-Mart Steve Jobs Voice-tracking Poker jargon Karl Rove New York Giants Employment Outsourcing The Price Is Right Inflation Interview Unemployment benefit The Apprentice 2 Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Corporate finance History of economic thought Rosa Parks Labour economics Workplace democracy Plame affair Employment discrimination Spidey Super Stories IBM Keynesian economics Receptionist Graduate school Stan Lee Unemployment types Minimum wage Drug test Scholarship Agent handling Sweatshop Mail-order bride Trade union Management Harry Bridges Taxicab Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Professor Efficiency wages Governor-General of Australia Violin Freeters President (game) Union shop Blackjack $ale of the Century World Wide Web Joseph Louis Lagrange Internet fraud Commonwealth of Nations Inheritance (computer science) Reggie Jackson One Tree Hill (TV series) Counterexample ITV Modelling agency Expert system Parable of the broken window Economic inequality Mahjong Immigration to the United States Business ethics In-N-Out Burger Royal Assent Burke and Wills expedition Larry King Star Wars live-action TV series Jeff Gannon Labor-power Dream Job (Season 1) Decision making Ethics Rental car Education in the People's Republic of China Tenure Dream Job (Season 2) College admissions Winning Streak 2004 U.S. election voting controversies, Ohio Toronto Raptors Sydney Riot of 1879 JET Programme Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v.
