pediatrician has refered my son to a pediatric cardiologist should i be worried my sons doctor heard a whoosh sound while listening to his heart he was born wit a murmur but dr says it is a different sound now than a murmur we go to the cardiologist monday and im scared you absolutely have every right to be worried and shame on your pediatrician for not explaining the problem to you regardless of whether they were sure or not usually a cardiologist referral is because your pediatrician is unsure if there is an issue and wants an expert in the field to confirm and diagnose this practice is very common and is the right thing to do most likely the sound he is reffering to is either a worsening of the murmur an aortic stenosis or some other congenital defect this really would depend on your child's age however you need to call your pediatrician and ask hime to explain what he she hear to you that is their job and they should tell you the truth demand it hope everything is alright Pediatrics Heart sounds Cardiology Aortic valve stenosis Noonan syndrome Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Medicine Turner syndrome Marfan syndrome Phimosis Aortic dissection Physician Aortic insufficiency History of intersex surgery Heart valve Stroke Heart Atrial septal defect Congenital disorder Congenital heart defect Blood pressure Folic acid Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Aortic valve Myocardial infarction Androgen insensitivity syndrome American Academy of Pediatrics Breastfeeding Patent ductus arteriosus Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Stuttering Truth Atherosclerosis Autism epidemic James Dobson Intersex surgery Congenital hypothyroidism Growth hormone treatment Hearing impairment Transposition of the Great Arteries Infantilism Cephalic disorder Philosophy of language A Canticle for Leibowitz Von Willebrand disease Hypertension 21 July 2005 London bombings Sound effect Jon Secada Reincarnation Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Medical analysis of circumcision Endocrinology Physical examination Social rule Thimerosal Urinary incontinence Shaggy dog story Boom Town (Doctor Who) Cardiology diagnostic tests and procedures Coronary catheterization Sudden infant death syndrome Hypoglycemia Plame affair Endocarditis Tocopherol Prostate cancer Ethics Mental retardation Church of Christ, Scientist Book of Isaiah Sickle-cell disease Sports medicine Autism Religious Society of Friends Cardiac stress test Adult attention-deficit disorder Science Controversies in autism Harald V of Norway Heyde's syndrome Aorta Amy Yasbeck Genetics Atkins Nutritional Approach Abdominal pain Philosophical skepticism Asperger syndrome Growth hormone deficiency Nurse Roswell UFO incident Ren__ Favaloro EastEnders Tonality Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Intravenous therapy Mitral stenosis Incest Ventricular septal defect
