can a corporation restrict your accounts after you have filed for bankruptcy with them having been a member of usaa for over years i am still restricted from banking with them for a bankruptcy i filed years ago the bankruptcy has been finalized since when i have tried to open any bank accounts with them they have demanded payment in full on the credit card account balance before they will open any kind of bank account with me also they demand payment in full on all of my insurance accounts before they will issue them while they allow a payment schedule from others they even quoted me a payment schedule on an insurance account recently before a representative noticed a restriction on my account i guess my question is can a finacial institution refuse to bank or give credit to someone who has filed bankruptcy with them in the past even years ago because of the debt balance from the bankruptcy thanks for anyone's help i don't have it in for usaa they have given me good rates and are a very responsive company ann pj that's a good point but i didn't know how much bankruptcy laws allowed for forgiveness of debt yes they can restrict you however a account that goes way back yrs ago should have been off your report a long time ago it is against the law to try to make you pay back a debt you owed after you filed bankrupt anyway bankruptcy stays on your report to years so maybe you need to check your credit report cause if it still shows you filed bankrupt they need to take it off usually if you owed money to a bank and you filed bankrupt they would clear that debt and start you from scratch that is what any other creditors do phone company gas company ect also bye law they suppose to have cleared the debt you owe maybe you need to talk to their bankruptcy department bankrupcy does not follow you to the grave it gives you a chance to rebuild yourself and people that have not been in that situation were they had to file don't understand i do cause i had to do it bankrupcy stays on your credit for to years not the rest of your life as far as creditors opening credit to you or maybe opening a account for you depends on the bank itself you have creditors that are willing to give you a second chance by extending credit to you then you have the others that are not willing to do it just shop around i filed bankrupt mos ago and i was able to get a discover card with a credit limit that is good to me considering my credit was not all that great but they were willing to give me a second chance and you know discover is next to american express it depends on the lender Bankruptcy Bond Bank Credit card Government debt Debt Credit score Enron Corporation Student loan Social Security (United States) Annuity Mortgage Great Depression Deflation (economics) Money Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Gold standard Corporation Security (finance) Estoppel Bankruptcy in the United States Economy of Russia Tom DeLay Economy of the United States Bretton Woods system Monetary policy Legal tender Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Bank fraud United Kingdom corporation tax Finance Donald Trump Mutual fund Cheque Taxation in the United States Wheel of Fortune Derivative (finance) Financial services Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Personal finance Economy of Pakistan Unemployment Lloyd's of London Fractional-reserve banking Internet fraud Federal National Mortgage Association Appeal Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code Hong Kong Monetary Authority Schabir Shaik Trial Capital accumulation Credit default swap Surveillance Economy of Nigeria Economy of India Microeconomics Primerica Financial Services Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Yield curve Insolvency Economy of Bolivia 401(k) Life insurance MCI Bolivia FairTax Money supply American Express Credit repair Economy of Argentina Credit union Fiat money History of the United States (1918-1945) Accountancy Social Credit Temasek Holdings Tax U.S. public debt Timeline of the Enron scandal Islamic banking Knots Landing Corporate governance Debt levels and flows Trust (Law) USA Apprenticeship Financial audit Air America-Gloria Wise loan controversy Certificate of deposit Bank of China (Hong Kong) Collateralized debt obligation
