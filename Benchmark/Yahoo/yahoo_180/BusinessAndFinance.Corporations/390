why do stores have so many check out lanes they never use dang it's so annoying i wouldn't mind waiting in a line so long to buy my goodies but the fact that stores like target build like check out lanes and never use more than like at a time is so stupid why do they go to the trouble of putting in the registers and the candy and all that stuff that goes a long with a check out and make like of them then never use them and they could use the space to put more product in explain well maybe the targets you've been to were like that but the one i worked at had lanes and they were constantly calling people over from other departments to make sure that there were never more than or customers waiting at a time it's difficult to allocate the personnel necessary to run all of them because it's difficult to predict how much business a store will do during the non holiday seasons so the amount of employees necessary to run all of them at once may not even be there at any given time employers hate paying people to stand in one spot doing nothing for more than minutes so they're always doing a tug of war with trying to pay as few employees as possible but still trying to keep customer satisfaction high CPU cache Bulk vending Best Buy Poker jargon Call centre Customer relationship management Married... with Children Gross domestic product Sears Holdings Corporation Internet fraud Wal-Mart Microeconomics RuneScape economy Neopets Time Out of Mind System/34 Compiler optimization The Amazing Race In-N-Out Burger Retailer 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, vote suppression CPU design Tesco Advertising Argos (retailer) Sinclair ZX81 Unemployment Strategic management Fry's Electronics Surveillance Seinfeld Social rule Dilbert Sam Walton GSM services Investment bank United States Postal Service Target Corporation RFID Apollo 8 Central processing unit Business performance management Mutual fund Economics Canadian Tire Domain Name System Taxicab Ashton-Tate Betting (poker) Neighbours Beavis and Butt-head Supermarket Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Blackjack RISC Loyalty business model Inflation C programming language George Costanza Keynesian economics Management information system Publicly funded medicine FairTax Windows XP Health insurance Flat tax Futurama (TV series - season 5) Make money fast USS Whale (SS-239) Mergers and acquisitions Bank Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Economic calculation problem Capitalism Electronic commerce USS Seadragon (SS-194) Public transport Computer virus Good Times Motorola 68000 Common criticisms of Microsoft System/36 Expert system 2005 World Series Sin City Labour economics Self Portrait Variable Publishing Traumatic brain injury Squidward Tentacles Bike lane debate New Coke Jeff Gannon Transportation of Los Angeles Freeters Objective-C American football strategy Apple Computer ISO 9000
