what is better ps or xbox based on graphics gamplay games and for the long run i need to no before tomorro well it all depends on what type of gamer you are right now i have a ps and i loooove it both are good though but i think the ps is the bigger bang for your buck here is my recommendation if you want a multimedia console that has online gaming movie downloads etc overall focus on intense gaming like mature and teen games and great exclusives ex gears of war halo tenchu z etc then get the xbox some xbox s have hardware problems my friend is on his rd xbox red rings of death which he bought his first one at launch but also my one friend who recieved his last christmas hasn't had any problems microsoft now gives a year warrenty so just incase it does happen your going to be protected for a while if you want a multimedia console that has freee online is well balanced with all types of games good exclusives as well heavenly sword lair ninja gaiden sigma little big planet resistance etc and many other features like web browsing and ps home then get the ps ps doesnt have rumble in the controllers though which is one part i hate about it around christmas rumble controllers will be released though i like the ps because it comes with wifi blue ray gb and rechargeable controllers also if you wanted this same amount of power except for more gigs on your xbox elite it would cost around total for the wifi hd player year of xbox live charge kit this would save you around bucks ps price estimated cost around with hdmi chord plus microsoft only allows the to be compatible with microsoft equipment ex hardrive and headset so if you like wanted to upgrade you ps or buy a mic you could go to ebay and find one really cheap i found a mic for bucks and have found gb hardrives on ebay for around bucks still making it cheaper than the but then again you might not use these extras so you might wanna go for the wii or xbox since of the price difference many people also compare the ps to the xbox and say that the xbox is better based on present facts duhh the has been out a year longer than the ps the ps hasn't even been out for very long to release all these great games and present all of its great features by christmas the ps will have great games along ps home and xbox will only have the overated halo dont get me wrong halo is a great series but it is just overated again like i said it all revolves around what you like and what you can afford if you can afford anyone of the consoles and like anything then i would go for the ps ps also all these next gen systems will be good in the long run they will last for around years so saving up for the ps is the wisest choice the ps will get tons of exclusives by christmas lair warhawk heavenly sword ratchet and clank future tools of destruction the getaway white knight story afrika tekken etc and many of these exclusives are new unlike previous exclusives like the metal gear solid series Halo: Combat Evolved Computer and video games Xbox Live Halo 2 Halo (video game series) Wipeout (game) Nintendo GameCube Dead or Alive (video game) Nintendo Revolution Sega Dreamcast Nintendo Video game music First-person shooter PlayStation Portable Counter-Strike Machinima ATI Technologies IBM PC compatible Ninja Gaiden Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Final Fantasy XI Microsoft Sega History of video games (Sixth generation era) Gradius Console wars History of computer and video games Sega Saturn Microsoft Windows TurboGrafx 16 Windows XP Need for Speed Apple Macintosh Game controller Timeline of computing 1990-forward MMORPG Atari 8-bit family Lightsaber Modchip Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Marathon (computer game) Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Phantasy Star Online The Sims Game Boy Advance Nintendo 64 Final Fantasy Windows 2000 Mouse (computing) Game Critics Awards Super Robot Wars DVD MAME FIFA Series Radeon Sega 32X Resident Evil Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Sonic the Hedgehog Intellivision History of Microsoft Windows NVIDIA Pump It Up Universal Serial Bus Handheld game console Grand Theft Auto III IPod Game programming Nintendo Entertainment System DirectX Atari ST Voice over IP PowerPC Yu Suzuki Blue screen of death Ninja Mac OS X Madden NFL Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake Nintendo Power Star Wars: Galaxies Thunder Force MechAssault Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield Electronic Arts History of video games (32-bit / 64-bit era) Laserdisc
