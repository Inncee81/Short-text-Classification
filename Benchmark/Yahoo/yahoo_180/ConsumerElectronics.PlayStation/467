sega is king poor sega it was once king of the playground with its legendary genesis but then came the saturn and failed then the dreamcast fought but but was destroyed by the ps until it eventually became a software company not a hardware a software its a very sad time for sega they're even making a game with nintendo they're old rival before the end of the year with nintendo characters and sega characters just to survive my question is this do you think sega will somehow find the revenue arise from the flames look at microsoft sony and nintendo's face and fight back with a new console or will it survive for a few more years until it eventually dies also would you like to see a new console from sega if they got the revenue sega won't come back technology changes daily sega hasn't done hardware in so long they won't know what the hell happened while they were gone sega is now a software company becoming a hardware company again would be more expensive than they could ever handle what people should question is if one of the big three were to fall what company would replace them i think microsoft might be pushed back out of hardware after their got a failure rate and after ipod shunned zune out of the market microsoft might stop with the hardware Sega Nintendo Sega Dreamcast NVIDIA Sega Saturn Computer and video games Console wars Sega 32X Nintendo Entertainment System Nintendo Revolution Nintendo 64 Sega CD Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis History of video games (16-bit era) History of video games (Sixth generation era) Sega Master System TurboGrafx 16 Video game crash of 1983 Spider-Man (games) Resident Evil Code: Veronica Virtua Fighter Super Nintendo Entertainment System Video game music Handheld game console SNK Playmore Mortal Kombat PlayStation 3 History of video games (32-bit / 64-bit era) PlayStation 2 Rare (video game company) Resident Evil Atari Jaguar Ecco the Dolphin Resident Evil (video game) Microsoft Console emulator Yu Suzuki Video game console Atari N-Gage Console manufacturer Platform game Nintendo Entertainment System hardware clone Sega Game Gear Tetris IBM PC compatible Nintendo DS Sonic the Hedgehog series Home computer Sony Computer Entertainment GameFAQs Sonic Adventure King of Fighters Analog stick Sonic the Hedgehog Action Replay Video game publisher 3dfx Console game Sakura Wars Golden Age of Arcade Games FIFA Series Resident Evil 2 Handheld video game Apple Computer Streets of Rage Road Rash Modchip Doom Commodore C64 Games System IPod Atari 8-bit family Game Boy Advance Street Fighter EA Sports Double Dragon Lunar series Bish__jo game Acclaim Entertainment Bubble Bobble Versions and ports of Doom Quake Nintendo Virtual Boy Linux kernel Commodore 64 ROM image Jeopardy!
