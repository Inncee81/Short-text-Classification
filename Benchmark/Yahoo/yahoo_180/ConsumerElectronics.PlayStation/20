do i need a chill station for my playstation i just bought a playstation and i never really used it for a very long time i have a lot of things to do can the playstation overheat do i need a cooling system for my playstation do i need a charging station for my controllers as well technically it can overheat but mine never has and i have left it on for a week straight running folding home and tehre are many people who have run f h when they're not playing games when it was availible if your ps overheats then odds are that you got one of the of all ps s that are defective whcih is really unlucky and should not be a problem to return it but odds ar that this is not the case so no you do not need a cooling system for your ps but if you are paranoid then i would reccomend the pelican one as having its own power supply prevents running the risk of chocking the power supply for the ps as was the problem of cooling systems for the as the ps only uses watts from its watt power supply during normal operation this should not be a problem anyways but a little extra protection can't hurt PlayStation 2 Armored Core Overclocking Nuclear reactor PlayStation 3 Gas metal arc welding Super Nintendo Entertainment System Thermostat Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis PlayStation Portable Poker jargon Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Betting (poker) Engine cooling Transformer Thermal power station Electronic amplifier Sega Saturn Sega R-Type Electric power transmission Star Wars: Battlefront Galileo spacecraft Effective radiated power Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Gas tungsten arc welding Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Hydropower Xbox 360 Pump It Up Ford Ranger EV Wind power USB flash drive Traffic light Newcomen steam engine Laptop Thermal resistance Nuclear power USS Thompson (DD-627) Stroke 2003 North America blackout Norway national football team Digital rights management Psoriasis Xbox Ocean thermal energy conversion Cray-1 CANDU reactor Loudspeaker Spacecraft propulsion Air conditioning Three Mile Island Solar power Regional lockout Atari 8-bit family Water resources Environmental concerns with electricity generation Welding Amateur radio Hard disk Renewable energy Game programming Celtic F.C.
