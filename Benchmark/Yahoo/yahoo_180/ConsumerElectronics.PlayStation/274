what sould i get a ps x box d s or a game cube help help find what i should get and like on game of the thing you picked from my things it really depends on the kinds of games you enjoy and the amount of money you can spend a gamecube is cheap cheap cheap and has pretty much been totally phased out of the nintendo lineup i'd get a wii before i got a gamecube a ds is fun and obviously portable with games that are not necessarily going to be action packed ie no halo or resistance but if you like strategy games and rpgs then a ds might be a good choice xbox is great good graphics and fun games with major titles coming out for it however i've had friends get one and then have it break on them they had to send it in to microsoft to have it fixed and waited for months for it to get back ps hasn't had those defects at least not to my knowledge the friends of mine who have it are in love with it you can download games on it just like a wii and and you can play online against other players just like just like the other two a ps is backwards compatible allowing you to play both ps and ps games this system has a ton of mature games with lots of blood and killing as does both and ps have great games like elder scrolls iv oblivion and will have other ones like assassin's creed resistance fall of man for ps is great halo should be incredible for for my money one of these two systems is where it's at both are graphical powerhouses both offer internet gaming and both have great games ps has a few more features it seems like for instance the sixaxis controller which is similar to the wii's controller in that it responds to your hand movements but the whole system costs an arm and a leg xbox plays hd dvds while ps plays bluray discs both of which are much crisper and better looking formats than a standard dvd of course you'll need an hdtv in order for these formats to fully reach their potentials and there in lies the problem one thing leads to the next with these systems you buy the system then you need to buy a new expensive tv to get the graphics to look their best and then you need to get a digital surround sound system in order to get the full effect of the sound cards on these systems so you wind up spending something like for these things i mean you can always stick with an older tv and no sound system and the games will still look great they just won't be at their best i don't know i sure wouldn't want a ds or a gamecube good luck with the decision it's an expensive one Nintendo GameCube Xbox 360 Nintendo PlayStation 3 Computer and video games PlayStation 2 Computer role-playing game PlayStation Portable Sega Dreamcast Counter-Strike Video game music IBM PC compatible Sega Halo: Combat Evolved Game Boy First-person shooter Console game Console wars Xbox Live Game programming Laserdisc History of computer and video games Game programmer MMORPG Nintendo DS Halo 2 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Windows XP ATI Technologies Atari 8-bit family Karaoke Sega Saturn The Sims Star Trek Customizable Card Game Super Nintendo Entertainment System Poker jargon Floppy disk Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Spider-Man (games) Nine Inch Nails Nintendo Entertainment System RuneScape Game Boy Advance Windows Vista Computer and video game genres Final Fantasy Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game Amstrad CPC The Sims 2 TurboGrafx 16 Seventh Sea (collectible card game) History of video games (Sixth generation era) MP3 Modchip Pok__mon (video games) Video game controversy Computer Resident Evil (video game) Gradius Microeconomics Final Fantasy XI Wheel of Fortune Phantasy Star Online Pok__mon Ruby and Sapphire Animal Crossing Neopets Monopoly (game) Computer and video game packaging $ale of the Century Pretty Good Privacy Universal Serial Bus Microsoft Grand Theft Auto III Commodore 64 Gramophone record Blu-ray Disc Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Mortal Kombat Resident Evil Theory of conduct Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles Mouse (computing) ZX Spectrum Advanced Squad Leader Baseball Contract bridge VHS Regional lockout Pornography Sony Computer Entertainment Copy protection
