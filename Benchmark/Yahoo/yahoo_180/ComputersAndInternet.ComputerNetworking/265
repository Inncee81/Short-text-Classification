how do i find my port number i trying to download a torrent but i want it fast so i need to find my port number on my computer that connects to my router i have a belkin soo any ideas you're very confused i will try to explain every computer that is connected to a network has thousands of ports when a program communicates over the network it uses a port every packet of data sent over a network contains a port number aswell as the address of the computer the purpose of a port number is simply so your computer knows which program the piece of data belongs to now it's important to understand that it is your router that is connected to the big internet network you computer is connected to the router through a smaller network and only to the internet through the router well making outgoing connections onto the internet like requesting a website over http is no problem the router just sends the request on out the internet incoming connections situations where your computer is the host or torrent seed however can be a problem because the router needs to know which local computer the connection is going to what i mean is computers out on the internet only see your router connected to the internet and are trying to request data directly from it the router needs to know where to send the request through to ok you need to set your router so that the used port number s redirect to your computer's address it's local ip the easiest way is to set your computer to the dmz demilitarized zone on the router which defaults every port through to your computer remember to unset the dmz after you're done though you don't want to be there all the time Network address translation Internet Group Management Protocol Netfilter/iptables Internet protocol suite Denial-of-service attack AppleTalk Transmission Control Protocol Firewall (networking) BitTorrent Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol IPv4 Domain Name System Common Unix Printing System Wi-Fi Computer Routing Peer-to-peer Uniform Resource Locator Voice over IP Telnet HyperText Transfer Protocol Ethernet Web crawler Universal Serial Bus Internet Control Message Protocol Novell NetWare Communications protocol MDAC HTTP cookie Differentiated services Streaming media Proxy server Modem Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol Email authentication History of the Internet Computer virus Freenet IPv6 X Window System Skype E-mail Whois Bluetooth IP address Tor (anonymity network) Internet Spyware Windows XP Pretty Good Privacy Telegraphy E-mail spam Stateful firewall Internet privacy Open Shortest Path First HyperTransport OSI model File Transfer Protocol Port (computing) FidoNet Network switch Transport layer Embedded system Content-addressable memory Gnutella I2P Request for Comments General Packet Radio Service Internet Protocol Password Packet switching Perl Computer network Ping Cross site scripting World Wide Web GPRS Core Network Network congestion avoidance Border Gateway Protocol CPU design Demilitarized zone Kernel (computer science) PlayStation 3 Quality of service Lag Onion Routing Berkeley sockets Redundant array of independent disks National Weather Service Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Integrated services
