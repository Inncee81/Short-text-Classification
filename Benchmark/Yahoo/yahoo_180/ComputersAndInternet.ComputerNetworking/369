full home ethernet networking my house has built in ethernet wiring with jacks in every room each of these long wires end up connected to a dual speed stackable hub in my basement currently i have dsl and i have a router connected to my dsl modem in a bedroom i use one of the four out jacks on my router to plug into the room jack downstairs the hub recognizes this wire as the link and now i can pull a wired internet connection in any room so questions if i were to pull an internet connection in rooms simultaneously will this slow down the internet if i were to move the modem router to the basement and insert an ethernet cable into one of the out s on the router and the other end into the hub will this work again will speed be compromised thanks for the input guys i'll let this forum on for a few more hours at least to let more responses in the main point was this i need wired connections for some equipment i run and i can't connect wireless to it additionally do you all think i can buy a switch and seamlessly replace the hub with it i am also going to get verizon fios and they provide a gateway so gone is the issue of having a dsl line in the basement there are a couple of issues here a bandwidth you get a certain amount of bandwidth from your dsl provider if all of the active connections take up more than the available bandwidth you will notice slowdowns b hub or switch there is a difference between using a hub and using a switch a mb hub with connections will split the mb into a mb switch with connections will try to provide mb for each port if you are using a true hub then you may notice slow downs however the sneaky marketing people have been selling switches labeled as hubs there are a few responses that talk about wireless ethernet it is an option but make sure you understand the security implications before jumping on the wireless bandwagon also there is a difference between mbps ethernet connections and mbps wireless g again it depends on your situation to answer your question probably not as along as the total bandwidth is below what the dsl company gives you yes if you move the dsl connection to basement Modem Broadband Internet access Router Cisco Systems Universal Serial Bus Cable television WiMAX Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line Power line communication Internet service provider Xbox Voice over IP Wi-Fi Wireless access point Telegraphy Bluetooth Integrated Services Digital Network Xbox 360 IP Multimedia Subsystem Internet protocol suite Musical Instrument Digital Interface TIA-568A/B HomePNA PlayStation 2 Federal Standard 1037C Broadband Laptop DOCSIS Cable modem Quality of service IMac AirPort Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing Differentiated services Denial-of-service attack Super Nintendo Entertainment System Local area network USB flash drive Floppy disk Nintendo DS Telephone Computer bus Oscilloscope General Packet Radio Service Embedded system Loudspeaker Acorn Computers Serial communications Nintendo Revolution Computer networking device Internet Group Management Protocol Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Television Transmission Control Protocol Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Routing Alcatel Token ring Network switch Commodore 64 Network address translation Computer network 3Com Corporation Electrical wiring Multiprotocol Label Switching DVD ALOHAnet Jack plug Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Antenna (radio) IPv6 Lag HyperTransport Verizon Wireless Windows XP Satellite internet IBook ITU-T Category 5 cable IPod Softswitch U.S. Robotics Netfilter/iptables Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Congestion control
