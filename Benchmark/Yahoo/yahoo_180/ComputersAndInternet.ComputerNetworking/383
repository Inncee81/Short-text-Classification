i can't configure my new router see details i have a linksys wrt g router i can't configure it its brand new after selecting the internet type dhcp it takes me to this other step where i have to enter a password and confirm it i put in a password and confirmed it and clicked next after it gets to it says cannot configure router i try doing it again and it keeps saying cannot configure router please help i've been trying to configure it for hours i presume you have configured your internet service using a pc directly connected to your modem if not you probably need to do this first as most isps requrire this check with your isp and get the internet service to work this way first now to the router use i am assuming that you are talking about the wan port configuration first you need to log into the router with the default user name and password usually they prompt you to change this password but you don't have to do that you should however change from the default password now to the wan port configuration if you have a dynamic public ip address from your isp not pppoe protocol which is point to point protocol over ethernet you should indicate that you have a dynamic public ip address you should notselect pppoe protocol unless you are told to do so by your isp pppoe requires you to submit a user name and password which was given to you for pppoe protocol by your isp if you do not have a pppoe user name and password from your isp you most likely have ip routing instead and you need to go back to the config of the router to make sure the router was not accidently configured for pppoe please do not confuse dhcp many do your isp can assign you a dynamic wan ip address and most do when you configure your wan port you configure for a dynamic wan ip address seldomly do routers call this a dhcp configuration because the isp has dhcp configuration but the router wan port does not it has to be configured for a dynamic wan ip now for the lan private side ip this is where you specify dhcp from router to lan devices this is commonly done in your type of application my initial guess is that you have accidently configured your wan ip for pppoe check that out also be sure to reboot the modem and router always reboot modem whenever you change from connecting to a pc vs connecting to a router Router Password Ethernet Point-to-Point Protocol Digital Subscriber Line Wi-Fi AppleTalk Network address translation Novell NetWare MAC address Domain Name System Denial-of-service attack E-mail spam Internet Group Management Protocol Universal Plug and Play Border Gateway Protocol Internet protocol suite Transmission Control Protocol Asynchronous Transfer Mode Netfilter/iptables Voice over IP Stopping e-mail abuse Email authentication Windows Server 2003 Internet service provider Virtual Network Computing Bluetooth Modem Cisco Systems Uniform Resource Locator Quality of service E-mail Windows XP IP Multimedia Subsystem Windows 2000 Federal Standard 1037C Broadband Internet access Password cracking Secure Shell Wireless LAN IPv6 Routing Telnet System/34 System/36 Local area network Virtual private network Buffer overflow Universal Serial Bus Preboot Execution Environment Web crawler Common Unix Printing System IEEE 802.11 GSM services File Transfer Protocol History of the Internet Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Satellite internet Mozilla Firefox X Window System Public-key cryptography User Datagram Protocol Session Initiation Protocol 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Private branch exchange Firewall (networking) Internet Relay Chat Musical Instrument Digital Interface RuneScape cheats Web hosting General Packet Radio Service AmigaOS MDAC Tor (anonymity network) Integrated Services Digital Network RS-232 Virtual LAN Danger Hiptop Zeroconf Kerberos (protocol) Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol Whois Sender Policy Framework PlayStation 2 Nintendo DS NSA encryption systems FidoNet Apple Open Collaboration Environment Multiprotocol Label Switching Telegraphy Simple Network Management Protocol PlayStation 3 Mouse (computing) X.25
