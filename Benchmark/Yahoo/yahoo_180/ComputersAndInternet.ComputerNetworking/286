what happened to my wireless internet connection and computer something weird happened to my computer and i'd like to know what it was i'm using a wireless router and adapter and was online earlier i know for a fact i didn t press anything but my computer just restarted itself by itself i know i didn t do anything so why did it do that i looked over at the router and the internet light had gone off that when my computer had restarted itself the little green wireless icon on the taskbar had disappeared and when i looked at the adapter it said i had no adapters i was confused because my adapter was still plugged in and nothing had been moved so what happened there i couldn t get online as it was saying i had no wireless adapter and no connection so i shut down my computer and switched off the router left it for a few minutes switched everything back on and it was working again since then i've had the signal strength going up and down all the time from low to excellent whereas before today all it was ever at was excellent and the speed which is normally mbps has gone up and down from as low as mbps i'm worried as to whether anyone has access to my pc or don t know if i am just over reacting could the weather be interfering with it in anyway or is it something more serious any ideas i am worried my internet access is no longer safe and cant understand why my computer restarted itself thanks jn i do have a password for it if i try and connect manually instead of letting the pc connect automatically then it asks me for the password so is this safe enough i really dont want neighbours stealing my internet also its a wpa setting so that is the safer option isnt it rather than wep i'm not good with computers i dont think the pc needs to be restored though because the actual router itself is connecting faster than it did before just couldnt understand why the signal was going so crazy archmagus micael now you mention it it could have been a power cut because the router must have switched off too when i turned around it was searching for the internet light again and it only does that when it's first switched on so i guess it would do that after a power cut too hmm wireless adaptors have a tendency to do funny things at times but not normally unless you frequently experience problems you mentioned the weather really nasty weather like fog in the house lol can affect it as can local electrical discharges etc lightning ofcourse that's a bit doubtful that it happened if you've been having bad weather what might have happened is that you had a split second power cut at your house which explains the restart of the computer and also depending on your wireless router the possible resetting of the router if you yourself are having troubles connecting to your system then it's highly unlikely that anyone else is hacking into your system most routers use passwords anyway and if you have one set up you'll be in no trouble sorry to be so vague with the answers but wireless problems exist in literally hundreds of different forms so it's really very hard to fix without specifics try to connect yourself to the router by ethernet cable some routers have to have a tickbox set not default to be able to be accessed wirelessly if still no luck just try resetting everything to do with the wireless connection on both the router and your system and start again Ethernet Modem Password Windows XP Universal Serial Bus Embedded system Mouse (computing) Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Bluetooth Wireless access point IEEE 802.11 PlayStation Portable Wireless LAN Nintendo Revolution Broadband Internet access Telegraphy System/36 Floppy disk Xbox Internet Group Management Protocol MAC address HyperTransport Cheating in Counter-Strike Nintendo DS AirPort PlayStation 2 Cisco Systems Digital Subscriber Line Router Password cracking Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Atari 8-bit family PowerPC Voice over IP Telephone exchange AppleTalk CPU cache Drill bit Diablo II Federal Standard 1037C Computer Piccolo Junior Saga PlayStation 3 Speed of light Wi-Fi Protected Access Phreaking Asynchronous Transfer Mode Copy protection Local area network Ecco the Dolphin Heinkel He 100 USB flash drive IPod Opera (web browser) Central processing unit RuneScape cheats Internet Laptop Electrophysiology Global Positioning System Theory of conduct History of the Internet Loudspeaker B-47 Stratojet Commodore 64 Mach kernel Nintendo GameCube Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Cable television Radar Web crawler Power line communication Social rule Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Computer security MP3 The Star Wars Holiday Special Xbox 360 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Danger Hiptop IEEE 802.11i GameFAQs Anchor Wardenclyffe Tower Communications satellite Musical Instrument Digital Interface Year 2000 problem Television Control-Alt-Delete ITU-T
