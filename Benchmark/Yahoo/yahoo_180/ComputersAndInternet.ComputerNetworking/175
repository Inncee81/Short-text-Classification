data transfer question i have an old computer with windows that can't load windows i was wondering if i can connect a null modem or laplink cable to connect from that computer to another computer to load the files because there are files that i would like to access but i can't because it won't load windows will a data transfer allow me to view the files on the other computer or is there some other way to do it both the computer that doesn't load windows and the one that i want to transfer data to run on windows and have mb of memory you have several options you can try booting up in safe mode you can get to that option by repeatedly hitting f when the machine boots up safe mode most likely will not allow you access to the internet or to other machines so you're only option will be to copy the data to a removeable drive usb key floppy disc external drive etc if it won't even allow you to get to safe mode then you can try to remove the hard drive buy an external hard drive chassis the computer store will know what you are talking about when you ask for it and then connect that chassis to a new computer via usb or firewire there is a third option slaving your old pc's hard drive but that is most likely more complicated than you want Floppy disk IPod Hard disk Universal Serial Bus Windows XP Atari 8-bit family Computer hardware Computer virus Commodore 64 Booting AmigaOS PlayStation 2 Computer forensics Secure Digital card Advanced Technology Attachment FireWire File Allocation Table Knoppix Blue screen of death USB mass storage device class Apple Macintosh Linux BIOS Acorn Electron Redundant array of independent disks Virtual memory Apple II family DOS Architecture of Windows 2000 ZX Spectrum Modchip Digital photography Desktop computer Computer FreeDOS Amstrad CPC Btrieve TRS-80 LiveCD NTFS DVD Serial ATA System 7 (Macintosh) Windows 3.x History of Microsoft Windows ITunes SAM Coup__ System/36 Copy protection PlayStation Portable MAME MS-DOS PDP-11 NeXT Microsoft Windows System/34 Bluetooth MiniDisc IBM PC compatible SCSI Power Macintosh G3 Apple Computer Forth programming language Timeline of computing 1990-forward Common Unix Printing System Super Nintendo Entertainment System Xbox 360 Digital rights management Creative Zen Macintosh Finder Early IBM disk storage Password Computer network Mandriva Linux CPU cache Commodore DOS Modem File Transfer Protocol Federal Standard 1037C Partition (computing) Computer storage Steam (content delivery) Digital audio player Operating system Atari ST Laptop Backup Digital video recorder C programming language Ethernet
