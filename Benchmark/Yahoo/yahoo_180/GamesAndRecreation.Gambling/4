what do you do in this nl texas holdem shorthanded game its handed you are bb deep and opponent has you covered oppenent is fairly tight but switches it up alot and is a thinking player you are fairly aggressive and have c bet of the time but you show down the goods you raise it to with a and get a call from middle position the blinds fold the pot is the flop comes you bet and he raises to what do you do if you call what do you do on the turn bet or less the pot as a blocker bet check planning to fold bet more than the pot would any of this change if you had k instead o so sorry sabes the flop has two clubs and you have ad h this is a really tough spot it's tough to imagine that he would call a raise with a in his hand or just call your raise pre flop with j j or a bigger pair than that but you also mention that he is tight so one would believe that he thinks he has the best hand there is a key piece of info missing here though is the flop rainbow it makes a difference since he could be raising with a flush draw i don't think i would fold here it's just too unlikely that he just calls a raise with a pair jacks or better or calls a raise with a in his hand i would have to put him on maybe or or maybe he has a also or possibly k q or j suited or a flush draw if possible and the only hands to really worry about are or a suited and there isn't even much chance of him calling the raise with the second hand that said i think re raising is the best play since we are bb deep if we were shorter i think calling would be the better play because it would commit less money but with such deep stacks you have the chance to re raise and still be able to fold if he comes back over the top re raising should pick us up the pot right here most times and will give us a chance to gain the info we need to possibly fold if necessary calling isn't a really bad option but it kinda puts you to a guess on the turn especially if a high card comes off on the turn folding isn't really bad either but i think there are too many hands we beat and if we had k i think i would probably fold or just call since i could safely put my opponent on a as a more logical possibility this is one of those tough spots in hold'em where all three of the options are ok but you don't really like any of them Betting (poker) Omaha hold 'em Stud poker Cheating in poker Draw (poker) Poker Seven-card stud Sheepshead Bluff (poker) Blackjack Poker strategy Five-card draw Poker tournament Professional wrestling slang Glossary of American football American football strategy Five-card stud Volleyball Pai gow poker New York Giants Card Sharks Let's Make a Deal Cribbage Hand (poker) Bad beat Mao (game) Kasparov versus The World President (game) Norway national football team Baccarat Craps Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man Ruy Lopez $ale of the Century Chess terminology Harmonica Contract bridge Table tennis Game show Dominoes ELO rating system Backgammon Winning Streak Maverick (film) Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Tic-Tac-Dough Paintball Buffalo Bills Chess strategy and tactics Slot machine Hearts (game) Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers American football Wheel of Fortune Big Two Gambling San Francisco 49ers Pete Rose Spades Equine conformation Badminton Eight ball The Joker's Wild T.
