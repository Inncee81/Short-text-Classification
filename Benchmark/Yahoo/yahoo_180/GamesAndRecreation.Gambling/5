question about texas holdem strategy okay i was reading a wikipedia article on poker strategy http en wikipedia org wiki poker strategy and it says that there are other more advanced strategies however i have tried to do some research and i have never found anything that was even more advanced on the net so basically do you guys know any good links or have good info on some advanced strategy ummm queens i think i figured that out quite a while ago that is basic basic basic advice maybe read the article and try to give me something that i dont know this advice in the article is almost completely taken from the theory of poker by david sklansky who is referenced a couple of times as you probably noticed the only more advanced strategy i can think of right now that can help you is the idea of psychological manipulation knowing your opponent and everything about him can really help you when you are playing against people you've never played against in online play that would be his statistical information and to some degree the chat box but in live play the idea gets more complex since you can see and talk to your opponents i'll some live play examples say you are starting a live tournament and seated with a group of people you don't know there is one empty seat to be filled and a man wearing numerous gold chains with an open button down shirt and smoking a cigarette takes the final seat and you notice immediately that he won't stop moving his leg and that he stacks his chips very sloppily what can you assume about this player is he going to be a tight conservative player or will he gamble it up you can safely guess that this guy is going to be pretty loose and aggressive most likely in contrast a very well dressed guy is sitting in another seat very calm and collected and spending a lot of time making his chips very neat and tidy well you can probably guess that this guy doesn't spend too much time actually playing pots if he's got so much time on his hands to stack chips nicely and that he's pretty conservative with his money you ask the man sitting next to you how he entered the tournament and he says he got in through a satellite you can guess that this guy is just here for the ride living the dream and just hoping to scratch into the money you can also guess that he won't be putting a lot of money in the pot without a big hand you ask the man on the other side of you how he entered and he says he bought in directly you then ask what he does for a living and he tells you that he is a bookmaker right away you should know that this guy has the money and will be willing to gamble now these things don't tell you all that much about them until you see them play but they give you at least a small idea since you've never watched them play i don't know how much live poker you play but when you do and you play people you don't know you should make sure to notice these things Poker Texas hold 'em Betting (poker) Draw poker Craps Poker tournament Cheating in poker Gambling Mahjong Doomtown Online poker Blackjack Star Trek Customizable Card Game Backgammon Tournament Norway national football team World Series of Poker Theory of conduct Prisoner's dilemma Slot machine Baroque chess $ale of the Century Game theory Bluff (poker) EastEnders Contract bridge Wheel of Fortune Maverick (film) Milton H.
