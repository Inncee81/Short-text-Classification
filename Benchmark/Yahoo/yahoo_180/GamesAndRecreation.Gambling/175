to be a good poker player what do you have to know things like odds and probabilities and things what else thanks you need to know alot of things to be a good poker player but thats talk numbers first the most important mathmatical thing in texas holdem is pot odds you have to use pot odds when you hold a draw like a flush or straight draw a draw is when you need one more card to complete the combo anyways have you ever had a flush draw but someone went allin you know you need one more card for that flush so is it worth it to call to try to complete your flush the first step is to look at your draws and ask yourselves what your hands odds are to find your hand oddsyou should first find out how many outs you have outs are the number of cards out there that are not used yet that will complete your draw lets say you have a flush draw and you hold ksjs the flop comes out s s d you need one more spade for that flush to be complete you have of them and the board has two of them that is that are already used there are spades in the deck and as i said are already in use that leaves spades that can complete your draw so you have outs okay next we need to find out what the chances of completing are draw is here is an easy rule to remember multiply your outs by and then subtract one to find your hand odds by the river okay so with our flush draw with aouts we multiply that by and then subtract that is or you can multiply your outs by and then subtract by one for any and every draw on the flop once you get to the turn you only have one more chance now you can only multiply your outs by but you can add one so now you have a or chance by the river to complete your draw lets say the turn brings out c you would now use this rule remember these rules arent completely accurate and maybe will be off a little anyways your hand odds on the flop would be and on the turn so what do you do with hand odds you are suppose to compare your hand odds to your pot odds if the pot odds are less than the hand odds it a good call if its more than its a bad call well now we have to know how to find your pot odds lets go back to the previous example where you hold ksjs thats say preflop you raise it times the bb which is with your hand on the button so you raise it to six and get callers both on the blinds the pot is now the flop comes s s d the small blind bets the big blind folds so what do you do with your flush draw well lets look at your pot odds the pot is and it costs you to call pot odds is the ratio to call to the pot so your pot odds would be or close to it would be okay to call because your pot odds would be while your hand odds would be the turn comes c the pot is now and he bets now you have to call to win or close to again however your hand odds are this time your hand odds is less than pot odds so you should fold well thats about it for pot odds if you dont understand anything check out this link http en wikipedia org wiki pot odds also heres a good

how to capitilize on position i was just reading some above posts and one person gave really solid advice until i read the earlier the position the better wrong the later the better you get alot more info let me give you an example thats say you hold kj utg first person to act preflop its a game and you raise it to normal raise preflop you get raised to by someone on the button what do you do well you arent ahead of anything that reraises and maybe even money with pocket s and lower you are down big time against any ace with a jack kicker and higher and you are still down versus any ace you are down big time against any pocketpair higher than pocket 's and against any king kq kk but you decide that since you have a king you want to call the flop comes out k you bet into a pot of he calls now you decide that since he just called he is weak you bet the into he reraises you allin now you lost half your stack on a hand that can hardly beat anything good you are forced to fold now you should have folded preflop and stopped betting after the flop is done however if you had position you probaly would have saved at least dollars on the turn calling on the button with kj isnt a bad move and calling the flop when the king came out wasnt bad maybe a raise to get information would be better however when he bet you should probaly fold because as i said kj isnt too great a hand anways position gives you a whole bunch more of information the worse the hand the better position you need know how to play suited connectors know how to bluff and semibluff know when to slowplay and when to just bet of the time you need to be agressive and bet know your oppenents and their tells betting and facial once you get the feel of the game start varying your play like raising with suited
