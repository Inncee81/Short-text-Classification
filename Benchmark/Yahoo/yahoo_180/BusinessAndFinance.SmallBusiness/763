how much does it cost to start a mary kay business i am in grad school and thought i could make some money doing mary kay how is the best way to go about this hi i am a mary kay consultant i started in february so i have a good idea of the current costs your starter kit only costs but you need to place a order to actually be considered an active consultant that is retail you pay half price for everything also you need to order at least retail every months i think to keep receiving that price if you are going to get out there and start selling right away using your starter kit it's not hard to do but your director may suggest you place that order yourself so you can have more samples and inventory i really like mary kay but i do have to warn you that it is not a get rich quick company you can get a lot of money but it takes time and energy and most of the money comes from recruiting others you really have to get out there and meet people and sell they recommend giving facials in days as a power start mary kay is a great company but it does take a lot of time so maybe wait until after grad school to start i would rather you have a good experience with the whole process than feel duped and lose money because you just don't have the time to make it work for you hope this helped to receive bonuses an independent beauty consultant's initial order with the company must equal or more in wholesale section products to be eligible for the price that is retail you can wait and get that in actual sales but there is another free bonus for you if you place it within calendar days so yes the kit is but they expect you to place an order fairly soon and it does help you to have more stuff than just the starter kit Wal-Mart Amway Economics Illegal drug trade Investment bank $ale of the Century Advanced Squad Leader Sears Holdings Corporation UK Singles Chart Inventory Retailer Microsoft Bulk vending Best Buy Inflation Mutual fund Xbox E85 Just In Time London Congestion Charge Electronic commerce Biodiesel The Apprentice 2 Nike, Inc.
