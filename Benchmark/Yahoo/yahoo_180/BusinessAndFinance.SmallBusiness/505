how to attract customers to my meat counter i work in a tesco store part time but i'm considering a team leader role in this store i have to start on the counters as i currently work on the meat counter my main problem is attracting the customers to the counter first problem the price of the meat as far as i'm concerned is too expensive and tesco won't budge on the price second problem recent programme regarding the counters at tesco and sainsbury's haven't helped i'm currently trying different lines for the counter and always make sure the counter looks fully stocked and fresh other than putting a gun to peoples heads i just have no ideas it feels like flogging a dead horse if anyone has some genuine ideas please put them forward i've already asked the customers yes i know lower the price but as i said tesco won't budge at a meat counter i would like to see recipes and tips on grilling first of all even though the prices are rather high do they have a good quality of meat also put together packages a lot of small butcher shop owners put together like weekly packages and sell it at a package price that is a bit cheaper than buying all the same items individually then moms and housewives can pick out the whole week of meat get a package price and people are pretty happy with that make premade meat loafs and pre marinaded stuff all they have to do is take it out and prepare it without doing all that work if a housewife or a working mom can save some time and money that s great plus you may be giving them to off in giving them a package price but if they like the idea you will make up the sales in volume give them a deal that saves them a little money and makes their lives a little easier Wal-Mart J Sainsbury Meat Loaf Tesco Ireland Argos (retailer) My Little Pony Hamburger Microeconomics Plastic Supermarket Best Buy Internet fraud The Apprentice 2 Ramen Loyalty program Supply and demand Mutual fund Illegal drug trade Extreme Programming Bulk vending Aldi Tofu Costco Electronic commerce CPU design Morrisons Supply-side economics Hydrogen economy Filling station Barbecue Theory of conduct No frills MRE Arbitrage United Kingdom corporation tax Cuisine of Denmark Airsoft AMD Common Agricultural Policy Investment bank Social Security debate (United States) RFID Short selling Boots Group Economics Small business Commodore 64 Central processing unit Star Trek Customizable Card Game Health insurance Sears Holdings Corporation Inventory Capital accumulation Bread Inflation Jim Steinman CPU cache Wind turbine ITunes Music Store Atkins Nutritional Approach $ale of the Century W H Smith Gold as an investment Fry's Electronics Mergers and acquisitions Dairy Capitalism RuneScape economy Free trade Los Angeles Clippers Oil price increases of 2004 and 2005 Food Outsourcing ASDA Cable television Asian financial crisis MMORPG Public good Electronic Arts Freeters EastEnders Economy of Russia Current teachings of Prem Rawat Auction Cyprus dispute History of the United States (1918-1945) American Broadcasting Company Technical analysis Audi
