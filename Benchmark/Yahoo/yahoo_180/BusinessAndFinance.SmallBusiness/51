should i return the deposit part i have a children's party business and we send out clowns and magicians to birthday parties i previously posted a question about if i should return deposits to customers when the entertainer gets lost and the client does not answer the phone to give directions the response is if the entertainer gets lost its the enterainer's fault and the deposit should be returned i want to rephrase the question what if the client offers a wrong address or bad directions assume we hold the spot for the client we get a mapquest and double check on yahoo maps we always check with sources because sometimes they are wrong we get directions and drive out to an address and it turns out the client misspelled something gave the wrong zipcode or the wrong address so the enterainer cannot complete the party question when its the clients fault for giving a bad wrong misspelled address should they get their deposit back thanks for me it depends on several things including what your actual out of pocket expenses were and what you have to show the client provided you the wrong information if you had to book the entertainer and your being billed for that expense explain that to the client there is also a big difference if the client wrote out the wrong directions or if you took them down over the phone one way you have proof they gave the wrong directions the other way its he said she said at best if it was me regardless for the sake of goodwill for the business i would keep what ever part of the deposit i needed to cover the actual cost i incurred even if that ment keeping all the deposit i would then offer to rebook the even in a future date at a greatly reduced cost or even at cost sometimes good businesses have to make up for other peoples mistakes that whole customer is always right thing while i think both you and i know that isnt always the case sometimes it just makes sense to act as if its true course there are some people that all the appologies and explainations in the world arent going to smooth things over if you are sure its their fault and have proof you did everything to fulfill your end of the contract then i personally would stick to the contract if for some reason you don't have a written contract or don't have the clients sign initial verify the information you have for their event you might consider doing so in the future having your t's crossed and i's dotted is always the best policy take care of the problem before its a problem course all this is just my opinion i have know idea what the actual legal ramifications could be for you if you refuse to give back any or part of the deposit if you are concerned about that in anyway you should best speak to an attorney i was only thinging about how you could best deal with a disgruntled customer while keeping a good reputation for your business Insurance Plame affair CPU cache Contract Scientology beliefs and practices Extreme Programming Domain Name System Intellectual property Theodicy Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Password Trademark Credit card E-mail spam Life insurance Microeconomics Divorce Social rule Corporate governance Poker jargon Law of value Customer relationship management Ethics Philosophy of language Information Services Procurement Library Health insurance United States Postal Service Determinism Gmail National Kidney Foundation Singapore Abortion debate 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines British national identity card Biblical inerrancy Voice over IP U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Short selling C programming language Floppy disk Appeal Infantilism Internet fraud Best Buy Outsourcing Mach kernel Glen Jacobs Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Intelligent design Annuity Slander and libel Killian documents Business ethics FairTax Surveillance Identity theft Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Cheating in Counter-Strike Prices of production Current teachings of Prem Rawat Adoption GED Philosophy of mathematics Epistemology Bank Halting problem Goodness and value theory 2005 United States Grand Prix Enterprise content management Information Technology Infrastructure Library Katelyn Faber Consensus decision-making Auto insurance Kasparov versus The World Public-key cryptography Nicomachean Ethics Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Avenue Q Ted Kennedy Cyprus dispute Lawyer Creationism Solar cell Transformation problem AppleTalk A Course In Miracles Sin Phishing Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) PRINCE2
