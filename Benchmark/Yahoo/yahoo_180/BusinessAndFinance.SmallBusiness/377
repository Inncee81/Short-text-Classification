dealership business help i have an issues me and apartner recently opened up a small used car dealership we have actually only had our license for about month now and have not even actually sold our first car we have everything ready to go and are even setup with trp's now my partner is changing everything we had agreed upon when we began so i am thinking of dissolving the partnership and relationship how can i do this without a bunch of grief do i just return the trp's if he will even let me without a big fight or can i just call s o s and explain all to them maybe they can remove my name from the license and business somehow any direction would help thanks in advance not sure what a trp is but here is my advise get everything in writing as you are finding out partnerships no matter who the partner is are very difficult to keep some of the differences settled you should have a detailed business plan that you both sign the only way it can be altered is for both of you to sign it getting your name off of the business license should not be that difficult whoever the license is through can easily help you i started my businsess with a partner and he changed everything he had agreed to within months of opening all i had to do was write a letter stating i was leaving the partnership and how the business would be spit then we both signed it i sent that to the agencies i had a license with and it was very simple try and work it out if you can there are some huge positives to a partnership mainly financial keep in mind you have been open month you are still starting up on average it takes years to build a business good luck Vehicle registration plate Warren Buffett Civil union Advertising Extreme Programming GNU General Public License American Motors Charles Goodyear Schabir Shaik Trial National Football League Civil unions in the United Kingdom Kyoto Protocol Nintendo Grief Contract bridge Paul Martin Intellectual property NATO Image Comics One Tree Hill (TV series) European Union Timeline of the Enron scandal Information Technology Infrastructure Library Neville Chamberlain Lawyer Wintel American Locomotive Company Law firm John F.
