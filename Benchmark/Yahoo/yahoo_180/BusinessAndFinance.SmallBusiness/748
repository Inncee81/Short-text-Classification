say im selling on ebay if i said heres a huge lot of video games and then say i dont know which work or which doesnt work will that decrease my chances of making good money or if i just test these games which i cant bcuz i dont have consoles to them but if i test them and say what works and what doesnt work will that increase my chances of making money am i making sense the more info you give the better the chances of getting your items sold at the best possible price if selling as a lot you can post in your listing the disclaimer that some of the games will work and some will not you're honest but having said so will drive away a lot of buyers as they may not know which ones are broken and which ones are good what if everything or turned out to be bad expect a lot of questions asking you which ones actually work if you can provide a listing of which ones are sure to work in which case why even bother to include the ones not working you can get a better price than if you said you don't know which ones work plus customers will be happier to receive the items knowing that they already know which works rather than getting the items and then the game they want most turned out to be a lemon that does not work Arbitrage Internet fraud Atomic Kitten Neopets The Market for Lemons Supply and demand Microeconomics Computer and video games IBM PC compatible Regional lockout EverQuest RuneScape economy Overclocking Atari Warranty Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Xbox Atari 8-bit family Poker jargon Home computer Theory of conduct Live 8 Auction Game show MMORPG Bond Let's Make a Deal Bulk vending Gran Turismo (game) Atari 2600 Microsoft RuneScape Mini-Games Health insurance Monopoly (game) Loss leader RuneScape cheats Blackjack Contract TurboGrafx 16 Option Network effect Monopoly Economics Extreme Programming Nintendo GameCube Opportunity cost PlayStation 3 Game programming Short selling Inventory $ale of the Century Super Nintendo Entertainment System Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Babe Ruth Atari ST Xbox 360 Adverse selection Electronic commerce Magic: The Gathering Commodity BZFlag Nintendo Entertainment System Online auction business model Virtual economy Diablo II: Lord of Destruction The Apprentice 2 Deflation (economics) Quicksort Capitalism Jennifer Lopez Price discrimination Trading Places Mario First-sale doctrine Commodore International Rare (video game company) Computer role-playing game Retailer Final Fantasy XI Subscription business model Los Angeles Clippers Punisher Tax GunBound Islamic banking Sears Holdings Corporation Insider trading Call option Quality control Bank Amazon.com Video game crash of 1983 Single certification ATI Technologies Video game music The Sims 2: University MapleStory Real estate broker
