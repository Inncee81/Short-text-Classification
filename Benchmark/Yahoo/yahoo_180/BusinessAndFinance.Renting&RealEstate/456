should i buy an expensive home or a cheaper home should we buy a cheaper home where it's going to take some work ex carpet roof paint ect ect or a newer home where we just basically have to move right in we don't really want to do repairs but if it will save us in the long run we are more than willing to do it also we have help the payments are about difference the cheaper home was built in the mid 's and the newer home was built in the mid 's it's just that if we bought the more expensive home we'd be on a really tight bugdet i just don't know what would be better on the long run fyi it's kinda the same layouts in both the homes and same sq ft the newer home is probably about more sq ft go with the more affordable one houses always seem incur more expenses than we expect so the more financial breathing room you have the better the only reason i'd reconsider the difference is if the newer house is much more insulated and energy efficient which could make up the difference with utility savings depending on where you live Solar power Microeconomics Solar cell Autonomous building Mutual fund Hydrogen economy Roof and tunnel hacking Straw-bale construction Publicly funded medicine Sport utility vehicle Transformer Space Shuttle program Life insurance Gross domestic product Binoculars Timber framing Arbitrage Fuel injection Fuel cell C__ile Ferate Rom__ne Automobile Boeing 747 Laserdisc Mortgage CPU design Wind turbine Capitalism Brewery Psychiatric hospital Free trade Health insurance FairTax Rational pricing Digital photography Boston and Lowell Railroad TGV Xanadu House Personal rapid transit 401(k) Volleyball McMansion Rocket fuel Electric power transmission Apple Macintosh Hard disk Derivative (finance) BASIC programming language Biodiesel Green Revolution Price discrimination Stairway Nuclear power phase-out Euro Toll road Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus House Cruising (maritime) Taxicab Central processing unit Wayne Corporation Annuity Hybrid vehicle Electrical wiring Radio controlled airplane Stars!
