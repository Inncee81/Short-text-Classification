how can i sell my house my house has been for sale since june of are there any ways to sell it besides a realtor any websites or other places where i can advertise my house if you've been on the market for over a year something is wrong you probably are not using a realtor and that is probably your main problem my second guess is that you're priced way too high and your home is not show ready of the time you may need to fix some things a few of the major turn offs are clutter and odors such as smoking and pets if you are going to stand firm on your price make sure you do the repairs and clean your home thoroughly especially if you choose not to use an agent revisit your price as there's no reason why your home should be on the market for over a year by the way only of homes that are fsbo actually sell and the ones that do the homeowners actually tend to net less than if they used an agent i know the fee seems high but after you are done paying for your advertising time and lack of knowledge you end up paying the anyhow selling a home without an agent is like going to trial without a lawyer you might think my comments are typical coming from an agent but i am an agent who has tried to sell my home on my own as well before getting my license to save the fee and after months i just stopped trying and got my license it's very difficult Mortgage Microeconomics Insurance Mutual fund Supply and demand Monetary policy Short selling Intellectual property FairTax Economics Mergers and acquisitions Capitalism Neopets Auction Nintendo Entertainment System Windows XP Commodore International Broadband Internet access Publicly funded medicine Filling station Government National Mortgage Association Advertising Principal-agent problem MMORPG Inflation Video game crash of 1983 Monopoly Atari 2600 Search engine optimization Law of value Real estate bubble The Apprentice 2 Enron Corporation Best Buy Hard disk Technical analysis Topps Illegal drug trade Lawyer Predatory lending Blockbuster Video Financial markets Gross domestic product Pharmaceutical company Inventory Plame affair Cable television Opera (web browser) Stock broker Primerica Financial Services Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Taxation in the United States Dairy Variable universal life insurance Food and Drug Administration Public good Day trading Videocassette recorder Productive and unproductive labour SCO-Linux controversies Internet fraud Bond CPU cache IBM PC compatible Sento Social Security debate (United States) Airline Bank Arguments for and against drug prohibition Microsoft Windows Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis NeXT National Kidney Foundation Singapore Network effect Externality Citigroup AMD Wal-Mart Radar Capital accumulation Economy of Russia The Price Is Right Contract MOS Technology Copyleft Gold as an investment Sears Holdings Corporation NFL on television Inkjet printer Heinkel He 112 Atari 8-bit family Privatization Theory of the firm Surplus value Television in the United States Mediation Bulk vending Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus White flight
