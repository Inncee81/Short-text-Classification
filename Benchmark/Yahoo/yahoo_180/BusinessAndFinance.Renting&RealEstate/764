what rights do i have vs my landlord managment would like to point out i'm a college student living in a college town so this might screw the management's view also not sure who is the one at fault the management or the actual owner of my apt so when i moved into my apartment last august the air conditioner didn't work it turned on but the compressor didn't kick in so it didn't cool i wrote a note and on the slip that you are suppose to write about whats wrong i came back a week later for classes and the a c was on but same problem i complained a few times but winter came around and for a different problem the maintenance man said he remembers the previous tenants also complaining about that a c and wrote that it needed replaced and that he'd mention it agian but that its no use to complain until spring complained in spring first once a month then twice finally in late june since my apartment didn't cool down below degrees ever i wrote a letter saying i'd purchase my own and withold rent after i purchase my a c i'd send them a copy of the bill and deduct it front my rent they came the very next day and the maintenance man noted it needed replaced so i paid my rent i called in again and they said weeks it'd be replaced weeks later i called and they said any day end of july hit so i called agian and they said today or tomorrow anyways the guy came to replace it and found out they got the wrong size so called in again the new one was suppose to come in yesterday or today in the mean time the a c in my bedroom ended up leaking on the inside and soaked the carpet under one bed and basically half the room i called them and they showed up late last night they pushed my one bed up against my bathroom so i have a inch gap to slide in and said the carpet cleaners would come any minute they didn't show called agian this morning same story so busted a c a carpet that is smelling like mildew and stinking up my entire apartment also i technically can't replace my own a c if i did i could get fined so they supplied an a c with the apt a reason why i got said apartment and i'm not allowed to replace it so i feel like this is their responsibility a lot of times you have to show proof that you notified them of a problem with the apartment such as a certified letter return receipt you may want to get sworn statement from the maintenance man if he's willing to give one apartment managers must notify the owners of anything that is needed for the apartment and get the owners okay first speaking from experience however it shouldn't have taken as long as you said it did one way to find out what is legal in your state is to google your state statutes then look for the section dealing with rental law you may have to navigate a bit but you can find it as for the water damage they are more than likely responsible for any damage to your belongings that resulted from the leak also if you have health issues resulting from the mold such as asthma they may be responsible for any medical bills Plame affair Leasehold estate Avenue Q Heinkel He 112 Public domain 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Estoppel Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Heinkel He 100 Apartment Oasis (band) Rental agreement Babylonian law W.
