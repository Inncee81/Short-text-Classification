co signer what does it mean when a house is in a co signer's name instead of the seller of the house we are the buyers does the seller still get money or not also why did they do an appaisal on it and does this mean seller has to move the seller is talking about suing the loan officer why please answer all questions thanks n additional details hours ago the seller inherited the house from her parents when they passed away u need a co signer for that also she owes the bank a bunch of money they say they gave her money to fix the house up but she never did she is bankrupt is trying to refinance can she do that up till now i guess the house was in her name suddenly now it's only in the bank's name does that mean it's a foreclosure or they did that on purpose so we can close on the house already what happens to her does she still get the money or no and does she have to move out now please revise your answers thanks n and they keep delaying the closing what's the longest a closing has ever been delayed we were supposed to close on may st they said they're waiting for some guy to say yes on monday what do they mean everything's ready ' i've been hearing for weeks in a row should we just foreget it already o and how do i know if it's in foreclosure i think they might be moving o and how do i know if it's in foreclosure i think they might be moving this situation sounds familiar to me i am willing to be that the seller made a last ditch effort to avoid foreclosure by giving the deed to the lender aka deed in lieu after trying to refinance the property and failing a deed in lieu can't be done without the approval of a specific person in government which i can't remember his title but it is simply a matter of being sign off on the seller does not stand to receive any money from the sale the house was likely originally purchased with a cosigner and had a deed of survivorship once the cosigner passed away there was no need to re record the deed with only the sellers name on title the seller sounds like a pretty desperate person in serious financial trouble the sellers threat to sue the mortgage broker is likely out of frustration as to when she must vacate the property that is up to the bank to evict her obviously this must be done prior to closing because you aren't going to close knowing you will have to deal with a squatter i suggest you give the bank who is now the seller the heads up on this issue as to avoid another delay this contract has had to expire by now giving you the option to walk away from this whole situation if you choose Mortgage Real estate broker Foreclosure Contract Great Depression Microeconomics Predatory lending Student loan Security (finance) Wheel of Fortune Article One of the United States Constitution Short selling Concurrent estate Insurance Title insurance Deflation (economics) Conveyancing Tax Allodial title Islamic banking Option Plame affair Canadian Senate Derivative (finance) Unconscionability Act of Parliament Financial markets Bank Internet fraud Bond ACORN Life insurance Annuity EastEnders Citigroup Notary public British House of Commons Trademark Big Brother UK series 6 Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Mutual fund Social rule Enron Corporation New Deal CPU cache Spice Girls Family Feud Big Brother (USA TV series) United Kingdom corporation tax Futures contract Intelligent design movement FairTax Donald Trump Stock market 401(k) SCO-Linux controversies Autograph She Loves You Corporation Schabir Shaik Trial Oil-for-Food Programme Adverse possession House of Lords ITunes Music Store Temasek Holdings Theory of conduct Mensal__o scandal Same-sex marriage in Canada Trust (Law) USA Shaggy dog story 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Venezuelan recall referendum, 2004 Government debt Oakland Athletics Intellectual property Hyperinflation Taxation in the United States Inflation Tennessee State Constitution Money World Championship Wrestling Ken Jennings Land reform Hulk Hogan Trust (Law) non-USA History of the United States (1918-1945) Password Construction
