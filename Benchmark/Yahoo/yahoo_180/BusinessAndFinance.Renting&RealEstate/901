can i consolidate mortgages on homes into one loan to my benefit i have two mortagages from two lenders on two houses is it possible to consolidate and have one loan from one bank covering the two homes what sort of benefit or disadvantage would this entail i'm sure its possible at some banks though most would not want to do it right now its very possible to get some sort of umbrella loan usually you do this with lots of properties you want to bundle together still to do this banks would hate it just easier for them to keep each property seperate and what if you decide to sell one house down the road but keep the other you couldn't do that without refinancing again also i can't think of any advantage beyond a tiny savings in cost to get the loan only one closing needed for example but this would actually be a cost for you since you already have mortgages on both properrties so its just a bad idea won't help any and causes all sorts of hassles you could instead simple have the bank write you two seperate loans for both properties at the same time if you wanted assuming you are planning to refi them both now they'd be much happier to do this Mortgage Primerica Financial Services Debt consolidation Insurance Savings and loan association Predatory lending Debt Central bank Deflation (economics) Interest Student loan Federal National Mortgage Association Life insurance Bank Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation Government National Mortgage Association Subsidy Washington Mutual Leasing Real estate broker Citigroup Monetary policy Irish Life and Permanent Bond Annual percentage rate Donald Trump Title insurance Personal finance Payday loan History of the United States (1918-1945) Externality Islamic banking Islamic economics 401(k) Extreme Programming Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Foreclosure Unconscionability FairTax Real estate bubble Short selling Financial markets Derivative (finance) Bretton Woods system Microcredit Mortgage-backed security Real estate Economy of Russia Gold standard Mobile home Security (finance) Fee tail Anarchism and capitalism Soci__t__ G__n__rale CPU cache Conveyancing Indian reserve Finance Refinancing New Deal Easement Home insurance Intellectual property CPU design Yarralumla, Australian Capital Territory Handelsbanken Popular, Inc ACORN Annuity Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Concurrent estate Bank of America Free trade Microeconomics Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Savings and Loan crisis Stamp duty Capital accumulation Great Depression Temasek Holdings Privatization Corporation EastEnders Kasparov versus The World RISC Mach kernel Construction Trade Credit card Collyer brothers Productive and unproductive labour Property tax Toronto-Dominion Bank Urban renewal Emirates Stadium National Australia Bank Real estate developer Leeds United F.C.
