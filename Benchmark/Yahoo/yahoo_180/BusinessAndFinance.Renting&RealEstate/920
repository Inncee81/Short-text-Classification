mortgage advice property portfolio i have k in savings i want to buy a house for k therefore need a k mortgage if i buy the house and remortgage it to buy another one how much capital will be available to me will it be the k for the value of the house i think i understand what you are saying and this should help to buy a buy to let property typically a lender will look for quite a substantial deposit depending on who you go with so going buy your plan if you buy your house for k with a k mortgage and then remortgage it you should be able to get about k which of course you could invest in new properties you will then be paying interest on the full k plus whatever additional borrowing you have taken on in order to pay for the second house its difficult to advise you on the best way to fund all this without knowing the details of how and when you are buying all the properties however you need to sit down and think about how much you can afford to be repaying how much you need to set aside for repairs and vacant periods how quickly you will need the second property and how much of a benefit it would be in having large amounts of capital available immediately rather than having to rely on a remortgage my basic advice would be if you are buying one property and will then look to build upon this over a number of years when you find another one you might well be best served reducing your mortgage payments with a large deposit if however you are looking to extend you portfolio in months rather than years it may be easier and more cost effective to retain more capital in savings and rely on a larger mortgage to fund the first and second purchase good luck Mortgage Bond Mutual fund Life insurance Bank Student loan Islamic banking Insurance Debt Annuity Taxation in the United States Personal finance Money Federal National Mortgage Association Finance Credit card Microeconomics Leasing Savings and loan association Predatory lending Financial markets Interest 401(k) Capital accumulation Monetary policy Capitalism Primerica Financial Services History of the United States (1918-1945) Security (finance) Marshall Plan Title insurance Microcredit Municipal bond Government debt United Kingdom corporation tax Gross domestic product Citigroup Wells Fargo Social Security (United States) Short selling Government National Mortgage Association Real estate bubble Inflation Gold standard Hyperinflation Toronto-Dominion Bank Bretton Woods system Annual percentage rate Great Depression Variable universal life insurance Derivative (finance) Futures contract Privatization Housing cooperative Mortgage-backed security Donald Trump Monopoly (game) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Free trade Real estate Tax Subsidy Anarchism and capitalism Trust (Law) USA Temasek Holdings Social Security debate (United States) Real estate broker Treasury security Concurrent estate Yield curve Keynesian economics Rational pricing Registered Retirement Savings Plan Real estate developer Islamic economics Health insurance Irish Property Bubble Construction Saving (economics) U.S. public debt Supply and demand Mergers and acquisitions Estoppel Labor theory of value Money supply Economy of India Rental agreement Public transport Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Software patent debate CPU cache Securitization Schabir Shaik Trial
