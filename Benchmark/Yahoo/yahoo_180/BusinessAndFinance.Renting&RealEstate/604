tax sale troubles i've asked a general question about tax sales before but just now i thought of another angle that i'd like to hear more about what are all the things that can go wrong legally etc when purchasing tax sales what do potential investors buyers need to be aware of on the lookout for etc so that they don't get more than they'd bargained for i think that my state nc is a tax deed state not a tax lien state so i think investors buy the properties outright i'm afraid of buying a property and thinking there are no other liens only to find out later that there was a lien i didn't know about also i was told that when you buy from a tax deed sale it nullifies the mortgage or something since tax debts trump mortgages the mortgage is basically wiped off the slate so to speak be aware of the total tax lien and any other liens on the property as you will be responsible for them should you purchase the home get an inspector to look at the place inside and out to ensure that it is not gonna be a money pit for you make sure you have the money or financing at the time of the sale good luck Mortgage Security (finance) Microeconomics FairTax Insurance Donald Trump Municipal bond Contract Foreclosure Real estate broker Predatory lending Islamic banking Allodial title Concurrent estate Taxation in the United States Tax Conveyancing Mutual fund Title insurance Annuity Capitalism Mergers and acquisitions Warren Buffett Bond Corporation Economy of Russia Enron Corporation Derivative (finance) Federal National Mortgage Association Stamp duty Economics Life insurance Social rule Monopoly (game) Construction Surplus value Money Wal-Mart Unconscionability Great Depression Personal finance Gross domestic product Michael Milken Property tax Economy of the United States Capital accumulation Debt Deed Leasing Real estate developer Auction Temasek Holdings Government National Mortgage Association Real estate bubble Intellectual property U.S. public debt History of the United States (1918-1945) Gold as an investment Primerica Financial Services United Kingdom corporation tax Tom DeLay Law of value Bankruptcy in the United States Advertising Financial markets Free trade Deflation (economics) Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Supply and demand Gold standard Mechanics lien Dividend Treasury security Privatization Ford Motor Company Bulk vending Trust (Law) non-USA United States Department of the Treasury Charles Ponzi Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Oil-for-Food Programme Bank Insider trading Stock Government debt Supply-side economics Price discrimination Stock market Registered Retirement Savings Plan SCO-Linux controversies U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Jim Bakker Harken Energy Scandal Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Day trading Inflation
