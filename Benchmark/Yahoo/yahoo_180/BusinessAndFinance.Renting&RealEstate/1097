is there a limit to how much you can withdrawl from you k for the down payment on your first home i know it is under the hardship clause and fidelity knuckleads told me k per person but i cannot find any confirmation of this limit pls advise fidelity are a bunch of knuckleheads who've somehow conned most major businesses into putting their k business with them in return they have to toe the line anyways there is no k limit for hardship withdrawal as long as you are meeting the criteria for hardship distribution and you are i e purchase of primary residence then there should be no problem normally a hardship distribution can only be for the dollar amount of the financial hardship there is essentially no limit except the funds that you have in your account that are available to you with the home purchase your hardship amount is generally your down payment and or closing costs so you should be able to request an amount that would cover these costs obviously you will have to show proof though which would be a mortgage application or seller's agreement that shows the costs that you are having to pay out of pocket i e can't be included in the mortgage note the only way there might be a k limit is if it is some sort of plan imposed limit this means that your company might have drafted their plan to limit the hardship withdrawals get a copy of the summary plan description and read what it says about hardship withdrawals 401(k) Mortgage Life insurance FairTax Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus United Kingdom corporation tax Bank Security (finance) Islamic banking Annuity Bond Taxation in the United States Bretton Woods system Social Security (United States) Student loan SCO-Linux controversies Health insurance Microeconomics Legal tender Trademark Credit card fraud Money Credit card Wal-Mart Mensal__o scandal Primerica Financial Services Social Security debate (United States) Personal finance Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards Gold standard Dividend Real estate broker Unemployment Construction Capitalism Housing cooperative Short selling United States Postal Service Cooperative Kyoto Protocol Bank of China (Hong Kong) Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Deflation (economics) Oil-for-Food Programme Corporate finance Open access Pension Gross domestic product Monetary policy Food Stamp Program Schabir Shaik Trial GNU General Public License Derivative (finance) Rational Unified Process Federal National Mortgage Association Savings and loan association Corporation History of the United States (1918-1945) Income trust Copyright law of the United Kingdom Bank fraud International law and the Arab-Israeli conflict Screenplay Octopus card Public good Canada Health Act Warren Buffett Futures contract Value added tax Public domain International Monetary Fund Leasing Hyperinflation Great Depression Education in the People's Republic of China Citigroup Health savings account Probation officer Air New Zealand Trade union Software patent debate Annual percentage rate Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Business continuity planning Economy of Russia Privatization Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Monopoly (game) Patent application Mergers and acquisitions Medicare (United States) Identity theft
