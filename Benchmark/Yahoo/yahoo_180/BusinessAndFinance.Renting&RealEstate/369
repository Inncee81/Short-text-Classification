countrywide reo i found a countrywide reo property it has been in the listing for over months and the remax told me that there is no offer yet they reduced so far i would like to offer of asking price does anyone know if they are accepting offers in the range well you can try that but keep in mind the lender obviously has costs associated with this property and needs to recoup those costs i hope you are using a realtor to represent you not the listing agent and you had better have a full house inspection done before better to lose than to have in repairs later on Real estate broker Mortgage Insurance Conveyancing Federal National Mortgage Association Temasek Holdings Title insurance Government National Mortgage Association Airline Intellectual property REO Speedwagon FairTax Finance Natural monopoly Annual percentage rate Supply and demand Education in the United States Plame affair Debt Broadband Internet access Best Buy Bank Interest Student loan Privatization Gold standard Leasing Economics Estoppel Wal-Mart Multiple Listing Service Food and Drug Administration Economy of Russia Oxford English Dictionary Participatory economics TAM Linhas A__reas Credit card Growth hormone treatment Warren Buffett Real estate Construction Cyprus dispute Yield curve Monetary policy Microeconomics Leica Short selling Filling station Subsidy Bond Application-specific integrated circuit Welding Low-cost carrier Ford Motor Company Property (ownership right) NVIDIA Luke Skywalker Botswana Commodore 64 PlayStation 3 Iraq and weapons of mass destruction Concurrent estate Oil-for-Food Programme Labor theory of value Risk management State sector organisations in New Zealand Eastern span replacement of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Naval Station Norfolk Software engineering Plastic Real estate bubble New Zealand English MMORPG Debt consolidation COX-2 inhibitor Loss leader Dodge Charger Diamond Illegal drug trade RuneScape weapons Laptop Stock Financial markets M6 Toll Inflation Hybrid vehicle Space elevator Craps Jean Grey Transition metal Canadian federal election, 1993 Free trade Classic Car Club of America Predatory lending Tiger I Mainframe computer Class in the contemporary United States Heretics of Dune Capitalism Citigroup
