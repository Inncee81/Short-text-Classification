rental question my landlord comes over to water the lawn on a regular basis and i have to foot the water bill every month what can i do about it first be careful don't say anything to the landlord until you've read your lease if you have one and know your rights second study your lease know your rights and make careful and accurate calculations of how much the water for the lawn actually costs per month i'll bet that it's a trivial amount but i could be wrong so make the calculation third if you discover that the landlord is watering too much or that the landlord has to pay for the gardening and the water for the gardening then have a tactful discussion with the landlord most of the time you have more to lose than the landlord so always be tactful fourth if and only if you are right the landlord is wrong and the amount of money the cost for the water is significant then consider going the legal route but in of the cases the legal route is not the best for you good luck Leasing Leasehold estate Estoppel Monopoly (game) FairTax Gambling United Kingdom corporation tax Eviction Poker jargon Craps Insurance First-sale doctrine Blackjack Public domain Betting (poker) SCO-Linux controversies Babylonian law Lawn Mortgage Accounting methods Islamic banking The Amazing Race Irish Land Act Capitalism Slot machine Economics Publicly funded medicine Derivative (finance) Ethics Waste (law) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Microeconomics Taxation in the United States Property law New York Knicks Abortion debate Boston and Lowell Railroad Sears Holdings Corporation Credit card Bond Contract Gold standard Medical malpractice Bernard Williams Theory of conduct Health insurance Annuity PE ratio Tax Serfdom Surveillance Life insurance Utilitarianism Labor theory of value Law of value Public transport Geolibertarianism COINTELPRO Inflation Parliament Act Han Dynasty 407 ETR Age of the Earth Auto insurance Renting John McDouall Stuart Unemployment Tennis Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849) Software patent debate Surplus value Press Your Luck Domestic partnerships in California Identity theft Sports betting Intermediate consumption Article One of the United States Constitution Prince Edward Island Economy of Russia U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Intellectual property Land reform Vivian Solon Lend-Lease Arguments for and against drug prohibition United States Postal Service Externality Transformation problem Ponzi scheme Adoption Fixtures Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) 1919 World Series Sam Walton Interest Economy of the United States Neoclassical economics National Kidney Foundation Singapore
