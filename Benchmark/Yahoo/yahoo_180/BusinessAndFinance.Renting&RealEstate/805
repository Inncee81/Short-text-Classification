help with getting money back lease details i stayed in a room apartment and the security deposit was there was always stuff going wrong but i called each time but right before my lease ended a light stopped working and i called to see if i should get it fixed before i moved out or if they could write it down that it was damaged so i wouldn't be charged the lease said will automatically be taken out for carpet cleaning so that would be if there werent damages the only other thing wrong was there was paint chipped on a door and the light thing but i called about that i got my check back and only got dollars and they listed about dollars worth of cleaning and the rest for damage repair i knew they would rip me off and now i have to despute in writing only but how can i prove anything i knew they were shady since they wouldn't let me be there for the inspection and that they would probably make up stuff any advice also it said for carpet cleaning and for jean cleaning whatever that is that just proves it there since they said carpet cleaning was only if you want to play thier game you may get a few more dollars back this is just a way for them to pocket a few bucks just dispute it if they don't give you your money back dispute it again chances are they will cave and refund your money Poker jargon Satchel Paige Enron Corporation Aladdin (1992 film) Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man Betting (poker) Friends Octopus card Leasehold estate EFTPOS USS Vestal (AR-4) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Joker's Wild Badly Drawn Kitties Contract Wheel of Fortune Tag Slot machine Shaggy dog story Ocean's Twelve Knife Make money fast Blood Simple Sin City 2005 trial of Michael Jackson The Time Machine The Caves of Androzani The Daleks' Master Plan Knots Landing Buckingham Palace One Tree Hill (TV series) Plame affair Time Out of Mind Vending machine Dial M for Murder Grandview, U.S.A.
