how do i make myself look better than the other potential tenants my boyfriend and i are going to be seeing an apartment on wednesday with a few other people who want the same one we're already going to have our applications and fees prepared ahead of time but is there anything else we could do to just look amazing so we'll have a bit more of an edge thanks so much this is our first apartment how bad is that going to look the normal practice is that the first person who submits an application and meets the standard criteria gets the appartment this avoids any possibility of claims of illegal discrimmination when i was a landlord i had basic criteria that had to be met credit score verifiable employment or other resources sufficient to pay the rent felony check etc the applications were reveiwed in the order they were received the first one that passed muster was offered the place the fact that one might look better than another wasn't a factor once one met my standards i didn't even review the others E-mail spam Mortgage Estoppel Plame affair College admissions Insurance Barrister Leasehold estate Life insurance Education in the People's Republic of China Blackjack Affirmative action Killian documents Appeal Harlem Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Probation officer George W.
