anyone else have their mortgage sold to www mortgagequestions com i'm just curious i originally opened my mortgage with usaa who in my opinion are a great company within the first two months they had sold my mortgage to a company who's website is www mortgagequestions com i always have trouble logging on to their site they say the password is incorrect sometimes they say the security questions are incorrect and after i have them mail me a new password it will say that one is incorrect i have to go through this everytime i want to access my account anyone else out there experience this too and i know i'm entering the correct info after about the forth time this happened i would write everything down to be sure i entered the correct info the next time i went to log on does anyone know if there is a way to have usaa take over my mortgage again this is just so frustrating their customer service is horrible actually phh mortgagequestions com run most of usaa's mortgage's on their behalf i used to work for them when they were called cendant so when you call into usaa even though they answer the phone usaa you are usually speaking with a representative from phh they call this branding they also do this with many other companies such as merrill coldwell banker era and charles schwab the list goes on and on phh is essentially the servicing agent of your mortgage usaa and all the other companies that partner with phh want to make this as seamless as possible so they give authority to phh to utilize their name to process mortgages on their behalf branding phh doesn't own usaa or any of the other companies but they run most of if not all of their mortgage divisions even though usaa is huge and has the capability to portfolio mortgages they usually farm out most of their mortgages to the company phh this isn't the case on all their mortgages but it is on most you can contact the initial representative who took your mortgage to verify but it is most likely the case here that being stated your mortgage really never moved from one place to another and will likely stay exactly where it is they are a really good company though so i wouldn't worry like i stated before though check this with your initial representative or with the post closing department as far as the website is concerned you'll definitely want to continue to contact them to get that issue resolved they are huge and do have it problems from time to time i hope this helps and good luck Password Citigroup Debugging Mortgage Internet fraud Phishing Surveillance E-mail spam Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Plame affair 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Call centre Security (finance) Windows XP Domain Name System Independent Media Center Bond Sears Holdings Corporation Gmail GameFAQs Data retention Social rule Karl Rove Construction MMORPG Customer relationship management Credit card Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Danger Hiptop Investment bank Information Technology Infrastructure Library Cross site scripting IBM PC compatible Neopets Tesco Real estate broker Stopping e-mail abuse Halting problem Ashton-Tate Mach kernel RuneScape cheats Mutual fund Skype CompuServe Roswell UFO incident System/36 Killian documents Outsourcing Financial services Collision detection Contract Lehman Brothers Jeff Gannon World Wide Web Timeline of the Enron scandal Delta Air Lines UK Singles Chart Identity theft Debt Steam (content delivery) Enron Corporation Insurance Intelligent design Pretty Good Privacy SCO-Linux controversies Charles Goodyear The Joker's Wild Theodicy Primerica Financial Services Electronic commerce Computer security Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act BlackBerry National Australia Bank Popular, Inc Database Master Control Program Software agent FairTax Opera (web browser) Simple Mail Transfer Protocol GSM services Lawyer CPU cache Goodness and value theory Privatization DeviantART Short selling Secure Shell Copyright Cendant
