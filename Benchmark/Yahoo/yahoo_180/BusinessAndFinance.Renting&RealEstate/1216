whats really going on in the mortgage industry can someone please break it down for me what effects will this have on sub prime mortgage companies this is a long complicated answer i am a mortgage broker in the midwest that does prime subprime alt a and government essentially the foreclosure rates for loans that were funded over the previous year boom in the housing industry are astronomical products like negative amortization and interest only put a lot of homeowners in a situation where they couldn't keep up with their payments once they adjusted to a regular amortization schedule and there was no equity in their home to sell it due to the high foreclosure rates investors responded by making significant changes to the qualifications of certain subprime loans for instance the credit score requirements increased dramatically to do no money down loans or stated income loans in order to combat the high risk levels they were dealing in before the foreclosure rates continued to climb and the business stalled because they made it harder for people to get money so lenders became strapped for cash a lot of lenders acted like consumers in that they overextended themselves as well borrowing cheap money on teaser rates that caught up with them investors pulled their money out of lenders in the subprime market and rendered the lenders without the ability to fund any transactions and thus close others faced legal issues and were shut down because of fraud and still others just couldn't keep up with their debts and filed for bankruptcy what this has done in the subprime market is make is hard to get loans done when i normally would have different lenders taking a loan i may now only have or if any at all thus less people can buy houses so the real estate market has suffered as well which effects consumer confidence in the market which effects their spending which makes investors and lenders even more fickle when it comes to these matters there are a lot of contributing factors with the fed raising rates that go beyond this that are affecting the overall mortgage industry but the rates are still very low compared to historic averages Great Depression Microeconomics Federal National Mortgage Association Financial markets Finance Government National Mortgage Association Economy of the United States Student loan Credit card Life insurance Government debt Mortgage-backed security Annual percentage rate Security (finance) Gold standard Islamic banking Mutual fund Short selling Primerica Financial Services Free trade FairTax Capital accumulation Economy of India Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Taxation in the United States Interest Annuity Citigroup PE ratio Tax Temasek Holdings Stock Derivative (finance) Real estate Keynesian economics Money supply Privatization Microcredit Money Gross domestic product History of the United States (1918-1945) Usury Real estate broker Subsidy Municipal bond Real estate bubble Bretton Woods system Corporation Foreclosure Hyperinflation Central bank Economy of Pakistan Enron Corporation Interest rate Collateralized debt obligation Yield curve Publicly funded medicine Savings and Loan crisis ACORN Federal Reserve Income trust Investment bank Capitalism Personal finance Economic relations of Japan Allodial title Argentine Currency Board Consumer finance 401(k) Business cycle History of post-Soviet Russia U.S. public debt Repurchase agreement Credit score Economy of Cuba Debt consolidation Internet fraud Toronto-Dominion Bank Donald Trump Social Security debate (United States)
