renting apartments please try to answer all my questions thanks is it the responsibility of the owner or renter to pay the bills for mowing the lawn and pool maintenance what usually happens when the carpet get dirty is the owner or renter responsible for cleaning it how long do people typically change their carpet is it reasonable for the renter to ask the owner to change the carpet or is that the renter's problem thanks these things should be discussed between the landlord and renter before a lease is signed if it's a large apartment complex the landlord normally takes care of lawn and pool maintenance if it's a house it may be up to the renter when the carpet gets dirty while being lived in by the renter then the renter needs to vaccuum it would take a lot of wear and tear i would think to need to actually change the carpet sometimes it's done between renters if needed if you're talking about getting it cleaned before moving in then you should see if the landlord is getting is done professionally before you move in everything should be clean and ready for you when you move in or i would consider looking elsewhere for a place to live as far as changing the carpet completely you can ask but the landlord doesn't have to do it unless it's in horrible condition Rental agreement Leasehold estate Boston and Lowell Railroad Apartment Gentrification Housing cooperative Public housing Lawn mower Lawn The Young Ones (TV series) Extreme Programming Motor oil Avenue Q Irish Land Act Social rule Robot Tennis Babylonian law Intellectual property Miss Saigon Carpet Ownership Radio controlled car Home repair Prostitution in Germany Palms, Los Angeles, California Waste (law) Sento Estoppel Absentee landlord Life insurance History of Santa Monica, California Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Stuyvesant Town Insurance Buckingham Palace Computational complexity theory Apartment building Animal Crossing Squatting British House of Commons Sauna American Psycho The Inside Taxation in the United States Public domain Leasing Surplus value Swimming pool Nortraship Rent (musical) Construction It's All Gone Pete Tong CPU cache Contact lens Bedbug Theory of conduct Gardening Suburbs of Johannesburg Yugo Pitaten Diving Emancipation reform of 1861 in Russia Scouting Babe Ruth Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Janashakti Drill bit Capitalism Stairway Computer virus Home insurance Microeconomics Friends Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Strap-on dildo Anarchism and capitalism McMansion Carburetor Land use forecasting Queensbridge Abortion debate Only Fools and Horses Minor characters in Seinfeld Real estate economics Publicly funded medicine Airport The Commons George Costanza Justification (theology) Dial M for Murder Surveillance Upholstery Fort Ashby, West Virginia Robert Moses Vista Way Minor league baseball Expert system Scottish clan Body piercing
