me and my mom own a piece of land yes we outright own it nothing is owed on it she got it for me and my husband and wants to put it in his name instead of hers now the only problem is i dont know how to do it does she have to be there where do it go and can i just add him for now my mom keeps telling me she'll get around to it because shes so busy but we cant wait any longer because the mortgage company will most likely need to see that he owns the land no can anyone tell me iftheres anything i can do my names is on the property as well as hers only cause she got a discount on it since she already lives in that community but she doesnt want ownership of it whatsoever ideas or comments is it just that simple just sign a piece of paper and then what do i send it some where and do we need to wait you're trying to get a mortgage to build a house on the land go down to the court house they have a department which keeps records on who owns property ask them it should just be a matter of your mother signing over her share to your husband it may be a better idea to just remove your mother and keep it in only your name that way its your property and if you divorce you arent as likely to be forced to sell the land and split the money Mortgage Intellectual property Concurrent estate Monopoly (game) Divorce Plame affair Housing cooperative Allodial title Property (ownership right) Sears Holdings Corporation Ownership Donald Trump Taxation in the United States Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Leasing Cooperative Cyprus dispute Construction American individualist anarchism Bond Laura Schlessinger Easement Property tax United States Postal Service Debt SCO-Linux controversies Extreme Programming Real estate Fee simple Wal-Mart Islamic banking FairTax Target Corporation Real property Babylonian law Fixtures Squatting Personal property Capital accumulation ITV Stock Warren Buffett Irish Property Bubble Corporation Status of religious freedom in Malaysia Fred Phelps Animal Liberation Front Derivative (finance) Public domain Federal National Mortgage Association Charles Dickens Money Adverse possession Atomic Kitten Privatization Wells Fargo Mutual fund Juliana of the Netherlands Rupert Murdoch Stamp duty Insurance Citigroup SCO v.
