what should i warn my friend about regarding buying a new house think he may be buying a house that he cant afford and i've been hearing about a lot of forclosures what's so good solid advice what some good solid advice some good solid advice is don't buy the place unless they really can afford it an aggressive mortgage broker or even bank loan officer will take all his info and then try to get an applicant to buy a house for as much as the formula says they can afford still the formula's aren't perfect and alot of people are being foreclosed on because they got in over their heads this is less of a problem today because the excesses of just a few years ago have caused the mortgage industry to really tighten up their standards but i assure you it still can happen he can get a loan that he really can't afford to pay specific advice on how to avoid this is first off get a fixed rate loan so his payments won't go up a year or so down the road figure out what the monthly payment will be for all costs bank or mortgage broker will figure out this and give him the info and compare the costs to his current income and decide for himself if he truly can afford this also no reason to buy the most home he can afford if the banker says he can afford k look for something in the k range best luck Mortgage Life insurance Annuity Mutual fund Bond Real estate broker Debt Deflation (economics) Islamic banking Bretton Woods system Bank Predatory lending Personal finance Government National Mortgage Association Short selling Gold standard Citigroup Student loan Primerica Financial Services Microcredit Gross domestic product Microeconomics Housing cooperative Annual percentage rate Stock Interest Federal National Mortgage Association FairTax 401(k) Savings and loan association Economy of Russia Inflation Capital accumulation Credit card United Kingdom corporation tax Mergers and acquisitions Mortgage-backed security Unemployment Federal Reserve Monopoly (game) Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Irish Property Bubble Concurrent estate Hyperinflation Monetary policy Title insurance Derivative (finance) Donald Trump Savings and Loan crisis ACORN Credit score Supply and demand Taxation in the United States New Deal Health insurance Public transport Wells Fargo Royal Assent Collateralized mortgage obligation Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Economy of the United States Intellectual property Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation Asian financial crisis Central bank Futures contract Free trade Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Tesco Urban sprawl Publicly funded medicine U.S. public debt Subsidy Leasing Advertising Mensal__o scandal Surplus value Financial services Bank fraud Security (finance) Mobile home Tax World Bank Group Public good Pound sterling Surveillance Economy of India NASDAQ Schabir Shaik Trial Formula One Usury Real estate
