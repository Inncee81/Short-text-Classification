income based apartments i was wondering about the whole income based apartment thing i've heard they look at your income and decide from there but then i see the profiles on the apartments and they have rent ranges listed that don't look any different from any other place exactly how does the whole thing work do these places actually determine your rent based on your income or what it depends on what you mean by income based some people have what is called a tax credit or section property where they have income guidelines but the rent is not on a sliding scale at these places they have to keep their rent below a certain level and you have to fall in between certain income ranges in order to qualify these are sort of an in between for people who can't afford conventional housing but have too much income to qualify for low income housing a low income housing property section or subsidized will have a sliding scale for their rent you will pay so much per month depending on what your annual income is the best option will be to call your local housing authority and ask them if they have a listing of subsidized housing in your community they would also be able to tell you about obtaining a section voucher which they would pay a portion or all of your rent and it would be transferable from property to property good luck Public housing Taxation in the United States Property tax Section 8 (housing) Progressive tax Tax Monopoly (game) Economy of Russia Education in the United States Gross domestic product Real estate bubble Surplus value Leasing Public transport Capitalism Student loan Mortgage Poverty line Economic inequality Credit card Food Stamp Program Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Income tax Insurance FairTax Economic rent Public good Flat tax National Insurance Microeconomics Productive and unproductive labour 401(k) Housing cooperative Income statement Leasehold estate Money Rental agreement Estoppel Life insurance Gentrification United Kingdom corporation tax Government debt Education in Germany Government of Maryland Rent control Value added Harlem United States Postal Service Public domain Variable universal life insurance Capital accumulation Property (ownership right) CPU cache Bluetooth School choice Hybrid vehicle Annuity Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Copyright law of the United Kingdom Labour economics Trademark Squatting Entropy Public education Labor theory of value Anarchism and capitalism Jack Layton American individualist anarchism Apartment Supply and demand Arthur Laffer Copyright Tennessee State Constitution Public policy Extreme Programming Offshoring Anarchism and society Baseball Inflation Centrelink Motion picture rating system Slide rule Libertarian economic views Value product Unreformed House of Commons Explosive material Royal Assent Avenue Q Scientology beliefs and practices Freeters RuneScape Measures of national income and output Barrister Dividend Canadian Senate Contract with America Article One of the United States Constitution Oceanic trench
