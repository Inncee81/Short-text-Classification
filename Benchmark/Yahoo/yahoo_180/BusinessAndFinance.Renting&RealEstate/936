real estate investment with no own money involve no credit check etc is this true i see a lot of advertisements on craigslist re real estate investment with no credit check no own money involve etc is there any truth in this i would like to get involve in real estate investing hoping that it will be a pathway to financial freedom but i have no money to invest baby s yes you can invest in real estate without your own money as i'm pursuing this now as my new career the thing you have to remember is that what you would be doing is dealing with those homeowners who have found themselves going through the 'foreclosure process' meaning they have fallen about months behind on their mortgage and their lender usually a bank has started the 'foreclose' process if you check your local paper you'll see back in the real estate section ads entitled notice of default this is a mandatory process all lenders must due once you've found a homeowner going through the foreclosure process you then negotiate what is called a short sale with the lender google the term real estate short sale note include the then go through the the first url's that are returned and you should then get the gest of what and how short sales work another way of investing in real estate is through a process called wholesaling how this works is you still find those homeowners who are going through the foreclose process however they're not as far along as those who would be candidates for a 'short sale' you talk to the homeowners to find those who are motivated to sell now and thus are open to taking a lower amount then what the house would typically sell for you put the house under contract which can honestly be done for less then and then before you close on the property find another investor who would be willing to buy the house from you fix it up themselves and then resell it months later here is an example of how that would work homeowner needs to move now because of job promotion out of state or even because of a 'divorce' does not have time to wait for house to sell under normal process find realtor do a 'open house' etc etc needs to sell now and is willing to take any offer just to get out from under the loan house is appraised at say minus of market value or if house needs any repairs carpet paint ect etc minus those costs from amount factor in a wholesale profit of say now your offer to the homeowner would be appraised value or repairs example wholesale profit example offer to homeowner homeowner accepts offer during the days or so it typically takes to 'close' on a loan you find another investor from ads like you've seen on craigslist com or from signs you may see in your area that say we buy houses you provide the information on said home to investor if the investor decides to buy the house then you turn around and sell it for any price above the you offered to the original home owner so imgaine if a house was appraised at you picked it up from the owner for if you then turn around and sell it to the investor for say even if the house had about worth of repairs needed the investor could still turn around re hab the house and sell it for the apparised values a few months later thus allowing everyone in the transaction to walk away happy homeowner is happy because the house sold quickly and can now move on with whatever they want to do you you walk away from the closing with x xxx cash in hand investor profits just as much as you did if not more but only after they rehab house and sell it heck they might even keep the house rent it out and have a positive cash flow every month of course there are other factors to take into consideration but that is the general jist how it works in real estate investing when you put a house under contract this can actually be done for about dollars i highly recommend you check out the following website for more information and read some of the posts by other investors who are making money from this process www
