hpw should i approach my fiance's family to co sign on a house for us there is not a chance i'm asking my parents to do it i can pay almost k down on a k starter home i am a student with a lot of assets but do not have a good paying job yet only what my parents have invested in the stock market for me her family knows that i have more than enough money but how do i approach them i'm paying k month for our rent when my mortgage would be that you don't approach them to do so would be unimaginably boorish crass and rude if anyone would approach them it would be your fiance and that would be nearly as boorish crass and rude as if you had approached them what you can do is have your fiance and yourself visit with your future in laws and casually explain what you had planned to do while expressing remorse that you did not qualify for a mortgage because of inadequate income and that the only way you could qualify for the mortgage is if someone co signed it for you if your future in laws are interested in co signing for you they will offer at this point however asking them outright to co sign will place them in a very uncomfortable position if they do not offer their assistance as co signers it is safe to assume that they are not willing to do so Mortgage Bond Insurance Mutual fund Life insurance Derivative (finance) FairTax Real estate bubble Security (finance) Debt Monopoly (game) Trust (Law) USA Warren Buffett Government National Mortgage Association Modern portfolio theory Economic rent Capitalism Primerica Financial Services Capital accumulation Supply-side economics Mortgage-backed security Law of value Financial markets Savings and loan association Interest Predatory lending Annuity Gross domestic product Professor Surplus value Labor theory of value Stock Deflation (economics) PE ratio Economic inequality Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation Islamic banking Federal National Mortgage Association No Child Left Behind Act Student loan Great Depression Intellectual property Plame affair Arbitrage Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Property tax Financial services Donald Trump Pension Kasparov versus The World United Kingdom corporation tax Value added Say's law Centrelink Finance Leasing Keynesian economics New Deal Housing cooperative MMORPG Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Investment bank Futures contract Economics Hedge fund Harlem Dot-com Economy of Russia Income trust Short selling Wal-Mart Rational pricing Craps Bank History of the United States (1918-1945) Education in the People's Republic of China Municipal bond Microeconomics Political corruption Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Fixed income Economy of Africa George Brown, Baron George-Brown Rent (musical) Concurrent estate Blackjack Trust (Law) non-USA Income statement Corporate finance Foreign exchange market Corporation Knots Landing Saving (economics) Social Security debate (United States) Education in Germany
