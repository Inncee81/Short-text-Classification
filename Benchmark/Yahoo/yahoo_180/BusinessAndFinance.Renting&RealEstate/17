is it true a person can't pay cash for a house in texas my grandfather thinks so thats seems odd to me can give me any information about this several years ago there were laws that prevented you from taking out a mortgage on a home you already owned it was designed to protect you from borrowing against your homestead and maybe losing it to foreclosure i remember a lot of brokers telling people it was a risky idea to pay cash for a home because they could not borrow it back out if they needed to later i am guessing this is where your grandpa got that idea of course you have always been able to pay cash for a house here Mortgage Insurance Predatory lending Allodial title Bond Life insurance Warren Buffett Finance Stock Foreclosure Real estate broker Intellectual property Mortgage-backed security Johnny Cash Bank fraud Poker jargon Debt Rational pricing Theory of conduct Surveillance Citigroup Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Craps Adverse possession Savings and loan association Betting (poker) Personal finance Margin (finance) Copyright Annuity Piccolo Junior Saga Mergers and acquisitions Mutual fund Money Keynesian economics Squatting Derivative (finance) EastEnders History of the United States (1918-1945) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Fixed income Property (ownership right) Tom DeLay Microcredit Universal Studios Financial markets Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Interest The writing of Principia Mathematica Abraham Simpson Housing cooperative Homestead exemption ACORN Debt consolidation Password Short selling Oakland Athletics Concurrent estate Corporation Construction Dave Ramsey Great Depression Irish Property Bubble Tax Socrates Variable universal life insurance Islamic banking Savings and Loan crisis Easement Personal property Bankruptcy in the United States Credit card Habitat for Humanity International Inflation Joseph Smith, Jr. She Loves You Real estate bubble Capital accumulation Liability Rent (musical) Wheel of Fortune Home insurance New Deal Plame affair Municipal bond Big Brother UK series 6 Modern portfolio theory Collateralized mortgage obligation Nashville Skyline Mobile home Corporate finance Supply and demand Government National Mortgage Association Deflation (economics) Child support Tithe PE ratio Gambling Social Security (United States)
