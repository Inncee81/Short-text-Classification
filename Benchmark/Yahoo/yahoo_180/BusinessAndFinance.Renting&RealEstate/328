i think cemetarys are a waste of land that could be put to better use the land is for the living any cmments i agree completely its a waste to keep land which is often beautifully kept just for dead bodies this is especially problematic in the u s where bodies remain in the graves for an unlimited amount of time as opposed to some parts of europe where bodies remain in graves for a certain period of time and are then dug up so the spot can be used for a new body the land could be used for something to benefit people who can actually benefit people that are alive and the bodies could be cremated once the body is gone the person is gone it seems kind of archaic to keep the body around when the person is long gone Burial Death Burial at sea Cemetery Funeral Cremation Embalming Japanese funeral Linear Pottery culture Cryonics Mausoleum of Maussollos Prehistoric Britain Animism Vampire Jewish bereavement Jason Voorhees Football (soccer) Heinrich M__ller Laws of cricket Vlad III Dracula Property (ownership right) Urnfield Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Archaeology Alexander Technique Pol Pot John the Baptist Jewish eschatology Aegean civilization Tax Wealth Fugu Hitler's death Leasehold estate Apprenticeship Spacecraft propulsion Poker jargon Technocratic movement Corded Ware culture Avalanche Vladimir Lenin Battle of Jenin 2002 Nankana Sahib Saint Waste management Romulus and Remus Eucharist Daylight saving time Patent European Union The Waste Land Kosovo War Subjunctive mood Life insurance Resurrection British national identity card Plan de S__nchez massacre Eutrophication Hohokam Paul Is Dead Card game Operation Market Garden Night of the Living Dead Deus Ex: Invisible War English verbs Anarcho-capitalism Stomach cancer Microeconomics Trust (Law) USA Hades Social contract Post-invasion Iraq, 2003___2005 Growth hormone treatment Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Tlingit Kurt Cobain Second Amendment to the United States Constitution International Space Station Terri Schiavo Nuclear fallout Nuclear power phase-out Mojave people Capital punishment Neolithic Betting (poker) Indigenous peoples Subud Kaminaljuyu Skinny Puppy Prehistory of Cyprus Love Canal Reincarnation Anorexia nervosa Nuclear power Khmer Rouge Tennessee State Constitution Urinary incontinence Mercantilism
