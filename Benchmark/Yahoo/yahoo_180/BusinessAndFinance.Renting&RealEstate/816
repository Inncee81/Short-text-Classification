when is it truly a good time to buy a home my husband and i have been talking about buying a home for a few months now since we are both financially stable and have a baby on the way we figure that we will need more space as she gets older and or as our family grows we have looked around in different parts of town and have found a few homes that interest us within our price range but my husband says to keep putting it off until we have more money saved since the market is going to get better i don't mind living in an apartment at all since i have mostly my whole life but at the same time i keep thinking about my daughter and how nice it would be to have her grow up in a house just like my husband and i both did maybe i am just getting impatient but i feel we have more than enough money saved to do this i know that he is just concerned that we might be on a tight budget once we buy a home any advice or anyone who has been in a similar situation obviously i don't know any specifics about you and your family but i think a lot of young people find themselves in your situation generally the best time to buy a home is now what i mean is that if you compare the economics to buying now compared to waiting a year it almost always works out that being in sooner is better financially you have an additional year for building equity the way that equity increases i am assuming that you buy in a nice area with good schools where home values will slowly appreciate is as a per centage of the home's value whereas adding to your savings only increases by the amount that you can save let's say you buy a house worth k by putting down a k down payment if you waited a year you could have k for your down payment and afford a bigger house but in the meantime somebody else who bought the house with k down has a year of appreciation let's say the house went up that is of k though that is k so you have twice as much growth as the person who waits that sort of thing is the typical way the situation would work out again assuming that you buy wisely in a nice neighborhood at least start looking seriously listing positives and negatives of different houses and even different neighborhoods don't get too hung up on the negatives every house has some either you wish the yard were bigger or you are too far from work or the kitchen is ugly or whatever keep in mind that some things can be changed and some can't like you can update your kitchen when your income grows but you are never going to be able to pick up the house and plop it into a better school district you can do landscaping and painting yourselves little by little so try to look past that stuff if you can some people can't they can only see a house as it is now that is why people make money flipping houses your baby probably doesn't know that he lives in an apartment so you have time to work on this you will probably realize that the house you really want might have to be your second or even third house not the first one but the sooner you are in your first house the sooner you will be in your second house Microeconomics Gross domestic product Supply and demand Poker jargon Capital accumulation Annuity Personal finance Deflation (economics) Keynesian economics Life insurance Mortgage Shaggy dog story FairTax Infantilism Monetary policy PE ratio Bond Economy of Russia Freeters Surplus value Arthur Laffer Progressive tax Externality Theory of conduct Kitchen Warren Buffett Derivative (finance) Supply-side economics Social Security debate (United States) Friends Money Finance Real estate bubble Free trade Estoppel Health insurance Stock Debt Capitalism Urban sprawl Corporate finance Labour economics Common Agricultural Policy Divorce Tax Insurance Commodity markets Great Depression Monopoly (game) Economics Wheel of Fortune Money supply Humphrey Bogart U.S. public debt Law of value Philatelic investment Mergers and acquisitions Fixed income Gold as an investment Gold standard Option Stock market Internet fraud Mid-levels Publicly funded medicine Say's law Interest Quicksort Bank Taxation in the United States History of post-Soviet Russia Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Islamic banking Economy of the United States The McGuire Sisters Milwaukee, Wisconsin The Inside Predatory lending Primerica Financial Services Flat tax Asian financial crisis Wealth W.
