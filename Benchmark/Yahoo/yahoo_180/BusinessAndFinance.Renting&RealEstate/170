question about buying a flipped house the seller bought the house in april for they maybe put into fixing it up and now want to sell for is this justified can i lowball and get a much better price houses in the area sell for about less and in response to the person who said that they thought this price was low and should have asked for more you are an asshole and do not know what you're talking about it turns out that the owner of the house owns rental properties across the city the average price of a house sold in the area is it has been listed since april and the seller originally posted it for but changed it after only week hi if comps are k less than the that they are asking you can counter with a lower offer but the flipper is into the house for at least before you calculate in his closing costs on both sides of the deal and holding costs for a couple of months so based on market values no the price isnt justified even if they have done a gorgeous rehab job the neighborhood is not going to support the price if the true value of the property is and they are into it for they the flippers have screwed up because they are going to have a hard time selling it at the price they need to get to make the deal worthwhile as an investor i would go find another deal if i was an end user and really liked the house i would offer and see what they counter with but i wouldnt spend a lot of time on it the flippers need to get more than market value on the house they are better off holding if they can make it cashflow as a rental or they may be able to get close to the price they need if they offer owner financing on it if you are not in love with the house and they dont accept the offer look for a better deal they are out there best of luck to you barbara www therealestatebirddog com Supply and demand Microeconomics Technical analysis Capitalism Mutual fund Economics Short selling Stock Mortgage Futures contract Leasing Warren Buffett Wal-Mart Real estate broker Stock market SCO-Linux controversies Price discrimination FairTax MMORPG PE ratio Airline Inflation Monetary policy Security (finance) Bond Berkshire Hathaway Google Temasek Holdings First-sale doctrine Economy of Russia AMD Enron Corporation Gold as an investment Poker jargon Tax Commodore International ITunes Music Store Ford Motor Company Capital accumulation Supply-side economics Day trading Illegal drug trade United Kingdom corporation tax Eircom Donald Trump Labor theory of value Derivative (finance) Atari 8-bit family Internet fraud Citigroup Monopoly (game) Islamic banking Hyperinflation Transformation problem Blackjack Consumption of fixed capital Externality Rational pricing Economy of the United States Air New Zealand Law of value Margin (finance) American individualist anarchism Surplus value Insurance __lectricit__ de France Estoppel Betting (poker) Tesco Extreme Programming Economic inequality Property tax IPod Economic rent Interest Modern portfolio theory General aviation Yield curve Amway Deflation (economics) Public housing Debt Laptop Inventory Intellectual property The Apprentice 2 Credit derivative Goodness and value theory Wealth MG Rover Group Nintendo GameCube
