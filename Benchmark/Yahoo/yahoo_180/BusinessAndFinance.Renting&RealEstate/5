what is all this about mortgages on the news i hear all this stuff about mortgages on the news this weekend what does it all mean i am not very familiar with mortgages so please explain it thoroughly thanks for your help i just don't like not knowing what they are talking about on the news and was wondering if it would effect any people i know who have mortgages during the housing boom of the last few years lenders issued mortgages to many buyers who were stretching themselves financially to buy a home to make it possible for the buyers to make the mortgage payments the lenders issued adjustable rate mortgages on which the interest rate and monthly payments are very low during the first few years then increase in future years requiring higher monthly payments on the mortgage many speculators bought houses with such loans in the hope of selling them for a higher price now the housing market is in a slump and a lot of the mortgages are hitting the time when monthly payments are increasing home buyers who cannot make the higher payments are having trouble selling their homes and many of the loans are going into default that means that the banks that issued these mortgages now have to repossess the homes on which payments are not being made mortgages are in the news now because the number of defaults and repossessions is much higher than normal lenders are in financial difficulty getting study with houses that are not selling and buyers are losing their homes because they cannot make the monthly payments Financial markets Debt Federal National Mortgage Association Student loan Monetary policy Predatory lending Real estate bubble Interest Interest rate Mortgage-backed security Derivative (finance) Real estate broker Islamic banking Deflation (economics) Finance Personal finance Insurance Housing cooperative Privatization Life insurance Annual percentage rate Central bank Credit card Annuity Microeconomics FairTax Great Depression Citigroup Government debt Security (finance) Economy of Russia Futures contract Collateralized mortgage obligation Short selling Savings and loan association Economy of the United States Supply and demand Leasing Bretton Woods system Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Primerica Financial Services Hire purchase Foreclosure Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation British property bubble Irish Property Bubble British residential property market Rational pricing Taxation in the United States Mergers and acquisitions Arbitrage Federal Reserve History of the United States (1918-1945) Hong Kong Monetary Authority Stock market Inflation Money Internet fraud Real estate 401(k) Consumer finance Price discrimination Asian financial crisis Hyperinflation Credit score Mobile home U.S. public debt Temasek Holdings Credit derivative Yield curve Donald Trump Islamic economics Gross domestic product Free trade Securitization DBS Bank Concurrent estate History of post-Soviet Russia Call option Argentine Currency Board Municipal bond Conveyancing Capital accumulation Unconscionability Harlem Economy of India Dot-com
