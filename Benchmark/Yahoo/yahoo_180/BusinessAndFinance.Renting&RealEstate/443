whats shared ownership im looking to move into my first house with my girlfriend and weve seen a house thats great but it has either a to buy price or a shared ownership price what is shared ownership whats the plus and negatives about it thanks all shared ownership is where you own a percentage and the council housing association etc own the rest you pay mortgage on the bit you own and rent on the bit they own a shared ownership is great if you can't get a mortgage for the full price of the house i bought a share back in and when i had a windfall i bought another share so i just pay rent on the rest the rent is usually quite cheap but you have to be aware that even though the housing association or whoever own part of the house they are not liable for repairs etc the only problem i had was when i wanted to move my mortgage away from my rubbish bank very few lenders deal with shared ownerships if getting a house will stretch your budget get a shared ownership and buy more as time goes on Mortgage Housing cooperative Concurrent estate Islamic banking Predatory lending Great Depression Bond Leasing Monopoly (game) Insurance Federal National Mortgage Association Stock Short selling American individualist anarchism Financial markets Corporation Microeconomics Taxation in the United States Oakland Athletics Stamp duty Estoppel Derivative (finance) Finance Deflation (economics) Temasek Holdings Capitalism Donald Trump Title insurance Enron Corporation Government National Mortgage Association Citigroup Leasehold estate FairTax Bank Anarchism and capitalism Progressive tax Security (finance) Debt Money Property tax Privatization History of the United States (1918-1945) Ownership Mutual fund Cooperative Harlem Gold as an investment Economy of Russia Public housing Real estate broker Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Annual percentage rate Personal finance Gross domestic product Babylonian law United Kingdom corporation tax Interest New Deal Capital accumulation Central bank Yarralumla, Australian Capital Territory Student loan Surplus value Savings and loan association British residential property market Economy of India Islamic economics Liability Corporate finance Broadband Internet access Ericsson Property (ownership right) Advertising DBS Bank Renting Washington Mutual Gold standard Futures contract Economy of Romania Auto insurance Commodore International PE ratio Irish Property Bubble Economy of Africa Law firm Slavery Stock market Abbey (bank) SCO-Linux controversies Intellectual property Canadian and American economies compared Social Security debate (United States) Inflation Mergers and acquisitions Air New Zealand Economy of the Republic of Ireland Land use forecasting
