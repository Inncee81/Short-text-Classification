injunction bond a non certified judgement has been placed against my seller's property according to him there was no monetary awards in the case we have a buyer to buy the property but the title company is asking to take at closing for a month and then return it to him if it is unclaimed is this a good idea he is very concerned what would be the best course of action r this it sound like a lis pendens filing until the case is fully settled the other party has a permanent claim against the home if the case was fully settled and the other party did not receive any award or the award is paid in full then the filing needs released the title company believes there is no valid claim or the lawsuit was for a small amount but needs certainty i would close the loan the title insurance protects the lender buyers should always buy a policy anyway and the title policy will protect the buyer the will remain in escrow until a release has been obtained on the potential judgment i would consult the attorney preparing the deed if the case is closed it is a formality to release the claim the seller should not be concerned unless they need the money immediately in that case the seller is probably just out of luck because there probably will not be a way to get clear title otherwise Real estate broker Title insurance Insurance Contract Mortgage SCO-Linux controversies Capitalism Lawsuit Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Islamic banking Option Short selling Microeconomics Gold standard Economics Bond Financial markets Life insurance Finance Stock Internet fraud Estoppel Warranty Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal Slander and libel Trademark Privatization Hyperinflation Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Auto insurance Oil-for-Food Programme Babylonian law Price discrimination Government National Mortgage Association Surplus value Specific performance Security (finance) Predatory lending Call option Tax Credit derivative Money Annuity United Kingdom corporation tax Commodity markets Gold as an investment SCO v.
