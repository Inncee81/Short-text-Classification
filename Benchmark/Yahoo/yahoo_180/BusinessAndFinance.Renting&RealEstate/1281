renting a house my partner and i are looking to move we currentley rent a bed semi through a friend of a friend this has turned out to be a nightmare hence wanting to move rent has been paid every month on time and landlord has had no problems with us although does not want to give us a reference on top of this our credit history is not excellent although the debts were old they stay on your report for years my parents are willing to act as gaurntours for us my partner has a reference from his accountant as he is self employed and i have a bank reference and employer reference what do you think our chances are good if you've got references i cant understand why landlord doesn't want to give reference i'd be more than willing to do that if i had a good tenant everyone moves on eventually so he shouldn't be with holding a ref out of spite good luck hope things go ok just explain to new landlord the situation with the old one he will probably understand Leasehold estate Irish Land Act Monopoly (game) Renting Mortgage Avenue Q Rent control Estoppel L.
