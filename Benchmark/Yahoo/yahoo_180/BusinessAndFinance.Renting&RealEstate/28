landlady is causing an ulcer please help i have been living in my landlady's house for a about a year and before moving in paid a deposit equivalent to one month's rent i moved out at the beginning of the last month june of the contract due to an emergency and offered the deposit to cover rental arrear i do believe there were damages to this house but partly due to having moved out suddenly and partly knowing that the landlady was known to hold the deposit for unreasonable reasons i choose to forgo the deposit to cover last months rent however she is still insisiting on me paying june's rent where as i want to see a statement of damages still not made available which i am happy to settle and end the contract if its reasonable what i would like to know is am i within my right to do this and if she wished to take action against me how would she go about it would it be throught the police i am an international student so would the home office be involved in anyway the quick answer is you are not technically within your rights as a good person and tennant but it may be a good course of action for getting things sorted its not the police who will resolve this it is the courts and that is a lot of hassel for both you and the landlady which i would advise you both avoid if possible i am not advocating you not paying for anything that you reasonably owe however you are in a reversal of the normal or old before they were deposited in separate bank accounts deposit situations where you are at the landladys mercy basically i would write to her phone and politely explain the situation as you see it explain you don't think the damages amount to entire deposit and are only willing to pay when you have seen evidence of what needed to be done politey but firmly make it clear you are not going to blindly hand over money without further action from her unless you absolutely destroyed the place she should be inclined to sort it out without outside intervention and if you end up paying for whatever the damage was everyones a winner nb your situation is somewhat weakened if you need a reference in the near future Microeconomics Contract Estoppel Insurance Theory of conduct Credit card Mortgage Plame affair SCO-Linux controversies Katelyn Faber Money 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Law of value Schabir Shaik Trial Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Inflation Flood geology Appeal Economics Public policy Capital accumulation Capitalism Tax Hercules Robinson, 1st Baron Rosmead Annuity Gold standard Renting Epistemology Summa Theologiae FairTax Theodicy Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game Ethics Abortion debate Goodness and value theory Philosophy of mathematics Karl Rove Terri Schiavo Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Health insurance She Loves You Public Eye Mensal__o scandal Monopoly (game) Cheque Life insurance Domestic violence Public domain Supply and demand Babylonian law Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Copyright law of the United Kingdom Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 7 Australian constitutional law Personal finance Merit Bank Israeli West Bank barrier EastEnders Security (finance) Leasing Slander and libel John Kerr The Trial Anarchism and capitalism London Congestion Charge Bond Urinary incontinence School choice Neville Chamberlain Betting (poker) Weathermen Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Gross domestic product Socrates Tom DeLay Anarcho-capitalism Wheel of Fortune Animal Liberation Front Bretton Woods system Rent (musical) December 2001 riots (Argentina) Philosophy of space and time Civil rights Tag Trade union Slobodan Milo__evi__ Craps Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 11 Individualist anarchism
