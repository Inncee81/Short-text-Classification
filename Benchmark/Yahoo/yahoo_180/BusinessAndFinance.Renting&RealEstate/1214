what is the difference between pmi and an loan this ties back to my previous question my friends are being told their monthly payments will be around for a k house using a interest rate on a yr fixed seems impossible to me when comparing to amortization tables i come up with mo some of the answers told me the explanation could be pmi which i know means private mortgage insurance but not much other than that for my house i have a loan since i put no downpayment and my rate is about a month but my house was k i don't understand how they could pay only less than me for a house that costs so cheaper so please explain this pmi and why they just cant get an loan yes i have two loans one for at and one for at i had for a downpayment but decided to keep that cash for other purposes once i realized i could get two loans instead also this is definitely for a yr fixed not a or loan second my tax rate in my county is slightly higher than theirs okay first of all the pmi is insurance that protects the lender from you walking away whether or not this is required is based on the loan to value ratio the more of the home's value you borrow the more likely the bank is to get hurt if you bail so they usually want pmi if you go over that's why the loans were devised one thing you have to consider on an is that the loan is usually at a higher rate like up to a full percentage and they usually have a balloon meaning you pay as if it were a thirty year loan but it's all due in fifteen that scares some people now there are a lot of other factors that can make the difference in payments besides pmi and loan value taxes may be different and so might insurance there's also the term of the loan and the interest rate why can't they get an well could be credit scores could be the appraised value of the house could be that they don't want two payments maybe the balloon scared them off maybe the interest rates were so much higher remember also that pmi isn't a permanent part of the payment after a year or two if they've paid diligently and the appraised value is high enough above the loan they will stop charging pmi on request of course so the homeowner has to do something about it Insurance Bond Life insurance Annuity Predatory lending Annual percentage rate Real estate bubble Debt Bank Deflation (economics) Microeconomics Interest Credit card Savings and loan association Economy of Russia Islamic banking Primerica Financial Services Monetary policy Government National Mortgage Association FairTax Taxation in the United States Gold standard Federal Reserve Mutual fund Government debt Tax Citigroup Economy of India Money Social Security (United States) Mortgage-backed security Health insurance Credit score Subsidy Capital accumulation Personal finance United Kingdom corporation tax Microcredit Publicly funded medicine Federal National Mortgage Association Finance History of the United States (1918-1945) Islamic economics Variable universal life insurance Home insurance Debt consolidation Schabir Shaik Trial Payday loan Mobile home Interest rate Unemployment Hyperinflation Security (finance) Tertiary education fees in Australia Yield curve Title insurance Capitalism Compensation of employees Financial markets Bretton Woods system Tennessee State Constitution National Insurance Surplus value ACORN Paintball Poker jargon Education in the United States Gross domestic product Derivative (finance) Social Security debate (United States) Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Mergers and acquisitions PE ratio Real estate broker Collateralized mortgage obligation Euro Economy of Pakistan Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Certificate of deposit Health care in the United States Central bank History of post-Soviet Russia Trust (Law) USA Usury Evan Mecham Leasing Supply-side economics
