how do you sign over a house to someone privatley my auntie brought my nans house for k a couple of years back she now says she wants to sell it and is getting it valued the idea is that my nan will move in with my sister and my auntie will use the money from the house to build an extension for her now i want to put an offer on the table to her basically instead of selling the house i want to enter into a private mortgage with her instead so i will pay her every month and then borrow against the house to get my nan her extension and move into the property the question is how do i go about such a thing spending as little money as possible on any legal costs i live in the uk if i am understanding you correctly you want to have your aunt carry a silent first mortgage meaning she wouldn't record the loan with the county it would just be between you and her you would pay her on a monthly basis and then you would get an institutional loan once you are on title to the home against the property the only problem with that is that its illegal not to mention it would screw your aunt out of the equity in that home since the loan you would be getting would take first position it would get ugly if things went south some states do not allow the transfer of title without the consent of the current lien holder or requires that that lien loan be paid in full even if you can transfer title without paying off the loan on the house you will run into a seasoning issue most lenders will want you to have made months payments before they allow you to take any cash out of the house you may be able to accomplish it with private money lenders or hard money but the interest rates are not low with the current state of mortgage lending it may be even more difficult there are ways to accomplish what you are trying to do you could just buy the house from her for a reasonable price and just make a deal with her that a certain amount be given to your nan so she can put the extension on the property if she would be willing to take payments then maybe she would be willing to help you put an extention on the house after she gets a lump sum i suggest you talk to several good mortgage brokers in your area they would be familiar with the laws in your state Bond Insurance Debt Money Student loan Predatory lending Security (finance) Life insurance Annuity Government National Mortgage Association Deflation (economics) Gold standard Economy of Russia Microeconomics Stock Credit card Bank Title insurance Citigroup Federal National Mortgage Association Financial markets Annual percentage rate Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Mortgage-backed security Inflation Hyperinflation Derivative (finance) Privatization Capital accumulation Copyright Real estate bubble FairTax Gross domestic product Intellectual property Mutual fund Temasek Holdings Islamic economics Interest Central bank Donald Trump Allodial title Leasing Tax Anarchism and capitalism Money supply Mergers and acquisitions American individualist anarchism Economy of the United States Capitalism Personal finance Usury Margin (finance) United Kingdom corporation tax Economy of India Taxation in the United States Concurrent estate Savings and loan association Housing cooperative Bankruptcy in the United States Property (ownership right) Social Security (United States) Keynesian economics Government debt Rational pricing Construction Education in the United States U.S. public debt Divorce Poker jargon Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Primerica Financial Services Bretton Woods system Contract Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Labor theory of value Debt consolidation Political economy Social Security debate (United States) Schabir Shaik Trial Surplus value Flat tax Municipal bond Futures contract Corporate finance School of Salamanca Financial services
