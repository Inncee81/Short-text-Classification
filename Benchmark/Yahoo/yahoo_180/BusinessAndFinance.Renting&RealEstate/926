cntg no ko im not sure if the buyer agents will still be bringing potential buyers to a property if the home is under contigent no kick out status can someone please clarify i found out this from the web but not sure still to further clarify listings with cntg no ko have contingencies that need to be worked out but no kick out clause these contingencies are commonly inspection and financing the buyers may not get financing or the inspection may turn up issues that the buyers do not want to deal with so there is still a chance that the contract may fall out however the only time there is a contingency that the buyer sell their house first is a kick out which would allow another buyer to submit an offer and the first buyer would either have to remove that contingency or the second buyer would get the contract in nova that's listed as cntg ko once this status is up there you will proably pretty much see all interest dry up if the property is really well priced you might get a little interest and even a back up offer but this essentially means we have a contract and aren't really looking for another right now still go ahead and put in a back up if you want Real estate broker Contract Insurance Mortgage Security (finance) Conveyancing Annuity Option Put option Call option Microeconomics Stock B__rgerliches Gesetzbuch Oakland Athletics Capitalism Auction Internet fraud Standard form contract Supply and demand Credit derivative Arbitrage Islamic banking Privatization Stock market Unconscionability Illegal drug trade Coercion Oil-for-Food Programme Government National Mortgage Association American Broadcasting Company Economics Advertising Futures contract Divorce Financial markets Labor theory of value Bond Martial art Insider trading Economic relations of Japan Corporate finance Investment bank Iraq and weapons of mass destruction GNU General Public License Rational pricing Economy of Nigeria Dividend Option style Risk management Technical analysis Copyright law of the United Kingdom Tax Hire purchase 3dfx Mergers and acquisitions Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Finance Gold standard Real estate bubble Same-sex marriage in Canada Freelancing on the Internet Enron Corporation Margin (finance) Beverly Hills, California Estoppel Inventory Price discrimination Citigroup Construction Google Derivative (finance) Los Angeles Clippers Ford Sierra Naming rights MG Rover Group Babylonian law Philosophy of business Trademark Politics of Russia Harlem Monetary policy Property (ownership right) United Kingdom corporation tax LiveJournal Free software Leasing Liberty Dollar RKO Pictures Subscription business model Land reform in Zimbabwe Atari Li Ka Shing Life insurance Bumiputra Newstead Abbey Mattress Gambling Ford Motor Company Denis Law
