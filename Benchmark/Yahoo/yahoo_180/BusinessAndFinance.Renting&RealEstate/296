am i getting a great deal i am getting an offer from a builder on a almost sq ft house for about i mean it has a lot of upgrade almost a hundred thousand worth but with the real estate market going down the drain should i go forth with the deal oh yeah one thing thats bugging me is the house backs up to a street and i wandering if anyone owns a home that backs up to a street and if thae street really bothers you for instance when you're trying to sleep thank you your question sends a mixed message getting an offer sounds as though you are the seller but if the house backing up to the street bugs you now it sounds as though you're looking to purchase given the other comments i'll answer your question as though you are the buyer in order to determine if you're getting a 'great deal' you'll have to first know what the recent solds are of like properties similar age size number of bathrooms and similar amenities while there are public sites now that provide solds they are misleading you also need to know what those sites are not sharing for instance was there a seller contribution sc an appraiser will deduct the amount of the sc from the sold price for actual value in determining a 'great deal ' there must be a minimum of three comparables and at least one of those comps must be in the same neighborhood rural properties have different guidelines and i'm making the assumption this house is in a suburb another 'need to know' fact is that houses that back up to a street or unrestricted property are considered exterior lots residential property on an exterior lot will not get as high a value as it would if that same house were on an interior lot that fact needs to be factored into anyone working up the comparables for you generally speaking best buys occur with builders during pre construction close outs or if buying just before the fiscal year end for that particular builder i bought new last year during the last month of their fiscal year end and received a reduction in price money saving tip also know that upgrades is the bulk of where a builder makes its profits if ever you buy a build to suit from a builder it would be wise to purchase only those upgrades that are a part of the infrastructure for example a pest control system built between the walls of the structure go for it but if you prefer hardwoods to carpet or a microwave above the range in lieu of the standard hood save your money and take care of those things after you close unless of course time is more important to you than money in which case have them do it and be done with it if you want to take this research endeavor to another level have the agent working up the comps check out how houses have been appreciating if this builder is on the front end in building for this neighborhood chances are you'll have built in equity because builders are famous for continually going up in their prices if you're buying when in close out make sure you take the reduction in price lastly don't ever let a sales counselor bully you into thinking you can't negotiate remind them that you and their employer are the principals sales counselors are merely a facilitator to the transaction it's your money spend it wisely Tax Capitalism Supply and demand Real estate broker Mortgage Insurance Economics Economy of Russia Islamic banking Gross domestic product Illegal drug trade Stock Capital accumulation Estoppel Inflation Progressive tax Mutual fund Monetary policy Gold as an investment Wal-Mart Life insurance Short selling Publicly funded medicine Construction Day trading MMORPG Security (finance) Poker jargon Flat tax Annuity Surplus value McMansion Real estate economics Wood Wealth Warren Buffett Mergers and acquisitions Bretton Woods system Free trade Commodity Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Option Model (economics) Free market IBM PC compatible Labor theory of value Taxation in the United States Intellectual property PE ratio Political economy Hyperinflation Keynesian economics Dodge Charger Airline Law of value Urban sprawl Monopsony Economy of India Modem Berkshire Hathaway Prices of production Great Depression SCO-Linux controversies Temasek Holdings Ethical consumerism Housing cooperative Investment bank Trademark United Kingdom corporation tax Object-oriented programming Microsoft Straw-bale construction Public good Debt Deflation (economics) Economic inequality Dot-com Financial markets Mobile home Unconscionability Neopets CPU cache Surveillance Technical analysis Futures contract Credit card
