california's ellis act my neighbor lives in a unit complex her landlord filed an ellis act on her building but withdrew it before it went through so the restrictions still apply to her unit he's been making it almost impossible for her to live there she's a longshoreman and works nights he put a worker in the unit below her who's torn the same wall down rebuilt it four times and is blasting music from am pm so she had to move out my question is is she still able to move back in under the ellis act she didn't want to leave and has told the landlord numerous times in writing and in person about the noise problem but he refuses to listen i should add that he has tried numerous times to evict teh tenants in the building so he could sell it at a higher price since he bought it a year ago the ellis act relates to a landlord who decides to go out of business and take his rental units off the market the landlord files a request with the rent control board to remove or withdraw his building from rental use you said the landlord filed paperwork but withdrew the request before it was approved that means the building never changed status it is still as it was originally a unit rental property located in a rent control zone you mention restrictions that apply to her unit those specific rent control restrictions are governed by the rent control board in your city your friend can file a grievance citing all the problems she faced while a tenant unreasonable abusive noise is usually a valid grievance against the landlord she may be allowed to move back into the apartment with the same rent restrictions as before if the determination is that she was illegally forced to move she must show evidence that the landlord acted illegally your city or community might have a neighborhood housing authority or neighborhood housing office they can answer questions on tenant rights they are a good place for more information your neighborhood legal aid office can also help you on this and guide you in dealing with the rent control board if the building never changed status your friend wouldn't use the ellis act in her argument to move back into her apartment she would use the landlord's obligations to the rent control board and all other obligations he has when renting the units of the building if the landlord's request to withdraw the property was approved then later resinded your friend would then be able to use provisions of the ellis act in her argument you need to find out if this is what actually happened in court your friend might be allowed money or compensation if it's found that the landlord violated any of her rights as a tenant Eviction Estoppel Public housing Housing cooperative Rental agreement Leasing Rent control Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Supreme Court of the United States Motion picture rating system Plame affair Public domain First-sale doctrine Appeal Taxation in the United States Contract Article One of the United States Constitution Stuyvesant Town SCO-Linux controversies American individualist anarchism Copyright infringement of software Anarcho-capitalism 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Harlem Judicial review United States Constitution Irish Land Act Unlawful combatant Anarchism and capitalism Parliament of the United Kingdom Renting Copyright Controlled Substances Act Microeconomics First Amendment to the United States Constitution Israeli settlement Babylonian law Apartment Labor theory of value Australian constitutional law Waste (law) Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Immigration to the United States GNU General Public License Treaty Squatting Insurance Copyright law of the United Kingdom Arab-Israeli conflict United Kingdom corporation tax New Hampshire Supreme Court Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution Tax protester Trade union Lawrence v.
