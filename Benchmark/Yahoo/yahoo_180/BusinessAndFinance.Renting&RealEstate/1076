i decided to sell a house and the fastest way is to use one of those companies that buys the home from you and pay the mortgage off i will be making some money the house is being rented now by some family members who decided to forged my husbands signature to get another mortagage on it they ruined his credit i am turning the forged signature to the authorities and selling the house is this the right thing to do the family members refused to pay us rent so i am selling the house our lives is a living hell because of this i have no experience with this type of problems so we decided by a lawyers advice to sell the home and press charges for forgery i think we are in the right track are we guys the lawyer told us that to sue country wide we would need money because country wide the bank that accept this forged signatures is a rich company the lawyer told us selling was the way out we don't have money for a lawyer or to invest on anything right now we have kids my husband he is the one working right now our own home is falling on top of us need repairs quickly so we are practiclly giving the house for a mare thousand dollars that is after the loan is paid just to get out of this horrible situation no one would touch us for loans or refianance is just a nightmare not having an remote idea of what we are doing makes this just that worst because of lack of knoledge it took me a long time to do my homework i have now evidence of the forge signature on the loan papers this is being going on for about two years now his family refuse to talk to us to give us anything they using the home for a home group business i found out she is the one listed as a tenant not the disable people they have in there they give us no rent just bad credit the house has being for foreclosure times at my persistance they have the payments current at this time we have to sell before they do it again you probably need to decide if you are willing to send family to prison over this if not then you'll have a hard time getting anything from the local lender or closing agent title company or attorney's office for the fraud they helped out on if that's the case you need to sell the house or keep it as a rental either way you first have to have the current tenants evicted as far as the crime that has been commited your relatives are probably not the only guilty party somebody had to notarize the loan documents the loan officer had to see picture identification too criminal investigations as well as professional complaints should be filed against these two companies though i expect they won't go far if you won't also include the criminal charges on your relatives good luck to you this is a hard position to be in Mortgage 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Bank Insurance ACORN Predatory lending Debt Life insurance Great Depression Bank fraud Bond Deflation (economics) Leasehold estate Student loan Citigroup Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Schabir Shaik Trial Mutual fund Identity theft Donald Trump Primerica Financial Services Mensal__o scandal Usury Real estate broker Interest Estoppel Pretty Good Privacy Internet fraud Notary public Appeal Babylonian law Government National Mortgage Association Marshall Plan Tom DeLay Fair Game (Scientology) Alger Hiss Ronnie Earle Surveillance Karl Rove Harlem Monopoly (game) Concurrent estate Killian documents Economy of the United States George Galloway Timeline of the Enron scandal Evan Mecham Knots Landing Finance National Kidney Foundation Singapore 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities Capital accumulation Annuity Bretton Woods system Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Mikhail Khodorkovsky Avenue Q Xerox Make money fast Unlawful combatant Gold standard Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial Divorce Security (finance) Capitalism E-mail spam Wal-Mart Housing cooperative Gross domestic product Oil-for-Food Programme New Hampshire Supreme Court Personal finance Martha Stewart SCO-Linux controversies Hyperinflation Government debt 2004 U.S. election voting controversies, Ohio Conspiracy Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Lawyer Microcredit Secretar__a de Inteligencia Eliot Spitzer
