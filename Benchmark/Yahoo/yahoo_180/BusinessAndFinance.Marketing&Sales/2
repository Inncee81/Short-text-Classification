job interview round i got called back for a second interview for marketing coordinator at this point i'd like to be sure i am interviewing them as well to ensure that this job is really a fit for me they mentioned at the first interview that they previously had other people in this position within the last year and that turnover is common as with any large corporation is it okay to ask why these former employees left what they disliked about the position or do you think that is something i should stay away from i think knowing how others felt about the position gives me insight as to how i will feel about it and if i am confident enough to do the job well i also agree that the questions you mentioned are inappropriate for an interview ideally you want the interviewer to feel that you want this position over all others in the marketplace make them feel comfortable that you are certain this is the right job for you they don't want to be re conducting this same job search in a month's time however i do know of people who have asked why the person before them left but they did so in a way that sounded less intrusive something like is this a position with opportunity for advancement i was curious if the person who previously held this position moved up in the company since turnover is common you may casually ask them why this is the case just be careful not to push anyone's limits Social rule Plame affair The Apprentice 2 Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Milton H.
