so i had a nd interview today where the boss left me alone with the sales staff so that we could get to know each other and such one of the employees mentioned what her salary is plus commission the boss called me later that day and told me that his team endorses my hire he gave me a verbal offer that is less than what the one salesperson said she made and she hasn't been there long enough for it to be from a raise i was a little put off but politely told him that i was still waiting or more offers how do i handle this she is coming from pharmaceutical sales and i from telecom the job is in telecom i also have yrs sales exp i doubt she has that much first of all i found it odd that someone who did not know you would tell you how much she made would you do the same now let us assume it was true big assumption that the info is correct then you only need to focus on negotiation are you good at that without going through the details or asking you to take a class i suggest you try to push as hard as you can but without over doing it you may try to say something like i really like the job provided you had the other offers on hand don't lie but it would be a lot easier if you can adjust the offer a bit they would ask you how much you try not to give a number and ask how much more would you feel comfortable then add one of two or our personal selling features like you can help them to build business because you have the telcom exp etc at the end the employer may adjust some it is up to you then to take it or not try not to ruin anything Social rule Mattress The Apprentice 2 Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Plame affair Keynesian economics Microeconomics Unemployment Real estate broker Sales Wal-Mart Theory of conduct Employment Microsoft Extreme Programming Supply and demand Time Out of Mind Management MapleStory ELO rating system Friends Call centre Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Craps RuneScape quests Normal distribution Montreal Screwjob Economic inequality Hypnosis G-Man (Half-Life) Dog training Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus 2000 Australian Grand Prix EastEnders Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Kodocha Big Boss Milton H.
