my year old son had a root canal yesterday the dentist said part of the drill broke off in his root she also said the tooth was still infected then she went ahead and sealed it up and said she was done he's still in a lot of pain she says all this is normal any ideas i've never had a root canal but i thought the pain was supposed to go away once you were done and i thought you couldn't do it while there was still infection present thanks he doesn't have any insurance so we're paying cash for this the dentist did pack it with antibiotics and told him to come back when he came back yesterday it was still infected and they finished it anyway he was on a day course of antibiotics before they ever touched him too i just had my first root canal done back in march um i hope you didn't pay this woman because it is never okay to leave any sort of surgical or dental tool in a patient's body when she drilled into the canal she should have packed it with medicine before sealing it up they do this in steps so if this was some so called one step or one time root canal that is wrong they go in and drill a bit get the infection out pack it with medicine and they seal it up for two weeks then you go back they take all that stuff out and redo it i went back a third time they took the medicine out put whatever it is they put in there which should not hurt by the last time because the root and nerve ending are gone then they seal it with the crown some pain after is a little bit normal because they are drilling around but he shouldn't be in excrutiating pain when all is said and done you need to get him to another dentist asap then you need to contact your insurance company to stop payments because this woman in my opinion did not do her job and if the next dentist you take him to says that what she did was incorrect you need to report her to the ada and get in writing all of the things that have gone wrong Dentistry Root canal Chronic fatigue syndrome EastEnders Dental caries First aid Surgery Hey Jude Endocarditis Drill bit Tooth enamel Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Cellulitis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Traumatic brain injury Intraocular lens Traditional Chinese medicine Carpal tunnel syndrome Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Theory of conduct Babe Ruth Blood on the Tracks Milton H.
