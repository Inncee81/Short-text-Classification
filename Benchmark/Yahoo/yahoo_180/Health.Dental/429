i can't apply any pressure to the teeth that recently had cavities filled is this normal it's been one week and my teeth really hurt only when chewing typically is a tooth or teeth are sensitive once a filling is placed it will get better over time that being said you can have the dentist check it out and see if the filling is too high and needs adjusting if the filling is too high it causes you to bite harder put too much pressure which will furthur irritate the nerve if the filling was very large there could be nerve damage but they shouldn't charge you to check it out so let them take a peek and hopefully you will be feeling better soon jamrdh a dental hygienist Dental caries Tooth Tooth enamel Dental fillings Dental brace Crown (dentistry) Dentistry Oral hygiene Drill bit Gingivitis Methamphetamine Acupuncture First aid Root canal Chewing gum Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Medical prescription Pain Bruxism Fecal incontinence Chlorpromazine Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Fluoride therapy Urinary incontinence Turbocharger Loudspeaker Local anesthesia Halitosis Trigeminal nerve Equine conformation Coeliac disease Casting Dental hygienist Pneumonia Toothpaste Handloading Carpal tunnel syndrome Traumatic brain injury Hamster CPU cache Hand grenade Erogenous zone Land mine Mouth ulcer Cocaine Maxilla Fluoride Penis Vomiting Carburetor Poker jargon Prostate cancer Glaucoma Multiple sclerosis Dental implant Stuttering Breastfeeding Tire Crocodilia Amalgam The Dentist Certified Nursing Assistant Mandible Naval mine Professional wrestling holds Chair Oral cancer Cephalic disorder Diode Dental floss Oral sex Dialysis Diving Tetrapod Eczema Orthodontics Domestic rabbit Skull Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Doom enemies Erectile dysfunction Liquid breathing Eye Electrophysiology Stopping power Shark Tyrannosaurus rex Dog training Ear Fancy rat Acne Clomipramine Terminal ballistics Stem cell Motorcycle Hypertension Babe Ruth Endocarditis
