dental advice how long should fillings in between the teeth take i am years old i just had a baby months ago i went to the dentist today and he should that i have six very small cavities in between my back teeth they are going to use the resin tooth colored fillings however he said that it will take one hour per cavity i think that is silly i have never had work done on my teeth before does this sound about right should i get a second opinion and does anyone know how much fillings cost approximately i am starting to think since he wants to do the work in to different visits maybe he is just trying to get more money in visits cleaning exam etc help oh and after the cleaning and the exam i am in some pain is that normal thanks for responding terrified of the dentist in hawaii crystal to start with use warm salt water rinses to ease the soreness your experiencing sorry about that as for the fillings he has planned the composites being placed in between the teeth of molars can take some time to place and finish first he must numb you which takes a few minutes then he will need to excavate the decay clean the area and place a band that will retain the material and help to shape and contour the tooth then the tooth will be etching and rinsing thoroughly adhesive applied and then the restoration can be placed after it's cured he can then adjust the bite and polish the restoration so it will be smooth to your tongue the composite materials take a little more time to do but are esthetically pleasing and last just as long as the amalgams when he says it will take an hour for a filling and has planned several appointments for these he is probably saving you from being numb on both sides upper and lower in one visit what you've described is normal for interproximal restorations be glad he's being considerate and scheduling you for different appointments for each side rather than trying to do them all at once it sounds to me like you have a good dentist and should trust his sound judgment regarding your dental care i hope i've been of some help and good luck with your pending procedures cost for composite restorations vary from dentist to dentist and city to city but most all one surface restorations are approximately and up your case will most likely be a two surface and somewhere around per tooth additional information although you have what he considers or appears to be small areas of decay they may look that way on your x rays and with a visual exam but the only way of knowing how small is once he is in the tooth excavating the soft decay leaving you with a sound solid tooth structure to restore in other words the decayed areas may be larger than what's anticipated and he may be allowing more time for what is unexpected but possible so that you aren't alarmed being in the chair for longer than what you expected Dentistry Dental brace Tooth enamel Fluoride therapy Dental fillings Domestic rabbit Mouth ulcer First aid Wood Crown (dentistry) Casting Mattress Dentures Maxilla Urinary incontinence Mandible Cosmetic dentistry Bruxism Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma The Dentist Violin Knife Enceladus (moon) Halitosis Massage Dialysis Terri Schiavo Cocaine Hoover Dam Saxophone Hubble Space Telescope Radio controlled airplane Methamphetamine Root canal Dishwasher Multiple sclerosis Friction Prostate cancer Medical prescription Manicure Seismic retrofit Wisdom teeth Plastic Breastfeeding Place of articulation Strap-on dildo Electrophysiology Glacier Vowel Hamster Great Pyramid of Giza Tetrapod Nuclear fallout Hangul Brewery Diamond Gingivitis Equine conformation Mercury (element) Japanese tea ceremony Paint Textile manufacturing Cast iron Laserdisc Solar cell Tyrannosaurus rex Orthodontics San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Pottery Mars Exploration Rover Ultraviolet Daylight saving time Turquoise Carburetor Dental hygienist Stereoscopy Supreme Court of the United States Acupuncture Medicine Calixarene Chair Cat Tide Lunar Prospector
