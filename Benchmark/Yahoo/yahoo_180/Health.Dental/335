deep cleaning is my dentist ripping me off i have a dmo which only lets me go to a few dentists so i found a new one in my area and after the exam he said i need a deep cleaning my insurance covers everything other than what is listed as theraputic drug injection the dentist says i need one injection per quad which adds up to about dollars i do not understand why my insurance would cover everything besides the injections unless i do not really need them i asked the dentist what it was for and he said it was to kill bacteria so anyway i'm not sure if this new dentist is trying to make money off of me or if i really need to find a way to get dollars for antibacterial shots he is not ripping you off he is treating you with the best medication on the market would you want your heart surgeon doing a half ass job same with the dentist the purpose to place the antibotics is to kill the bacteria left deeeep within the pockets if you leave them open with no medication crap is just going to get back in there and start all over again the material actually helps your gums reattach to the teeth and make the pockets smaller so if you can afford it then pay the money and have it done but only in pockets mm or deeper anything else is overkill oh and nobody's under insurance covers the anitbotics so you are not alone Dentistry Tooth Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Health insurance Halitosis Acne Dental caries Tooth enamel Publicly funded medicine Poker jargon Antiseptic The Dentist Insurance Canadian and American health care systems compared Asthma Endocarditis Life insurance Medical prescription Psoriasis Surgery Medicare (United States) Intravenous therapy Stomach cancer Wound Illegal drug trade Canada Health Act Growth hormone treatment Pharmaceutical company Medicine Gingivitis Medical malpractice Arguments for and against drug prohibition Stem cell Microeconomics Warren Buffett The Shining (film) Finance Escape from New York Carpal tunnel syndrome Controlled Substances Act Physician Medicare (Canada) Bruxism Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Bulk vending Vernon Schillinger Antiviral drug National Health Service Anesthesia Billiards Betting (poker) Lethal injection Table saw Hydrogen peroxide Chewing gum Penicillin Wisdom teeth Knife Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Social Security (United States) Pneumonia Mercury (element) Radio Yerevan Blackjack Open access Money Abortion Oral hygiene Annuity Unemployment Hemp Homeopathy Earwax Dial M for Murder Toothbrush Confidence trick National Kidney Foundation Singapore Tuberculosis American football strategy Mouth ulcer Thimerosal Craps Cocaine Commodity markets Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Antibiotic Virus General practitioner United States dollar Laughing Gas (novel) Topps Emergency Medical Services AIDS Dairy Goaltender Sewage treatment Strap-on dildo Prostate cancer First aid Philatelic investment
