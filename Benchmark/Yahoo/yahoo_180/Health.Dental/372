my jaw is really sore my jaw is sore ive got a cold my jaw pops its been like this for the past days and i've looked up symptoms for tmj that cant be it cos alot of the symptoms dont apply to me i've been in the dental field for years so i know a little bit about what i'm talking about more than likely it is your tmj eventhough a lot of the symptoms don't apply anytime you have clicking or popping in the joint there is some sort of inflammation try taking mg of motrin or advil over the counter but make sure you have some food in your stomach first then apply heat to the area min on and min off for a few hours you may need to do this for several days if you're under a lot of stress you may be clenching or grinding your teeth at night while sleeping this also can cause problems with the jaw tmj you may want to visit your dentist and inquire about a night guard this keeps the teeth slightly apart at night while you are asleep and gives the muscles a break it also helps with people who grind their teeth preventing damage such as cracking or breaking teeth i know this is uncomfortable for you and i sincerely hope you find relief soon take care Bruxism Mouth ulcer Chronic fatigue syndrome Carpal tunnel syndrome Tooth Orthodontics Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Breastfeeding Methamphetamine Psoriasis Dental caries Tooth enamel Dentistry First aid Equine conformation Stomach cancer Group A streptococcal infection Urinary incontinence Osteoarthritis Social rule Cocaine Gingivitis Neuralgia Coeliac disease Traumatic brain injury Professional wrestling throws Oral and maxillofacial surgery Dentures Asthma Sleep apnea Insomnia Drill bit Mattress Alzheimer's disease Myocardial infarction Tyrannosaurus rex Gout Eczema Fibromyalgia Shark Welding Narcolepsy Halitosis Cramp Pneumonia Dialysis Cancer Dog Paget's disease of bone Crown (dentistry) Manual transmission Fecal incontinence Medicine Gastroesophageal reflux disease Hip fracture Herpes simplex virus Stroke Decompression sickness The Legend of Zelda series enemies Hypertension Radiation poisoning Post Polio syndrome Embouchure Trigeminal nerve Esophageal cancer Milton H.
