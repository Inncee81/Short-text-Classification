am i teething my wisdom teeth are growing now and it hurts itches all i want to do is bite on something to relieve the irritation i believe that this would be time to have an appointment with your dentist if your wisdom teeth are trying to erupt or coming through the gum i do not think it would be a good idea to bite on something that may cause you to have more of a problem some mouth washes have alcohol in them and cause burning pain your gum will probably become more painful with time be careful of the mouthwash you use a dentist will be your best option he may want you to take an antibotic for infection if it is present many people have problems with their wisdom teeth and have to have them eventually removed Dental caries Dentistry Wisdom teeth Gingivitis Halitosis Oral hygiene Breastfeeding Tooth enamel Mouth ulcer Bruxism Psoriasis Crown (dentistry) Dental brace Fecal incontinence First aid Oral cancer Dentures Cirrhosis Certified Nursing Assistant Itch Methamphetamine Bubblegum The Dentist Endocarditis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Traumatic brain injury Body piercing Cocaine Hydrogen peroxide Chewing gum Tobacco smoking Toothpaste Root canal Dental floss Carpal tunnel syndrome Anesthesia Eczema Babe Ruth Coeliac disease Glossitis Chronic fatigue syndrome Listerine Al-Razi Callus Scabies Tarantula Urinary incontinence Earwax Pain Pneumonia Prostate cancer Yarrow Antiseptic Theory of conduct Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Stomach cancer Dandruff Surgery Diarrhea Gastroesophageal reflux disease Cancer Xerostomia Clomipramine Clove Otitis externa Esophageal cancer Mosquito Orthodontics Tongue piercing Goodness and value theory Ferret Aspartame Horse tack Alcoholics Anonymous Hamster Shaving Stoicism Medical analysis of circumcision Shark Polyols Domestic rabbit Chlorpromazine Lyme disease Hypoglycemia Cat James Robson Diving Toothbrush Oz (TV series) Common cold Guinea pig Jock itch Hell Capsaicin Nine Inch Nails Kim Possible Rosacea Crohn's disease
