i ate hard chips with braces but i didn't break a bracket or wire is my teeth fine or my braces fine or will it affect the allignment of my teeth that quickly because im under treatment im worried i would say if it didn't do anything nothing broke or snapped or bent than it is fine this time i wouldn't get into the habit of eating these foods because after a while some is going to happen and you are going to be sorry because then you will have to get it fixed at the ortho and he will probably ask if you ate anything you weren't supposed to and you shouldn't lie lol when i had my braces i chewed gum for one day on a plane so i wouldn't get a huge headache from the pressure and the next time i went to the ortho i didn't think it had done anything but it had and the ortho could tell i had been chewing gum so it's better to just follow the rules lol good luck Tooth Drill bit Mojave people Chewing gum Dentures Dental caries Tobacco Happy Tree Friends Tooth enamel Cocaine Food Knife FoxTrot Paget's disease of bone Halitosis Kosher foods The Fairly OddParents Domestic rabbit Bracket Theory of conduct The Dentist Dog training Kodocha Fecal incontinence Singlish Squirrel Piccolo Junior Saga Topps Humphrey Bogart Woodworking Wood carving Psilocybin Fancy rat Hamster Philosophical skepticism Bubblegum Bulk vending Poker jargon Procrastination Shaggy dog story Atari 8-bit family Wire B-47 Stratojet Binge eating disorder Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Blur Slot machine Dentistry Equine conformation Scoliosis Donald Neilson Bruxism 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Frugivore Kasparov versus The World Garfield Pastel Deformation Ron Weasley Cheese Tetrapod Debugging Sugar substitute Second Battle of the Atlantic IBM PC compatible Traumatic incident reduction Friends Betel nut Laws of Singapore IPod Charles Goodyear Mastication Orthodontics Seabiscuit Meme Craps Oral sex Neighbours English grammar Fluoride therapy Carpal tunnel syndrome Potato Babe Ruth 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Olduwan Fokker D.VII Themes in Blade Runner Social rule Luck The dozens Hal Trosky Tire Trapping Stewie Griffin IPod shuffle Days of our Lives Pan Am Flight 103 Characters in the Smurfs
