will a teeth whitening procedure last so i haven't had the best teeth infact i'm a little embarrassed of them and wish i could improve their colour they're slightly yellowish and it turns out that's my natural colour and not some stains you can remove with teeth cleaning my local dentist does teeth bleaching for around but only said that it lasts months to a year do these procedures typically last that long what other alternatives do i have that actually work like strips do they make a difference i'm kind of desperate at this point sigh but don't know if i'm willing to pay so much for such a short term thing any help will do the over the counter bleaching strips do help some people it may take more than one box to get a decent amount of change in your color i think what the dentist may mean is that you might need a touch up now and then after you bleach i'm not sure if he is using an at home tray system for you or doing the bleaching all in his office if its an at home tray system all you need to do is buy extra bleach and wear your trays once a month or so most bleaching will last longer than a year in fact i doubt your enamel color will darken to its original color if it does it should take longer than a year we use something in our office called deep bleaching it is a combination of in office sessions and week at home bleaching tray session we have had great success with it and it is supposed to be permanent if followed correctly Tooth enamel Tooth Textile manufacturing Hydrogen peroxide Tooth bleaching Fluoride therapy Japanese tea ceremony Color Dental brace Drill bit Menstrual cup Color blindness Mattress Flour Poker jargon Surveillance Bleach Acne Nirvana (band) Domestic rabbit Water purification Softball Dentistry Dishwashing Upholstery Incandescent light bulb Dental caries Patent Craps Theory of conduct Turquoise Menstrual cycle Customs and etiquette of Japan CPU cache Technicolor Oral sex Blackjack Laundry detergent Sodium hypochlorite Social rule Goodness and value theory Scientology beliefs and practices Leaf New York Giants Torquay United F.C.
