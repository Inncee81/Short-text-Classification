i chipped my tooth about years ago had it capped everything was fine after brushing my teeth with baking soda a few days ago not a normal practice for me my tooth has been hurting where the chip is i get the sensation that its chipped again it sucks to eat right now and i did notice that there is a faint little brown spot on a corner where the tooth and cap meet am i going to die just kidding but is my tooth rotting or what the hell is going on hi i've been in dentistry for over years and unless the dentist ground your tooth down and took lots of impressions with a tray of material in your mouth for several minutes at a time you do not have a cap or crown same thing the covers the whole tooth to the gum line i'm guessing that you had a chair side plastic acrylic crown and these only a few years if he did a filling that is something completely different crowns caps don't break off if they do you would see the metal underneath i would call the dentist and make an appt if the material came off i bet you have decay under it and that is why it fell off the very best thing is get an experts hands on and get fixed now before you need a root canal the exposed dentin will hurt because it has no protective layer of enamel marie Tooth enamel Dentistry Poker jargon Knife Bruxism Crown (dentistry) Dental brace Dentin Fluoride therapy Betting (poker) Plastic Bong Root canal Paint Nine Inch Nails The Dentist The Legend of Zelda series enemies Oral sex Laser engraving Drill bit Mattress Happy Tree Friends Dental fillings Ivory Shark Glacier Cocaine Tooth development Mouth ulcer Casting First aid Desert Amalgam Cookware and bakeware Floppy disk Halitosis Kim Possible Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Corrosion Tooth bleaching Tetrapod Orthodontics Seismic retrofit Toothbrush The Fairly OddParents Evidence of evolution Dentures Raisin Craps Vermicompost Hand grenade Netsuke Oral hygiene Wisdom teeth Cosmetic dentistry EastEnders The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap Bulk vending Cigar Pastel Eric Cartman Breastfeeding Gingivitis Chopsticks Stairway Snooker Collecting fossils Clothing Leaf The Shining (film) Buster (comic) Glass Bread Woodworking Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Carnivorous plant Columbine High School massacre Sawfiler Tyrannosaurus rex Gold American Pie (song) Pantera Chewing gum Honey fungus Manicure Screw Nile crocodile Textile manufacturing The Amazing Race Tuff Wood Wood carving USS Yorktown (CV-5) Potato
