another wisdom tooth question whats normal for wisdom teeth that grows unimpacted i can't find anything online about whats normal for healthy wisdom teeth that grows in and has enough space its very annoying i have no medical and can't afford to go in and pay bills if theres no reason to go in i just am really starting to overly stress so hopefully someone can help me im usually very good at handling pain but this pain is quite intolerable at times i have a wisdom tooth and it clearly has enough room coming in but theres flaps of flesh covering the half closest to the back is that normal when i pull it back there is weird tasting blood coming out but just a lil bit is that normal is it normal for the flesh to be somewhat red from the crown under it or an infection from food debris my mouth has a hard time opening at times but its not really that swollen the pain is pretty contant but dissappears at times there is a hard dot like thing around the white stretch mark like flesh at the very back above the wisdom tooth at the arch thanks for taking the time what you're describing is called an operculum and it is a flap of gum tissue that covers the erupting tooth the flap of gum traps food particles and can become inflamed and infected it's not normal but it occurs frequently it is hard to keep clean because of this too if the tooth is erupting in a good position and there is enough room for it in your mouth then a dentist may be able to remove the flap of gum a small surgical procedure and this will allow the tooth to erupt fully and stop the infection in the mean time get a syringe from the pharmacy with a blunt ended needle and syringe under the flap with warm salty mouth rinse tsp salt in cup of warm hot water or use savacol mouthwash in the syringe to keep it clean don't poke around it and try not to be too rough when you brush if the infection gets worse and you notice a bad taste smell get some antibiotics ideally see you dentist http www providence org healthlibrary contentviewer aspx hwid hw servicearea generic Tooth Wisdom teeth Mouth ulcer Halitosis Dental caries First aid Intravenous therapy Tooth enamel Cat Oral hygiene Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Body piercing Dentistry Domestic rabbit Endocarditis Prostate cancer Fancy rat Traumatic brain injury Abortion Breastfeeding Tattoo Stomach cancer Leaf Dentures Chronic fatigue syndrome Dental brace Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Shark Carpal tunnel syndrome Penis Urinary incontinence Bong Kidney Common cold Psoriasis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Snake Needle aspiration biopsy Hamster Al-Razi Diarrhea Guinea pig Carnivorous plant Fugu Knife Cellulitis Cancer Autopsy Foodborne illness Medical prescription Aortic dissection Earwax Menstrual cup AIDS Milton H.
