sooo i need help my electric toothbrush fell in the toilet by accident and its brand new lol d well my question is should i pick it up and wash it with soap or with what and will it take all the bacteria out or should i just throw it away i think its kinda nasty to use it again but i did pay for it most electric tooth brushes come with adjustable heads that you can just take off and buy replacements for and you won't have to buy a whole other tooth brush just replace the head they sell them at various stores i would try where you originally bought it they might sell the replaceable tops there that's how mine is but if yours isn't like that i agree that boiling it for a few minutes would be your best bet anything else probably wouldn't be thorough enough good luck Tooth Poker jargon Hygiene Toothbrush Personal property Lionel Corporation ITV Procter & Gamble Sento UK Singles Chart Craps New England Patriots Japanese toilet Nuclear power Krusty the Clown Oral hygiene Hiberno-English Dairy Textile manufacturing Knots Landing Make money fast Betting (poker) Esperanto grammar Cruising (maritime) Neopets Toilet Game show Economics Toothpaste Dental floss Conker's Bad Fur Day Halitosis Filling station Agar plate Hand washing RuneScape economy Animal Crossing RuneScape quests Brush Tooth enamel New York Giants Nuclear power phase-out Hard disk First aid Bulk vending Electric motor Gross domestic product Big Brother (USA TV series) Menstrual cup Water purification Mattress Palindrome Ganesha Autonomous building New York Knicks Alcoholic beverage British Rail Class 86 Washroom Monopoly Hasbro Plastic Microeconomics Washing machine Brand Egg (food) De Lorean DMC-12 Draw poker Tofu GunBound Dodge Neon Hollywood Squares Married... with Children Bass guitar Nuclear reactor Doomtown Supply and demand Radio controlled car Auction Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Fecal incontinence Fossil fuel power plant Pittsburgh Steelers Fluoride therapy Say's law Laws of cricket Francis Bacon (painter) New York Jets 1919 World Series $ale of the Century Sears Holdings Corporation Escape from New York Procrastination Dental caries Donkey Kong 64 Card Sharks Aztec Los Angeles Clippers Knife Pete Rose Boil
