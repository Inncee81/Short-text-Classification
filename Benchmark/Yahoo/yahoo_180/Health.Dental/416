how do i make my teeth white i have braces on right now but in a month im getting them off so how to i make my teeth look very white overall i would say that most of my patient's have had some measure of success with the crest whitestrips some more than others the results are usually pretty quick noticeable in the first few days best in a week or longer our office uses crest supreme which are much stronger than what you can buy in a drugstore and don't cost that much more vs you can purchase the drugstore version but if you can do yourself the favor of using them right after you get your teeth cleaned as any staining and buildup tartar or plaque will impede their ability to work also don't use fluoride toothpaste before putting the strips on same reason the strips are probably your best low price alternative much less than in office whitening or custom trays about i am also hearing happy reviews with the aquafresh whitening trays unlike the strips they don't have the tendency to slip or move all of the methods strips trays custom trays in office whitening have the potential to make your teeth temporarily sensitive but will not harm the enamel if you get sensitive use the product every other day in conjunction with a sensitive tooth toothpaste you might try to drink dark liquids through a straw and don't smoke most whitening toothpastes just remove stain on the surfaces of your teeth and therefore are not so effective whatever method you use it will not whiten your teeth for life as you age your teeth will get darker and may need to be whitened again also wait a few weeks after your braces are off so the gums which often get swollen with the braces on a chance to shrink back to normal and of course have them cleaned first you don't want any cement that is left over to block the whitener good luck jamrdh a dental hygienist hope that helps Tooth Fluoride therapy Dental caries Toothpaste Dental brace Halitosis Oral hygiene Hydrogen peroxide Plastic Dentistry Drill bit Cocaine Chewing gum Transformer Upholstery Mouth ulcer Tooth bleaching Oral sex The Apprentice 2 Allergy Gingivitis Equine conformation Prostate cancer Psoriasis Crown (dentistry) Explosive material Cosmetic dentistry Methamphetamine Social rule Poker jargon Corrosion Growth hormone treatment Chronic fatigue syndrome Inflation Dairy Insurance Breastfeeding Titanium Dentures Acne Ultraviolet Domestic rabbit Bong The Dentist Knife RuneScape weapons Insulin Cancer Mattress Rum Fancy rat Wal-Mart Dental floss Raisin Tobacco Bulk vending Woodworking Textile manufacturing Bicycle lighting Sento Supply and demand Bruxism Water purification Audio data compression Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Wisdom teeth Hamster Clinical depression Stroke Diamond enhancement Magnetic resonance imaging Coeliac disease Urinary incontinence Acupuncture Homeopathy Food Sewage treatment Deflation (economics) Plame affair Coca-Cola Menstrual cup Short selling Normal distribution Nutrition Maxilla Theory of conduct Mesothelioma Bretton Woods system Japanese tea ceremony Arbitrage Medical analysis of circumcision Abortion debate Certified Nursing Assistant 2000 Australian Grand Prix
