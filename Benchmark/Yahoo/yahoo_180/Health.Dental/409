how to make them whiter how can you make your teeth cleaner and whiter i have braces and the thing i am worried about is having marks when i get them off i brush twice a day and even sometimes three times a day though no effect on the teeth i don't want marks on my teeth any suggestions you are actually talking about two different issues here whitening and white spots unfortunately you cannot whiten with braces on the whitening agent will not be able to get under where the brackets have been cemented onto the teeth if you do use a product you run the risk of have different colored rectangles on the center of your teeth when the brackets are removed once you braces are removed have your teeth cleaned and then whiten them sorry i don't have any other options for you however the white spots are caused by plaque that hasn't been cleaned off and has started to cause decay or decalcify the tooth in order to prevent these you should be having regular dental cleanings and checkups you should be brushing very often flossing or using a proxybrush to clean in between the teeth and around the brackets and using an over the counter fluoride rinse like act or fluorigard or using a high concentration fluoride toothpaste prescribed by your dentist or orthodontist to help remineralize build up the decalcified areas susceptible areas so do your home care and some rinsing along with good diet and hopefully you will be ok hope that helps jamrdh a dental hygienist Tooth Dental caries Tooth enamel Fluoride therapy Dental brace Dentistry Toothpaste Gingivitis Fluoride Halitosis Orthodontics Dental floss Mouth ulcer Methamphetamine Crown (dentistry) Listerine Drill bit Toothbrush Glossitis The Dentist Chewing gum Tooth bleaching Wisdom teeth Cosmetic dentistry Hydrogen peroxide Bracket Sugar substitute Medical prescription Soap Dentures Contact lens Dry cleaning Coeliac disease Upholstery Mercury (element) Oral sex Hygiene Fluorine Acne Prostate cancer Calcium Dental fillings Radon Alzheimer's disease Certified Nursing Assistant Psoriasis Hamster Dental hygienist Chronic fatigue syndrome Breastfeeding Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Foodborne illness Mesothelioma Bruxism Fancy rat Domestic rabbit Natural Hygiene Raisin White noise Textile manufacturing Growth hormone treatment Sento Raw food diet Social rule Last Exit to Springfield Cocaine Milton H.
