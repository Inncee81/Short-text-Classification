how do convince an autistic boy not to touch himself in public i have two sons with autism both have very serious speech delays and both have a terrible habit of holding their privates like they're afraid it's going to fall off i figure it's just a sensory issue but it's so embarassing they often attract enough attention as it is and most of the time people over look they're tics but this is one of those social tabboos that seems to be on the unforgivable list can anyone offer some advice please thank you everyone for your very helpful advice i was very concerned that if the boys continued with this behavoir it would continue onto adulthood but i now see that may not be the case once again thank you consider attaching a high stimulus item to his belt when he goes to touch his privates gently guide his hand to the other stimulus praise and or give a food reward make sure you aren't giving too much attention to the problem behavior in fact when you move his hand say nothing completely ignore it find out what sensory object he likes at home and then practice having him play with it on his belt sometime autistic kids find a particular enviornment too stimulating and need to be able to ground themselves by manipulating an item Autism Asperger syndrome Autism rights movement Controversies in autism Sensory Integration Dysfunction Autism epidemic Ethical challenges to autism treatment Controversies about functioning labels in the autism spectrum Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Milton H.
