of mice and men hello i really need help with closing arguments that i have to write to the jury in this assignment they're are putting george on trial for murdering lennie and i have to choose whether george is guilty or not guilty of murdering lennie i think that he is guilty because if prerhaps he would have not killed lennie and he would have been excused pm grounds of lack of mental competence and may have been given a better life than had with george so what i need help with is how to start my closing arguments and a few points to back my arguement i will truly appreciate your help i'm not being lazy ihave been working on this assignment for a long time and i desperatley need help now thank you once again well lennie would have been killed by curley he wasn't going to be taken for trial he was going to be lynched so george killed him as an act of mercy to spare him from suffering distracting him with the story when he did it it was almost a form of euthanasia however that does not make it legally excusable george intentionally and willfully killed lennie he didn't do it in self defense or by accident given the circumstances the charge might get knocked down to manslaughter but that's only if the court or jury feels merciful Murder Insanity defense Mumia Abu-Jamal Euthanasia Wyatt Earp Gwen Araujo EastEnders Jury trial Of Mice and Men Plame affair 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Leo Frank Suicide O.
