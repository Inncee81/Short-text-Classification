help describe ways students with ld could describe ways students with ld could be included in the regular education science or social studies class if their reading levels were well below the textbook level this is where you and the teacher need to collaborate you would modify the curriculum for those students even have an aide go to class with them for support students should not be sitting together as a group for that would defeat the one of the purposes of inclusion but among their peers there are times that this might be ok for certain activities but make sure gen ed students were also included the aide would be in the classroom to learn what the students are learning and to 'help' any student having difficulty but also concentrating on your students at times a behavior may need to be addressed and that could be accomplished just by the presence of the teacher or aide moving into the vicinity all work could certainly be modified shorter assignments taking tests back in their classroom oral testing give any notes to students ahead of time directly from the teacher during their class time in the sp ed class can be a time for them to get direct instruction for that class in that someone can read the material to them giving only the pertinent information alternative assignments may be accepted such as a drawing or other project in place of the gen ed assignment another advantage of inclusion is for the sp ed students to have peer models for behavior and social skills not to mention work habits and to be exposed to grade level curriculum make sure the teacher knows the limitations of each student so that they are not put in awkward positions as this can be the direct cause of behavior issues these are some of the things we did when i worked at a full inclusion school well mostly full Homeschooling Intelligent design movement Experiential education Education in the United States Teach the Controversy Kindergarten Secondary education in Japan Graduate school Education in Romania SAT CPU cache Asperger syndrome Master's degree No Child Left Behind Act Affirmative action Center for Science and Culture Secondary education in France Education in Taiwan Special education Education in Germany Sex education Education in Australia Massachusetts Institute of Technology Standardized testing Grade (education) College Academia A Course In Miracles Dyslexia Economics Test (student assessment) Education in Portugal Waldorf Education Reading recovery Education in Hong Kong IB Diploma Programme Medical school Education reform Murdock-Portal Elementary School Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Teacher Assessment College admissions Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Extreme Programming Education in Albania James Ruse Agricultural High School Martial art Creation and evolution in public education Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Hampshire College Social psychology Primary education __mile Durkheim Literacy A-level Physician Section 28 Middle school Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Tripartite System Hogwarts subjects Japanese tea ceremony Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination Danish Folkeskole Education Cooperative education Psychology Boston Public Franklin W.
