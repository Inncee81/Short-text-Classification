my four year old grandson is autistic and does not talk at all when are they too old to learn to talk the most important thing is to know that even though he may not be talking he is listening and that is still developing the part of his brain that is responsible for language as long as the language center of our brains are being used there is no window of time you can put on his talking that part of the brain only shuts down when it is not being used at all keep talking to him even if he doesn't look like he is listening he does hear and understand far more than he is able to communicate autism is like a prison that they cannot get out of imagine wanting to answer someone's question but you can't you know the answer but you can't make facial gestures and speak then the person you are desperately trying to communicate with goes on like you don't know anything and ignores you or doesn't listen to you that's what it's like it can be so frustrating for an autistic child talk to him read to him and point to the words in the book while you are reading them re read books over and over Autism Autism rights movement Autistic spectrum Controversies in autism Ethical challenges to autism treatment Controversies about functioning labels in the autism spectrum Autistic community Autistic culture Facilitated communication Aphasia Stuttering Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Learning disability Social rule Theory of conduct Neurodiversity English grammar Communication skill Hearing impairment Past teachings of Prem Rawat Traumatic brain injury Singlish Rain Man Dyslexia Donald Davidson (philosopher) Pervasive developmental disorder American Sign Language Noam Chomsky Body language Empathy Origin of language Second language acquisition Shaggy dog story Theory of mind Sign language Autistic savant Picture thinking Deconstruction Neurotypical Gifted Datalore (TNG episode) Milton H.
