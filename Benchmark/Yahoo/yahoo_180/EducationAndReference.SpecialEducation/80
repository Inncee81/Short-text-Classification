does anyone know about a program called rsp do you think it is a good one or not i was in this program called rsp when i was younger we had normal classes but we were considered special ed students the only difference we had was a teacher that came in to help us i feel this program really hurt my education but i was wondering what others thought i was in rsp when i was younger i remember being pulled from class and given extra help and also attending regular classes i think this hurt my education i was wondering what others thought of this program there are three major models to deliver services to students with special needs the two traditional models were rsp resource specialist program and sdc special day class sdc is when students are removed from regular classes for most or all of the day presumably because they have disabilities considered severe rsp is when students are pulled out from their regular class for less than half of the day for extra help the difficulty with rsp is that it puts the special ed and general ed teacher in competition for access to the same student for example the student might get the extra help that they need in math but then get behind in science that is one reason why i shifted from being an rsp teacher to being an sdc teacher now a new model is catching on called inclusion in which the special ed teachers and aides go into the regular classes to help students with extra needs that way gains in one area are not paid for with losses in another Education in the United States X86 assembly language Education in the People's Republic of China Special education Homeschooling Graduate school Education in Portugal Charter school Education in Romania Education Teacher Dyslexia Education in Australia High school Asperger syndrome Education in Taiwan Secondary education in Japan Secondary education in France College admissions Merrimack College Kindergarten Experiential education Waldorf Education Columbine High School massacre Inflation Affirmative action Inheritance (computer science) M60 machine gun Gifted Education Programme (Singapore) Social rule GED Carnegie Mellon University Williston Northampton School Caulfield Grammar School Down syndrome The College of New Jersey Students' union Education in Germany B-1 Lancer Tai Chi Chuan Learning disability University of North Texas PLATO French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools SAT Education in Austria Object-oriented programming College Education in France Master's degree Intelligent design movement Boston Public Athabasca University University of Chicago Martial art Central processing unit Alexander Technique Miami-Dade County Public Schools University of Michigan Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Microsoft Office Stuyvesant High School Microeconomics Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Educational perennialism The Sims 2: University Grade (education) Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Columbia University Aikido Poker jargon Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Professor Baseball Class (computer science) Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy IB Diploma Programme Georgia Institute of Technology Anorexia nervosa Music lesson Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Japanese tea ceremony Independent school (UK) Education in South Korea The Adventures of Pete & Pete Pittsburgh Steelers Glossary of American football Jaime Escalante Economics Power (sociology) Voluntary Student Unionism Hearing impairment Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Niagara University Education in Japan Education in India Reiki Raffles Institution
