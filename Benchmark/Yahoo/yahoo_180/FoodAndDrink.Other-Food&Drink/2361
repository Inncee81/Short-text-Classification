should eggs be kept in the fridge and if yes why arent they in the fridge at the supermarket i work at sainsburys and the eggs are not in the fridge they are on a shelf next to the refridgerated aisle it's more a question of how long the eggs are kept in a particular environment the eggs in your store probably spend on average a few hours on the shelf for that amount of time why waste the valuable and limited refrigerator case space on a high volume and relatively inexpensive commodity item like eggs the eggs are probably kept in cool conditions through much of the delivery and storage chain before being put on that shelf if you plan on using them within no more than a few days there may even be advantages to keeping them at room temperature otherwise i'd keep them in fridge where they will usually remain good for a month that's what i do because i don't use many eggs but i when i do i don't have time to make a special trip to get some in the retail food business there are lots of items like that many items in the produce department especially fruit are sold on room temperature tables you may even keep them on the counter to soften or ripen for several days yourself but almost all of them are stored cold before being put out for sale and if not sold are gathered and put back in the walk in cooler overnight there's even the beer that made a big deal in its advertising that was brewed cold filtered cold stored cold and shipped cold yet at almost every retailed it was sold warm in a pile on the floor or shelf right next to all other beers Brewery Refrigerator Supermarket Ice cream Retailer Beer Wal-Mart Solar power Organic food Aldi Sears Holdings Corporation Cuisine of Denmark Autonomous building Alcoholic beverage Dairy Jardine Matheson Holdings Limited Tesco J Sainsbury Hard disk Coffee Brewing Refrigerator car RFID Kitchen Tea Dairy Farm International Holdings Limited Overclocking Energy development McDonald's In-N-Out Burger Lager HVAC Nuclear power RuneScape economy Air conditioning Sake Banana Food Food storage E85 Pebble bed reactor Ozone depletion Foodborne illness Plastic Bread Hamburger Carbon dioxide Library Inventory Fry's Electronics Vitamin C Betting (poker) Electronic commerce Carburetor Woolworths Limited Rum Alcohol fuel Ozone hole Capercaillie Battery (electricity) Bulk vending The Long Tail Japanese tea ceremony Argos (retailer) Menstrual cycle Poker jargon Diamond Welding Atlantic Ocean Morrisons Temperature Nuclear reactor Hydrogen economy Guinness Vestey Group Thermal power station Utility cycling STS-62 Diesel engine Animal Crossing Cheese Fire fighting Food science Bong Tesco Ireland Cannabis cultivation Biodiesel Climate of the United Kingdom Tomato Explosive material No frills Veganism New Coke CPU cache Cider Thermoregulation Battery electric vehicle South African Breweries
