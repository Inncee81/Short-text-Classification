stale ryvita is it ok to eat stale ryvita i only ask this because i took ryvita to work with me and it wasnt as crunchy still yummy though i ate all three so it obviously wasnt that bad i've always liked ryvita not in any major way i mean it's not chocolate is it but as a pleasant crunchy alternative to bread i like it very much it surprises me when people claim to dislike it because the taste seems to me rather bland nothing much to dislike about it really unless i'm missing something what is ryvita it's a crispbread made of rye with a little salt added there are variations as always when a long standing product is brought up to date a particularly good one has sesame seeds added although they rather tend to fall off there is also a 'light' version and a 'dark' version although the only difference appears to be the shade of colour perhaps they're made with a different type of rye but the basic plain traditional ryvita has not changed as far as i can tell in the decades i've been eating it how is it sold it's packaged in a fairly efficient brightly coloured strong paper pack which is biodegradable so that's a plus from the environmental point of view i believe it only comes in one size in the uk the g pack which contains about ryvita crispbreads in europe it's sold in g packs it usually costs somewhere between p and p for a g pack at a supermarket each unit within the pack is a crisp rectangle about cm by cm in size they're brown in colour with a pattern of bumps on one side smoother on the other reasonably attractive i suppose although the colour isn't terribly exciting how do you eat ryvita i have to admit that if you try it alone it would be rather boring just crunchy nothingness really with a mild salty taste but add toppings and it becomes quite delicious my current favourite is to spread very thinly with not too hard butter or a decent quality soft margarine i usually go for olivio then equally thinly with marmite and then a couple of slices of a mild cheese such as gouda or mild cheddar yum another possibility is cream cheese again thinly spread with marmite and a few slices of cucumber i know people who eat it with ham and mustard or even butter and jam or chocolate spread the possibilities are endless the only warning i would give is that it doesn't work too well with tomatoes since the juices tend to run and make it go rather soft the best thing about my favourite way of eating ryvita is the crunchy texture contrasted perfectly with the smoothness of the cheese is it good for you it's certainly low calorie four slices provide calories apparently and can be eaten as part of a low fat plan of course that's not terribly helpful because i don't think many people would eat ryvita by itself and once you add your high calorie cheese or butter it takes on plenty of calories and fat however i suppose you could top it simply with low fat margarine and marmite and that would make a pleasant snack for someone trying to lose weight in addition it's wheat free so someone trying to cut down or cut out wheat products due to specific intolerances may find ryvita a useful alternative to bread particularly if they don't like rice cakes however it's not gluten free so someone with coeliac disease does need to cut out rye products as well as those with wheat how to store it if you're going to eat a pack within say a week then so long as you open the pack fairly carefully and fold it closed over the remaining ryvita each time you probably don't need to worry although putting it in an airtight container would ensure it stayed crispy if you're going to take longer than a week to finish a pack then it's definitely a good idea to keep it out of the air the best way to do this is to put it inside a ziplock style plastic food bag then squeeze out the air before sealing it then put it in a box or tin with a lid as well only don't forget about it by the time it's been opened for six months or more the texture will be far less pleasant and it will also taste a little stale it probably won't do any harm to eat a stale ryvita i don't think they ever go bad but it's not recommended what about the alternatives we've tried some of the supermarket own brand rye crispbreads but they don't really compare to ryvita they're not all that much cheaper but there are usually fewer in a packet as they're a bit thicker they also tend to taste a bit like cardboard to me even when i've added the toppings they're far more likely to be put in a tin and forgotten about so all in all i would recommend ryvita
