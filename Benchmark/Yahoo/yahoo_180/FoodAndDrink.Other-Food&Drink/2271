this one's for chefs experts when melting chocolate i'm about to start making a chocolate mousse and i've read in different places that the water where the bowl containing the chocolate to be melted is sunk in should not be boiling so i assume it must not be on the fire while melting the chocolate either does anybody know why is this i thought the hotter the water was the better as it'd melt faster isn't it going to take forever to melt it by doing this i e not letting the water boil thanks for any light you can shed on this you can really tell i'm a newby at this so that's why i'm interested in learning something new thanks everyone for the great advice i'm glad i asked you i was going to make it all wrong i followed your indications and the chocolate was really smooth and creamy never separated now the mousse is done and not to brag but it came out really delicious since all of the answers were great and helpful i just can't choose a best one i will let other users vote thanks for all your help ps you were right it didn't really take that long to melt but also because i chopped the chocolate bars and left the chunks on a covered metal pot next to the window where the sunlight was coming in through to soften them a little before melting them it worked water that simmers and water that boils is the same temperature the difference is how quickly the water turns to gas i've been making mousse for years and always heard that boiling the water simply increased the risk that a drop or two or steam would get into the chocolate and water in the chocolate can make it seize basically that means it would get hard and be almost impossible to beat i use a microwaveable bowl then put chocolate chips or chopped chocolate into it i microwave it for seconds then stir it i repeat this until it's almost completely melted often at that point stirring will be enough to melt it the rest of the way just be sure you don't leave it in the microwave for much longer between stirrings or it will burn Coffee Ice cream Microwave oven Japanese cuisine Welding Water (molecule) Poker jargon Solar power Brewery RuneScape skills Temperature Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Nuclear reactor Kitchen Tea Modem Internal ballistics Bong Chocolate Pebble bed reactor Sea ice Boiling point Forge Slow cooker Barbecue Idli Steel Titanium In-N-Out Burger Hydrogen Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Carburetor Alkane Ammonia Casting Incandescent light bulb Nuclear meltdown Mouse (computing) Carbon dioxide Hot chocolate French fries Thermal power station Melting pot The Apprentice 2 Geothermal areas of Yellowstone Plastic Customs and etiquette of Japan Hot spring Mercury Atlas 6 Water Non-native pronunciations of English Textile manufacturing Gas metal arc welding Hand grenade Phase (matter) Boiling Cookware and bakeware Glass Chili con carne Mercury 4 Agar plate Pottery Turkish coffee Tofu Betting (poker) Heat Team Fortress Classic Sea level rise Fire fighting RuneScape quests Beef noodle soup Electrophysiology Turbojet Happy Tree Friends Siphon Japanese tea ceremony Shaggy dog story Fire extinguisher Sento Planetary habitability Mattress Soldering Flood geology Futurama (TV series - season 4) Newbie Haggis The Time Machine Acorn Mathematician Sulfur Cajun cuisine Ocean thermal energy conversion
