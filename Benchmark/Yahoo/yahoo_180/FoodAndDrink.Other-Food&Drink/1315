how do i know when my white onion garlic and jalape o have expired i cook with these a lot i mean the actual vegetables as opposed to dry spices for example today my white onion had some black on the outside but when i chopped the black off the rest was fine these are ingredients i use quite often and all three of them have a very long shelf life jalapenos can last up to months in the fridge and although it might look wrinkled you can still cook with it garlic can last up to months outside the fridge and onions can last forever inside the fridge Garlic Onion Hamburger Tofu Cantonese cuisine Chile pepper Japanese cuisine Chili con carne Bengali cuisine Curry Jewish cuisine Cuisine of Brazil German cuisine Spice Ramen Refrigerator Hot dog French fries Chicken soup Russian cuisine Cuisine of Vietnam Oregano Cuisine of Denmark Polish cuisine Cuisine of Ethiopia Cuisine of Africa Pickled cucumber Cajun cuisine Soul food Kelantan Capsicum Black pepper Chutney Barbecue Soup Peruvian cuisine RuneScape quests Cuisine of Singapore D__ner kebab Salad Pasta Common bean Sichuan Pepper Stock (food) Ketchup Kimchi Cincinnati chili Risotto Korean cuisine Nabemono Meatball In-N-Out Burger Cuisine of Laos Haggis Cuisine of the Philippines Sausage Coriander Cuisine of Turkey Irish cuisine Cuisine of the Southern United States Pizza Cooking oil Leek (vegetable) Biryani Gazpacho Catalan cuisine Salsa (sauce) Mayonnaise Ukrainian cuisine Cuisine of Malaysia Allium Hot pot Muesli Chop suey Pickling Dumpling Steak Dim sum Taco Paella Italian cuisine Rum Cooking Cuisine of Cambodia Guacamole Gumbo Bacon Irish stew Laksa Okonomiyaki Starch Fried rice Wine Mung bean Sauerkraut Chinese cuisine Garlic Junior Saga Sauce Donburi
