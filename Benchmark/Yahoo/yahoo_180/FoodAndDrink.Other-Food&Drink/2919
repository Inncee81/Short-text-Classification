why does the chocolate on ice cream melt so quickly i was just eating a magnum and a bit of chocolate fell off of it i went to pick it up but it had already melted on the table i'm in a fairly cool room so i don't think that would be it the chocolate coating on magnums or most ice cream bars is so senstive to heat when you take that first bite the heat from your mouth and hands immediately starts to melt the chocolate anything other than ice would melt it right away like the table which was considerably warmer Ice cream Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Oreo Coffee Carbon dioxide Twix Cold Stone Creamery Internal ballistics Ice Cream (food) Water (molecule) Cake Soft drink M&M's Japanese cuisine Cat Standard enthalpy change of fusion Drill bit Kit Kat Customs and etiquette of Japan Heath bar Veruca Salt Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film) Dairy Ice cream cone Eskimo Pie Casting Dog Table tennis Thunderstorm Sea ice Sherbet Steel Planet of the Daleks The Apprentice 2 Magical objects in Harry Potter The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Gas metal arc welding Cha chaan teng Agar plate Cuisine of the Philippines Welding Nestl__ Metalworking Conker's Bad Fur Day Breakfast Candy bar Severe weather terminology (United States) Printed circuit board Lotte Tea Cooler Siamese (cat) Sento Gallium Cuisine of Denmark Refrigerator Sundae Soldering GB Glace Ice skating Cloud Chopsticks Wok Amorphous ice Ice sculpture Aluminium Vitrification Ceramics Mango Milkshake Nuclear reactor Fiberglass Bacon Root beer float Confectionery Sodium Hydrogen Molten salt reactor Butter Diamond simulant Climate change Refrigeration Climate of Antarctica Water vapor Nuclear thermal rocket Precipitation (meteorology) Ice sheet Gatorade Sulfur Fire fighting RuneScape quests Fog Thermoregulation Chocolate Salty Balls Effects of global warming Champagne (beverage)
