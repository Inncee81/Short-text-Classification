does it still count if you add stuff to you water everyone knows that your supposed to drink about ounces of water daily but if you add those packages of crystal light singles or kool aid singles or something like that does that still count towards your daily water intake i'm not too concerned with my sugar intake and i'm not using it each time just sometimes when i want to change it up a bit it certainly does count towards your daily intake of water as long as it does not contain certain chemicals which will actually dehydrate your body caffeine is a well known example but probably not found in your packages of flavoring while those are not necessarily bad it's probably not a good idea to have of your fluids come from crystal light or kool aid besides all of this one thing that most people don't know is that you also take in a surprising amount of water in food certain foods can contain a lot of water that is used the same way as through drinking this of course should not replace most of your fluid intake but it's something to consider lastly if you're wanting to utilize your fluids in the best way it's not recommended to chug your drink drinking too quickly will cause more of it to pass right through you rather then being fully absorbed Chocolate Caffeine Breastfeeding Coffee Water Milk Sugar substitute Soft drink Tea Hamster Nutrition Yerba mate Atkins Nutritional Approach Alcoholic beverage Marathon (sport) Tocopherol Hypoglycemia Electrolyte Dieting Hyperthermia Mountain Dew Survival skills Intravenous therapy Dehydration Tooth enamel Hydrochloric acid Fecal incontinence Sodium chloride Sewage treatment Edible salt Folic acid Zinc Gout Protein-energy malnutrition Coca-Cola Dietary fiber Rehydration Carburetor Hangover Carbon dioxide Magnesium Autonomous building Drinking Urine Energy drink Phosphoric acid Ramen Tooth Cuisine of Brazil Rum Tofu Illegal drug trade Food Honey Beer Hiking Glycerin Marshall Plan Insulin Jet engine Veganism Low-carbohydrate diet Eye Drowning Iron Internal combustion engine Ice cream Water (molecule) Bong Cooking weights and measures Food preservation Anemia Sugar Dioxin Bodybuilding Guinea pig Fuel injection Theory of conduct Urinary incontinence Fluoride Alcohol Healthy eating Bread Gastric bypass surgery Tang (drink) Toyota MR2 Instant coffee Omega-3 fatty acid Vampire Vegetarianism Diabetes insipidus Word of Wisdom Sake Acne Diseases of the honeybee Uranium Kidney stone Shark
