is possibly bacteria infected poultry safe after cooking i cut up and marinated two large pieces of raw turkey breast yesterday and put each piece into two separate sealable plastic containers like tupperware now today one of the containers and not the other is bulging out which i believe indicates that there's some sort of bacteria living in it will it be okay if i just cook it thoroughly or should i waste about and toss it i'd rather not get sick but i hate wasting food unnecessarily uhh i should probably throw out that this is mostly me wanting to know if a bulged out lid on a sealable plastic container indicates bacteria growth obviously i have no way to check for bacteria so i was wondering if that's the only thing that can be deduced from a bulged out lid or if there's other things non bacterial that would cause the lid to do that if it's something else just blindly throwing away my food ps i'm pretty damn poor would be a very bad choice i guess i should have asked specifically about the lid thing and not mentioned bacteria and if there is bacteria won't adequate cooking make it perfectly safe to eat after all isn't that why you always cook eggs and poultry thoroughly i don't get the pidture are things equal meat purchased same time marinade equal overnight in the frig no way i say it is fine you just didnt expel the air in one Foodborne illness Tofu Sea-Monkey Plastic Sauerkraut Bacteria Escherichia coli O157:H7 Agar plate Sewage treatment Barbecue Egg (food) Veganism Hamburger Omega-3 fatty acid Domesticated turkey Food preservation Hemp Cheese Food Chopsticks Factory farming McDonald's Jewish cuisine Milk Chicken Sushi Sausage Nutrition Pottery Poker jargon Cooking Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Theory of conduct Hamster Slow cooker Waste management Textile manufacturing Vegetarianism Yoghurt French cuisine Compost Cuisine of Laos Halitosis Pneumonia Healthy eating Crohn's disease Microwave oven Organic farming Kosher foods Raw food diet Unclean animals Genetically modified organism Guinea pig Kitchen Cuisine of Malaysia Genetically modified food Carnivorous plant Marine aquarium Ice cream Sterilization (microbiology) Campylobacteriosis Yoko Ono Livestock Fancy rat Japanese tea ceremony German cuisine Kashrut Cuisine of Denmark U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Anthrax Rose (Doctor Who) Bengali cuisine Equine conformation Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Conjunctivitis Aquarium Feces Tlingit Dustbin Banana Vitamin C Common cold Steaming Samuel Goldwyn The Star Wars Holiday Special Stir frying Roman eating and drinking Chinese cuisine Menstrual cycle Procrastination Polymerase chain reaction Blood (computer game) Motility Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Yum cha Korean cuisine Russian joke Baby bottle
