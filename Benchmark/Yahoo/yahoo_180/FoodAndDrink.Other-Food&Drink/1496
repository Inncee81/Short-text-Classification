what's strength weakness treat and opportunity of gatorade what's strength weakness treat and opportunity of gatorade i did a paper on this last year it is known that when people exercise they need fuel for their body to do its job water has always been the drink of choice because it can be found anywhere and it quenches your thirst it supplies the body with the water that was spent during exercise now with sports drinks on the market like powerade and gatorade people have been arguing which is better for the body during and after exercise it is clear that sports drinks are more effective than water when electrolyte fluid and carbohydrates are needed like when your body is being intensely worked sports drinks are usually better than water especially when exercising or exerting yourself sports drinks have light flavouring which makes the person thirstier unlike water which does not have any flavour so it has no incentive for the person to drink it if you like the flavour of a fluid you are likely to drink more and get the recommended amount of the fluid that you need since water does not have any flavour a person will probably not drink the amount that they need to hydrate while you intensely work out your body needs carbohydrates to provide energy to your muscles this will allow the person work harder and longer sports drinks are filled with carbohydrates while water contains no carbohydrates and therefore no energy that the body needs while working if a person can t get enough carbohydrates their body cannot function as well as if they had a sufficient amount of carbohydrates in their system most sports drinks contain a small amount of sodium salt in their drinks which makes the person thirstier and will encourage the person to get the fluid they need having sodium and flavouring together in a drink makes it very likely that anyone that drinks the fluid will get the recommended intake it is recommended for athletes to eat a sodium rich meal or salty snack before a game or intense workout this is because when you eat salty foods you get thirsty this is an incentive to get you to drink more to get the right amount of fluid that your body needs putting salt in sports drinks is just like eating a sodium filled meal before a big game water contains no sodium so the person isn t likely to get the amount of fluid their body needs sodium also has the ability to keep fluid in your system which holds in the nutrients instead of losing it though urination water contains no sodium so it makes the kidneys produce urine more than sports drinks do it also helps maintain sodium balance in the person s blood while water does not a study done by the gatorade sports science institute proved that exercisers that drank water for hydration only replaced of their fluid losses which is not enough to prevent dehydration they also proved that exercisers will drink more gatorade than water and that does a better job of hydrating the body this is likely due to the taste of the drink which makes the person enjoy drinking and with the salt content it makes the drinker thirstier and wanting more this combined with taste makes one addictive drink that is good for you at the same time the study involved triathleles and runners who exercised in a circuit for minutes at intervals the athletes had access to unmarked beverages consisting of an orange sports drink water diluted orange juice or an orange flavoured homemade sports drink each person chose a different one each time each time the athlete rated the beverage and the fluid intake was measured the results concluded that the subjects drank more of the orange flavoured sports drink than all the others even the homemade sports drink the athletes also rated the commercial sports drink higher than any other fluids according to taste the subjects drank more of the commercial sports drink than water more of the commercial sports drink than diluted orange juice more of the gatorade than a homemade sports drink this means that people preferred drinking sports drinks more often than any other liquid when they need hydration the same institute did a study to see what children will drink more of water or sports drinks they did this because dehydration and heat illness are much greater threats to children than they are to adults they put the children in a warm facility where they exercised for minutes and then rested for minutes this would be the equivalent to a child playing outside on a hot day during the experiment the kids were offered a grape flavoured commercial sports drink water and grape flavoured water the result was that kids drank more of the sports drink than the water which also maintained their hydration this means that children will voluntarily drink more of a sports drink than water due to the great taste this is important because it prevents children from being dehydrated and experiencing heat illness while giving their bodies the energy it needs in conclusion sports drinks are far better for anyone doing intense exercise it provides the great taste and sodium that makes the drinker keep coming back and drinking more and more which helps the athlete get their right amount of fluids in their system the carbohydrates in sports drinks are much more effective because it helps the muscles work while water has no carbohydrates it also holds the fluid in your body unlike water which runs through your body rather quickly out of all the studies that have been tested to has been proven that sports drinks are better than water during exercise even when the exercise is hard but only for a short amount of time sports water has still been proven to be better than water while doing hard work or exercise it is much better for your body to drink sports drinks rather than water Urinary incontinence Carbon dioxide Diarrhea Vitamin C Drowning Drinking Tooth Prostate cancer Rehydration Solar power Fecal
