what is the logic behind putting salt on top of the rice cooker when cooking rice pasta in high altitude it is in the boiling of water to cook foods that we encounter difficulty when cooking at high altitudes pressure decreases with increasing altitude the decrease in atmospheric pressure lowers the boiling point allowing the water to boil at too low a temperature for convenient cooking in order to cook foods by boiling at high altitudes it is necessary to increase the density of the pressure of water and one idea is by adding salt since it will cause the water to boil at a higher temperature when the water is hotter you can cook food faster salt also makes the food taste better Boiling point Pressure cooking Slow cooker Brewery Boiling Ramen Water (molecule) Steam engine Food preservation Cookware and bakeware Temperature Rice cooker Tofu Jet engine Coffee Decompression sickness Ice cream Turbojet Atmospheric pressure Nuclear fusion Water Water purification Spacecraft propulsion Solar power Turbocharger Barbecue Portable stove Bread Cooking Boiling water reactor Idli Earth's atmosphere Cantonese cuisine Barometer Alkane Global warming and agriculture Japanese cuisine Lighter than air Phase (matter) Pressurized water reactor Internal ballistics Ethylene glycol Wind turbine Chicken soup Hot air balloon Hydrochloric acid Dumpling Tea Carburetor Ammonia Ocean thermal energy conversion Degree Fahrenheit Heat Pasta Sushi Flour Rice congee Cuisine of Brazil Scramjet Steaming Evaporation Explosive material Adiabatic lapse rate Chopsticks Siphon Electrophysiology Geyser Thermal power station Ketchup Welding Carbon dioxide Jewish cuisine Turbofan Couscous Water vapor Cuisine of the Philippines Dead Sea Kitchen High altitude Nuclear weapon design SR-71 Blackbird Nuclear power Lift (force) Junkers Jumo 213 Heinkel He 100 French fries Dishwasher Atmospheric reentry Rolls-Royce Kestrel Hot dog Hydrogen economy Outer space Nuclear reactor Motor oil
