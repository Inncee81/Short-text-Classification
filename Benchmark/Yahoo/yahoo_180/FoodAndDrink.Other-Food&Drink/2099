do you prefer cheese in its original shape or kraft sliced cheese how do you like kraft sliced cheese usually how you use it and is there a way to grate it did you say cheese i love it to answer your question it really depends on what i'm going to do with it if i'm just going to slice a piece of cheese to eat by itself or with some fruit or on a piece of apple pie then the chunk style i like best plus this kraft cheese i usually get sharp or extra sharp if i want to make a cheese sauce to go on macaroni then i get the milder cheese in a chunk or large piece i grate it into small pieces and put it in a white sauce i make with flour salt butter and milk then when the sauce is cooked the grated cheese goes into it you mix it together and then bake in the oven until it's hot and bubbles and golden in color tonight we had havarti cheese to eat with ham and potato salad because it's summer and so hot i didn't want to heat up the kitchen havarti is a cheese from denmark it's a very tasty creamy cheese you asked about the sliced cheese i always called american cheese i always loved it on bread that i buttered on the outside and cooked in in a frying pan until the cheese melted and the bread was toasted you have to watch the heat so you don't burn it cook it on medium to low but as i got older i experiment mixing different things like a mixture of american yellow cheese and the colby cheese it has a nice melting quality together you can get a metal grater at a hardware store it has different sizes of holes so you get fine or course pieces of cheese if you don't have one take a knife and slice it as thin as you can then cut it into stripes like sticks gather the stick shapes and cut all across at the same time so you get tiny little pieces i think this is the end of today's cheese story but there is much more to tell lol good luck don't let a mouse find your cheese mama jazzy geri Pizza Jewish cuisine Barbecue Japanese cuisine German cuisine French fries Tofu Sandwich D__ner kebab Pancake Kraft Dinner Cuisine of the Philippines French cuisine MRE Soul food McDonald's Cuisine of Brazil Cuisine of the Southern United States Hamburger Bengali cuisine Bagel Dumpling Peruvian cuisine Pasta Bacon Fish and chips Sushi In-N-Out Burger French toast Cuisine of Singapore Peanut butter Cha chaan teng Cuisine of Argentina Dairy Ice cream Chili con carne Bong Cookware and bakeware Cookie Flour Maple syrup Casting Grilled cheese sandwich Sauce Knife Potato chips Chocolate Soup Cheesesteak Butter Mango M__m__lig__ Pottery Rum Roux Cuisine of Malaysia Vegetarian cuisine Brewery Roman eating and drinking Dim sum Potato pancakes Toast Ramen Joke Porridge B__chamel sauce Cuisine of Austria Rice pudding Risotto Apple Poutine Kosher foods Pizza Hut Cuisine of Laos Hamster Kebab Apple pie RuneScape quests Full English breakfast Genericized trademark Quesadilla Processed cheese Food Nabemono Deep frying Curry Korean cuisine
