i found a pair of hotpockets in the frezeer why does this always happen to me the last time this kind of problem happened was with the nestle drumsticks anyway this time i found a pair of cheeseburger hotpockets in the freezer but when i opened the box there was one cheeseburger flavored hotpocket but next to it is a pizza flavored one yet the box does not say anything about a pizza flavored hotpocket should i eat it i don't know why this always happens to you do you live alone if so do you lock your door do you find that you have frequent memory blackouts that might account for you putting hotpockets of two different kinds in one box and then not remembering it as for whether or not you should eat it i would say that depends on three things is it past the expiration date if so then definitely do not eat it you already have the memory problem having food poisoning would only complicate that is it still completely sealed in its individual wrapper if not then do not eat it see above if you've forgotten about the food poisoning problem do you like pizza flavored hotpockets you indicated that you were expecting to find a cheeseburger flavored one in there if you can't distinctly remember liking pizza flavored hotpockets i wouldn't take the chance who knows maybe you're allergic to them and your allergic reaction causes you to have memory problems regarding what is in your freezer better to be safe than sorry Trailer Park Boys McDonald's Pizza In-N-Out Burger Food Stuttering Japanese cuisine Allergy Tomato Tlingit Futurama (TV series - season 5) Peanut Public-key cryptography Philip J.
