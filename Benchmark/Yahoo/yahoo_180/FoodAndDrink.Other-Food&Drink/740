some people say that when you are a kid like being yrs old things taste better is this true ok my grandfather said that sodas such as pepsi or coke tasted a lot better when he was younger then he says that things taste a lot better to kids when their younger because ther kids which i said anything would taste that good when you dont get it as much like if an adult has not had a nice cold pepsi in a while and then dranked one they will be excited also then he said kids love candy then i said now being an adult candy is not really that exciting so well being a kid and eating candy is fun because its something sweet sometimes tangy and the flavor just hits your tounge and being an adult you grew out of going crazy about eating candy sure adults enjoy candy but not as much as kids because it may get them hyper so could someone help me explan this better thank you very interesting question there are a couple of things that you can say about this topic while it is true that things taste better when your a child than it does as an adult one of the reasons are as you age and over time people eat and intake things that actually desenitize their taste buds alcohol tobacco coffee hot spicy foods ect over time reduce the intensity your taste buds on your tongue have in distinguishing different tastes as a child most foods especially new ones are an experience for you and your taste buds so there is also a mental stamp you have of something you really liked at that time as a child that when you get older and try and compare that taste to the first time you had it of course it's not going to taste as great as it did the first time that's a mental reason why someone thinks something isn't as great as an adult as it was as a child it's more phsycological than anything else also take one of your favorite foods you love right now say ice cream for example and you ate it every day for a few weeks eventually you would get sick of ice cream it's sort of the same thing when you have had something not every day but say once a week for years the memory of what made you like it the first time hs become mundane and that taste doesn't stand out anymore you still enjoy it but it's never the same as it was the first time you tried it hope this helps Soft drink Codename: Kids Next Door Coca-Cola The Apprentice 2 Coffee Tea New Coke Cuisine of the Philippines Cannabis (drug) Chocolate Ice cream Japanese cuisine Kodocha The Fairly OddParents Diet soda Bread Trailer Park Boys Microeconomics Tooth The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Patrick Star Cocaine Happy Tree Friends Hiberno-English Ron and Fez Ginger Fecal incontinence Cheese Social rule Anemia The Adventures of Pete & Pete Humphrey Bogart Infantilism Cuisine of Singapore Organic food German cuisine Ranma __ characters Potato About a Boy Basic taste Bulk vending Jewish cuisine Tofu Kimi Finster Cuisine of Denmark Cuisine of Laos Pitaten Theory of conduct Inca Kola Garfield Meaning of life Shaggy dog story Caffeine Cantonese cuisine Babe Ruth Rocko's Modern Life Jumpstart 3rd Grade Futurama (TV series - season 5) Cuisine of Malaysia Heath bar Bengali cuisine Street food Word of Wisdom Atkins Nutritional Approach Avenue Q Pepsi-Cola Cuisine of Argentina Sugar substitute Human Kender Cold Stone Creamery Little Britain Vanilla Characters in the Smurfs Undergrads Magical objects in Harry Potter David Hume FLCL Rave party Billboard Hot 100 Piccolo Junior Saga Wine Singlish Billboard (advertising) Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Apple Beavis and Butt-head
