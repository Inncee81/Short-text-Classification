is there a way to prepare short ribs without them being cooked to death bought some bulk short ribs at costco the only way i've had them prepared in the past is slow cooked or pan roasted until they're the consistency of pot roast can they be grilled broiled or otherwise cooked so that they are more rare yet still tender neither me nor my wife like our meats cooked well done we prefer rare i've never really made short ribs myself before we can deal with a little stringyness or chewyness short ribs generally come from the chuck which is a less tender cut of meat so they're braised and cooked to death however with short ribs you have two standard cuts english style which are the are bone about long sort of like a little block flanken styles are short ribs that are cut thinly about and or ribs long the flanken style ribs grill up really well i usually just a steak dry rub or a slightly sweet korean style marinade the korean dish i believe is called kalbi for the english style you can try grilling them as a test case to see if the stringyness and chewiness is acceptable even though i use the term grill this also mean broil or pan fry cooking using a dry cooking method at high temperatures for a short time here's a recipe that implies that you can use either cut of short ribs for the english cut you just need to do a little more work korean short ribs in korea beef ribs are a mainstay these tender beef ribs are marinated and grilled fast to hold in all the flavor the secret is to butterfly the short ribs so they can be folded out on the grill ingredients beef short ribs cup soy sauce cup dry sherry tablespoon sugar tablespoon ginger fresh grated preparation trim excess fat from ribs and butterfly gently rinse and pat dry combine all ingredients in a large resealable plastic bag and let marinate for anywhere between minutes and a day preheat grill remove ribs from marinade and pull open and place on grill close lid and grill until done about minutes Hamburger Cuisine of the Philippines Korean cuisine Ramen Cuisine of Laos Cajun cuisine Bacon Cuisine of Denmark German cuisine Coffee Beef noodle soup Bengali cuisine Galbi Cuisine of Africa Beef Domesticated turkey Cuisine of Thailand Cooking In-N-Out Burger Kebab Seitan Pizza Sushi Hot dog D__ner kebab Cuisine of Singapore French fries Soul food Breakfast MRE Jewish cuisine Cuisine of the Southern United States Canadian Chinese cuisine Tea Rum Horse meat Cookware and bakeware Recipe British cuisine Cuisine of Argentina McDonald's Stock (food) Soy sauce Nabemono Food Jiaozi Sauerkraut Haggis Cuisine of Brazil Pork chop Hot pot Cheese Roast beef Curry Veganism Kosher foods Pottery Sandwich Satay Udon Sauce Russian cuisine Grilling Cuisine of Cambodia Cuisine of Vietnam Risotto Ice cream Equine conformation Vegetarian cuisine Chopsticks Rib Vinegar Oyster Idli Rice congee T-bone steak Soy milk Dim sum Italian beef Potato chips Food preservation
