has anyone ever tried the ice cream ball i was wanting to order one of these new ice cream balls where you put the rock salt in one part and the ingredients in the other part and you roll it and it makes ice cream was wanting to know if anyone has used it and if it works thanks our ren faire guild has used these twice now both very successfully seems to take about minutes of folks rolling the ball around to get a good consistency and it will need to be stirred at least a couple of times during that period to scrape the frozen bits off the walls of the container fun for a medium large group but probably not something you want to do with only a few people Ice cream Milkshake Bob and George Ice cream cone Cream (food) Tofu Oreo Bread Gelato The Yardbirds Japanese cuisine Carbon dioxide Cuisine of Singapore N.W.A German cuisine Apple pie Softball Sherbet Tag Ice hockey Textile manufacturing Cuisine of Malaysia Tea Drill bit Tempura Laws of cricket I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Brewery Cheesecake Mung bean Psychedelic music Sushi Dim sum Sento The Waterboys Onigiri Idli Dairy product Baseball Roller hockey Cuisine of the Philippines Sport Natt__ Swingout Root beer float Glacier Items in the Metroid series Cold Stone Creamery Jerry Garcia Weathering The Beach Boys Spidey Super Stories Sangr__a Cream (band) American Chinese cuisine Risotto Blonde on Blonde Ice age Funfair Coffee Great Lakes Rock (music) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Cake Mayonnaise Ice Cube Fast bowling Lake Sodium chloride Biscuit Baked Alaska Ben & Jerry's Peanuts Sea ice Sour cream Golf Football (soccer) Soup The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time weapons and items Music of the United Kingdom (1950s and 60s) Metroid Prime British Invasion Judas Priest Hamster Cantonese cuisine Kirby: Canvas Curse Maple syrup National Football League Lore Natural disaster Glossary of climbing terms Ice Hot dog Cuisine of Denmark Fishing Fried dough foods Grateful Dead
