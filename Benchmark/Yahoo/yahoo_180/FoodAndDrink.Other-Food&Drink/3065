how do you suppose farmers get seedless watermelon when there are no seeds to plant lol seedless watermelons are special hybrids that are genetically incapable of reproducing two varieties are crossed to produce hybrid seed these seeds are grown but because of genetic differences they cannot produce viable seed of their own to grow them they must be pollinated with another variety of melon when the flower is pollinated the plant grows a fruit like it normally would but the seeds do not develop most seed companies include seed of a pollinator usually sugar baby with the seed of the seedless variety Watermelon Fruit Pollination Cucumber Flowering plant Flower Apple Banana Fruit tree pollination Plant Cannabis sativa Orange (fruit) Vanilla Date Palm Plant breeding Pumpkin Species Kiwifruit Cannabis cultivation Loganberry Almond Peanut Melon F1 hybrid Plant sexuality Genetic engineering Sugar beet Raisin Rambutan Malus Squash (fruit) Cultivar Seed Fruit tree propagation Conifer cones Orchidaceae Transgenic maize Sorghum Pollinator decline Tomato Green Revolution Breadfruit Wheat Date cultivation in Dar al-Manasir Cereal Genetically modified food Citrus Sunflower Maize Colchicine Rose Monsanto Garden Strawberry Sustainable agriculture Reproduction Luther Burbank Coriander Pineapple Polyploidy Plant breeders' rights Sexual reproduction Weed control Blackberry Oil palm Heirloom plant Perfume Hemp Alfalfa Potato Hybrid Carnivorous plant Honey Biology Insect Cotton plant Frugivore Fig Strawberry Pollen Copihue Rapeseed Coconut Sweetcorn Smilax Pinophyta Apricot Durian Banksia Cannabis (drug) Illegal drug trade Gladiolus Pomegranate Vitis vinifera Neolithic Revolution Coffea arabica Chicken
