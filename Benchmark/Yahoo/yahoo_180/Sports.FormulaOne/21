can mclaren be stopped this season there is no doubt that mclaren is the best team for now but ferrari it's really close now they improved very much since indiannapolis and at least in the next races they seam to have the best chances of winning this is the best season i saw in years and it's nice to see mclaren back in top after they struggled so much in the past years i don't know if ferrari can overtake mclaren this year i don't really think so the liability of the car is not that good the team doesn't move like it should be twice the car failed on raikkonen many small mistakes at pit lane that cost massa or raikkonen points they might have the chance on the next races but still point between the leader and your best pilot say much so i don't think that mclaren can be stopped this year even with all the problems they have now hamilton will keep on scoring and alonso will try the best to prove he deserve his spot on the team Kimi R__ikk__nen Team McLaren Giancarlo Fisichella Fernando Alonso Michael Schumacher Juan Pablo Montoya Mercedes-Benz Jacques Villeneuve 2000 Australian Grand Prix 2005 Hungarian Grand Prix Chris Amon 2005 European Grand Prix 2005 Belgian Grand Prix 2005 French Grand Prix 2005 Formula One season 2004 San Marino Grand Prix Ayrton Senna History of Formula One Renault F1 Jacky Ickx Martin Brundle 24 Hours of Le Mans Penske Racing 2005 United States Grand Prix Indianapolis 500 2005 British Grand Prix Mika H__kkinen Ron Dennis 2004 Formula One season 2003 United States Grand Prix Bruce McLaren Jordan Grand Prix Ivan Capelli WilliamsF1 Jenson Button Gerhard Berger Surtees Emerson Fittipaldi 2005 Australian Grand Prix Heinz-Harald Frentzen Andrea de Cesaris Keke Rosberg Carlos Reutemann Nigel Mansell Masten Gregory 2005 Bahrain Grand Prix Jody Scheckter 2002 Formula One season Prost (racing team) Red Bull Racing Roush Racing Niki Lauda 2004 Monaco Grand Prix Sauber Formula One regulations British American Racing Adrian Newey McLaren Cars Riccardo Patrese Damon Hill Fran__ois C__vert 2003 Brazilian Grand Prix John Barnard Enzo Ferrari Jarno Trulli Valentino Rossi West Bromwich Albion F.C.
