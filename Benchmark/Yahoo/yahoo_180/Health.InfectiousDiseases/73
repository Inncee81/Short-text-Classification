can you get chicken pox after being vaccinated i had chicken pox as a small child and was vaccinated for it too i was recently exposed to it and i am going to visit someone who has just been diagnosed with cancer and was wondering if i could get them sick i need help if you had chickenpox varicella when you were a kid and were also vaccinated you are most likely immune to it therefore it is very unlikely that you can catch it and pass it on to someone else in other words you can't infect the person that has cancer Chickenpox Smallpox M.A.U.R.I.C.E.
