is it do able to put aluminum foil in the bottom of my oven so i don't have to clean it constantly can i safely put aluminum foil lined in the bottom of my natural gas kitchen oven as i seem to clean it constantly will it interfere with the cooking or heating i don't know where ali these burnt weird spots come from but it would be so much easier just to line the bottom with foil and be able to take it out put new in and have a clean oven i wasn't wanting to place foil on the rack s but on the bottom of my oven and not covering the vent holes on the sides where the heat comes out of yes sheila i do it every time i clean my oven i have an electric oven and it works well for controlling spills and spatter i use the heavier foil for this because it is less likely to tear when putting it in or removing it i am not sure about the layout of a gas oven but with care you should be able to put it on the surface where you find the weird spots then the spots will appear on the foil please be careful not to put the foil into the direct flame because it will oxidize the aluminum causing a white ash Wok Stove Microwave oven Cookware and bakeware Printed circuit board Bong Aluminium M16 (rifle) Gas metal arc welding Welding Aluminium foil Bread Town gas Air pollution Coal Portable stove Upholstery Renewable energy Hand grenade Fire extinguisher Fire fighting Motor oil Beverage can stove Explosive material Dutch oven Laser Spark plug Tire Internal ballistics Cooking on a campfire Mylar Hydrochloric acid Brewery Sewage treatment Carburetor Solar cell Energy development Hydrogen peroxide Carbon monoxide Billiards Space Shuttle external tank Thermal power station Sailing Solar power Nuclear power Carbon dioxide Diving suit Plastic Electrical wiring Brazing Refrigerator Sulfur Cremation Dairy Fossil fuel power plant Firefighter Heat Condom Drill bit Apollo Command/Service Module Solar box cooker Water (molecule) Geology of the Moon Volcano Titanium Amateur telescope making Fire Diseases of the honeybee Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Petroleum 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Headlight Catalytic converter Hydrogen Rocket fuel Harmonica Natural gas First Battle of the Atlantic Furnace Sterilization (microbiology) Incineration Asbestos M60 machine gun Space shuttle main engine Volcanic cone Volkswagen Type 2 (T3) Steam engine Corrosion Elevator Slow cooker Brush Spidey Super Stories Dry cleaning Seismic retrofit Lake Glass
