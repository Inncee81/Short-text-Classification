selfcleaning oven vim baking someone at someone else's house stuff spilled over and baked on i didn't realize it was a selfcleaning oven and started to use vim to clean it is this a problem can i not use selfcleaning until i get all the vim off and why not thanks for any help the vim is only on a small spot on the bottom of the oven in the centre it's not touching any components it's also natural i don't believe it has any chemicals that could produce gases under heat but that is what i'm mostly concerned about if i get most of it off the problem is that some will stick with the batter that has burned on will it be ok where is the vim take a look at the oven it should have pyrolitic or catalytic liners since they need to be rplaced from time to time they should be removable get them out and rinse them thoroughly unfortunately if you've scrubbed them or applied vim you may have compromised their function you may have to replace the liners never use bleach or any other chemical substance on the liners you will ruin them completely the manufacturer of the oven should have a help line you can call find the manufacturer on the web get the serial model no for the oven it's usually visible on the frame when the door is open or it may be on the floor of the oven itself self cleaning ovens require intense heat to initiate the self clean process i would not advise doing this until you've removed any residue nb all racks including the side supports need to be removed before initiating a self clean if the vim is only on the floor of the oven and there doesn't seem to be a removable liner there then clean what you can wipe off the vim take the racks out you're good to go natural doesn't necessarily mean it won't have achemical reaction but as long as the vim is not on a catalytic or pyrolitic surface just wiping most of the residue off will be fine anything remaining will basically turn to dust Wok Kitchen Cookware and bakeware Upholstery Carburetor Dishwasher Bread Town gas Stove Fire fighting Carbon dioxide Catalytic converter Alcohol fuel Brewery Cremation Coal Drill bit Welding Hydrochloric acid Printed circuit board XML Hydrogen peroxide Microwave oven Fuel injection Explosive material Motor oil Internal ballistics Biodiesel Unicode Water (molecule) Knife Lighting Bong Hydrogen economy Enceladus (moon) Sulfuric acid Haloalkane Asbestos Energy development Renewable energy Diseases of the honeybee Solar power Hard disk Sterilization (microbiology) Sewage treatment Coffee Origin of life Dry cleaning De Lorean DMC-12 Chocolate Nuclear weapon design E85 Casting Textile manufacturing Gas metal arc welding Incandescent light bulb Hebburn Vacuum tube Olduwan Soldering Magnesium Toyota Prius Cassini-Huygens Baking Plastic Francis Crick Nuclear explosion Glass Enzyme Fusion power Sun Manicure Sento Fire extinguisher Ozone depletion Refrigerator Spacecraft propulsion Industrial engineering Biochemistry Aluminium Barbecue Sodium hypochlorite Heinkel He 112 Eight ball Oscilloscope Air pollution Soap Dialysis Windows XP Glossary of firefighting terms Gasoline
