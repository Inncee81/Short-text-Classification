keep clean ok we are pretty clean people i have dog and cat a husband and me in a bedroom apartment this is a cleaning and a pet question ok first how do i keep my dog and cat out of everything and how can i keep the crap from piling up we my husband and i we work all day long and then come home pick a few things up and have a few hours to relax before we go to bed and do it all over again and it just seems like we can't keep up i was thinking of doing certain things through out the week like certain things on those certain days but i dunno i need some suggestions also sorry this is long but also how can i keep the carpet like really soft and clean it's old carpet i live in an apartment i can't just rip it up and get a new one so how can i keep it looking and feeling like new please any help would be sooo great also what are some cleaning secrets for everything in the house some cleaning stuff that disinfects but is animal safe first i totally get where you are not enough hours in the day but don't worry you can do it all really it just takes organization before i get into answering all your questions think about using simple green http consumer simplegreen com index php it's totally pet safe kinda smells like those christmas ribbon hard candies makes cleaning fun okay as for how to keep up with this cleaning get organized it'll be easier for you to keep everything picked up and clean if all your stuff has 'a place to go to ' i know this sounds weird but trust me if everything in your house has an assigned shelf drawer closet etc you can keep your house clean all week long so this may take some work but anything that 'doesn't have a place to go' that you are not planning on 'creating a place for' is either something you need to toss and throw away or simply make yourself create a space if you need house organizers you can get them at www bedbathandbeyond com or www lillianvernon com both places have neat organizers for underneath the bed in the closet great shelfing racks hooks for behind the door etc it really helps if your place is small as you say it shouldn't be that hard to keep clean the trick is having a 'plan ' for example organize your laundry in an organizer maybe colors are done on monday sheets and towels done on saturday etc you get the idea just like you have a trash day or bill paying day organize the rest of your chores the same way clean as you go like in the bathroom under the sink keep separate spray bottles of simple green and rags in the bathroom so as 'you are thinking about it' you can clean as you are blowdrying your hair or brushing your teeth clean the shower while you are letting hair conditioner sit on your hair keep stuff in the kitchen under the sink to clean as you are thinking about it too i e when a pot of water is boiling on the stove or while toast is in the toaster while you are looking inside the fridge deciding on what to eat clean off a shelf with a wet rag this helps 'multi task' and keep the house clean as you are doing everyday stuff as for carpets this one is tough with pets but simple green makes a pet safe carpet cleaner http consumer simplegreen com cons prod car php try renting a steam cleaner every two months that should help too good luck Kitchen Hamster The Apprentice 2 Social rule Avenue Q Textile manufacturing Japanese toilet Richard Chase Pet skunk Garfield Shaggy dog story Sin City Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sauna Blood Simple Cat Ron Weasley Fancy rat Friends Sento The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Phoebe Buffay's songs Calvin and Hobbes Guinea pig Dog training The Fairly OddParents The Brady Bunch Breastfeeding Happy Tree Friends Dormitory Upholstery Floppy disk Great Teacher Onizuka Shit Cruising (maritime) Extreme Programming The Family from One End Street The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Red Dwarf characters Plastic Aerial (dance move) Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina EastEnders Brewery Futurama (TV series - season 2) Trailer Park Boys The Star Wars Holiday Special Chatsworth House RuneScape quests Spidey Super Stories Carpet The Inside Vacuum cleaner Neopets Hazing Jackass: The Movie Japanese tea ceremony Toilet Russian joke Customs and etiquette of Japan Christmas tree Drag racing Genericized trademark Married... with Children Coconut crab The Invisibles Water Ron and Fez Johnny 5 Closet Grandview, U.S.A.
