rug cleaning question has anyone heard of using vinegar and water in the solution tank instead of using the liquid shampoo for carpets i was told that my carpets have soap build up i tried going over it several times with just water i had a proffessional come in to clean the rugs and this is what they told me soap build up any suggestions how to remove it will using vinegar and water clean my carpets remove high traffic area dirt i have the pro heat bissell carpet cleaner apparently this is a common problem when using a home shampooer they don't seem to get all the shampoo out you may have 'soap build up' on your carpets but it probably isn't as bad as you think your 'instincts' are right get a good 'carpet cleaning machine' and fill it with 'superhot water' mixed with cup vinegar to one gallon of water try to get a machine that will 'vacuum out' most of the 'water' it will also help 'remove' the soap build up go over your carpet twice go 'up and down' once and then go back and forth once to be sure that you have 'cleaned' every bit of carpet in the room then let it dry thoroughly and 'feel it' it should feel 'cleaner' and even be cleaner but go over it again in the 'opposite direction' to your last 'vinegar cleaning' and then rinse it well in plain hot water going the 'other direction after that you may 'hire' someone to come in but it will be much cleaner if you do it yourself the first time Vinegar Vacuum cleaner Sento Shampoo Soap Roomba Dishwasher Laundry Carpet Detergent Menstrual cup Sulfuric acid Soap bubble Solar power Dishwashing Upholstery Textile manufacturing Washing machine Otitis externa Drill bit Kirby Corporation Brewery Sugar beet Citric acid Hard water Dairy Soldering Casting Gilding Carburetor Dialysis Sodium hypochlorite Laundry detergent Halitosis Natural gas Tattoo Fire fighting The Hoover Company Mattress Basement Car washing techniques Home repair Fossil fuel power plant Acetic acid Japanese toilet Ammonia Siphon Wok Manicure Tofu Vacuum Energy development Carbon dioxide Wound Bong Coffee Hand washing Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne Marine aquarium Dandruff Tea Cleanliness Haggis Swimming pool Weaving Irrigation Hot sauce Contact lens Friends Textile manufacturing terminology Thermal power station Liquid crystal Magical objects in Harry Potter Solvent Cuisine of the Philippines Hydrogen peroxide Biodiesel World War Three (Doctor Who) Fire extinguisher Water Rebreather Timeline of invention Bedbug Transformer Sewage treatment Vacuum tube Car wash Water (molecule) Sodium hydroxide Internal ballistics Cleanser Good Morning, Vietnam Cruising (maritime) Social rule Yerba mate Water purification Food preservation Rocket fuel Aladdin (1992 film)
