how to get the smell out of flip flops i have about pairs of reef flip flops the ones with the nylon bands and foam rubber base and i wear them all the time they start to smell after a while because of the hot wet sticky summer weather and my feet lol what is a good way to wash them please do not tell me to buy new ones they are about a pop and are the only flip flops i like because they do not give me blisters at all i've tried soaking them in hot water and soap but the smell still remains i think i might pop them in the washing machine thanks try sprinkling baking soda on them and let them sit overnight then shake them out in the morning you can also buy like a peppermint foot spray or any kind of odor eliminating spray to use on them after you wear them hope this helps Menstrual cup Skunk Plastic Mattress Bread Sauna Diving suit Happy Tree Friends Car washing techniques Manicure Tattoo Aerial (dance move) Casting Laundry detergent Customs and etiquette of Japan Japanese toilet Sodium hydroxide Tofu Toilet humour Dishwashing Idli Pepper spray Pancake Tire Dairy Fire fighting Sulfuric acid Poker jargon Girls Aloud Bong Strap-on dildo Diseases of the honeybee Flip-flop Soap Common cold Textile manufacturing Coffee Cruising (maritime) Air conditioning Hyperthermia Cookware and bakeware Dishwasher Hiking Jewish cuisine Printed circuit board Cocoa The McGuire Sisters Sulfur Swimming pool Smells Like Teen Spirit Laundry Roman eating and drinking Smegma Toothpaste Sento Glycerin Johnny Appleseed Soy protein Car wash Bulk vending Japanese tea ceremony Bicycle brake systems Foot odor Dry cleaning Clothing Vulvovaginal health Timeline of alternative rock Spotted Skunk Paint Ozone Surfing Urban beach Vinegar Drag racing Flip-flop (electronics) Shoe fetishism Cuisine of Denmark The Damned MTV2 Pittsburgh English Roof Shark Psoriasis Thermal power station Marching band McDonald's Detergent Professional wrestling slang Counter Hydrotherapy The Jam Balloon Natt__ Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Barbecue Wilfred Rhodes Grunge music
