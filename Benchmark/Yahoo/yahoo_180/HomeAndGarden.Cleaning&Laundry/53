i recently moved into an old farmhouse i have noticed that when i line dry my clothes there is a terrible mildew smell if they are dried in the washer i do not notice this smell i cannot imagine why this is i treated the washer in case that was the problem and am waiting for the purewasher stuff to come but through weeks of trial and error it has become apparent that the clothes dried on the line are the offenders does anybody know why this would be try adding about a cup of vinegar to your wash cycle and then another half cup to the rinse cycle when you wash your towels they may have mildewed a bit at some point and you haven't noticed it until you line dried them i don't recommend fabric softener for towels but if the problem continues you might want to use some liquid fabric softener in the washer to mask the odor short term solution only Washing machine Vinegar Upholstery Menstrual cup Sauna Dry cleaning Sento Dishwasher Textile manufacturing Diaper Detergent Casting Fecal incontinence Psoriasis Ammonia Electrophysiology Carbon dioxide Hand washing Car washing techniques Common cold Sewage treatment Dairy Procter & Gamble Laundry detergent Tofu Jute Menstrual cycle Urticaria Cannabis cultivation Manicure Japanese toilet Glycerin Cheese Hydrogen peroxide Sugar beet Laundry Water Immortality Theory of conduct Halitosis Nocturnal emission Priestly Code Cruising (maritime) Acetic acid Microfiber Hard water Charles Goodyear Soy milk Oscilloscope Laundromat Clothing Weaving Computus Soap Sulfuric acid Breaker Morant Urine Soap bubble Sodium hypochlorite Redundant array of independent disks Toilet Breathalyzer Textile manufacturing terminology Modem Tea Seismic retrofit Embalming Comfrey Cochineal Prostate cancer Hard disk Shroud of Turin Diseases of the honeybee Hamster Coriander Thermal power station Sodium hydroxide Otitis externa Smegma Toronto Subway and RT Bacon Guinea pig Textile Anxiety Buffer overflow Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Natural gas Urinal Dialysis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Basement Digital circuit Ozone Operation Market Garden CPU design Ion exchange resin Camouflage Decompression sickness
