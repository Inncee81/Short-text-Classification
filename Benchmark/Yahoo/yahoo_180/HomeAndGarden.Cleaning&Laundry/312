hand held steamer on area rugs i have two area rugs that need cleaned they aren't stained just a bit dingy looking from my lab laying on them one is a jute type rug x and the other is a mixed type blend x it does have some wool in it i was just wondering if i could use my hand held steamer i have a shark steamer to clean these will it hurt them if i do this what should i use with it just water or some kind of carpet cleaner etc the steamer i have is not one that sucks the water back up i was thinking of hanging the rugs over my deck rail and cleaning them that way the water can run off as i do it it is not a bunch of money to have them cleaned by professionals it is cheaper if you take them to the cleaning company and pick up i highly recommend serve pro if they are in your locale when they know what the soil or stains are they're very successful pets leave oil from their fur and skin i am not associated with them i've used them when i owned my own floor covering business years ret jute can be tricky the mixed fiber rug may have polypropylene and should not be cleaned at a high temperature Carpet Plastic Jute Textile manufacturing Upholstery Mattress Textile Textile manufacturing terminology Lake District Deck (ship) Leather Domestic rabbit Bong Flax Jardine Matheson Holdings Limited Flea Solar power Jute fiber Hemp Berkshire Hathaway Dry cleaning Soap Fancy rat Japanese toilet Vacuum cleaner Shark Drill bit Hamster Diving suit Laundry detergent Hat Washing machine Rope Kitchen Cro Tattoo Geography of Albania Weaving Clothing Hydrogen peroxide The Human Stain Fecal incontinence Sin City Pet skunk Tooth Wound Dog Roomba First aid Skateboarding trick Carburetor Professional wrestling attacks Paintball Dietary fiber Motor oil Fossil fuel power plant Persian rug Cat Diesel engine Dye RMS Titanic Portland cement Sterilization (microbiology) Strap-on dildo Paint Avenue Q Energy development Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Carding Water Glossary of climbing terms Furness Railway First Battle of the Atlantic Mutual fund Cookware and bakeware London and South Western Railway Thermal power station Poker jargon Japanese tea ceremony Baptism Peanut E85 Vinegar M60 machine gun Professional wrestling holds Bedbug Billiards The Hoover Company Massage Train Psoriasis Cleanliness Fume hood Submarine communications cable Radio controlled car Bulk vending Lionel Corporation
