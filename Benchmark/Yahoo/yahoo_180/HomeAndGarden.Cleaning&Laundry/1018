can you please tell me why a rug will literally walk across a floor put a rug in one spot and after some foot traffic will go across the room granted it takes a day or so but how can i stop this thanks there is not much friction between the bottom of the rug and the floor when you walk and your foot pushes against the rug some of that force shoves the rug backward as you go forward there are non slip coatings and pads you can put under that rug before you slip and kill yourself some day Manual transmission Swingout Elevator Glossary of partner dance terms Professional wrestling holds Aerial (dance move) Equine conformation Bicycle Skateboarding trick Boxing Professional wrestling throws Strap-on dildo U.S. invasion of Afghanistan Escape from New York Carpet Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Japanese tea ceremony Professional wrestling aerial techniques Billiards Boom Town (Doctor Who) Shoe Big Apple (dance) Horse Hansel und Gretel Friction Milton H.
