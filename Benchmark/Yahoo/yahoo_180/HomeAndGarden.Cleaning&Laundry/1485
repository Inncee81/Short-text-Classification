how do i get a red wax stain out of a white linen shirt hi here's a random question i was moving one day and i have this red candle holder made of wax itself i leaned it against my nice white linen shirt without thinking and now i have a large red faded stain in the shirt which has been set in for about months what are my chances of removing this stain and how do i get it out thanks well you could try taking a brown paper bag and placing it on top of the stain on the shirt and running a warm iron across it and with some patience the wax will warm up and soak into the bag you could then spray the shirt with stain remover and launder i'm not sure this will work on white linen but it worked when a box of crayons melted into the seat of my car p Casting Mattress Wax play Candle Upholstery Linen Shroud of Turin Bong Paint Laundry Textile manufacturing Social aspects of clothing Manicure Black tie Ski wax Soldering Paul Is Dead $ale of the Century Christmas tree Crayola Japanese tea ceremony Diseases of the honeybee Motor oil Cross-country skiing Staining (biology) Knitting The Human Stain Top-bar hive Scrubs Aerial (dance move) Plastic Biff Tannen Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Lava lamp Mario Pysanka Mummy Dice Milk Pencil Mnemonic Tottenham Hotspur F.C.
