help dry cleaners turned my wedding gown yellow i was watching a talk show and the topic was how dry cleaners have been charging women for a service they didn't do you send your wedding gown to the cleaners to be preserved and they box it up all nice and pretty and seal it the gown is preserved for years air tight this is where they get you because they know the box is not to be opened for at least years so they don't do a thing to the gown the host of the show had her gown preserved over years and she was going to open it for the first time to see if her gown had turned yellow she opened the box and her gown was a ugly dark yellow she started to cry right there but then she got mad and said to everyone who is watching go get the box your gown is in and open it i was scared to open mine but i did and it was horrible my beautiful gown was now ugly yellow but not the hat the hat was still white my question is can anything be done can it be dyed back to it's original white can anything be done for my gown thank you i agree with the first poster somewhat oxi clean is like a magic potion i wouldn't soak the dress though i would test a small patch first and if it works i would spray the dress rinsing it clean thouroughly and then allow it to air dry for storage i would look in your local yellow pages for a company not a dry cleaner that specializes in wedding gown preservation they might also have a solution for the yellowing so you might want to call them first if you do use oxi clean and it does work wrap it in acid free tissue paper and store it in one of those vacuum seal bags the kind you can do yourself with the vacuum cleaner hose good luck to you sweetie i hope you can salvage your dress one more option if by chance your dress cannot be saved cut a few pieces of the lace and or trim and have it professionally framed as a keepsake you could also have a hanky made out of a remnant once the pieces are cut you could try again to soak them in the oxi clean good luck Textile manufacturing Vacuum cleaner Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Clothing Mattress Bong Upholstery Dry cleaning Jackass: The Movie Academic dress of Oxford University Textile manufacturing terminology Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Teen Girl Squad Tlingit Friends Wedding dress Vacuum Jute Evening gown Gaia Online Padm__ Amidala Characters in the Smurfs Kimono The Phantom Manor RuneScape quests Black tie Menstrual cup Oscilloscope The Inside Undergarment Kasparov versus The World Theory of conduct Spidey Super Stories Sento Black Paper Genericized trademark The Ashlee Simpson Show The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Contact lens Sin City Piccolo Junior Saga Tattoo The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie The Contender (television series) Japanese tea ceremony Advertising Taliesin Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Food preservation Casting Hat Have I Got News For You Time Out of Mind Academia Reservoir Dogs YuYu Hakusho Kilt Shrek 2 Glossary of firefighting equipment The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Skirt and dress Phoebe Halliwell Waking the Dragons Pottery Toilet paper Peter Shilton Solar power Wood Court dress Tanning Diablo II Bus models used in New York City Transit Origin belief Papa Lazarou Teletubbies Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Top-bar hive Knife Clothing terminology Characters of Naruto Hamster Manifold Little Britain The Star Wars Holiday Special RuneScape locations Dyson (appliances)
