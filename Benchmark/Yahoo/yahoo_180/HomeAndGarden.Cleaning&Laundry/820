vacuum reviews i am lokoing for some suggestions on the best vacuums for a house with a dog that sheds constantly the fur keeps clogging my upright so i think i am going to go with a canister vac however i do not want to spend a lot of money any thoughts i agree with pebblespro everyone will say a dyson however my husband and i own a housecleaning company and have used them on several occasions and they are not that great in fact i would say they are overrated except by consumer reports which places dyson in the middle ranking among a lot of other vacuum cleaners they do have good suction but then again so do most vacuums nowadays i've been trying to research myself different vacuums to replace the one we currently have it is getting old after checking out a lot of different vacuums we went with the eureka capture a new release by eureka it is pretty good except i would say the suction is not as good as the one we have now it has awesome attachments is durable and e z roll tires which is good for hardwood floors keep in mind thouugh our standards are high because we have to use them everyday and they have to be good and reliable the one that i would recommend though is what is our previous vacuum before this one the eureka smart boss this one has great suction power and has a long hose and attachments it was rated a best buy by consumer reports and carries the good housekeeping seal of approval something dyson doesn't have i am contemplating returning the eureka we just bought to go and buy another one of these we just wanted to see if there was something better out there anyway i know others will suggest many other vacuums but my advice is shop around go to the stores and pick up the displays and play with the attachments see which one fits you also amazon com has many reviews of vacuums that people have personal experience using so check them out too good luck Vacuum cleaner Dyson (appliances) Abortion Vacuum Upholstery Tire Hydraulic machinery Bulk vending Gross domestic product Glossary of firefighting equipment Hard disk Advertising Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Mattress Pacific, Missouri Transistor Poker jargon Paintball Electrophysiology Siphon Scuba set Bong Digital audio broadcasting Motion picture rating system Electronic commerce Supply and demand Carburetor Good Times Surveillance Glossary of wildland fire terms Dredge Galactic Civilizations Breastfeeding Anchor Incandescent light bulb B-47 Stratojet Circuit breaker Windows XP UK Singles Chart Kirby Corporation Clothing Capitalism Audiophile M16 (rifle) Inflation Luminiferous aether RFID Colonization of the Moon Episodes of Lost (Season 1) AT&T The Catcher in the Rye Ammunition Bicycle lighting Charmed Diving cylinder Jam (TV series) Internet fraud Eureka, California Solar power Nintendo Central processing unit James Dyson W.
