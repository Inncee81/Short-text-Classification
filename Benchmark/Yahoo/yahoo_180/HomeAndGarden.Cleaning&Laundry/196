what is best to clean my venetian blinds with i want to clean them but i don't want to ruin them what cleaning products should i use on them my favorite way works on vinyl or metal mini blinds is to take them down from the window put them in the bath tub heat up a gallon of white vinegar not boiling but hot like a cup of coffee or it'll melt and warp vinyl blinds and pour on them it'll cut any greasy residue from the air like cooking and smoking fill the tub with just enough hot water to cover them and swish the water around a bit let soak about minutes then rinse with warm water using vinegar will also give them an air freshening quality too believe it or not once the vinegar odor evaporates do not use harsh chemicals and stiff brushes because the strings will become fragile and break if they do need wiping use soft rags Vinegar Casting Textile manufacturing Bong Acetic acid Dishwashing Coffee Cheese Swimming pool Manicure Dishwasher Mattress Brewery Sulfuric acid Dry cleaning Solar power Menstrual cup Cookware and bakeware Cuisine of Denmark Breakfast Barbecue Hard water Tea Internal ballistics Rice Fossil fuel power plant Water (molecule) Incandescent light bulb Soldering Water Welding Comanche Wok Fire extinguisher Decaffeination Haggis Customs and etiquette of Japan Instant coffee Glossary of firefighting terms Sento Cuisine of the Philippines Dairy Hot tub Geothermal areas of Yellowstone Haloalkane First aid Cannabis cultivation Bacon Soap Japanese cuisine Ice cream Hand grenade Car washing techniques Pottery Solvent Sulfur Methamphetamine Fujian tea ceremony Onsen Hydrochloric acid Hot spring Violin Glass Air conditioning Smoke-screen Sake Soap bubble Wine Mercury (element) Plastic Steel Idli Agar plate Autoclave Printmaking Food preservation Top-bar hive Brazing Ketchup Soul food Motor oil Mouth ulcer Aluminium Chinese tea culture Air pollution Carbon dioxide Japanese toilet Forge Halva Hydrotherapy Hydrogen Glossary of wildland fire terms Evaporation
