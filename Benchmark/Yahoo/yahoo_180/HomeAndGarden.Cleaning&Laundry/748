using liquid detergent int the washer hole okay i asked a question earlier this morning regarding the use of dryer sheets and also liquid detergent most of the women that answered my question stated that you should get a softner ball or listen for the load to go into rinse mode to put the softner in my washing machine has a hole in the center that says liquid softner why not use this hole i remember that my mom did not use it either also if you use this or the softner ball my washer also has a seperate setting for extra rinse one more additional rinse than the regular rinse is it necessary to use this option thanks ahead of time for help when i use liquid fabric softener i use the liquid dispenser in the middle of the washer i am not sure why someone would use the softener ball when they have the option of the liquid dispenser in the washer but that isn't included on all washers and no it isn't necessary to use the extra rinse it is a matter of preference Washing machine Detergent Textile manufacturing Dishwasher Dry cleaning Upholstery Soap Floppy disk Oscilloscope Toilet Laws of cricket Casting Laundry Sewage treatment Shampoo Pinball Glycerin Manicure Dishwashing Motor oil Firearm Seismic retrofit Hard water Car washing techniques Volleyball Plastic Diaper Urticaria Mattress Japanese toilet Western blot Fecal incontinence Laundromat Glossary of American football Darkroom Hand washing Shaggy dog story Phoebe Buffay's songs Halting problem Strap-on dildo Advance Wars: Dual Strike Mouse (computing) Sento Vinegar IPod Brewery Atari 8-bit family Wok Clinker (boat building) Dairy Windows XP Hello world program American football strategy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Social rule Jumpstart 3rd Grade The Joker's Wild Grommet Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Bolted joint Spark plug Screw Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Solar cell Singlish Crew Exploration Vehicle CPU design Toilet paper Baseball Stars Sodium hydroxide GunBound Quebec sovereignty movement Cray-1 Poker jargon Carburetor Futurama (TV series - season 4) Blackjack Phosphorus Hydraulic machinery 9/11 conspiracy theories Menstrual cup Rule of St Benedict Water polo Procter & Gamble Theory of conduct Shroud of Turin Comanche Wheel of Fortune C programming language Sterilization (microbiology) Characters of Naruto Fast bowling Golf Sugar beet Offensive team Downing Street memo Saturn V Ron and Fez
