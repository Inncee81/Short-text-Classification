increase in negative and depressive feelings after drinking alcohol with bipolar ii i was recently diagnosed with bipolar ii and i'm taking lamictal my psychiatrist told me not to frequently drink while taking lamictal i rarely drink but last night i had a margarita one shot jose cuervo i've been feeling wonderful lately but today i'm feeling like my old depressed self could it possibly be from the alcohol even though i'm taking lamictal i heard alcohol may induce rapid cycling meaning it might have caused me to become depressed again does this make sense or does anyone have any information about bipolar ii and alcohol don't drink alcohol if your taking lamictal and your drinking don't you think your defeating the purpose of the treatment your doctor is providing are people who drink happy if your choosing to drink then why take your meds at all one drink or ten doesn't really matter you'll still be depressed edgy moody tempermental the next day you'll be in a funk and it will take a couple days to get over not a hangover funk but rather more of an i don't like how i feel i don't want to deal with anything or anyone and i just don't care type of funk you heard alcohol may induce rapid cycling with the lamictal now you were able to experience it first hand realize this now either save your money don't see the doctor don't take the meds drink it up and be your depressed unhappy self or see your doctor don't drink take your meds and learn to be who you truely are and you'll be okay with that picture this hopefully this makes sense take lamictal to help stabalize yourself two steps forward in the right direction add alcohol five steps backwards not a good thing now you are three steps behind where you originally started and you feel depressed again you don't have the peaceful contentment you did prior to the one drink alcohol took you back to where you were before taking lamictal now you feel the same as you did prior to the treatment and you wonder if the alcohol has something to do with it i would say so your now three feet back further then when you started the good thing is is that you have the opportunity to realize learn you should not drink at all because it will not make you feel good in the long run it put's you right back at square one it is defeating the purpose and it's not who you really want to be good luck Bipolar disorder Lamotrigine Clinical depression Alcoholism Alcoholics Anonymous Psychosis Addiction Breastfeeding Dead Like Me Humphrey Bogart Social rule Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Pitaten Schizophrenia Drowning Medicine Obsessive-compulsive disorder Happiness Milton H.
