my cousin has recently been diagnosed with anorexia what can i do for her and her mom i know my niece is getting all the help she needs she is seeing several specialists weekly i am really worried about her mom everytime she starts to talk about the problem she breaks down in tears i don't even know what to say to her the husband dad doesn't seem to get it at all and i can tell he is not much support i don't want to put my nose in where it is not wanted but i can tell they are all falling apart and it breaks my heart the family should be receiving counseling as well for this and how to deal with all that is going on in there life including whole family counseling with mom dad and daughter and any siblings involved sounds like mom and dad need couples therapy as well as individual that can be done in one hr session a week min for each and then min together also you need to be very supportive offer to do simple things that may be just adding to the stress like maybe taking any other siblings for the weekend so they can spend the three of them together because your cousin will need that one on one time the most also offer to run simple errands and do simple chores around there house little things to take the pressure off will help a lot also mom and dad need a night alone together to reconnect and should continue to do so if they are both strong people and there marriage is strong there love will persevere and be even stronger because of it Fathers' rights EastEnders The Adventures of Pete & Pete Grandview, U.S.A.
