can you buy prozac or any other antidepressants without prescription my friend in new zealand has been on them permenently for the last yrs i cant see her dr prescribing them for that long so i was just wondering if they are readily available to buy anywhere no except illegally of course it is not at all uncommon however for a dr to prescribe them for a very long time even in some cases for a lifetime prozac is considered safe over the long term though more studies will be needed to confirm this once it has been around for a longer period of time the only anti depressants you can buy over the counter are herbal remedies e g st john's wort which have not been tested in line with fda requirements for drugs so have not been proven effective prozac cannot be bought over the counter in new zealand prozac is relatively easy to find on the black market and is often taken by teenagers who generally in error think it will give them some kind of quick high since prozac takes time to build up in the bloodstream one dose won't do much but make you a little jittery hope this helps nathan Antidepressant Fluoxetine Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor Clinical depression St John's wort Psychopharmacology Paroxetine Bipolar disorder Pharmaceutical company Food and Drug Administration Psychiatry Herbalism Non-medical use of dextromethorphan Withdrawal Antiretroviral drug Bupropion Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Illegal drug trade Maprotiline Methylphenidate Aspartame Chlorpromazine Amphetamine Diazepam Methamphetamine Borderline personality disorder Migraine Medical prescription COX-2 inhibitor Sertraline Medical cannabis Growth hormone treatment Post-traumatic stress disorder Drug addiction Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Clomipramine Fibromyalgia Lamotrigine Kevin Trudeau Off-label use Generic drug Arguments for and against drug prohibition Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Drug test Prostate cancer Anxiolytic Medicine Cannabis (drug) LSD Prescription drug Gabapentin Duesberg hypothesis Chronic fatigue syndrome Fluvoxamine Premenstrual stress syndrome Acne Pharmacopoeia Haloperidol Sildenafil 5-HTP Prozac Nation Hypoglycemia Herpes simplex virus Atomoxetine Controlled Substances Act Erectile dysfunction Oxycodone U.S. Electoral College Isotretinoin Chemical imbalance theory Analgesic Doxepin Transsexuality Eczema Stroke Codeine Thimerosal Contract Kurt Cobain Paracetamol Convention on Psychotropic Substances Venlafaxine Anorexia nervosa Folic acid Baldness treatments Biological psychiatry Mood stabilizer Lorazepam Tocopherol Abortion Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Trimipramine Antipsychotic Methadone
