i have no friends no job live at home and i just want to end it can anyone sympathize i hate going outside because i see people having fun and i'm not i have a goal in my life but it seems so far away i feel better off dead i'm such a pathetic loser i know how you feel not a hundred percent because we are all different but i no somewhat i suffer from depression and anxiety i am on medication and maby you should go to the doctor as well i often thought about ending my life because it seemed like the easy way out but it is anything but easy the hardest thing to do in the world is live in it and i think that you should keep on living because what if something really good happens in your future and you leave this world and you never will have got to experiecn it i hope that i am making sense i also have a therapist who helps me thorough so much and she lets me say anything in the room and it is so nice to be able to talk to someone else who actually listens and i know that you may think that it is stupid to have a therapist but it really is helpful trust me but you do have to find one that you like because if you go to a bitch or an asshole like i have before it makes everything worse everything happens for a reason so right now life may be sucky for you but who knows maby tomorrow things will change i know you may not want to go outside and i totally understand because i am the same way but what i do is just put on my ipod and it makes everything go away and plus you also may be feeling sad because not going outside makes you sad because you get your vitamin d from the sun and that helps with depression some how my doctor told me that when i said i hate going outside i hope that what i have said may have put a dent in how you think and that you will keep holding on and make the most of your life because good things will come your way but you cant just wait for them to fall in your lap you also have to search a bit for them i say you just go and apply to a couple of jobs and then go from there good luck and if you ever need to talk you can email me Social rule Theory of conduct Avenue Q Borderline personality disorder Pitaten President (game) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Procrastination Milton H.
