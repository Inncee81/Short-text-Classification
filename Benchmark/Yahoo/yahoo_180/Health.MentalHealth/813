a question about breakingdown have you ever breakdown until you can't feel yourself inside you anymore i just did it was scary so what's your experience i was just blank i just layed there tears strolled onto my pillows and i didnt feel them go down my face i felt liek giving up not like killing my self but i sure felt like life was sort of pointless i was totally numb all around and i could practically see myself lying on the bed with a blank wet face u feel totally lonely and that is the only feeling until u just feel ur eyes rolling to the back of ur head and just almost like passing out totally unexplainable feeling my experiences were too numbing it was almost routine after a while but i got over things and am much better u learn to alter ur thinking and think about much better things and instead of sobbing and moping about things u think about how to solve them and u put then to action but i know what feeling ur talking about its painful but numbing Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story The Wall Scenes from a Memory Scientology beliefs and practices Out-of-body experience Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Jam (TV series) Milton H.
