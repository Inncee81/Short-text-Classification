my father has sustained a brain injury years ago he is verbal and abusive he hurts me and my family i hate my father so much i never do anything to him but he baits me and then it turns into a full screaming match which in the end he says its all my fault and then writes me a document outlining all the things that 'i don't know about his life' and that i'm the one with the problem every day he is lazy is not flexible he always has to stay in his routine everything is about him he does nothing for me and everything is 'tit of tat' he will only do something for myself or others if he is going to get something out of it he doesn't play the father role he hates taking my sister to and from school claims 'why do i have to do it' blames everything on everyone else contradicts himself in arguments and then the arguments just go right of subject because all he wants to do is win the argument and the list goes on i need help i believe my father has gone and i have a angry over bearing defensive abusive person to replace him i don't want to leave my family home what do i do couple things contradict themselves yes your father is correct that people with traumatic brain injuries can be violent and impulsive however manipulation and verbal abuse do not occur with the injury you and your sisters are in an abusive home your father does need help and so do you and your sisters you need to be brave and tell an adult what he is doing so there can be an intervention and some safety is there another adult in the household and are they supportive of your fathers behaviors there are so many factors here the bottom line is that your dad needs to be held accountable for his actions and being treated like that can have life long effects on children please tell some one and let us know how you are doing if you need any contact resources feel free to email me Domestic violence Fathers' rights Divorce Rape Narcissism Autism Transactional analysis Traumatic brain injury Spanking Borderline personality disorder Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Scientology beliefs and practices Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Schizophrenia Fathers' rights movement in the UK Psychoanalysis Theory of conduct Theodicy Anger management 2005 trial of Michael Jackson The O.C.
