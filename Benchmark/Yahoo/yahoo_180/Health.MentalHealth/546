anxiety leading to suicidal thoughts i've always had anxiety problems but for the past months or so the anxiety has given away to suicidal urges i haven't attempted obviously because i'm afraid of having my boyfriend find me half dead all i've ever wanted is access to a gun now my boyfriend wants to buy one i tried to tell him but he thinks i'm just making it up so he won't get one i won't slit my wrists because of the time it takes to bleed out no jumping off buildings because i could just ruin my body not overdosing on pills because i've known people who have tried someone tell me how to get him not to buy a gun i am treated for anxiety there is something called an anxiety based depression i have it and yes it does lead to suicidal thoughts if not treated get yourself to a doctor and get help you will be surprised how an antidepressant just makes you feel calm and normal if you are to the point of suicidal thoughts then probably all thoughts are negative think how nice it will be to just enjoy life and enjoy being yourself and liking yourself again depression gives you a false perspective of yourself and your surroundings little things seem unsurmountable and everything seems like hard work hope you reach out and will be ok Clinical depression Antidepressant Sigmund Freud Bipolar disorder Maprotiline Cognitive therapy Diazepam Psychoanalysis Anorexia nervosa Suicide methods About a Boy EastEnders Clomipramine Panic attack Borderline personality disorder Doxepin Paroxetine Paranoia Agent Urinary incontinence Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Bupropion Behavioral therapy Procrastination Obsessive-compulsive disorder Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Alprazolam Insomnia Stuttering Escape from New York Drug addiction Chronic fatigue syndrome Phoebe Halliwell Teenage suicide Infantilism Sertraline Fluoxetine Sedative George Costanza Kurt Cobain One Tree Hill (TV series) Chlorpromazine Alcoholism The Virgin Suicides Venom (comics) The Catcher in the Rye Bully Shaggy dog story Tricyclic antidepressant Boom Town (Doctor Who) Columbine High School massacre Menstrual cycle Enneagram Self-harm Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Ex-gay Meditation Post-traumatic stress disorder Psychiatric hospital The Inside Tianeptine Knots Landing Arguments for and against drug prohibition Autism Ludwig Wittgenstein Electroconvulsive therapy Neighbours Piccolo Junior Saga Citalopram Dead Like Me Caffeine Psychotherapy Kingdom Hospital Ten Commandments Traumatic brain injury Unemployment Hypnosis Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor Iris Chang Just Like That Stroke General anxiety disorder Medical views of suicide Avenue Q Sant Thakar Singh Opioid Everwood Methylphenidate Very special episode Sexual dysfunction St John's wort Alexander Technique Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind StarCraft: Uprising Theory of conduct Hormone replacement therapy (trans) 2005 Bali bombings
