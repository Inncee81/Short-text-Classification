plz read my last question no it's more along the lines of i have some reasons to believe that i myself am dying i don't want to i mean listen to me i'm talking to strangers on yahoo answers in full english at just while most of year olds prefer to talk in short i've absorbed too much in life to lose it all and just yet at this early age it's an upsetting thought and i just wonder what happens at death a lot i'm not really scared just nervous of the pain that i could possibly feel and the pain from those around me empathy and yet worry for myself i just want to be again thank you all for your answers i will choose a best one after some time when more people have posted replies me again lol i gave an answer to your last question and now reading this i think your stressing yourself out dont be so hard on yourself many people of all ages have been in the same position as you and have felt the same anxieties i'v had problems with depression and worrying about dying and the only thing i could say is that i'v read lots of books watched lots of great psychic medium programmes have been to see a few spiritualists and i strongly believe that when it's our rite time to die we go to another world one that doesnt need to be feared and meat with family that have went before us somepeople would say that i'm not helping but for me just knowing that when we die its not the end is very reasuring i think that a lot of people have felt how you do at some point in their life talkin to a doctor or someone you know and trust would really help to end your problem xxx Theory of conduct Social rule Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Empathy Anorexia nervosa Shaggy dog story Goodness and value theory Singlish Panic attack Charles Darwin's illness EastEnders Milton H.
