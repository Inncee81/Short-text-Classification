can someone tell me if i'm depressed or not 'm a year old girl going into the th grade i don't have any friends seriously i sit alone by myself at lunch no one talks to me etc etc i always have this terrible aching feeling kind of like longing for someone or something that can understand me and will love me for who i am i cant tell my parents anything or suggest anything to anyone because i am afraid that they will either laugh at me or tell me that i am stupid and to get over it i'm not suicidal and i don't cut my wrists i am overweight so that might have something to do with it i hate my life and i think that everyone else around me has perfect everything and it always makes me want to cry help me please from personal experience you may be despondent which is not quite depressed but you still have that depressed feeling you say that you have that aching feeling a longing for someone well i used to feel just like that but i had some good friends and many acquaintances if you really have no friends you may be farther down the road than i was i also felt that everyone else had things that i did not whether material emotional egotistical and did not deserve it if you keep dwelling on negative things and only dwell on pay attention to those i think you are definitely at least despondent if not depressed but hey that's about all i can guess from your description Shaggy dog story Pitaten Kurt Cobain Friends The Catcher in the Rye Kodocha The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Transactional analysis Milton H.
