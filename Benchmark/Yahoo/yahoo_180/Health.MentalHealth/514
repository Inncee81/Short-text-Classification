worst and best experience with a psychiatrist i've only seen one who i swear was trying to get me to kill myself by letting me take prozac for months and upping my dosage when i told him the medication was making me so much worse i did try to kill myself but i never say any professionals after that i quit the meds on my own do they get paid more for hospitalizations he worked at a psychward too that's why i wonder i had appointments with him one both were shorter than minutes since that was years ago and i never saw anyone since i have no best impression of a psycho doctor i think when i try meds again and i will i'll just see my gp he usually has about even minutes i just wanted to provide a context to your question that may be helpful i've been a therapist working with severely mentally ill people for about years in both inpatient and outpatient settings most people expect that a psychiatrist is going to be a therapist and when they get only a or minute interview and then get medication prescribed they are disappointed or angry up until about years ago psychiatrists were trained and functioned as both psychotherapists and medication prescribers however in the last years insurance companies figured out that it was cheaper to pay psychiatrists just to prescribe medications during a or minute visit and to have other therapists who cost less provide the minute therapy sessions up until then standard psychiatry visits were an hour long and included both medication and psychotherapy a lot of the psychiatrists fought their loss of the psychotherapy role but they ended up losing this battle while the older psychiatrists say years old or older have training and experience doing therapy ones younger than that may have had very little training in therapy especially in comparison to the training in therapy that use to be standard for psychiatrists instead their training is mostly about diagnosis and medication as well as general physical medicine so they may not be all that empathetic or trained in therapy because the insurance only pays for a brief visit they just get the basic information in sessions needed to determine if you need immediate hospitalization what is your diagnosis what is your general medical condition what medications have you been on before and what did and didn't work for you what side effects have you had from medications before or currently and what medication will the psychiatrist prescribe for you they also are suppose to try to establish a rapport with you in the minutes too that's a lot to figure out in minutes and so while the doctor may want to know if you've had suicidal thoughts or been abused as a child they don't really need to know the details and furthermore just don't have the time given the other things they need to establish in their brief visit with you for therapy and enough time to discuss these things in detail you need to see a therapist as well as a psychiatrist as first of all it is their job to be your therapist and second they will have the time to be able to talk with you in more depth about your own particular circumstance in order to get the best care you want to get a psychiatrist and therapist who share the same office as this way they are more likely to discuss your care and work together although sometimes therapists and psychiatrists who don't share office space will communicate sufficiently by phone to coordinate your care in the real world everyone is superbusy and so the odds are against it therapists would include psychologists clinical social workers or marriage and family therapists your insurance heathcare finder number on insurance id card if you have insurance should be able to direct you to a psychiatrist and therapist who share the same office do psychiatrists get paid more for hospitalizations only to the extent that they have more tasks to do so they get paid more for doing more work i have been in this business years and can't recall even one time where a patient admission was motivated by desire for making money that's out of more than admissions i've been involved with in several psychiatric hospitals in town people are hospitalized because they are a danger to themselves or others or because they can't function in society or because they can't be safely treated in a home environment most psychiatrists today either see patients as outpatients or inpatients so it's somewhat rare these days for the same psychaitrist to treat an individual in both settings most psychiatrists are superbusy and not looking for work and are in fact putting in longer days than they'd like i know there's always an exception somewhere however i can say absolutely that i've never seen a hospitalization take place where the motivation was making money i would strongly urge you not to get psych meds from a primary care doctor because if the medicine doesn't work they don't have the training on how to adjust medication or prescribe adjunct meds i see lots of inpatients who went the route you suggested seeing the general practitioner for meds when the prescribed meds didn't work the gp didn't know what to do next most people who take psych meds will need multiple medication trials and adjustments and the general practitioner just doesn't have the training to do this instead consider getting a psychiatrist and therapist who work in the same office understanding that each has a different role to play in your care you'll get much better care from your question i think you would benefit from medications and therapy and treating your depression with only medicine is not as effective as getting both meds and therapy multiple research studies in the treatment of depression show medications and therapy together work better than just therapy or just medication and since you have a history of trying to kill yourself your depression has been bad enough to be life threatening you shouldn't be messing around with anything less than the most effective treatment good luck to you with good treatment you will be so much better off National Health Service Medical record Carl Jung Asthma
