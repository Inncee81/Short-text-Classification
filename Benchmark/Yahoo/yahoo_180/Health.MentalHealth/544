should i admit myself to the state hospital im fwwling very suicidal homicidaal and i feel like i should but im drunk and my gf said shed break up w me if i go cuz ive been there alot i dunno wat to dko ne more a girl friend who isn't there for you or support you at the lowest time of your life especially when you're trying to make rightful decisions to help yourself isn't worth your time think about it if she doesn't approve is she better off having you commit suicide if she really loves you and the both of you have a potential for long term dating which can lead to marriage vowes in sickness in health she should actually be concerned and involved in helping you get the help you need she might actually be adding to your problems by giving you more stress to worry about you don't need that right now sit her down and talk to her if she can't see things your way or you guys can't find a middle ground to agree on then she has to go as for your own health i would recommend that you stop getting drunk this is one of the reasons why you're confused don't know what to do more stressed suicidal and can't make decisions although you know your choices well by doing this you'll not only benefit your health you'll be sober enough to make wise decisions based on the situation you're in and how things are also you're probably feeling useless right now which is probably one of the reasons why you're getting drunk in the first place getting back to the state hospital will not help you at all as you already know from being there many times as you mentioned already i believe that you're depressed and it has been going on for a while a psychologist or a psychiatrist might be able to help you get to the root of your depression if you want to know what is causing it if you don't already know this alone isn't enough though because all they would most likely do is put you on some prescibed medication while this might help a little you'll become dependent upon it and so forth i tell you this from experience first hand i've been depressed all my life and started to notice it at the age of i've gone through enough and i've never found a solution until resently i believe that god's extending his hand to you to help you as he's doing to me come to him as you are repent and be saved he is waiting on you to make your move he'll not only heal you from your pains but will as well renew you entirely won't you come to chirst today i'll pray for you and i wish you all the best remain blessed Friends Clinical depression Procrastination Transsexuality Breastfeeding Ex-gay Alcoholics Anonymous Kodocha Pitaten Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Infantilism Prostate cancer Euthanasia Psychiatric hospital Fathers' rights EastEnders Suicide Divorce Theodicy Theory of conduct Jon Secada Reparative therapy Ethics Bipolar disorder Anorexia nervosa Shaggy dog story About a Boy Hillary Rodham Clinton Eastern Orthodox Church Abortion Maison Ikkoku Same-sex marriage Humphrey Bogart Drug abuse Cult Arguments for and against drug prohibition Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Meditation Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Milton H.
