ativan my new doctor prescribed it but i'm used to xanax and i have a med phobia does it feel the same i have a med phobia and i'm scared to death of new meds i also have anxiety disorder my new doc gave me ativan instead of xanax cause it lasts longer but i'm afrade of what it will make me feel like so i'm wondering if it feels like when your on xanax just don't care about anything or if its totaly different ativan is similar to xanax for reducing anxiety but it is not the same chemical it does last longer than xanax about eight hours for most people and most people i know who are prescribed ativan prefer it over xanax myself included as for feeling like just don't care about anything that's not a product of a medication that's more of your state of mind that sounds like depression and depression with anxiety is now recognized to exist together in millions of people my spouse for one and he gets wonderful relief from taking paxil and ativan i used to feel just like you about taking new medications and felt it was a phobia from paranoia but later realized it wasn't i really am highly sensitive to psychiatric medications and just have to begin new ones at a very low dose to start which was a big relief to know because it did take a long for me personally to find the correct combination of medications to help me and if i would have kept believing it was just me being paranoid i would have suffered too long good luck to you and give the ativan a chance Anxiety Panic attack Antidepressant Lorazepam Alprazolam Chronic fatigue syndrome Bipolar disorder Borderline personality disorder Phobia Migraine Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Chemical imbalance theory Medicine Schizophrenia Obsessive-compulsive disorder Paroxetine Insomnia Transsexuality Benzodiazepine Addiction Charles Darwin's illness Drug addiction Post-traumatic stress disorder Anorexia nervosa Epilepsy Psychosis Fibromyalgia Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Antipsychotic Social anxiety Chlorpromazine Sigmund Freud Psoriasis Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor Eating disorder Procrastination Agoraphobia Psychopharmacology Divorce Cannabis (drug) Psychiatry Hypoglycemia Homophobia Haloperidol Milton H.
