dealing with depression is medication the only way i am in a relationship breakdown and in a state if grief will it pass i'm so scared should i take medication what if i can't get off them i too have been very depressed and i have been taking anti depressants for many years one thing my therapist has stressed to me throughout the years has been to exercise when you exercise your body releases many endorphins into your system and exercise definitely has positive effects on the brain endorphins trigger natural opiates in your brain similar to opiates such as morphine endorphins increase the level of seratonin dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain and have been associated with elavated mood so what i am getting at is that you should get some exercise every day to elavate your state of mind grief is something we all have to deal with at one time or another like when my only child died now that is true grief and it has taken me years just to be able to talk about it without bursting into tears so we all deal with our grief at different time frames but i wouldn't be afraid to take medication if your doctor feels it is in order i want to wish you the best of luck in the future with your situation and may god bless and keep you safe and happy Clinical depression Endorphin Addiction Drug addiction Withdrawal Psychosis Happiness Opioid Post-traumatic stress disorder Serotonin Bipolar disorder Cocaine Fibromyalgia Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Meditation Grief Schizophrenia Transsexuality Chronic fatigue syndrome Parkinson's disease Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Self-harm Antidepressant Electroconvulsive therapy Weight training Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Anorexia nervosa Psychotherapy Psychiatry EastEnders Urinary incontinence Anxiety Stress (medicine) Neurotransmitter Borderline personality disorder Hulk (comics) Migraine Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor Adult attention-deficit disorder Stroke Arguments for and against drug prohibition Theory of conduct Traumatic brain injury Tetrahydrocannabinol Obsessive-compulsive disorder Nitrous oxide Yawn Methylphenidate Venlafaxine Raphe nuclei Drug abuse LSD Sadism and masochism Alzheimer's disease Property (ownership right) Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis Narcissism Diabetes mellitus Massage Amphetamine Religion Sigmund Freud Psychoanalysis Multiple sclerosis Hypoglycemia Adrenal gland Scientology beliefs and practices Alexander Technique Milton H.
