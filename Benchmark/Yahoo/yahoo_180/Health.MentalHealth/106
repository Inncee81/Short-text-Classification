how do you deal with a hypochondriac my husband is constantly telling me how much is wrong with him and has something new every other day he's physically one of the strongest people i know and i know this is all in his head nothing i say or do is right i can agree or disagree and he gets upset what's the best way to handle someone who believes he is ill and is not also he goes to the dr and tells them what is wrong with himself he doesn't like any dr he's ever been to and he's over i tell him maybe he should switch doctors but he doesn't like the next one either we've been together years and this part is getting old ignore his behavior nod your head silently and go off into dreamland when he starts i have a close friend who is the same way and except for that facet of her personality she is a great person my theory about hypochondriacs is that they desperately need attention maybe if you don't give him any feedback either verbally or with body language when he begins his litany he will tire of getting nowhere with you he can only help himself if he cannot see that he has a psychological dependence on attention and fear then you have to steel yourself against it by being non comittal but still letting him know you love him you can't have him committed so grit your teeth and seriously go off into dreamland that's what i do when my friend starts in good luck it must be horrible to live with this Theory of conduct Social rule Le Malade imaginaire Milton H.
