depression or just stress it starts with being a full time student this past year was my th school year my first as a grad student and i had moved to a different field than my ba as well i hated the field and changed again to one closer to my original goal i have been doing the same job for almost years and yet searching for a regular full time since i got my ba but no luck my hubby hurt his back and makes no money he's also looking for a less labor intensive job also no luck so because of this we are barely scraping by then my son had som behavior issues that got cps called which ultimately ended in him going to stay with his dad for a year so he can learn that life is not perfect there i have been so down about all this that i am completely unmotivated to clean so my house is a pigsty however i also will soon start a state job long hr process my daughter will be in private school for free these make me happy for a while so will this go away as the problems go or am i depressed and taking time for myself doesn't really work i would love a massage or to go exercise but can't afford it and can't really go for a walk because our area is in the s and s every day and i can't handle the heat it literally makes me sick and the mall is boring any other ideas would be appreciated though oh forgot one other detail when my hubby left his ex she got depressed and was taking meds for it i remember him making so much fun of her for having to be on meds for depression that i am scared to consider that route of course he may have thought she was faking which is possible because she did a lot of other stuff really weird right after he left too but anyway i guess maybe i just need encouragement all sounds stress induced i have been there myself first off you do not need meds at this point there are many over the counter supplements you can take that will naturally help you increase your mood you do need some sort of excersise to help with mood weather it be doing a at home dvd you rent for free at the library or borrowing a excersise ball from a friend you also need some me time fill your tub up light some candles glass of wine and a book or some soft music can do a world of good for your soul or even some free meditation you need a support group or sounding board check at the college you go to i am sure they can get you to see a councelor on campus or have on campus support groups for these very issues the more postive you try to think even when things go wrong will work wonders if you give into the negitive then it will only make things worse another place to look to talk to someone is your local church sometimes just venting to someone can make you feel a ton better keep your chin up and repeat to yourself this to shall pass and before you know it it will Avenue Q Pitaten Shaggy dog story Scientology beliefs and practices Oh My Goddess!
