how can i stop it when i was growing up my dad used to hit me i dont mean the odd slap on the bum i mean proper hit me and i stoped seeing him when i was and always said i would never be like him and now ive started treating my partner like s t he upsets me i want to hurt him i just feel like hitting him and today i did it wasnt like proper hit but he was holding my arms so i couldnt hit him and i dug all my nails in i hate myself for it inever wanted to hurt him but i have and its not fair on him and all i can see is me turning out like my dad and i dont want that i feel like leaving him so i cant hurt him anymore and at the moment i even feel like getting rid of myself because i have hurt him how can i stop this i dont want to be be like my dad i really dont and i love my partner so much but when i get angry its like i cant stop myself and i know its not right and i hate myself i really do i know its not his fault he has just said that its better for me to do it than to bottle it all up and i know this probly sounds really silly but if i go to councilling then i feel like iv failed i should beable to just carry on and be ok i have been strong for everyone else and i feel like if i need councilling then im not being strong like im failing everyone else it takes a lot of guts to actually do what you do reach out for help i didn't want to treat my child as i have been treated by my mother and it took a conscious effort each and every time something happened years to accomplish i turned out not to be a mom like mine was but i still find that a lot of the things i grew up with seem to be embedded in me so it is a lifelong conscious effort to see how sick the behavior is and finding ways to deal with the momentary anger to not fall back into this old pattern what i do is leave i get up and take a nice long walk with my dog when i see that my anger wells up to the point where i would not be able to handle the situation properly where i would act like my mom once i calmed down am i able to sort things out and then approach the situation in a much more mature and healthy way call your local department of mental health and find out if they offer counseling and support groups to help you deal with this and learn how to change that pattern because that's what it is it is a behavior you grew up with unconsciously got comfortable with and therefore you got caught up in the same behavior a pattern passed down most departments of mental health do offer their own counseling services or have referrals and resources to use for those who need and want help good luck Milton H.
