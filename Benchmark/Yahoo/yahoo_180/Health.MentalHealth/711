ok so i'm going crazy nowadays i am extremely neurotic depressed tired and very pregnant i don t want to blame my hormones but everything seems to bother me and of course sometimes i just want to cry and stay at home instead of here where i m never good enough to my boss obviously i m worried about doing a bad work which i am loosing documents missing meetings etc i ve tried to be calmed to concentrate to make lists but it s just too much work sometimes and it makes me feel like i will not be able to do everything my boss wants me to and then i will not get the raise i m supposed to be getting on september i also feel upset at my friends to the point that i rather have lunch alone than seeing them i m mad at everybody i m so crazy and upset that i barely recognize myself sometimes my husband loves me he is the most patient man in the entire world if it wasn't for him i would have killed someone already what can i do i don't mean to be such a pain in the back i'm weeks pregnant and my job is well paid and i have a lot of benefits my husband has an awful job and bad salary and no benefits so he's been trying to find a new job but with no luck so if i leave this job of mine we will find ourselves with no money and that will be more stressful than the job i have now my boss is not very understanding darlin' is it possible for you to go out on maternity leave early sometimes all that you've described is your body and mind and spirit's cue to you to cut your losses and leave that insane place called the world of work how much longer do you have to go you could even have a chat w your midwife or ob and simply tell them where you're at if the stress is sufficiently awful then it seems quite possible to me that you could indeed be endangering your health and the health of your unborn baby i got the best job of my life whilst i was pregnant i'm a chef amongst other things before i began it i ended up having to tell my new clients that while i was extremely greatful they chose me b c i was pregnant and had morning sickness the entire time i was pregnant that i just didn't have the health or the energy or the well being to be their personal chef it was one of the hardest letters i've ever had to write and one of the hardest conversations i've ever had to have either but it was exactly the right choice and i was glad i made it that desire to be alone is also extremely common and very very natural very soon aloneness will be a thing of the past for about decades store up on it while you can your body knows this and it's protecting you and your needs and best interests it's all a part of going inward and the journey of becoming a mother you need your energy for you and your baby right now listen to your body our bodies are wise the reason pregnant women are all so tired those last one to two months is b c we're storing up on sleep and b c our babies are putting on a pound a week during that last month guess what all that energy's got to come from somewhere and it's coming from you we very soon won't be getting much sleep if any at all and our bodies instinctively know this listen give yourself permission go out on leave and tell your husband it's up to him to support you all now you're doing your share of the work already thank you very much you are not crazy at all you are working in a system that is made for single white men and was made up by them as well it knows and respects nothing of women's needs it doesn't even see women as different from men and doesn't compensate them equally still either you are not crazy you are very very sane do not buy that there's something wrong with you listen to everything your body and mind are trying to tell you listen and then heed Knots Landing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) EastEnders Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Abortion debate Pitaten Social rule Friends Humphrey Bogart Breastfeeding Kodocha Shaggy dog story Jam (TV series) The Contender (television series) Pregnancy Neighbours One Tree Hill (TV series) Prostate cancer Infantilism W.I.T.C.H.
