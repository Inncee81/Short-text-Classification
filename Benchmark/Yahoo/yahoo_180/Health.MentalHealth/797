attention problems i go to an all girls school and i have bee getting myself into so much trouble just so a male teacher that i am close to can talk to me after class all of the girls in my classes say wow i would never want to do that to a teacher do it again just so i can see him get angry at you again i wagged a class been arguing with him and walking out of the class texting and he has rang my mum so many times but i dont mean to cause so much trouble i just need a new begining and i need to know how to get on with my life and concentrate on achieving the best not getting into trouble that i dont mean to please help then stop stand up for yourself and learn to treat yourself the teachers and others with respect if you want to talk to the male teacher after class then do it but don't get in trouble or interfere with others time there are other girls in there that want to learn as far as your classmates go if they want to see the male teacher get angry again then by all means let them be the one to anger the teacher ever think that maybe this teacher might see something in people who have potential who want to learn ever think that by you taking the focus off of the subject at hand and putting it on you is not a good thing there are people who want to learn who want to do something with their lives stand up for your self teachers don't get paid enough students don't learn enough people don't have respect for themselves or others so if you want to be a leader do you want to do it the wrong way or the right way for a new beginning change your schedule around perhaps it might even be a good idea to stay behind one day when your not in trouble and discuss this all with the teacher maybe you might even want to apologize for the lack of concern and respect he has been due he may even has a few good suggestions to help you with your situation you can start a new beginning at anytime now is good you can achieve the best at anytime now is also a good time to do that you don't have to wait or come up with an excuse if not now when Social rule Milton H.
