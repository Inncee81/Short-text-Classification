is music really good for you you see there is this one piece of music by pachelbel and i downloaded it to my mp player it kinda reminds me of a time in my life where i could've done my best but i didnt and now it haunts me every single time i don't know i just couldnt let go sometimes when i listen to it i get motivated and say i won't let that happen again remember why you fight but sometimes when i listen to it i tell myself it will be just like that time you will fail again so don't bother i never talked to anyone about this coz they will see this as a sign of weakness but should i keep on listening to it maybe music is to lift your sipirt in more ways than happiness sadness if it motivates you sure but remember music can teach hate so dont take thing litteral from songs but if it motives you then sure listen i cant tell you what to do who knows maybe youll do something famouse by listening to it and that part about itll be like last time thats just what your mind does when you feel happy it starts so question the fact of happiness music is a natural high for mind and body Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Theory of conduct Rich Mullins Cliff Richard John Cage Happiness Social rule The Marshall Mathers LP Pachelbel's Canon Time Out of Mind Pitaten Boom Crash Opera Shaggy dog story Jennifer Lopez David Hume Music Current teachings of Prem Rawat Dualism (philosophy of mind) Mixtape Philosophy of language Sant Thakar Singh Past teachings of Prem Rawat The nature of God in Western theology Yoga Sutras of Patanjali W.
