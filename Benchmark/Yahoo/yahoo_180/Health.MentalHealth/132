for those of you with depression how do you function in a society where in my case anyway i have to raise a year old boy with no help work full time go through a divorce be in the midst of recovering from drugs dealing with parents who say things such as we wish you were never born etc i do as much as i possibly can during the day including going to therapy and support groups but at some point every single day i just can't take it anymore where just having dinner with my brother becomes a huge chore and i cannot do it then the cycle begins of my family saying that i don' t try enough i am turning my life around and starting from scratch and doing it all by myself and yet those around me don't udnerstand my depression and never look at all that i do do it's all about what i don't do you didn't have dinner w your brother my son and i aside i can't take the pressure of having to please my parents friends etc i am just running on empty and have been doing so for way too long i was a victim most my life most recent was an abusive sister who was telling me i was pessimistic was unreliable violent a bad mother and the punishments lord after years of this i totally lost myself i no longer knew who i was my confidence was gone i was shattered i couldn't believe people who said i was a good person all the good i'd done dissolved into a grim dismal haze i turned to sleeping pills and overdosed several times eventually i realized i had to escape when i saw what i had endured witnessed and allowed i became enraged furious the only things i could feel was depression rage or absolute numbness people avoided me due to my anger i finally hit rock bottom which created change i actually began to face my anger and pain i got off pain meds and decided to just deal with my physical pain i realized my thoughts were molded from birth and forgave those who taught me for they were also taught blame is pointless forgiveness everything the hardest part is forgiving our abusers mom quoted the saying poison destroys the vessel in which it is kept she d remind me of my grandfather s face the permanent frown etched there from years of hate i won't be a vessel like my him for i saw his destruction that still ripples out dreadful emotions fester spilling over to contaminate all that's precious leaving merely empty wasteland my abusers cruelties will no longer infect me like that sometimes we must remove ourselves from negative situations especially when people intentionally hurt us are pulling us down or try drawing us back to old patterns change frightens them it is scary because we become a different person sometimes friends and even family no longer play a part in our new life i found myself grieving for awhile because i didn't seem to fit in but it passed i discovered new friends that inspired rather than drained family can learn acceptance and may even change because you've set an example however i had to leave some behind i moved across the us to find peace but you cannot run from problems or you will recreate them elsewhere i dealt with them before i left this part is most important the way i saw myself i had to see myself as strong and worthy i had to learn to value myself before others could i had to see myself for who i was a book called how we choose to be happy helped me with that it really changed my life along with other powerful books i also had to consider what i wanted in life something i never really gave much thought to because i was taught to please others it took some time to consider but i finally left california to find myself i'm still in the process of that but i've healed tremendously i had to face the fact that i was groomed to be a victim there are things we do to remain victimized and there are predators who recognize this to prey on us i have been working very hard on my feelings mind set and behaviors i am changing for myself and as an example to my daughter and son who have also suffered i suffered excessive negativity night terrors and sleeplessness because of sexual and emotional abuses and traumas i have gotten so much better because of self help books color therapy and meditations these have changed my life though it takes time work and lots of commitment perhaps it could help you i've been working very hard changing myself and my thinking like seeing what i've gained not what i've lost i'm happier because i've been changing the way i see myself and my world but change takes time so be patient it's doesn't happen over night if you are interested in meditation let me know i will provide a couple that helped me or you can purchase books on it energy is real we actually carry negative energy left behind by our abusers people who have been abused have higher rates of health problems i have spent a great deal of time releasing that energy into the earth there's so much more that i have done like change the way i allow myself to be treated learning to love myself realizing i am worthy god bless you love recovery and healing is a difficult road but definitely well worth it the rewards and peace of mind are indescribable take care good
