how do i deal with this me and my sister and iming and talking about our family and the lack of love and all the anger and hatred and it's really getting to me because i've always felt unloved and attacked by the majority of my family now i feel like cutting because i'm sitting here sobbing and i don't like crying i don't like showing emotion like that but i don't really want to cut either whats another way i can deal with this i've been a si for years now and i figure it's about time i tried learning other ways of dealing si is self injury if you feel like inflicting pain on yourself please find alternatives to cutting many people say that snapping rubber bands or just making marks on themselves with pens or markers is a suitable alternative another good way to cope is to do something that keeps you busy and also lets you release your emotions try writing playing an instrument doing art or even taking up a craft like sewing or knitting in addition to making yourself feel better by doing these things you get stuff you made yourself out of the process it's good that you're able to talk to your sister about this as talking is very important in dealing with these feelings Anger management The Amber Spyglass Self-harm Emotions (album) Blood on the Tracks Social rule Grief Knitting The Ashlee Simpson Show Friends Teen Girl Squad The Marshall Mathers LP Time Out of Mind Pitaten Textile manufacturing Evil Prostate cancer Milton H.
