i haven't been myself lately i can't figure out why i am unconnected all the sudden i felt like i was going into a depression but instead of letting it take the best of me i fought it this is a normal part of my life but now i have completely lost interest in everything my sex drive is gone nothing is funny i'm not happy or sad but from what i am told i'm just straight up mean and i don't quite understand it or know how to go along dealing with this oh and i did just start using a different kind of birth control pill within the last couple weeks which is contributing to this also i used to party alot and use drugs all the time but i met a man about years ago that i loved enough to stop doing it all so i have been sober years and i guess i kinda feel like i'm peddling backwards i'm actually starting to think that i was alot better of a person when i did drugs i wasn't so high strung bitchy mean and so serious about everything i don't have the money to go back to a counsler what do i do i have questions for you are you sober like going to meetings sober or are you abstinent from drugs and alcohol without support if you don't have the support your emotions will always default to the way you used to think and feel it never fails if you do go to meetings and have a good support network then this is just a part of your growth process in sobriety i went through the same thing at about years sober i stopped going to meetings and i became an angry bastard worse than i was when i was drinking luckily i got back to meetings before i drank got the support i needed and the emotional growth continued also if you stopped using for some guy you probably didn't grow emotionally like you would if you got sober for yourself first and then got into a relationship finally don't underestimate the power of the pill talk to your gyno and see if you can change it up Alcoholics Anonymous Shaggy dog story One Tree Hill (TV series) Knots Landing Humphrey Bogart Friends Happiness Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind EastEnders Motivation Alcoholism The Smoking Room Theory of conduct Narcissism Milton H.
