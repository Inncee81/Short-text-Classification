what effect would amphetamine sulphate have when taken with prescribed diazepam and anti depressants obviously not a recommended combination but as diazepam is meant to mellow you out and amphetamines do just the opposite wouldnt it be wise then to assume that these drugs will clash and battle against each other am trying to make someone close see that though the speed may provide a temporary lift but when that wears off wouldnt the depression deepen somewhat and make everything seem worse than it was before the speed was even taken please serious answers only any input and suggestions welcome amphetamine salts are used to treat people with sleeping disorders such as narcalopsy and adhd depends on how the amphetamine salts are prescribed for example if the person is taking an extended release pill only small amounts of the drug are released at a time which would have very little effect on the diazepam the diazepam can cause drowsiness but in some people it might have the opposite effect the question about the anti depressants is what type of anti depressants is the person taken there are many anti depressants out on the market today that are not stimulant based nor are they in the same drug family as the diazepam so that they would not react with each other examples like zoloft cymbalta and abilify are non stimulant anti depressants and help slow down the neuro transmitters in the brain ativan xanax valium are the ones that are used also as sleep aids for people who suffer from depression insomina bipolar and schizofrenia disorders to name a few the amphetamine is used to help control your dopomine transmitters in the brain it helps the thoughts in the brain come under control instead of being scattered and disconnected was this person prescribed all of these meds by a doctor if so i would check into the doctor's practice to make sure they are not a pill pusher one who prescribes whatever the patient thinks he she needs in the short term effect the speed effect of the amphetamines could cause a crash effect and depending on the mood of the person at the time could cause them to be more depressed than before but again it all depends on what anti depressants are prescribed the dosage amount of the amphetamines and the diazepam if you have more questions on the drugs check out some the websites of the major pharmaceutical companies Antidepressant Bipolar disorder Amphetamine Drug addiction Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Anxiety Sleep Bupropion Methylphenidate Chronic fatigue syndrome Maprotiline Methamphetamine Psychosis Antipsychotic Clomipramine Epilepsy Adderall Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Adult attention-deficit disorder Insomnia Narcolepsy Urinary incontinence Benzodiazepine Chemical imbalance theory Psychiatry Lorazepam Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Doxepin Psychopharmacology Drug abuse Controlled Substances Act Sleep apnea Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Neurofeedback Cannabis (drug) Paroxetine Sertraline Medicine Prostate cancer Schizophrenia Stomach cancer Pharmaceutical company Migraine Chlorpromazine Mental illness Multiple sclerosis Psoriasis Hypoglycemia Traumatic brain injury Parkinson's disease Lamotrigine Addiction Anticonvulsant Haloperidol Venlafaxine Sildenafil Topiramate Gamma-hydroxybutyrate Dextroamphetamine Primidone Schizoaffective disorder Asthma Psychotherapy Medical prescription Medical cannabis Fluoxetine Cocaine Buprenorphine Kurt Cobain Methcathinone Meditation Transsexuality Growth hormone treatment Osteoarthritis Tardive dyskinesia Post-traumatic stress disorder Oral contraceptive Withdrawal Alprazolam St John's wort Hypnosis Drug test 5-HTP Alcoholism Orgasm Antiretroviral drug Hypertension Folic acid Duesberg hypothesis Dopamine Fibromyalgia
