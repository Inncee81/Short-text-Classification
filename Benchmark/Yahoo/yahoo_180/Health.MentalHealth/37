is there an alternative my entire life i had been trying to figure out what i was abused by my mother and i finally found out that it's because she thought my father cheated on her when she was pregnant with me she drank six wine coolers a day to try to make him feel guilty for if she lost me or i was born with a defect thank goodness i wasn't then for most of my life actually until i moved out for college she told me how much she didn't like me how ugly i was threatening to kill me etc a bunch of stuff but now i finally know why i don't feel better like i thought i would you know i have tried talking to her about it but as you could have possibly guessed that was futile so how can i be helped to get over this would you suggest a therapist therapy can help some it's worth a shot it never helped me with my dad becoming spiritual helped me but everyone is different what you need is a mindset to help you feel content you can't change her but you are strong enough to realize that her behavior is wrong you know that she is unstable you don't want to be treated like that and you don't want to treat people like that but this is all because you are your own person you are not her so try to draw the separation between her and yourself and while still trying to maintain some sort of distant relationship with her because you don't need the guilt and find you what makes you feel good it makes me feel good to help children and make people feel good on a daily basis what are you interested in i enjoy reading academic work socializing etc these will help find out whether you need a spiritual sort of guidance or more psychological guidance i can tell you that considering what you have written you seem to be doing well for yourself you recognize the problem and want to attack it e mail me if you want to talk Friends Alcoholics Anonymous About a Boy Theory of conduct Milton H.
