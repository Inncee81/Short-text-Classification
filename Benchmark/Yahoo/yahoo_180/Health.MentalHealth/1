math problem for each of the following find all integer values of x that make the equation or inequality true a x b x c x d x x e x a x or x b x c x or x d x e x or x work a find the square route of which equals three or negative three because a negative times a negative equals a positive b the absolute value of a numbwewr just means how far from it is so is five places away from c same thing what plus two equals duh or and the absolute value of any number is positive d add x to both sides so the x cancels and it's x then divide because you want to get the x by itself and the answer is e first find the square route of which is so what is and the answer is or find the square route then what negative number and that's Elementary algebra Square root Negative and non-negative numbers Computer numbering formats Absolute value Inequality Exponentiation Complex number ___1 (number) P-adic number Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Trigonometric function Economic inequality Binary numeral system On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Conic section Division by zero Dirac equation Mathematics 0 (number) Polynomial Prime number Quadratic equation Fischer Random Chess Real number Irrational number Unix time Quaternion Quartic equation Basel problem Negation Complexity classes P and NP Riemann zeta function Mental calculation Entropy Pascal's triangle Quantum computer Path integral formulation Expected value Napier's bones Proofs of Fermat's little theorem Golden ratio base Inequality of arithmetic and geometric means Naive set theory Optimization (mathematics) Infinity Particle in a box Random walk Continued fraction Fibonacci number Derivative Joseph Louis Lagrange Median Invalid proof Numerology Tetration Proof that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes diverges Halting problem G__del's incompleteness theorem Method of complements Sudoku Pi Cissoid of Diocles Negative binomial distribution Signed number representations Fluctuation theorem Quadratic sieve Probability Division (mathematics) Fundamental theorem of arithmetic Ordinary differential equation Polylogarithm Calculus Bose gas Goldbach's conjecture Explosive material Dice Gravity Moral relativism Lebesgue integration State space (controls) Collatz conjecture Modular exponentiation X86 assembly language Microeconomics Philosophy of space and time Algorithm Floating point Euler's totient function Multiplication Aberration in optical systems Newton's method Philosophy of mathematics Matrix (mathematics) Experiment Projective transformation Ruffini's rule Decibel
