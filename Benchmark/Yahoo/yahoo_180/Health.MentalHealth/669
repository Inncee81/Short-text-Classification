i despise my job and can't figure out how to make it work anymore i work in a small lawfirm with only one lawyer and other staff members co workers are great but the boss is a tyrant who needs to control every aspect of our lives i call in sick to work once every couple of months because i literally cannot take it i live on a small island and jobs are few and far between but i'm now developing high anxiety about going to work sometimes i leave to cry in the bathroom and have had panic attacks standing outside the office door i'm on the verge of just walking out but that would mean losing my home and possibly my son but i really don't know how to cope its in the morning and the anxiety of facing tomorrow won't allow me to sleep i can't speak to my boss as he tells us we don't know how lucky we are to work for him it will just make him direct more anger towards me i am looking for other jobs on other islands but its been months and no bites i am drowning help may sound stupid but may work pray whatever your belief i think you have someone to pray to pray for you to find a new job pray for strenght to bear with your nazi boss pray for your son i'm sure your condition will improve if you have enough faith its the only thing left to do if you do not want to fall in despair it may sound stupid especially if you do not belive but what do you lose by trying you said yourself you dont want to leave the job because it is difficult to find a new one the only option left is to live with the situation praying may help you do this even if your request is not granted or so you think as god is not the genie in the lamp you'll find strenght to continue fighting the situation so you never give up and fall to taking drugs or alcohol which will greatly make the situation worse life is not a bed of roses everyone has their crosses to bear but the weight of these crosses may lessen if you let god share their weight what can i say more you do your best and let god do the rest Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an EastEnders Social rule Muslim ibn Aqeel Anxiety The Pilgrim's Progress Knots Landing Avenue Q Prayer Shaggy dog story Simone Weil The Shining (film) Panic attack Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Eastern Orthodox Church Boss (video games) Alcoholics Anonymous Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Plame affair RuneScape quests Freeters Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories The Amber Spyglass Chronic fatigue syndrome Sin City One Tree Hill (TV series) Otello Darwin from Orchids to Variation Aphrodite Clinical depression El (god) Badly Drawn Kitties Dog training Humphrey Bogart The Catcher in the Rye Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Rich Mullins Kodocha Friends The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Miss Saigon Blackjack Book of Isaiah Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Priesthood (Mormonism) Faustyna Kowalska Brave New World Columbine High School massacre George Costanza Conversion of Dale-Gudbrand Joke Jacob John the Baptist Slow Train Coming Modoc War Ephesian Tale Liam Gallagher Stuttering Jean Grey Phoebe Halliwell Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Out-of-body experience Diazepam Euphemism Random Harvest Breath of Fire III Customs and etiquette of Japan G-Man (Half-Life) Sola fide Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Aladdin (1992 film) Guns N' Roses Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Isa The Fairly OddParents Justification (theology) Jon Secada Bipolar disorder Rule of St Benedict Christian eschatology Oasis (band) The Critic Fiddler on the Roof Forty-seven Ronin Trapped in the Closet Final Fantasy XI Blood (computer game) One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich Futurama (TV series - season 5) Pitaten Characters of Lost The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Aramaic of Jesus Garfield Hypertension
