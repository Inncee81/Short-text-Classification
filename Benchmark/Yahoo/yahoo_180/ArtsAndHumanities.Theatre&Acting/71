pleeeeease i need help ive been acting my whole child life in community theatre school plays etc and i think im ready to start auditioning for bigger roles can anyone tell me where to start my big acting career thx it's wonderful that you have that experience so many here don't have that you should absolutely look into getting an agent and if you want to find a legitimate agent to represent you for commercials tv film go to sag org use the dropdown menu on the right labeled 'resources' and choose 'agent information' on the next screen on the left choose 'find a sag franchised agent' and follow the directions you can look up agents all over the us but there are higher concentrations where the work is los angeles ny il fl ga etc another great resource is ross reports especially because they update their info so often but not all of the agents they list are sag and you have to pay for the list that doesn t mean they re not legit but that s why i always tell people to start with the sag list it s free and those agents have signed an agreement to put the actor first www rossreports com if you subscribe to backstage com you can get a combo subscription which can come in handy but can also get quite expensive then you can send the agencies your headshot resume and a cover letter stating that you are seeking representation and wait to see if they call you in for an interview you never call the agencies directly that is a big no no at least it is in la please remember that reputable agents take exactly of your pay after they help you get a job not one cent more and not one cent before anything else is a scam this is strictly for talent agents not modeling agents or talent managers who take different percentages once you have an agent they will get you the auditions but until then you can check out actorsaccess com outside of california and ny you can also see if your state has a film alliance commission society or whatever your state calls theirs some have more than one sometimes they post audition information for projects filming locally for theatre and other auditions on backstage you can go to backstage com or www actorsequity com click on casting call if you find the audition on the equity site you still may be able to go as long as their not taking appointments from equity actor's only on backstage com you have to pay to get all of the info but the initial search is free and you may be able to see enough info to find out the rest on your own without paying good luck Screen Actors Guild Modelling agency Open access Internet fraud MMORPG Spam (electronic) Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Plame affair Advance fee fraud National Football League Domain Name System Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus The Jackson 5 Cable television Divorce Marlon Brando RuneScape World Wide Web FairTax Unemployment Oakland Athletics Enterprise content management Slot machine United States Postal Service Lauren Bacall Advertising E-mail spam Corporate governance Child support Database management system Search engine optimization Minor league baseball Security (finance) Monopoly (game) Principal-agent problem Teletext Film Microsoft Karl Rove X Window System American Football League AmigaOS Sunset Boulevard (1950 film) Church of Scientology Notary public Financial audit Open Directory Project Social Security (United States) Eric Bischoff Oil-for-Food Programme Mozilla Firefox Ombudsman Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Economics Government of France Oxford English Dictionary Digital rights management Mattress W.
