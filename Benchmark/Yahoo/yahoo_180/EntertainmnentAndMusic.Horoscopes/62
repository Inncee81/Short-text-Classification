which of your friends changed the most throughout the years and what is his her sign i also realize that changing is a natural progression and that good fortune bad luck can change a person as well also what is your sign hi catwoman i really had to think about this and probably i'll think of another person later but the person who i'm thinking about now is a very very dear friend of mine she's a virgo i always seem to get on well with virgos and she really is typical of her sign she also seems to have some libra in her in that she finds it almost impossible to make a decison deliberates over things for a long long time sometimes misses chances because of this and sometimes finds it hard to motivate herself i've known her for around seven years now she's my best friend and she's this year and in those seven years she has become more independent often doing things apart from her husband because quite frankly their retirement isn't what she expected it to be when she became more adventurous he became the opposite he's a virgo too she will now make impulsive decisions such as when we all decided to go to canada together she had the holiday booked instantly which took me really by surprise and i praised her for it her husband has become more adventurous because we do a lot together as couples so that gets him out more my friend joins me and my daughters when we go off for weekend holidays and we have a lot of fun i think perhaps she has got influenced by their young and gregarious spirits her wonderful sense of humour often comes out now and it's just so wonderful to see a virgo and someone in her later years starting to enjoy life more and more thank you for the question it was nice to think this through polly 2000 Australian Grand Prix Birthday Nicomachean Ethics Social rule Theory of conduct Catwoman About a Boy Virgo Coming of Age (TNG episode) Consensus decision-making Jumpstart 3rd Grade Solar Element Saga Avenue Q Kender Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Shaggy dog story Pitaten Human nature Astrological sign Friedrich Schleiermacher Free will Evil Zodiac Incarnations of Immortality Piccolo Junior Saga K' The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Norway national football team God Emperor of Dune The Devil Wears Prada Merit Alcoholics Anonymous Supernatural Infantilism Time Out of Mind Radiohead Haven (TNG episode) Mojave people Objectivist philosophy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Ranma __ characters The Lovely Bones Blood on the Tracks Transactional analysis Uzumaki Naruto Sleeping Murder The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) One Tree Hill (TV series) EastEnders Kimi Finster Charles Darwin's views on religion Sharon Tate Eastern Orthodox Church Libra Urantia Goodness and value theory Christian eschatology Bernard Williams Numerology AFI 100 Years series Religious Society of Friends Have I Got News For You Situation comedy Aristotle Summa Theologiae Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Cliff Richard Friends Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Kodocha Victor Cousin Deconstruction Extreme Programming The Beggar's Opera Year of the Spider Scrooge McDuck The Adventures of Pete & Pete Garfield Oh My Goddess!
