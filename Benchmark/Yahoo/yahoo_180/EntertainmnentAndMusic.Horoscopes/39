help why do i have such bad luck with men born i have a pisces rising and a capricorn moon and i am the usual culprit when it comes to having problems in a certain area of life is saturn and its placement in the birth chart saturn's influence causes restrictions delays anxieties and difficulties i took a look at your birth chart and firstly you have saturn placed in the sign of scorpio the traditional planetary ruler of scorpio is mars the planet strongly linked to all things male this placement of saturn alone in a person's birth chart has the potential to cause difficulties and frustrations in relation to men women with this placement tend to feel anxious and uncomfortable around men and are highly suspicious of their motives however your natal venus which rules love and relationships also makes a stressful contact with saturn in your birth chart both men and women with this placement tend to be highly cautious and set very high standards when it comes to forming relationships it often takes them a long time to trust and warm up to someone they typically dislike frivolous and superficial affairs their love nature is serious and responsible what they typically seek is a committed relationship that will last a lifetime that is why people with venus saturn contacts tend to enter relationships and marry later than most people because they seek true quality in love and that is hard to find it requires immense patience however the good news is that saturn also rules endurance and stability consequently when people with a venus saturn contact ultimately find love it is often a love that is truly solid real and durable Astrological sign Solar system in astrology House (astrology) Astrology Asperger syndrome Zodiac Birthday Western astrology Ruling planet Polyamory Cassini-Huygens Planet Gravity Eastern Orthodox Church Human sexual behavior Medical astrology Sexual orientation Alignment (role-playing games) Social rule History of astrology Autism Astrological aspect Education in the People's Republic of China Dead Like Me Transsexuality Infantilism Capricornus Anorexia nervosa Jupiter A Course In Miracles Second language acquisition Religion and sexuality Aphrodite Timeline of solar system exploration Equine conformation W.I.T.C.H.
