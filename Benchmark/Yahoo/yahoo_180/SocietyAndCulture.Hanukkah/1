what is the difference between the two different spellings chanukkah and hanukkah the holiday is the same but actually there are more than just two different spellings it comes from the fact that the word hanukkah is hebrew so it was not originally written with english letters and it is even more difficult to write in english than other hebrew words because the first sound in the name does not have an exact spelling in english it is not really h like hair or happy nor is it ch like chair or choose instead it is a gutteral sound kind of like clearing your throat it is the same sound as in the german word ach if you have ever heard someone say ach du lieber in an old movie you'll get the idea it is also like the way scottish people say loch like loch ness not lock the way we usually say it but with that rolling chhhh that they use in scotland because there is no really right spelling for a sound we don't even have in english people try different combinations of letters to give people the idea or they just give up and simplify to h hope this helps good luck Voiceless velar fricative English language Non-native pronunciations of English Shibboleth Scotland Loch Ness Hangul Dutch language Loch Ness Monster Scottish Gaelic language Hanukkah Indonesian language Spelling reform Diacritic German language Greek language Phoneme Tetragrammaton Wolof language English spelling Latin alphabet Pinyin Esperanto as an international language Jehovah Arabic alphabet International Phonetic Alphabet Alphabet Hebrew alphabet Slovak language Firth Scots language Writing system Umlaut Old English language Vowel English as an additional language New Zealand English Morphology (linguistics) Phonology Danish language English plural Pronunciation of English th Singlish Springfield Elementary School Inverness Germanic languages Scottish English American and British English differences Vowel length Yeshu Dyslexia American English Yu-Gi-Oh!
