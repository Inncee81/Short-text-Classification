mr howard my husband and i have children together year old and year old twins my husband works fulltime and i work days per week it costs me a lot of money for childcare and at the moment i go to work for our family to have an extra per week so if i decided to stay at home rather than work my family would be worse off whicg would probably only cover the extra fuel i use to drop the kids at childcare and then pick them up again i find this very discouraging to make an effort and hving the twins in childcare is very expensive as childcare centres only give discounts once you have children in there i have always worked before having my children and only had months off for maternity leave in total i know of a few single parents which i know not all are like this who complain because they are been made go to work and they have no one to have their kids well even in a family environment it is hard if the husband works fulltime i still have to find childcare for my children is there any plans to make it easier for the working familes i stayed home with my kids for a similar reason the first week that i signed my entire paycheck over to the babysitter and still owed her ten bucks i quit my job and enrolled in first aid certification classes so i could babysit in my home worked out much better that way when you are home all day with the kids you can get really creative with ways to save money i make my own bread we have a garden that produces fresh vegetables in summer and canned goods in winter i shop carefully for bargains and sew a lot of things you can't buy then there is the joy of being the one to teach your child their colors numbers letters songs arts and crafts i miss staying at home with my kids sniff sniff but the big ones are in high school and junior high now Day care Warren Buffett EastEnders Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Emancipation of Mimi Education in the People's Republic of China $ale of the Century Microeconomics Billboard Hot 100 Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Solar power FairTax Childcare Poker jargon One Tree Hill (TV series) About a Boy Graduate school Jennifer Lopez 1957 World Series For Better or For Worse Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Freeters Children of God Education in Taiwan Mutual fund Inflation Everwood Division of labour Education in Germany The Family from One End Street Kelly Clarkson London Congestion Charge Spice Girls Weezer Laura Schlessinger Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film) 2000 Australian Grand Prix The Fairly OddParents Health insurance Humphrey Bogart Organic food Education in the United States Pitaten Cruising (maritime) Divorce Babe Ruth The Skeptical Environmentalist Credit card No Child Left Behind Act Beatmania IIDX Monday Night Football Red Hot Chili Peppers Social Security (United States) Garth Brooks Education in Romania United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East Fathers' rights movement in the UK MapleStory Capitalism Rosa Parks School bus Bond Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Live Aid Calvin and Hobbes Education in the Republic of Ireland Disney's California Adventure UK Singles Chart Avenue Q Full House U2 (band) Homeschooling RuneScape quests Days of our Lives Kodocha Radiohead Kibbutz Abigail Folger Woodlands, Singapore MMORPG Insurance Hikikomori Whitney Houston Anarchism and society Tag Mid-levels The Adventures of Pete & Pete The Temptations Leeds United F.C.
