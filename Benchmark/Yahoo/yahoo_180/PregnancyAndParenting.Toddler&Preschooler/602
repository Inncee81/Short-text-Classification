doe my baby send too much time in her bed shes months old the last months she has been sleeping close to hours at night and when shes ready to take a nap she actually takes me to her crib to put her down she will play in her crib for about an hour then go to sleep for about an hour to an hour and a half and then again in the evening for her nd nap i dont object to it for obvious reasons lol but im concerned that maybe shes spending too much time in her crib is that possible when she is up i spend plenty of quality time with her so she is definately getting enough love care and attention should i be concerned it sounds like your daughter is craving a little personal time kudos to you for getting this lucky with a child i watch my niece and nephew several days each week and we have appointed personal private time where they spend minutes alone in their rooms while i play with the other one it really helps them to calm down and get ready for dinner etc if your daughter does this before naps it's fine i wouldn't be concerned if you're worried ask your pediatrician about it or drop him her a line Sudden infant death syndrome Apollo 8 EastEnders Sleep Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Time 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Rule of St Benedict Urinary incontinence Breastfeeding About a Boy Luke and Laura Spencer Narcolepsy Fertility awareness Co-sleeping Big Brother UK series 6 Insomnia Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Phaedo Knots Landing Daylight saving time The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Fancy Crane Le Malade imaginaire John the Baptist Siesta Humphrey Bogart Avenue Q Dorama Futurama (TV series - season 5) Oasis (band) Planet Waves Melanie Wilkes James Hanratty Friends Shaggy dog story Blitzball Miss Saigon Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Polyphasic sleep USS Tunny (SS-282) Infantilism Big Brother (Australian TV series) Delayed sleep phase syndrome Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story!
