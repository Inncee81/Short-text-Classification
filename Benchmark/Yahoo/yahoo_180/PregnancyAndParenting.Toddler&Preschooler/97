my daughter just turned years old please give me some discipline methods or what works for you she must always be the center of attention and is in the talk back stage and repeats a question hundreds of times until she gets a response she will start pre school next month and i hope that can calm her somewhat i am the man of the family and my wife does nothing to assist with discipline how does time out work and how would i use it put her on time out either on a cushion on the floor or on the couch same place each time if possible no toys no books no tv etc leave the room so she has no one to talk to but check on her secretly if you can if she gets up put her back only do this for minutes because that is a long time for a child it worked great for my son i even found him on time out once when he was five and he had put himself there for something he had done although i appreciated that i let him off it wasn't something i would have given him time out for anyway but anyway after a few time outs when she knows you are serious her behavior will change as far as the repeating of questions not to be a smart ass but it is far easier just to answer them when they are asked then she won't keep repeating them to get an answer good luck Shaggy dog story Dog training Social rule 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Zhao Yun The Newlywed Game GED Plame affair timeline 1957 World Series Milton H.
