my year old is driving me crazy by not listening i just asked her to clean up a mess she made by the table she threw some melon during breakfast she said no mommy you do it i again asked her to do it she just looked at me and refused to do it i put her in time out for awhile and then got her out and told her again to pick it up she refused so now she's back in time out i don't know what to do she needs to learn to clean up her messes when i ask her to i don't think this time out is even working any ideas discipline only works if the parent is more relentless than the child let this be your mantra i will not let a three year old boss me around throwing food is unacceptable and you are right not to tolerate it let the girl sit in her corner until she is ready to clean it up you gave her the three minute time out now the choice is hers she can chose to sit in a boring time out or she can chose to ask politely to clean up her mess then play if you make it very clear to her that those are her only two options she will eventually chose to clean up the melon if she wants to sulk in the corner for a little while first don't let it bother you take the time to do something quiet that makes you happy like read a book or magazine or eat a cookie you will be surprised at how quickly she will be a helpful respectful girl again stick with it because it's worth it Shaggy dog story The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe St. Elmo's Fire (film) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Avenue Q The Amber Spyglass Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Social rule Singlish Time Out of Mind Cleveland Browns Garfield One Piece minor characters Grandview, U.S.A.
