he wont listen what do i do my son is in general a very good kid most everything i tell him to do not do he listens the only problem i have with him is he keeps playing in the bathroom it is attached to his room so unless im supervising every move of the time i dont know if hes in his room or the bathroom i cant lock him out or anything cuz its the bathroom i took all the chemicals out so thats not a concern but thats gross i dont want him playing in there and every time i catch him at least times a day i ask him what are you doing he always responds with playing in the bathroom i know im not supposed to so i know he knows better i have spanked him taken things away done time out and nothing is working its frustrating the hell out of me if he knows hes not supposed to how do i make him stop unless he is playing in the toilet then you might just have to let it go if he is in the toilet then get a toilet lock keep it super clean and let him play in it it could be worse give him a clorox wipe and let him wipe up the area he usually plays in so he has some responsibility sounds like he is old enough the bathroom is actually not even as germy a room as the kitchen in most houses so it isn't so bad or just lock him out of it if you are really against it if there is another bathroom in the house he can use that one but eventually you will have to let him back in it and then the problem starts again perhaps ignoring the problem will make it less attractive to him good move to take everything out of it though Japanese toilet Toilet Toilet paper The Shining (film) Bathroom Fecal incontinence Shaggy dog story Bristol Grammar School Friends Social rule Beavis and Butt-head Punk ideology Kitchen Washroom Bidet Dormitory Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sin City Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Toilet humour Changeroom Pitaten Saw II The Brady Bunch Colony in Space The Inside Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan Patrick Star Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Video game music Euphemism Theory of conduct Operation Market Garden Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Kimberly-Clark Corporation Utilitarianism Property (ownership right) Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Jam (TV series) About a Boy Queensbridge Blood Simple Menstrual cup Rugby union positions StarCraft: Uprising House Chinglish Knife 1957 World Series EastEnders Urinal Ron Weasley Poker jargon Russian joke Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide 2000 Australian Grand Prix Vegeta Chess terminology The Time Machine Piccolo Junior Saga Professional wrestling holds Phoebe Halliwell Ariel (Firefly episode) Operation Petticoat Treehouse of Horror V Paul W.
