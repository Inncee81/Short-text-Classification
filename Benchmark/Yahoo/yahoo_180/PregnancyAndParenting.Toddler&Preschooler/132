we're flying with our yr old son for st time hr flight then a hr drive he is very active any ideas containment is key make sure he has his own seat on the flight and bring your car seat on the plane and buckle him in he will be more comfortable and he can't get out to run up and down the aisles he's also more likely to sleep my son is wild but almost always sleeps on the plane something about the noise and motion i think get him his own little carry on bag with wheels and stock it with healthy snacks small toys crayons and paper and a spare change of clothes just in case and if he's not sound asleep keep him busy during the flight if he's in a car seat he'll have to sit next to a window so you can also look out the window together between the flight and drive make sure to give him some serious running around time a clean diaper and a good meal or snack he might be cranky when you get to your destination but a good night's sleep should fix him right up have fun Passenger car Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Southwest Airlines Fixed-wing aircraft Railroad car The Shining (film) Japanese tea ceremony Drag racing Air New Zealand Diaper Pan Am Flight 103 Hong Kong International Airport United Airlines Flight 93 Flight controls Helicopter Hamster Urinary incontinence IBM PC compatible Train Concorde Sleep Blood Simple Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Sears Holdings Corporation Model aircraft Airport Ryanair Station wagon C__ile Ferate Rom__ne The Amber Spyglass USS Wasp (CV-7) Airbag Jackass: The Movie The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Comanche Volkswagen Type 2 Bicycle Air France Flight 8969 Siesta Suicide methods Crayola Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Sukkot Traditional animation Isetta Aviation history Windows XP Sport utility vehicle Mattress Autogyro Teen Girl Squad Co-sleeping Mouse (computing) Movie theater Saki Douglas DC-8 Macbeth Computer virus Late Night with Conan O'Brien Winning Streak Dog Mercedes-Benz A-Class Spacecraft propulsion Sleep debt Sleeping car Insomnia Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571 B-47 Stratojet Clyde Pangborn 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Sin City American Black Bear Fun Lovin' Criminals TGV Rail terminology Fecal incontinence Cuisine of Denmark Spatial disorientation Sports car Recumbent bicycle Gliding Tea Target Corporation Happy Meal Phonograph Boeing 747 SR-71 Blackbird Airline Citro__n 2CV Tire Atari 8-bit family Air Force One Camp Lazlo Paul Is Dead Saints and Soldiers Mohamed Atta al-Sayed Japan Airlines Bus models used in New York City Transit Mexicana de Aviaci__n The Joker's Wild
