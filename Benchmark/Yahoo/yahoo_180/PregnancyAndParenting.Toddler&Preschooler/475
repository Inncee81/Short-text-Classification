year old belly ache ok i don't know what to do about my year old she keeps saying that her belly hurts she'll go sit on the toilet and try to go potty but here's where i m confused she'll say things like my belly hurts because i want to go to the playground or to the store something like that how can i get her to stop because i'm not going to know when she is serious she's been doing this for months it's like the boy that cried wolf i have started making her lay down when she says this to make her feel better and she gets upset and cries what do i do a four year old can comprehend a lot so sit down tell the story about the boy who cried wolf make it intriguing then tell her that what she does is like that then tell her that when she tells you that her belly hurts you will listen and take care of her as you see best which means laying down to rest till she feels better tell her that it will never get her a trip to the park or the store or anything else great job in turning that around and saying you don't feel well you better lay down just from experience i wouldn't use the say things like we better to go the doctor for shots if that scares her enough to stop that will get you the results you want for now but when you do have to take her to the doctor for anything and someday yes for a shot she will be petrafied and that is something not worth dealing with then if you think that the reason she stopped saying the belly thing was for no other reason than she does not want shots so you don't want to plant a fear issue to resolve another issue and don't worry if it ever is for real you will know by how she is acting Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Shaggy dog story Jon Secada The Shining (film) Taxi Driver Sin City One Tree Hill (TV series) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Theory of conduct Social rule Kodocha Jam (TV series) Le Malade imaginaire Milton H.
