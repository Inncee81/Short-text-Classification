should i keep my son's potty seat in the bathroom while he is learning to use it my son is years and months and i'm starting to potty train him he wants to sit on the new potty chair we bought for him but only for a short time i was wondering if its a bad idea to bring it out say in front of the tv so he can sit on it longer while being a bit distracted at two years old he isn't going to have a long attention span so don't expect him to sit on the potty longer than a minute at most keep the potty seat in the bathroom give him one of those potty stories to read while he's on the seat in the beginning don't expect him to actually go just get him used to sitting on the seat when i potty train a child and i potty train at least children every school year i start by taking them to the potty about every mins then i also keep a chart in which i write down the times he is wet i do that only for a week to see if there are regular times when he seems to go then i can make sure he sits on the seat if that seem to be his voiding time i have the parents send in about pairs of cloth training or underpants and complete changes of clothing per day in the beginning i find that children cant really tell when they're wet with pullups because they do such a great job of absorbing all the pee even the new ones with the cool sensation isn't quite the same as cloth yes it's more laundry initially but soon the kids are potty trained and it's no more diapers except at nap night time the parents love that good luck and remember not to push too hard or you may stress the child and he could regress best wishes Fecal incontinence Urinary incontinence Diaper Kimberly-Clark Corporation Toilet humour Undergarment The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie The Fairly OddParents Elimination communication Milton H.
