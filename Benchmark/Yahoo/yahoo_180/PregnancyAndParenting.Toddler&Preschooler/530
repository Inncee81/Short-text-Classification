attention potty trainers haha for those of you who have or are potty training your toddlers right now what were the first signs of them being ready my daughter is months old and while i know that she's not ready to be in big girl undies and using the potty i think she's ready to start trying to potty let me give you my situation twice last week we went to get her up from her nap diaper was off and she was upset she didn't wet or mess in the bed but she had the diaper off yesterday i sat her on the pot and encouraged her to tee tee of course she didn't but she thought it was fun to sit on it so last night we tried again she didn't go and i didn't leave her on long enough either because it was time for bath so we got her down and i got in the tub to find the water was too hot she reached over to lift the lid of the pot daddy said no she does it all the time and secs later she tee teed on the floor what do you all think sounds like she is ready to know about the potty just not ready to pottytrain yet the important thing about pottytraining is the child needs to be able to communicate to you in some way that he she has to use the potty and they need to be able to get the pullups underware up and down themselves or atleast willing to attempt it if she does happen to go potty in the potty give lots of praise girls are usually faster about pottytraining good luck and make sure daddy is with you on the pottytraining thing too when she shows interest in the potty make sure he puts her on it just like you do and she will be pottytrained before you know it good luck Social rule Customs and etiquette of Japan Shaggy dog story Elimination communication Teen Girl Squad Dog training Kimberly-Clark Corporation Housebreaking Infantilism The Emancipation of Mimi Textile manufacturing Jackass: The Movie The Chemical Brothers Milton H.
