how would you deal with a month old who throws tantrums my son will headbang too with the tantrums serious answers please so will my yr old who's been doing it since about your sons age i don't know why and it freaks me out my oldest never did it so when my nd came along it was all unfamiliar territory to me i asked my doctor and she really didn't have any answers for me she wasn't much help and seemed shocked when i told her that he'll throw himself on the floor and bruise his forehead if you tell him no now not sure if this will help but if he throws himself on the floor i walk over him and ignore him i noticed if i pick him up and give in to what he wants brothers toy candy something i'd normally not let him play w the tantrums would get more frequent and worse so now i ignore him at first it was hard cause it seemed like he would scream forever but eventually he'd get up and go play w something and it would be over w i'm not saying it cures them of all tantrums but it cut mine down from like a day to once a day oh also i've heard that if children your sons age can usually act out violently because they can't talk properly like we can so they get flustered cause they can't tell us what they are feeling or what they want so that could be part of it good luck Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Kodocha Shaggy dog story Little Britain The Shining (film) The Star Wars Holiday Special Theory of conduct Fecal incontinence Stomach cancer Fred Phelps Saturday Night Live Rais massacre Piccolo Junior Saga The Inside Autism Static Shock Milton H.
