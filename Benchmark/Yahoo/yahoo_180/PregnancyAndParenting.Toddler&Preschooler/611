why won't she use the potty i need some advice here we have a very smart year old daughter yes she's smart not just because she's mine she knows what the potty is and will sit on it and some times use it i take her in the mornings after nap before bath and several times during the day she won't go grrrr i know she understand because we have tried m m's as reward we have also used the get cold pull ups and she doesn't notice the difference she will go mostly before bath but other times will pich a huge fit and doesn't want to go potty i'm thinking that she's just not ready am i right i know every child is different but my mom can't rememer how we were and all my other friends have kids younger than she is help please you know my daughter was the exact same way the pull ups to her were no different than diapers the cold feeling didn't bother her either i was just as frustrated as you are it sounds like you're home with her quite a bit this is a good thing my daughter has been potty trained for about a month now wooo hooo i didn't think it would ever come what we i should say my mom since she started it did was put regular underwear on her she had about two wet accidents my daughter did not like the feeling whatsoever of her underwear being wet but she mostly disliked the feeling of the pee running down her leg my mom would take her to the bathroom about every hour and after the few accidents she started going on the toilet in the beginning she would want to sit on the toilet for about a half hour before she actually went but it was worth it so if you can try putting your daughter in regular underwear if she wets don't make a big deal out of it just say oops you had an accident lets go potty on the toilet that worked really well with my daughter we had to take my daughter to the bathroom for a while but now she tells us when she needs to go now my daughter goes all the time and i have even gotten lucky and she won't go in her pull up at night she even tells me when she's taking a bath that she needs to go potty she won't go in the bath water it's awesome and it only took about a week at the most to really get her into the routine like i said after a few accidents she got the idea of going on the toilet good luck mom you can email me if you have any further questions because your daughter sounds like exactly what my daughter did just over a month ago and my daughter is also she will be in december Kimberly-Clark Corporation Toilet Fecal incontinence Social rule Toilet humour Japanese toilet Avenue Q The Adventures of Pete & Pete The Fairly OddParents Toilet training Diaper Married... with Children The Shining (film) The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Shaggy dog story The Contender (television series) Urinary incontinence Grandview, U.S.A.
