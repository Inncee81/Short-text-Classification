did my toddler have night terrors this has only happened nights while on vacation one night at my fathers house and one night at my house here is what he did woke up screaming crying grunting he was all red and his head would jerk each time he took in a breath i tried to hold him to comfort him and he just kept crying and screaming he would push me away with his arms after a while he would open his eyes kind of calm down then do it again for a while i could not calm him down eventually he opened his eyes and calmed down on his own and was really quiet for a while is this what children do when they wake from a night terror on all of the nights where he woke up like this he had not sleep his usual amount from naps it sounds like he was overstimulated with missing his naps and being on a vacation it is a combination of being over active and a bit of night terror but it was cause by his activeness of his days children like patterns bc they know what is coming next but because you were on vacation he didn't really know what was going on i will bet that when you get home he will calm down and go back to being himself i know because at times when my daughter was overstimulated by going to the pool then missing her nap would wake in the middle of the night screaming this happened twice on different occasions i hope this helps and good luck Sleep Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Miss Saigon Poker jargon Futurama (TV series - season 5) Urinary incontinence The Shining (film) Pitaten Insomnia 50 First Dates Salad Fingers L__ Bu Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Siesta Blitzball Narcolepsy The Amber Spyglass Michael Garibaldi Jon Secada Hip hop collaborations Donald Neilson The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy The Contender (television series) Hansel und Gretel Sin City Tris Speaker Breath of Fire III Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an House of M Three Stooges Kodocha Hulk (comics) Rovers Return Lisa the Vegetarian Rapid eye movement Betting (poker) Babe Ruth Reservoir Dogs Sonic the Hedgehog Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Autism World Series AFI 100 Years series The Legend of Zelda series enemies Craps Scenes from a Memory Vincent Price Charles Bukowski Sukkot 2000 Australian Grand Prix The Inside Characters of The Sandman Lucid dreaming Time Out of Mind Scream (film) Waking the Dragons Piccolo Junior Saga Make Believe Jam (TV series) The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask characters Random Harvest Breastfeeding Bob and George Kibbutz Cleveland Indians Have I Got News For You A Night in Heaven The Sims Srebrenica massacre Swimming Mattress What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?
