my son is very bow legged he is yrs old he was a late walker at months and even now at months he when he runs he does it on his tiptoes i want to know what the long term effects of bow legged ness are in kids he has been checked for hip dysplasia and he doesn't have it i am worried this is partially my fault because when we are at home the kids run barefoot all the time and he learned to walk in the house in winter so he hardly wore shoes until he was almost months old i would like to hear from anyone who has older kids that are bow legged my youngest son was bowlegged by the time he hit around or a little older than two he had a growth spurt and it straightened his legs out do not worry about letting your children go barefoot my pediatrician said that when children are learning to walk it is better for them to be barefoot give him a little while longer and keep checking with his pediatrician i am sure it your pediatrician is not worried i would not be alarmed either give him a little time to grow out of it if he gets to be and still looks bowlegged see if you pediatrician can recommend you to a specialist Diving Equine conformation High-heeled shoe Barefoot Puberty Aerial (dance move) Pediatrics Breastfeeding Scoliosis Comanche Japanese tea ceremony Sport rowing Horse gait Breakdancing Professional wrestling aerial techniques Phimosis Iliotibial band syndrome Prostate cancer Koopa Kid Human height Urinary incontinence Hip dysplasia Growth hormone treatment Pantyhose Abbot Walking Archery Dog training Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Flat feet Havanese Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Shaggy dog story Drowning Teachers (film) 1957 World Series Melanie Wilkes Hip hop culture Foot Heracles Emperor Xuan of Han Undergarment Black tie Triathlon The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Blackjack Link (Legend of Zelda) Bow (weapon) Codename: Kids Next Door Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Past teachings of Prem Rawat Social rule Horseshoe Daylight saving time Achondroplasia Ice hockey Salad Fingers Situation comedy Infidels Customs and etiquette of Japan Punt (boat) The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time weapons and items Tennessee Walker Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Satchel Paige The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask characters Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb The Amazing Race Piccolo Junior Saga Paget's disease of bone Eastern Illinois University USS Tunny (SS-282) Swingout Mach kernel Childbirth Chicago, Illinois Billy the Kid Biped Team Fortress Classic Growth hormone deficiency Namie Amuro Mission UK Stephen King Naval mine Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Brian Close AFI 100 Years series Horse Dog The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Christmas Joseph (Hebrew Bible) Characters of Lost Shadow the Hedgehog Rich Mullins Battles of Lexington and Concord Androgen insensitivity syndrome Avenue Q Gwen Stacy Indian Oil Cup 2005
