my mo is not sleeping through the night because his diaper is leaking i have him in s it is very hot here right now so i've been having to give him extra fluids so he keeps waking up and wanting to sleep in my bed i had just convinced my hus that it was time to end our co sleeping and my son slept a few nights alone in his bed he normally wears size diapers but the s were still not enough has anyone gone through this did you find any diapers that would hold up all night i need some sleep in a bed without a toddler who doesn't want you to touch him while he sleeps don't say don't give him liquid it's degrees warmer here than normal and we've broken heat records for the last days the house is not getting below degrees at night he's too little to go without liquid in that i thought i had remembered there was a huggies product for night time but when i went shopping i didn't see them i'll try wal mart nan i started to do that last night but i thought maybe it sounded crazy if he wakes up tonight i'll try it by the time i get in there to change him he is wide awake and mad lol i have to go through my night time routine to get him back in bed and most nights i'm just too tired to try plus i have school m f and i need my sleep lindsey if the house wasn't so hot i'd try that but he's very hot natured and he'd still be up screaming i'm using huggies but if i can't find the overnights tomorrow i think i'm going to try a pack of luvs if they don't work for him i'll just send them to daycare they change him every hours anyway mayasmom he's not developmentally able to put pullups on yet especially not in the middle of the night my bff's three yo can't even do that without some help i guess girls are able to do those things faster i agree with the diaper doubler if they don't sell them around where you are you can buy them online and also try the night time pull ups as they seem to hold more for my little boy through the night and he doesn't relaly wake up too often at night anymore and depending on the weight you may consider the good nights they're more expensive than pull ups but i think they're wonderful plus they have better odor control than pull ups i know what you mean about the heat it's been well into the 's this past week and if the pull ups and goodnights can survive a night after hydrating a kid for that then it's very well worth it i have found that pull ups do leak quicker than the goodnights though Kimberly-Clark Corporation Urinary incontinence Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Social rule Shaggy dog story Humphrey Bogart Jon Secada Futurama (TV series - season 5) Sin City The Shining (film) Slow Train Coming Bedwetting Miss Saigon Winning Streak The Amber Spyglass Aerial (dance move) The Emancipation of Mimi Avenue Q Billboard Hot 100 We Belong Together EastEnders Procter & Gamble Milton H.
