i need tips for babysitting ok im going to be babysitting two little girls ones about the others a year younger ive known them since birth but this is my first time babysitting and im only it will be darkish outside from any ideas they will probably be going to bed by anyway so you don't need to worry too much about things to do with them i suggest playing with them indoors letting them show you how they play with their toys and maybe having a favorite childhood movie on in the background babysitting is easy just don't give them too much to do let them decide what to do and just have fun doing it and supervising just make sure to follow any house rules to the letter and that they are in bed on time Calvin and Hobbes The Fairly OddParents Tag EastEnders Garfield Lizzie McGuire Stewie Griffin FoxTrot The Adventures of Pete & Pete Social rule Milton H.
