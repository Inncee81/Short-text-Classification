why do children typically like to play with really expensive nice things and not the things they are suppose to i'm going out of my mind i tell my son not to bother things and when i turn my back there he goes even for a second and it's not something that is like the trash can or dishwasher no it's our computer or messing with my vaccuum by the ways these are in dollar form washing machine it drives me nuts then when he messes with it my husband fusses at me when all i did was try to have him a glass of lemonade when he walked in the door from work when do children grow out of this stage when they are made to do chores he's sixteen months old make sure you are giving him stuff that he can play with instead of telling him what not to do don't try telling him what to do for example you can play with the toys on the floor or something like that many young children do not hear the 'don't' part of a direction and don't do something becomes do something further drawing attention to something by telling him not to touch it only makes it more enticing to the child give him plenty of things he can do and try telling him what you want him to do instead of what you don't want him to do i think you'll find that this helps a month old does not 'like to play with expensive things' he has no concept about what is expensive or not draw his attention to other toys and keep an eye on him months is very very young and he cannot be expected to remember directions such as don't play with that you need to monitor him around things you don't want him playing with and redirect him to appropriate toys and activities Social rule Milton H.
