my grandson is always swearing and shouting when he plays computer games he even kicks the walls he s really loud i have to get him off their its horrible how can i control this weird behaviour it the same with all the children my grandson is the same when he is allowed to play these games and so his parents restrict him to morning afternoon and perhaps after his tea but not before he goes to bed it seems as though they get possessed when they play these games children need to be monitored and not left to their own devices when playing these games no matter what tantrums they try on to get their own way spare the rod and spoil the child that old adage serves as well today as it did years ago and todays parents would do well to heed this including my own daughter Avenue Q Jean Grey Tag Shaggy dog story Console game Computer and video games History of Test cricket (1884 to 1889) EastEnders Pinball Pete Sampras 2000 Australian Grand Prix Characters of Naruto Book of Joshua Child abuse Sydney Riot of 1879 Football (soccer) Spanking Futurama (TV series - season 5) Slot machine Child sexuality ZX Spectrum Pittsburgh Steelers Nintendo Entertainment System Game Boy The Den (television) Video game console Commodore 64 Kain (Legacy of Kain) Baby Blues Marie Antoinette Computer and video game genres Amiga Power Sly Cooper Nuclear reactor Jacob Water polo Transactional analysis Combine (Half-Life 2) Game controller South Park Rais massacre Sub-Zero The Catherine Tate Show 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Jason Voorhees Atari ST Noah Little Britain Romulus and Remus School bus Atari 8-bit family TV game Super Bowl XVIII Cheating in Counter-Strike Marathon (computer game) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Yu-Gi-Oh! main characters Motion picture rating system Super Bowl XIV SMTV Live Santa Claus Russian joke National Football League Color Super Bowl XV OpenGL Eric Cartman Ryo Bakura Saint Nicholas Domestic violence Calvin and Hobbes WNNX (FM) The Ashes Censorship in Australia Veruca Salt Regional lockout Rugby union Insomnia Super Bowl XIII Canadian football Super Bowl XXV Hearing impairment G-Man (Half-Life) Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Codename: Kids Next Door Comparison of Canadian and American football Rod Stewart Tea Team Rocket Emulator Polyamory Code: Lyoko About a Boy Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Final Fantasy Legend III John the Baptist The Doctor Dances
