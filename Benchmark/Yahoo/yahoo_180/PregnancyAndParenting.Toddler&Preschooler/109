night time is it okay to put safety lock on yr old's door so he can't get out my son is the most energetic yr old ever which is loads of fun however because he's not afraid of anything and loves to try new things i feel uncomfortable at night time just in case he wakes up and gets out of bed he's learned how to crawl out of the crib so we put him in a toddler bed he knows how to open the doors too at night time though i put those child safety locks over his doorknob so he can't get out is that okay i would hate for him to get into something or get hurt in the middle of the night it sounds horrible though any thoughts my parents had to do the same thing for my brother who is now years old if i think i have you right you have the child door handle covers on the in side of the room so you can get in but he can not get out i was starting to think i might do the same for my daughter that way if there is a fire or something else that may go wrong you will know where to find your child if they can open the door to the bed room it will not be long till they can get them self's out of the house you are doing it for the child's safety not as a punishment make his room as safe as you can strap the dresser to the wall just remember that they say it is safer to sleep with the bedroom doors closed in case of a fire good luck and get a good nights sleep The Shining (film) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sin City Doctor Who (Enemy Within) Car safety Social rule The Death Gate Cycle Shaggy dog story Blood Simple Columbine High School massacre Blankets (graphic novel) Futurama (TV series - season 5) Co-sleeping Mattress W.I.T.C.H.
