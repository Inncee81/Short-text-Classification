how do you feed a very picky child my daughter is and wants to eat nothing but peanut butter and bread if she is made to eat something else she makes herself sick she eat just a few bites of food of her choice yesterday and has eat nothing but two little bites of biscut and gravey today she got sick this evening from not eating and said she was ready to eat after eating very little got sick again i don't have any idea what to do to get her to eat different types of food i had her doctor tell me that she'd eat when she gets hungry to make her eat what we eat that doesn't work and now i am at a dead end as to what to do please help okay your daughter is actually 'making herself throw up' and isn't actually 'getting sick' this is something i learned from a person who did that even as young as three and did it all of his life his mother was a terrible cook what you need to do is to 'distract' your daughter from her 'pickiness' by 'accenting it' tell her that you know that she 'loves peanut butter and bread' but that you think that she's 'just picky enough' to learn to 'really enjoy' other 'foods' that most kids never try then the two of you should 'go out to lunch' at someplace where she can't get her 'peanut butter and bread' and 'try something totally new' perhaps some 'steamed fish' with some 'fresh vegies' steamed don't make her eat 'a lot' but let her 'decide' what to try and when she's 'done' you can 'pull out' a peanut butter brownie she loves peanut butter which is actually a very good source of protein and she won't want to 'throw up' with that 'brownie' sitting on 'top of' the other food then 'go shopping' and don't buy peanut butter or 'her type of bread' but buy 'lean and tasty fresh foods' that she can 'nibble on' and then have 'half' of her 'peanut butter on good bread' for 'dessert again with that peanut butter on top she's not going to want to 'throw up' give it time and be 'extremely patient' but engage your daughter in 'buying and preparing new foods' and emphasize that 'other kids don't have your good taste in food' and your daughter will soon be a 'real foodie' and will stay 'slim' but be 'engaged in eating healthy' her whole life Breakfast Bread Cuisine of Denmark Tofu Peanut butter Cuisine of the Philippines Peanut Hamburger French cuisine Japanese cuisine Pizza Jewish cuisine Butter Ramen Cuisine of Malaysia Food German cuisine Peanut butter and jelly sandwich Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Vegetarian cuisine Cuisine of Singapore Comanche Cuisine of the Southern United States Cuisine of Brazil Veganism Pancake Bagel Chinese cuisine Garfield Singlish Fecal incontinence Passover Chocolate Sandwich Fish and chips Dim sum The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Dairy Hot dog Chili con carne Shaggy dog story Porridge Dieting Cookie British cuisine Kodocha The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Cuisine of Africa Domesticated turkey French fries Hansel und Gretel About a Boy Yakitate!!
