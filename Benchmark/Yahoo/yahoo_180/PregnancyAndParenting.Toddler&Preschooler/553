my m old has a fever and is seeing something that terrifies her it's really weird whats happening my m old girl started a fever last night i was lying beside her this morning she still had a fever and was wimpering half a sleep when all of a sudden she started up her eyes wide looking at something on the blank wall behind me she screamed the most horrifid scream raised her hands up above her head and fell back i picked her up and tried to soothe her she was looking all aroud the room trembling with fear and crying her scared cry she is not taking any meds what is really weird is the same thing happed to my now four year old son when he was i took him to the doctor and the dr said he had never heard of that and not too worry but my son is very fearful to this day how high is her fever this sounds like fever hallucinations to me that's strange that your doctor hasn't heard of this it's very common with high fever to hallucinate i did all the time as a child this is pretty common and i'd worry more about getting the fever down than anything she's seeing that isn't there if she or your son continue to see things after the fever breaks i would take them to a doctor a different one as that isn't normal and my be a cause for concern hope she feels better Shaggy dog story Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Milton H.
