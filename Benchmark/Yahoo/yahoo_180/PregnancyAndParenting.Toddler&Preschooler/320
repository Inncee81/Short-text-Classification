is it ok that my month old son still sleep in my bed as long as you are fine with it who cares what any one else thinks america is the only country that forces their children to grow up and be independent too soon every other country encourages being close with their parents being a baby child and developing normally without being rushed into being a big kid before he's ready like how american's rush to get their newborns to sleep through the night regardless of how hungry they will get during the middle of the night remember their tiny tummy's are only as big as their fists and they need to eat more we rush them into learning how to hold their own bottles potty train them by the time they are okay sorry for the rant but going back to your question i see absolutely nothing wrong with him sleeping with you not only will he know he's safe because mommy is nearby but he'll have the added comfort security and bond with you too many parents force their infants to fend for themselves and sleep on their own what kind of security is that teaching them that they are stuck in their crib or stuck in their room regardless if they get scared or just want a parent to snuggle with they are left to fend for themselves i'd love to see the mentality personality comparisons of each group as adults it would be interesting to see who became the more well rounded adult Breastfeeding Infant Co-sleeping Sudden infant death syndrome Humphrey Bogart Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Infantilism Abortion debate One Tree Hill (TV series) Urinary incontinence Sesame Street Comanche Child Child sexuality EastEnders Care Bears The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Lisa's First Word The Subtle Knife Knots Landing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) John the Baptist Milton H.
