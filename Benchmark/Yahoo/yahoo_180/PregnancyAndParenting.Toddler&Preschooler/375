any ideas of fun pre k activities for a month old im looking for fun but at the same pre k activities to prepare my son for pre school any idea there is no reason at all to try and prepare your child for preschool let him have fun and let him play and that is the best way for him to learn talk to him pay attention to him enjoy being with him share your daily activities with him take him places with you around town and when you are out of town tell him about the world while he is out looking around at it with you reading to him is about the best educational thing you can do i've heard it said that kids need toys sand and water they learn a lot by being able to play with sand and water and a few cups or containers can make it a little more fun and educational i've also heard it said that the most important things to do with your child every day are to read to him and to cook with him play with him and let him enjoy being with you and let him enjoy playing with what he likes to do he will make it clear what he is interested in learning at any specific time by being interested in it if he is not enjoying something that you are trying to teach him don't bother at his age he needs to be able to learn completely on his own pace in fact he will not learn anything until he is ready for it he will just be bored or irritable if you insist on teaching him something and it will not help him to learn anything but rather will end up showing him that learning is boring if he likes to play hide and seek or catch or chase or roll over and get tickled or look at himself in the mirror and have you talk to him or have you point out where his nose and eyes are then do all those things with him and let him enjoy being with you Avenue Q Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Pitaten About a Boy God Emperor of Dune Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Garfield Bart chalkboard gags Little Britain Milton H.
