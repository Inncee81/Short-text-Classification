what is going on with my year old she has been going to the bathroom in her pants she is fully potty traines but just these last couple days if you dont take her to the bethroom she will just go right in her pants shes never done this before i dropped her off with her dad today and he called me saying she went poop in her pants and pee like times i think it is because she is just excited to be around the other kids there and to busy playing she just doesnt care she hasnt been around too many kids this summer so does that sound like a reson she was soing that so much today she has only done it a couple times here at home if i dont take her to the bathroom on time she likes to be accomponied sp also she doesnt go over there much so maybe thats another reason excuse my spelling i was typing fast excuse my spelling i was typing fast this is going to sound strange but is there any chance her dad was allowing her to drink caffeinated soda chugging a cola or two can make kids act strangely not to mention act as a diuretic and a laxative if this is not the case she may have been too shy to ask for 'help' in the bathroom causing her to hold it until she lost control not to freak you out but loss of control when accompanied by other warning signs can be a sign of abuse there are many other possible reasons for her 'accidents' much more likely than someone hurting her but if you feel you have any cause for concern it might be something to look into Fecal incontinence Atomic Kitten Toilet humour Caffeine The Fairly OddParents The Adventures of Pete & Pete Social rule Japanese toilet Urinary incontinence MC Hammer The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Knots Landing Babe Ruth Friends Ron and Fez Hypoglycemia Kimberly-Clark Corporation Vowel The Shining (film) Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Toilet Singlish Paul Is Dead Chris Jericho The Young Ones (TV series) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Kyle Broflovski Fathers' rights Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Rape Anorexia nervosa About a Boy Minor league baseball War of the Worlds (2005 film) I'm Spelling as Fast as I Can One Tree Hill (TV series) Anger management Crate training Urination Ben Johnson (athlete) Fast bowling Blink-182 Butters Stotch Involuntary commitment Pitaten Hey Jude Mnemonic Buttocks Divorce The Wack Pack Parachuting Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Good Times Characters in Bleach series Manual transmission Homer Simpson Recess (TV series) Softball Dead Like Me Yerba mate Gothic metal Terri Schiavo Diuretic English cricket team Tori Amos Emo Fasting Bart chalkboard gags Thom Yorke Billboard (advertising) Ranma __ characters Non-native pronunciations of English Jackass: The Movie George Costanza Cirrhosis Doug Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?
