what's the deal with microwaves and getting cancer i've heard that you shouldn't be in the room while they're working open the door without pressing stop look at them when they're working are any of the above true i know not to microwave with plastic plates bowls and stuff like that can any of you support your answer with a real source not just tell me that my grandma told me that exposure to microwave radiation for extended periods may well cause certain cancers to occur they may also cause cataracts birth defects and other serious health problems including nervous system damage headaches and pacemaker interference however new ovens are typically designed so as not to exceed mw cm of radiated power in addition any leak that exceeds mw cm at a distance of inches from a microwave oven is considered to be dangerous and the oven should not be used ovens can deteriorate over time and should be checked to ensure that these limits are not exceeded this can be done by your local service centre or you can purchase and earth leakage detector and have it on hand to keep a regular maintenance check of your oven if an oven is in good condition then it would present no more risk then anything else around your home such as eating processed food using mobile phones living near hv power lines or living in your house which exposes you to electromagnetic radiation from the electrical wiring with respect to the safety of using plastics in a microwave well this all depends on the type of plastic some plastics are more prone to the effect of migration whereby some additives used in plastics are more likely to migrate to foods more than others the main concern in the past has been in connection with plasticisers which are used to improve the flexibility of some packaging materials as the tendency for plasticisers to migrate increases at higher temperatures only those plastics specifically designed for oven use are suitable for cooking to reduce any possible risk one should use only microwave safe utensils while some packaging films may be labelled 'microwave safe' care should be taken to avoid direct contact with the food when using them to cover containers or to reheat dinners on plates as migration is more likely to occur into hot fatty foods glass containers are a suitable choice for heating these products as yet there are no standards for claims such as microwave safe if you are in doubt as to the safety of such materials contact the manufacturer or use a ceramic glass alternative following are some links that may be of interest Transistor Mobile phone radiation and health Nuclear power Vacuum tube Diode Plastic Ultraviolet Solar cell Solar power Kitchen Cookware and bakeware Gas metal arc welding Radioisotope thermoelectric generator Cancer Explosive material Aluminium Transformer Glass Chernobyl accident Corrosion Electromagnetic spectrum Sewage treatment Spark plug Uranium Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Integrated circuit Fire fighting Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Incandescent light bulb Radio Solar power satellite Asbestos Gramophone record Optical fiber Soldering Electromagnetic radiation Amateur radio Floppy disk Battery (electricity) Ceramics Casting Prostate cancer Wi-Fi Tank Nuclear reactor Polyvinyl chloride Space elevator Loudspeaker Heat Food Microwave Hamster Light-emitting diode Burglar alarm Tire Stomach cancer Folic acid Universal Serial Bus Laser Coaxial cable Energy development Psoriasis Radiation hardening Thimerosal Menstrual cup Slow cooker Thermal power station Electric motor Powder metallurgy Nuclear fallout Stove Milk E85 Plutonium Glossary of firefighting terms Portland cement Printed circuit board Omega-3 fatty acid Residual-current device Furnace Motor oil Oscilloscope Organic food Directed-energy weapon Wind turbine M16 (rifle) Superconductivity
