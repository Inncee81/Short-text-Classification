using a one in front of a phone number occasionally i get a phone message that says this number does not require a one before dialing and sometimes i get a message you must dial a one before dialing this number if the phone system is smart why doesn't it either drop or add the one and complete the phone call it really seems like bad programming user interface if it's just a matter of long distance versus local calling i think the phone company should just ask do you want to continue rather than making you hang up and redial the number anyone from a phone company wish to comment some of those switches on the wire line side are very old eventually this problem will go away as they are retired give it another years Telephone exchange Telephone numbering plan Voice over IP Phreaking North American Numbering Plan 9-1-1 UK telephone numbering plan Private branch exchange Modem Telephone Predictive dialer GSM services Vertical service code Integrated Services Digital Network Telegraphy Skype Musical Instrument Digital Interface Rotary dial Emergency telephone number Dual-tone multi-frequency Mobile phone Telephone number Bulletin board system Telephone tapping Phone fraud X.25 NorthwesTel Caller ID Telephone switchboard Nonblocking minimal spanning switch Crossbar switch Telephone call Argentine telephone numbering plan Bluetooth Dial tone Short message service Mach kernel Morse Code IP Multimedia Subsystem Embedded system Gmail Instant messaging Digital Subscriber Line Blue box Multimedia Messaging System FidoNet BlackBerry Public Switched Telephone Network Pretty Good Privacy MTR Code division multiple access Toll-free telephone number L4 microkernel family ISDN User Part Cellular network Hayes command set Autovon Eircom AppleScript Computer Symbian OS Long distance Global System for Mobile Communications Directory assistance Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Overhead lines Nordic Mobile Telephone Radio Windows 2000 HomePNA Surveillance Call for help Burglar alarm Game programmer Thread (computer science) System/36 Television Mac OS X Session Initiation Protocol Windows XP Btrieve Area code 905 Internet fraud Beatmania IIDX Broadband Internet access IS-95 1-1-1 Spam (electronic) Payphone Universal Serial Bus Associative array Universal Mobile Telecommunications System High-Speed Circuit-Switched Data Something Awful VHF omnidirectional range Stargate (device) Dialer Data retention Programming language
