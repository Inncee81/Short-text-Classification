can someone help me my home phone is not working there's no dialtone it's not the phone's problem not the line connected to the phone either strange because it could connect to the internet not aol but netzero i have internet networks then the whole phone line could not connect to any network completely now my phone is dead any suggestions of what i can do before the technician comes morrow if someone can advise me i might not have the technician come in morrow i have phone and plug it into the phone line and it didn't work i have new lines connected to the jack and it didn't work either if your internet is dsl then it is possible that the dsl signal will still work even when there is a problem on the voice side of your line however the speed may be slower then normal bring a standard corded phone to the nid outside your home and check for dial tone there if there is dial tone there the trouble is inside if there is no dial tone there the problem is outside when you dial your number is it busy or goes straight to voicemail or is it just ringing and ringing if it is ringing and ringing check for a broken wire or make sure the line cords are connected securly to the jacks and phones if it is busy first i would unplug all fax modem sattelite boxes phones from the jacks and dial into your number if still busy there is a short in your wiring or a jack if ringing now and not busy plug one device in at a time and test inbetween untill you find out what device or phone is defective if it is still busy when you call i with all devices disconnected from the phone jacks but you had dial tone at the nid check the pins of the jack for water damage this would appear as greenish color or damaged pins if you can not find any jacks that look defctive then go back to the nid and remove wire going towards your house at a time and dial into your number untill it rings thru once you have isolated the inside wire that is defective there should only be only a few hopefully only one jack that does not have dial tone on it remove that jacks cover and disconnect the wires to the jack go back to the nid and reconnect the wire to the nid and call into your number again if it rings then replace the jack if it is busy replace the blue white blue wires or green red wires with the orange white orange wires or yellow black wires at the nid and call into the number again if it rings then switch the wires at the jack if still busy this wire needs to be replaced Phreaking Digital Subscriber Line Private branch exchange Voice over IP Jack plug Integrated Services Digital Network Domestic AC power plugs and sockets GSM services Universal Serial Bus Telephone Ethernet Telephone switchboard Vertical service code Bluetooth TIA-568A/B Telephone numbering plan Dual-tone multi-frequency Enigma machine BS 1363 Oscilloscope Computer bus Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis 9-1-1 Telephone number UK telephone numbering plan Mobile phone Atari 8-bit family Residual-current device Telephone tapping Telegraphy Blue box HomePNA IPod Broadband Internet access RS-232 Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line Phone fraud Electric motor Fuse (electrical) Poker jargon Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Power line communication Transformer TGV Overhead lines D-subminiature USB flash drive Color Stargate (device) Cable television Dialer 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines SCART Color blindness ITU-T The Shining (film) Rail terminology Emergency telephone number Electrical wiring (UK) Skype Super Nintendo Entertainment System Floppy disk Sega Dreamcast RCA connector Commodore 64 Internet fraud Asynchronous Transfer Mode Electricity meter Secure Digital card Hayes command set Public Switched Telephone Network Serial communications Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Mach kernel Password Morse Code Switch IP Multimedia Subsystem Rotary dial Circuit design Predictive dialer Crossbar switch Spark plug Call centre Wi-Fi 25-pair color code Fire alarm control panel Caller ID Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Railway signal Dial tone
