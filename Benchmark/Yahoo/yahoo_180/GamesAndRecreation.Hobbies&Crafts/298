has anyone ever made a photo quilt or a photo pillow i'm looking for instructions on how to make a photo quilt or a photo pillow the photo pillow uses quilt squares per side do you know of a website where i can get step by step instructions on how to make one there are two issues here how to get the photos onto the fabric and what pattern to use the pattern part is easy you can use any pattern with a space large enough for your photo you can use blocks patterns that have large center spaces or you can simply add sashing strips to the photos and assemble them however you like the first link below is to a website with over free quilt block patterns the second is to a bunch of photos of photo quilts you can use for inspiration as for putting the photos on fabric there are a few alternatives i would avoid the iron on transfer paper that you can get at most office stores the photo doesn't last either it fades or it peels it's fine for making a t shirt but i wouldn't use it in a quilt you can buy paper backed fabric that is made to go through your inkjet printer at many craft and fabric stores there are several different brands so be sure to read the instructions and choose what will work best for you some cannot be washed some need to be heat set before washing also check what kind of printer you have the kind of ink will affect how well it works on the fabric a word of warning these fabric sheets are not cheap you get three or four sheets for upwards of if you're going to use more than that i'd recommend making your own sheets using bubble jet set and bubble jet rinse to prepare the fabric iron a piece of freezer paper to the back of the fabric so it will go through your printer Mattress Upholstery Computer printer Casting Textile manufacturing terminology Inkjet printer Quilt Textile manufacturing Symmetry CPU cache Knitting RISC Compiler optimization Oscilloscope Quilting Printed circuit board Applique Printmaking Japanese tea ceremony Typewriter Redundant array of independent disks Plastic Brewery Clothing Menstrual cup Medical prescription PDP-8 Konica Minolta Photocopying System/36 Dot matrix printer Tire ZX Spectrum Dairy Yohoho!
