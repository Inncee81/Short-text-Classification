how do you create a d cartoon i want to figure out how to make a d model of a cartoon and then be able to paint it but the problem is i don't know what materials or tools i need to make it i've been seeing them just this white material it' smade out of but i don't know what it is if you're thinking of a simple d cartoon type figure you can use various types of clays for making those among other things the traditional animation type of figure or object is made with plastalina or a similar clay which is already pre colored that type of clay never dries but stays flexible forever so it can be moved repeatedly for animation shots it's a higher quality of the type of heavy colored clay that kids have used for generations if you're wanting to just make a non flexible cartoon type figure though that will get hard you can use a polymer clay or an air dry clay you can usually do a lot more with polymer clays than most air dry clays but they do need to be baked in a home oven at a low temp for about minutes or so air dry clays will dry instead of curing and that would usually take about a day and the item would shrink somewhat if you want to look into polymer clays i'd suggest starting with a brand like premo which is a strong clay after baking even in thin areas but is still relatively soft when it's unbaked other strong brands would be fimoclassic kato and cernit the sculpeys would be weaker fimosoft would be in between in strength various brands should be available at craft stores art supply stores and online with polymer clays generally the color is built in by using pre colored clays which can be mixed together to create most any color but white or any color polymer clays can also be painted over with a couple of coats of acrylic paint or you can color the clay itself by mixing artists oil paints they come in little tubes or alcohol inks among other things into it the baked clay painted or not can also be given a gloss shine with various acrylic sealers you may have seen the white colored sculpey that comes in a lb box rather than the small packages of white you can use that stuff in the box but just be aware that it's the most easily breakable of the brands types of polymer clay if you want much more info about polymer clays how to use them what all they can do which is a lot more than making little sculpts lessons and links to photo examples check out at least these pages at my online polymer clay encyclopedia http glassattic com polymer kids beginners htm click on sculpting http glassattic com polymer sculpture htm click on whimsical in the websites section for all the other pages at the site look here http glassattic com polymer contents htm hth diane b Casting Paint Plastic Pottery Drawing Gesso Traditional animation Sculpture Epoxy Light-emitting diode Leather Wood Lacquer Polystyrene Knife XML Cookware and bakeware Transformer Chocolate Solar cell Building material HTML element Polymer Genericized trademark Thermal power station Flour Tofu Glossary of sculpting terms Macromedia Flash Drill bit Mattress Polyethylene terephthalate Strap-on dildo Circuit design Portland cement Objective-C Cascading Style Sheets Hamster Radio controlled airplane Carburetor Hydroponics Polymerization Ajax (programming) Computer Gramophone record Miniature (illuminated manuscript) Model aircraft Illegal drug trade Typewriter Titanium Textile manufacturing terminology Bass guitar Irish dance Ceramics Solar power Yu-Gi-Oh!
