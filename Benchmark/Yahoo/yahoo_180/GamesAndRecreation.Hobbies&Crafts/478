tips on sewing stretch interlock fabric i've never sewn stretchy material before and i did a practice dress with extra material my problem was that there was no stretch on the places that i made hems and sewed pieces together when i put the dress on the seams broke because the fabric needed to stretch in some areas and it couldn't do i need stretchy thread how do i fix this problem i have a sewing machine that i am using its a year old could that be the problem am i using the right setting i have like settings sorry for all the questions in one thanks for any advice you can give me or sites that have tips on them i sew my daughter's competition ice skating outfits and while i am not an expert by any means i have a lived with stretch material for years now first one problem that you may have is that you have only two way stretch material take you material in hand and pull and then turn it and see if it pulls just as much on the other side the opposite side but the what's the word ahhhh adjacent side anyway some fabric will stretch almost equally on all four sides and some wont if they aren't then have two way if you do have two way you can still make this into a dress you just need to look at which way you want your stretch to go for instance you don't need your stretch to go from your shoulders to your knees you need it to around your body so just take in cutting your pattern unless it is a pattern fabric and that might pose some problems next when you do sew it you don't need stretchy thread you can get by with a regular not serger machine and just use a zig zag stitch this stitch allows for the stretch and will stop most of the breaking but sew it one way then flip it and sew it the other way to finish the seam this will make it more comfortable to wear and stronger as well some of the other answer mentioned a serger and oh my goodness yes i serger will make your life so much easier but if you don't have a serger it really is still possible to work with stretchy fabrics if you have a ball point or a stretch needle in and there is a special rolling foot that makes it much more sane also you get less problems with grabbing if you use that roller foot best of luck to you Sewing machine Textile manufacturing terminology Mattress Textile manufacturing Upholstery Sewing Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling holds Skateboarding trick Drill bit Kimono Bookbinding Softball Carpet Stocking Glossary of climbing terms Knife Swingout Kilt Fast bowling Professional wrestling throws Figure skating Rail terminology Applique Strap-on dildo Backstroke Earring Shoe Volleyball Fencing Shaggy dog story Floppy disk Screw Breaststroke Glossary of ballet terms Swimsuit RuneScape quests Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Punt (boat) Wound Cross-stitch Crochet Leather Equine conformation Diving suit Billiards Diving Embroidery Rugby union Climbing equipment Rope Golf Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Glossary of partner dance terms Skirt and dress Comanche Kayak Weaving Kasparov versus The World Glossary of American football Condom Suture Suplex Metalworking Canoe Shroud of Turin Craps Casting Woodworking Fan (implement) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Violin Lace-making Fecal incontinence Tatting Anchor Corset Wire Double bass Roller hockey Front crawl Baroque chess Chess strategy and tactics Fabrication (metal) Pottery Sari Aikido Mouse (computing) Yarn Glossary of nautical terms CPU design Professional wrestling aerial techniques Lindy Basic
