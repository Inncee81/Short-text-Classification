does my cat have fleas i've noticed bugs on my cat's neck probably other places as well but that was the only place i saw since it's hard to get her to sit still in the past few days but she doesn't seem to be too bothered by them she's an indoor cat but we have outdoor cats as well which also don't seem to be bothered ths bugs are black and not too big but much different than pictures i've seen of fleas and larger so should i be worried if they aren't fleas then what am i supposed to do if they aren't fleas what else could they be just some random bug that has decided to nest in my cat's fur if so what can i do it's just strange because they aren't itching at all or anything not even showing signs of anything bugging them it does sound like fleas yuck you should act quickly if your cat comes indoors my neighbors house has fleas i found out because their son has red spots all over his legs we asked him why and he said fleas in his bed they multiply fast i read that over of fleas live in the house and only live on the pet sorry not to make you nervous Flea Cat Dog training John Frusciante Domestic rabbit Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Missingno.
