changed cat's feeding schedule strictly indoor cat my cat was eating cup x a day she asked for more so i asked the vet and he said a cup a day was fine so i started feeding her cup x a day occasionaly i go out of town for few days i haven't since i've had her my mom will come over twice a day to feed her but not x so i started feeding her a cup twice a day at noon and midnight she eats all of her food within hours she has not begged for more is it ok for her to eat like this all of the other cat's i've ever had ate their food slowly over the course of a day when she was being fed three and four times a day she would eat all of her food at once she's been to the vet recently and she is healthy she appears to be happy also once in a great while she will produce a stool that is tinged with blood the vet says it should resolve the next day and it always does will her feeding changes affect her getting a blood tinged stool she's had several negative fecals and the blood is always gone the next day she eats dry food only it makes sense what one person said about wet cat food i am a little worried that introducing something new might give her a diarhea cats need canned food as well as dry food each day can food supplies the oils and vitamins that they need in their daily diet for healthy skin hair nails and bones it's best to feed canned food in the morning and have dry food available throughout the day with fresh water sounds very much to me that she is not satisfied with what you are giving her something is missing in her diet and her body is sending her that message serving dry food only is rough on the digestion system and this could be the cause of the blood in the stool good luck Guinea pig Stomach cancer Nutrition Cat Domestic rabbit Urinary incontinence Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Dairy Dietary fiber Anemia Vitamin C Hamster Fancy rat Coeliac disease Ferret Pet skunk Raw food diet Vitamin D Dieting Veganism Botulism Feces Ramen Tlingit Vegetarianism Prostate cancer Peanut Folic acid Atkins Nutritional Approach Vitamin Taboo food and drink Omega-3 fatty acid Protein-energy malnutrition Vermicompost Hypoglycemia Domesticated turkey Vomiting Garlic Diarrhea Healthy eating Sea-Monkey Escherichia coli O157:H7 Entamoeba histolytica Garfield Albatross Acne Food Irritable bowel syndrome Fasting Domestic goat Fugu Dehydration Livestock Tasmanian Devil Colorectal cancer Foie gras Paget's disease of bone Cat food Radiation therapy Vegetarian nutrition Adjustable gastric band Chili con carne Carbon dioxide Binge eating disorder Gastroparesis Chronic fatigue syndrome Shaggy dog story Coffee Chinchilla Crohn's disease Terri Schiavo Sauerkraut Coprophagia Apple Bread Bat Certified Nursing Assistant Seabird Jewish cuisine
