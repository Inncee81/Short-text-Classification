why'd my friends cat bite me he was sitting on my lap purring and the second i glanced down at him he kind of jumped up and put his paws on my chest and started rubbing his head face against my face it made me uncomfortable but i was like whatever so i started rubbing the cat on its' back and it continued to purr then it suddenly turned its' head really fast and put its' teeth around my hand he didn't clamp down but still i put him on the floor after that he jumped back on the couch five minutes later tried to nuzzle me in the face again but i ignored him so he left the room and got in the window sill that means the kitty wanted more attention don't be afraid soon enough the kitty will get tired and walk away but kittys bite to get and keep your attention well not really bite kinda stick their teeth into your skin or their claws and sometimes they meow really loud just to get your attention so that's all it is never neglect the kitty because you never reallyy know how sensitive they really are some may feel reall neglected rejected til' where they will go into hiding for hours and some will just go to their spot and lay there wont really move Cat Aerial (dance move) Shaggy dog story Milton H.
