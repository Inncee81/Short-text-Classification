help cat waking us up early in the morning our cat faith is years old she's always been a bit high maintenance and somewhat difficult to deal with but she's a good cat overall every once in a while she will wake my husband and i up early in the morning between am and am which is annoying but it usually only happens about once or twice a month the cats do not sleep in our room so our door is closed but for the last week she has been waking us up every morning am this morning she woke us up at am it is getting hard to deal with because we aren't getting all of our sleep we have tried squirting her w a water bottle but she runs away and comes back scratches the door and cries again and we've locked her in the bathroom but she still wails and i feel bad and she does it again the next night not sure what to do any suggestions remember cats are originally nocturnal animals meaning they can become more active during the night rather than during the day play with her before bedtime at least a good minutes if not more this way she will tire out and hopefully not want to come and wake you is there a specific reason she is waking you is her food bowl filled water bowl as well if there's no apparent reason then there are ways to deter this behavior try plugging in the vacuum cleaner and placing it near the door when she comes to wake you turn it on when she comes back turn it on again do this each time she comes to wake you up eventually she will understand that if she wakes you at that time that loud awful noise will start up never confine a cat because it is waking you up it is looking for attention and confining it is making it confused and possibly even depressed you will not teach it anything by confining it nor by hitting it if boredom is an issue playtime before bed and getting her an interactive toy to play with while you are asleep might help you also Sleep Cat Housebreaking Dream The Shining (film) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Sin City Shaggy dog story Mattress Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Avenue Q Social rule Toilet humour Friends Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Hikikomori Knots Landing Garfield Lucid dreaming Narcolepsy Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Ron and Fez Ferret Columbine High School massacre Oh My Goddess!
