my cat im scared i put my cat outside and its an indoor cat and its like to years old ad its scared i put water and food out for him but im scared he wont eat it and just die will he be ok and idc if it was right or not for me to do it i just dont like how hes a mean cat but i still want to keep him will he stay by my house and let us feed him a nd shit or will he wonder away either way i dont care i just dont want him to die he wont get hurt unless he gets run over cuz hes really mean nd has claws wat will happen hes under a bush right now i jsut put him out here its his first time ever outdoors why did you put him outside he's probably terrified imagine if someone took you out of your house and put you out in the forest or the desert if you put him outside because he's a mean cat can't you just let him live in the house and not do whatever makes him mean even if that means you just ignore him i have a cat who is unapproachable and unpettable essentially she's a feral cat who lives in the house she bites and scratches but i wouldn't put her outside to try to survive no he won't be all right he'll cower there under that bush till some predator attracted by the food you put outside for him kills him there are doubtless some homeless cats that are already in your area they will find him in their territory and fight him till he runs away probably injured probably infected with the diseases unowned uncared for cats carry he won't be able to find food elsewhere and he doesn't know how to hunt he'll starve if he isn't killed first by dogs or foxes or coyotes or run over or shot by someone who hates cats or dies of disease you owned him for four or five years you owe it to him to take him to an animal shelter he probably won't be adopted no one wants a mean adult cat but he will get vet care and food and a safe place to sleep and ultimately a quick painless death i don't understand why you put the cat outside and are now so concerned about him did your parents throw him out Cat Dog Ferret Feral cat Kakapo Pet skunk Hunting Brown Bear Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Guinea pig Domestic rabbit Gray Wolf American Black Bear Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Socialization Lion Garfield Jon Secada Animal euthanasia Hamster Singlish RuneScape quests The Critic Pitaten Jam (TV series) American Alligator Theory of conduct The Marshall Mathers LP YuYu Hakusho Organic farming Livestock Feral Treecat Humphrey Bogart Tick Ranma __ characters EastEnders Tasmanian Devil Puma Characters of Lost Sin City The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Kodocha Fox hunting Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Pok__mon Live!
