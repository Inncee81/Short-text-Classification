should i put my cat down for many reasons my cat is now years old she was my second pet since i have been married she gets a long really well with my black lab we've had the lab longer but she absolutely hates my pomeranian years old and my other cat one year old see i also have children and they are all really good with the animals but my adult cat hides all the time and only wants attention from me here's the problem my older cat who's started to pee throughout the house she is fixed and has never done this before but i can't get her too stop now she is scared of my husband who yells at her a lot when she has peed on his hockey gear she is always hiding in the bathroom behind our toilet seat i have heard that no ones going to want a cat that pees in the house and once they start they don't stop i have been told to put her down by a family member can someone help i have had her advertised for a while and no luck have you thought of having her checked over by a vet very commonly what owners think is a behavior problem is actually a physical problem the cat may have a urinary infection and any amount of punishing her is not going to cure that the fact that this behavior has started recently suggests something has changed and it might be that she has gotten an infection cats do not urinate in inappropriate places to be bad or to make their owners angry or to express some emotion that is a case of human beings projecting their ow n feelings and how they act onto animals who don't think the same way and why would a cat want to do something that gets her punished and terrorized if she doesn't have a urinary infection and since it sounds like her relationship with your family has soured i suggest you take her to an animal shelter she may do fine in a home without other cats or dogs or children or some combination i adopted a cat who was brought to the animal hospital where i work by her owner who wanted her put to sleep because she urinated on the floor it turned out that the woman had recently remarried and there were now three lively boys and two dogs in the family and the cat was terrified i took her home and she has been immaculate about her litter box use from the first day in my house an ethical vet will not euthanize a healthy cat or one whose problem can be treated Urinary incontinence Cat Dog Guinea pig Hamster Rabies Domestic rabbit Infantilism Pet skunk Prostate cancer Garfield Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Animal euthanasia Domestic violence Ferret Tobacco smoking Shaggy dog story Ranma __ characters Theory of conduct Friends Toilet humour Toilet The Fairly OddParents Urination Sin City Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Socialization Divorce Urine Avenue Q Animal shelter YuYu Hakusho Herpes simplex virus The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Characters of Lost EastEnders Oh My Goddess!
