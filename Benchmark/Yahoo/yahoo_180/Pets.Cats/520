how do you toilet train a kitten i've picked up a stray kitten last night i heard her mewing and she basically followed me because it was late at night and she was so small i figured she'd probably been abandoned she won't even eat solid food yet only milk plus she looked scared and was basically begging passer bys with continuous mewing so i took her in the only problem is it's been about hours now and i don't know where she goes yet i'm sure she must have left a gift or two somewhere by now i wasn't prepared for this so right now i've filled a shoebox with potting soil i'm going to go get some real litter in a couple of hours anyway i've shown her the shoebox but it hasn't been used yet and i don't think she gets it so what's the quickest way to get a kitten to understand the concept of litter box first thank you for caring get some gerber stage chicken baby food and the kitten milk kmr also dry kitten food which you can soak and a little canned food which she can have a teaspoon of times a day also a bag of regular litter not clumping don't use pellets because if you end up finding her another home she may not use regular litter mix baby food with a little kmr and she'll eat remember she's stressed and she's just a baby you can try gently rubbing her hieny with a warm wet piece of cotton and see if that helps make sure she can get into litter box okay here's a great trick put her in litter box gently take one of her little front paws and dig with it just a few times it triggers instinct then leave her alone let her leave the box herself and watch her to make sure you don't miss her first pee then and this is important watch her carefully and when she is nosing around like she needs potty put her in the box and leave her if she doesn't go right away you can do the gentle dig again once make sure she uses the box and you shouldn't have a problem again it's just that first time another good idea is to put a little litterbox in every room so that her tiny bladder always gets relieved in a box it's only temporary and it's better to make it easy for the kitten to do what you want if she starts soiling elsewhere she will do it again this routine has never failed me best of luck Cat Urinary incontinence Hamster Fecal incontinence Kitten Toilet humour Guinea pig Ron and Fez Pet skunk Shaggy dog story Dog Phoebe Buffay's songs Tea Plastic Fancy rat Housebreaking Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Theory of conduct Chicken Kodocha Comanche The Inside Menstrual cup Idli Genericized trademark Kitchen Social rule Humphrey Bogart Dairy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Kosher foods Customs and etiquette of Japan Japanese tea ceremony Cannabis cultivation Diaper RuneScape quests Sharon Tate Characters in the Smurfs American Black Bear EastEnders Tofu Halitosis Mattress Tlingit The Amazing Race Carnivorous plant The Ashlee Simpson Show Capercaillie Chocolate Casting Aerial (dance move) Piccolo Junior Saga Elephant Childbirth The Star Wars Holiday Special Ben Johnson (athlete) Hydroponics Vampire Little Britain Joy Division (band) Pottery Magic (illusion) The Marshall Mathers LP Johnny 5 Night (book) Jon Secada Oscilloscope Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Coconut crab Escape from New York Cuisine of the Philippines Joke Japanese cuisine Toilet Spidey Super Stories Oplan Bojinka The Shining (film) Continuation War Cheese Yoko Ono First aid Iditarod Salad Fingers Blood (computer game) Kashrut Pittsburgh Steelers Time Out of Mind Sea-Monkey Escherichia coli O157:H7
