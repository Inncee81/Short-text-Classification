vets cat owners please help i need to know asap until i can get to my vet i noticed last nite my cat sneeze on the odd occasion then i woke up to him having a sneezing attack in the middle of the nite when i got back today he is having several sneezes together again my husband and i have had a bad flu is it possible to pass it to the cat his personality is the same he seems happy is still playing eating etc and i will be taking him to the vet monday morning anyway to make sure but until then i need peace of mind someone told me they can die from the cat flu is this true what do you all think the vet will do thanks alot for all of your answers p s he has no eye discharge thanks for all the answers so far a cat cannot catch a cold or flu from humans just to put your mind at ease it could however be anything from allergies to the beginning of an upper respiratory infection does he have any discharge coming out of his nose or eyes if so what color is it if there is not discharge or it's clear the problem is most likely allergies now a green mucousy discharge can be a sign of an infection unfortunately you can't get a proper diagnosis without the cat being examined if the vet feels it's just allergies they'll send him home on an antihistamine for an upper respiratory infection he may just be sent home on antibiotics if it's not too serious as for a serious upper respiratory infection he may have to be hospitalized since you say he's acting normal and still eating and drinking it's most likely allergies if he does become lethargic or stops eating try to get him to a vet sooner Common cold Fancy rat Cat Upper respiratory tract infection Allergy Guinea pig Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Asthma Sneeze Hay fever H5N1 Domestic rabbit Tuberculosis Oh My Goddess!
