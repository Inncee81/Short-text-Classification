any tips for raising kittens without the help of a mama cat we have them in a nice little hutch and they have plenty of room to roam around we got them a couple of baby bottles just their size and some formula i need some help though because i heard you have to stimulate them to go potty uh help i also have kittens with out a mother that i am fostering fortunately i have help from the spca here's some tips first the little hutch sounds nice and warm they will enjoy that the kittens will also need space to run and play but it sounds like you have that handled too if your kittens are weeks or under you will need to feed them from a bottle here's what you do if the formula is powder then fill the bottle half way full with that and the rest water if it is a liquid formula then i can't help you also when they are weeks old you will want to have a bowl of watered down canned kitten food out depending on the kitten they will need feed times a day but that also depends on how much they eat at a time if you just got your kittens then the first two days you have them they may not poop because of the change of food here's where you come in it may sound a little bit gross but a mother cat will lick the kittens bottom and eat it's poop so you need to take a warm rag and softly in circular motions wipe its bottom but don't eat it if the kitten still hasn't pooped in three days of having them you will need to take them in to the vet and have them flushed out i also recommend that you don't try to make the kittens environment quiet they need to get used to noise other than that they need lots and lots of love care and attention good luck Cat Kitten Toilet humour Japanese tea ceremony Pet skunk Guinea pig Little Britain Hamster Socialization Brewery Tea Bong Garfield Ron and Fez Mattress Feral cat Thermal power station Dairy Phoebe Buffay's songs Rocko's Modern Life Atomic Kitten Internet phenomenon Ferret Chinese New Year RuneScape quests Social rule Japanese toilet Glossary of nautical terms Trailer Park Boys Chicken Pitaten Puma Joke StarCraft: Hybrid Coffee Sea-Monkey Chocolate Sampling (music) Chopsticks Internal ballistics The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Fancy rat Kakapo Caffeine Water Soap bubble Poker jargon Elephant Ship naming and launching Situation comedy Idli Fecal incontinence Urinary incontinence Roxette Big Brother UK series 5 Alma Cogan Hiking Microeconomics The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland Champagne (beverage) Giant Panda Azumanga Daioh Hearing aid Sewage treatment Nestl__ Infant formula Spider Livestock Breakfast Purr Cats (musical) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Houseplant The Jazz Singer Equine conformation Rabbit Textile manufacturing Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Big Brother UK series 6 Shrimp farm The McGuire Sisters Great Teacher Onizuka Mid-levels Bonus Stage Kitchen Rose (Doctor Who) Maine Coon Kimi Finster Infant Customs and etiquette of Japan The Beatles bootlegs Violin Insomnia Brown Bear Girly
