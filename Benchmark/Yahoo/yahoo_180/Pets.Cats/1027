is there a limit to how often cats and kittens can get baths is it possible to bathe cats too often is weeks apart too much i have a four month old kitten that always wants to get in the bath with me how often can i shampoo him you shouldn't bathe them too often cats generally do a pretty good job of keeping themselves clean i bathe mine few times a year if you wash all the oils off you can dry out their skin and make the hair more brittle but there's a difference between bathing and swimming swimming doesn't involve the scrubbing and rinsing so if your kitten likes to swim i guess you can let him occasionally but don't let the soap water get in his eyes or ears Sento Shampoo Soap Cat Psoriasis Social rule Kitten Otitis externa Diving Car washing techniques Manicure Dandruff Swimsuit Body piercing Hard water Wok Atomic Kitten Japanese toilet Turkish Van Menstrual cup Customs and etiquette of Japan Eczema Ranma __ characters Hand washing Bathing Sauna Textile manufacturing Manx (cat) Swimming pool Fruits Basket Phoebe Buffay's songs Cleanser Fecal incontinence Minor Harry Potter Beasts Swimming Washing machine Acne Leather Lynx Pitaten Urticaria Garfield Through the Looking-Glass Baptism Cats (musical) Dry cleaning Socialization Tokyo Mew Mew Thermoregulation Friends Dishwashing Dishwasher Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Turkish Angora Washroom Ferret Hydrotherapy Little Britain Catarrh RuneScape quests Feral cat Cast iron Niddah Skin Azumanga Daioh Tenchi Muyo!
