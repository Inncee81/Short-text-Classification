regarding the issue of declawing a kitten cat train the kitten not to scratch furniture or other unwanted objects by directing it to a scratching post with catnip spraying it with a water bottle etc but what about when you are not home and the kitten is scratching the furniture how do you redirect the behavior then i do not like it but i will probably get my kitten declawed because i cannot guarantee my fianc that our new kitten will not scratch the furnative the argument against that it takes away their nature defenses against predators is void b c my kitten is an indoor one and will not go outside this is an invitation for suggestions opinions on the subject the decision to declaw has not been made lightly but rather through a lot of research i would like to have some feedback from both sides cat owners who have declawed cats how is their behavior did it change after the surgery do you regret getting it done those who refuse to declaw how do you keep your cat from scratching unwanted objects are you at home all the time what do you do when you are away at work i'll try to play the devil's advocate here in my apartment we have a year old declawed cat and my new almost month old kitten i have toyed around with the idea of declawing but my hesitation has nothing to do with it taking away their natural defenses like your cat mine will be strictly indoors i have asked my roommate about her cats declawing experience and she said she didn't seem traumatized by it much that it was only days before she could switch back to using regular litter she used paper shreddings in the interim so that the litter didn't clump in her scabs really in the area where the surgery takes place she did say with a family cat they ended up getting the back feet declawed as well and there was a definite difference in the behavior of the cat afterwards almost a sort of depression and a complete in the way the cat behaved or acted so it was sort of traumatized by it i have also researched alternatives i wouldn't want to spend the constant money on the soft paw caps it just seems like a waste and we've tried that on family cats before and they never last as long as they claim our cats would bite chew whatever to get them off however i clip my kittens claws on a regular basis those things are never more than nubs and as a result he's never really been able to start clawing my furniture in fact he can barely jump up on it because he has no claws to grip into the fabric he usually just slides down or falls now if a cat is scratching religiously in one area i've been told that taping aluminum foil while ugly and annoying on the area for a period of weeks will stop the cat from scratching there they hate the feel of it think putting an old e battery on your tongue sort of feeling my roommate absolutely didn't regret doing the surgery but here's the thing i have two separate friends who both work in two different vet clinics one of the clinics has completely refused to continue declawing the other one will only agree to do it once consulting with the owner and offering plenty of other alternatives the vet there does it but he's stated repeatedly how much he wishes he could make the owners watch the declawing being done or watch a declawing being done first before making the decision the literally cut the entire first joint of the digit off of the toe while not all declaws result in complications a large majority of them suffer from excessive bleeding or complications with the claw continuing to grow despite the joint being removed and then when it does grow it grows in all deformed can grow back into the foot etc and require additional corrective surgeries to fix it but if it is seriously something you desire i would definitely get it done sooner than later much like surgery on children vs adults less pyschological impact if they're babies when it takes place just be prepared here is an article specifically asking
