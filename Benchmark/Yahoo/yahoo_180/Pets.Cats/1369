i'm thinking about adding another male cat to my house and i need advice i already have one female spayed and one male my male has not been neutered yet and neither has this new kitty the new one is a full grown cat as well my male has not started spraying yet and he's about months old so i don't think that he's going to spray if he hasn't started doing it already my thing is that with all of the hormones i'm not sure how these new kitties will take to each other also i'm wanting to know if anyone thinks that he will start to spray if i bring in another male maybe they will both spray i don't know these boys are brothers but have been separated since weeks any ideas or thoughts would be great thanks so should i get this other kitty or not and if not then why first of all my cats never ever go outside i had already planned to have him fixed but i haven't had the money to do it just yet my female has been fixed since i got her so no worries of kittens around here i know that my male isn't spraying because he's indoor only and i have searched this entire house with a black light to make sure i know that the two males will not remember each other but it would be nice for him to have a friend this other male is the sweetest cat i have ever seen in my life that's why i want to get him i just want to know what the chances are that they will not spray if i get both of them fixed before i move the new one in with unaltered males in the house you can pretty much bet they will both start spraying even if your female is spayed they will not recognize each other as brothers cats don't have that kind of conceptual memory they will simply see another male and instinctively mark their territory if you get them both neutered then you shouldn't have a problem Cat Kitten Pet skunk Feral cat Ferret Theory of conduct Poker jargon Friends Domestic rabbit Dog Shaggy dog story Housebreaking Socialization The nature of God in Western theology Nine Inch Nails Castration Debugging Milton H.
