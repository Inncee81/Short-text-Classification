i would never declaw my kitten please read this and help i really hate declawing but she scratches everything but the scratching board even if its the basket she scratches the bottom of and i put the board on the bottom by board i mean in is a store bought scratching toy but its not a post i'm getting her a post soon but it might not make a difference the reason i'm not getting her soft paws is because she likes to jump on my shoulder and she wouldn't be able to hold on very well and she likes to dig her claws into my should when my grandma's dog is around it makes her feel safe it also hurts like heck so opinions get her soft paws or not and if you think i should do you think eventually i won't need to buy them and also do the even have smaller soft paws for kittens thanks very much for the squirt gun suggestions i'll probably try that first if you are for declawing cats please dont answer also do you have any experience with purchasing soft paws and how does it effect your cat also if i do get soft paws do they work for front and back paws my cats could still climb with soft paws i believe they come in sizes i bought the soft paws online just look up softpaws or soft claws and a whole bunch of sites will show up after i put them on my cats they tried chewing them off for a couple of minutes but then after about minutes they had already forgotten about them and were climbing on shelfs and windows again they will fall off naturally when their claws shed and then you just trim the nail back down and glue another one on in its place you can also get them at the vet and have the vet put them on for you i use them on both of my cats and they work great they may still try to claw sometimes but they cant puncture anything make sure you use enough of the glue that comes with the soft paws they are inexpensive so they are worth a shot i imagine they wont work for all cats but if it doesn't then you will have only wasted less then i think i bought mine with free shipping for bucks and it had sets in it the instructions only say to put them on the front paws i think if you put them on the back paws then they wont be able to climb even declawed cats get to keep they back claws it is possible that the other lady put the soft paws on right before the claws were ready to shed or she didn't use enough glue you just trim the claws down fill the soft paw up with the glue and slip it over the claw Cat Guinea pig Pet skunk Garfield Ferret Atomic Kitten RuneScape quests Hamster Domestic rabbit Poker jargon Dog Professional wrestling holds Textile manufacturing Equine conformation Dilbert Shaggy dog story Maneki Neko Upholstery B-47 Stratojet Cello Scale model Dog agility Dairy IPod Internal ballistics The Inside Time Out of Mind American Black Bear Friends Radio controlled airplane Mattress Azumanga Daioh Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Aerial (dance move) Killian documents Menstrual cup Rocko's Modern Life Heinkel He 112 Treehouse of Horror II Blonde on Blonde Inspector Gadget Shen Gong Wu Professional wrestling throws Drill bit Wood carving Krypto the Superdog Knots Landing Professional wrestling match types Detroit Tigers American lobster Treecat The Smoking Room Trigun characters Fancy rat The Amber Spyglass Xiaolin Showdown The Apprentice 3 Volleyball Russian joke Little Britain Atari ST Satchel Paige Cheating in poker Warren Buffett George Costanza Seismic retrofit Married... with Children Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Trapping Glossary of nautical terms Codename: Kids Next Door Violin The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Great Sphinx of Giza Woodworking Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Rent (musical) Dog training Gray Wolf Menstrual cycle Piccolo Junior Saga Halo 2 Coconut crab Natural Selection (computer game) InuYasha (character) Handloading Characters of Naruto English English Donkey Kong 64 Sento Care Bears Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Blood (computer game)
