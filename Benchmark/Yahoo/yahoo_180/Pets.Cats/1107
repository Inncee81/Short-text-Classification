my cat was kidnapped and dropped off in another town by my neighbor i recently went to the beach for the week and left my cat at home he is an in outdoor cat so i knew he would be fine i left him plenty of food and water as well as access to his usual shelter when i got back my neighbor announced to me that he took my cat to the vet to have him euthanized but then he decided to give the cat a second chance so he dropped him off in a nearby town i was furious so i asked him why in the world he would do that he said that he thought that the cat had heartworms so he didn't want his dog getting them too i told him to put his dog on heartguard and he wouldn't have to worry about it anyway what should i do is there anything that the spca humane society etc could do about it who do i report it to i want my cat back and i don't want my neighbor from hell to get away with this help i'd actually call your local police dept and try to report him through there and if they don't handle these kinds of issues than ask them who you should report him to if your cat went in his yard than i'm not sure how much you can do but hopefully he'll get in trouble enough to get him to not be such an ass besides the fact that he's a moron and heartworms aren't contracted by other animals they are contracted from mosquito bites if his animal is outdoors and isn't on heartworm preventative than his animal is totally wide open to the potential of getting heartworms even if no other animals are present if you find your cat and hopefully you will i'd just make your cat an indoor cat to keep your jerky neighbor from getting his hands on him if he wants his dog to stay healthy than he needs to do what's right for his dog ie heartworms tests yearly heartworm pills monthly and vaccinations not take out your pets Heartworm Rabies Pet skunk Socialization Shaggy dog story Dog training Ferret Animal shelter Knots Landing Garfield Domestic rabbit EastEnders Theory of conduct Hamster Humphrey Bogart Gray Wolf Social rule Animal euthanasia People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Animal rights RuneScape quests Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Anopheles Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Taboo food and drink Richard Chase Organic farming Kodocha One Tree Hill (TV series) Microchip implant (animal) The Big Goodbye (TNG episode) Trailer Park Boys Tooth enamel H5N1 The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe 2000 Australian Grand Prix Kitten Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Malaria Pitaten Feral Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Housebreaking Livestock Radio Yerevan The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Feral cat colony Sin City Zoophilia Fancy Crane Cancer Phoebe Buffay's songs Rent (musical) Marilyn Monroe Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Fancy rat 2001 UK foot and mouth crisis Tenshinhan Futurama (TV series - season 5) Dilbert The Inside Avenue Q Coprophagia Kakapo Abortion debate Tick Flea The Lovely Bones SMTV Live The Death Gate Cycle DDT The Critic West Nile virus The X-Files (season 1) The Amber Spyglass Goldfish Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Greyhound Ren and Stimpy Feral cat The Invisibles The Subtle Knife Rabbit Whaling Haven (TNG episode) Donald Rumsfeld Elvis Presley Doraemon Ranma __ characters 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Ron Weasley Ultimate (sport)
