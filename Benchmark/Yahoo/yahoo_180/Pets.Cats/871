if a cat has a misscarriage will you see the kittens does miscarriages work the same way in animals as they do humans im not sure if my cat is pregnant or not it seems like the bump in her tummy has moved lower and it doesnt seem to be as big as it was she is still nesting so im just worried i guess if she had a miscarriage i would see dead kittens right yes if she is near the end of the term of her pregnancy days approximately she will deliver kittens if you are not there when it happens and there is a kitten that is not living she may take care of it herself if you are worried about her i'd really recommend that you take her to see a vet caring for a preggy cat and any babies she has until they go to forever homes is a big job and its best to have a pro in your corner definitely ask your vet to be oncall in case she has any problemes with delivery good luck Pregnancy Miscarriage Care Bears Kitten Obstetrics Abortion Cat Atomic Kitten Twin Guinea pig Breastfeeding Premature birth Socialization Feral cat Ferret Abortion debate Intact dilation and extraction Veterinarian Spina bifida Cytomegalovirus Pet skunk Childbirth Abortion in the United States Prenatal care Pitaten Garfield Cuteness Gonorrhoea Caesarean section Stillbirth Midwifery EastEnders Pet store Friends Dog Coeliac disease Phoebe Buffay's songs RuneScape quests Professional wrestling slang Greebo Breech birth Series finale Partial-birth abortion Diethylstilbestrol Big Brother UK series 5 Squirrel Cats (musical) Postpartum depression Teenage pregnancy Feral AFI 100 Years series Domestic rabbit Ectopic pregnancy Kodocha Rabies Tooth enamel The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland Melanie Wilkes Psoriasis Miscarriage of justice 2000 Australian Grand Prix Tokyo Mew Mew Puma Manx (cat) Prolactinoma American and British English differences The Aristocats Marilyn Monroe In vitro fertilisation Hamster Heinkel He 100 Anne Boleyn Thermoregulation Knots Landing Timon and Pumbaa Garfield and Friends Prenatal diagnosis Nepeta Unemployment Catgirl The Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation Treecat Heartbeat (television) Serval Rugrats Toxoplasmosis Hollyoaks Obstetrical hemorrhage Folic acid The Archers Girly Rabbit Social rule Pet StarCraft: Hybrid Sarah Kerrigan Parvovirus B19 Religion and abortion Tocopherol Purr
