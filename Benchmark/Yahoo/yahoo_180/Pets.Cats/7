my cousins cat keeps randomly getting hair ties and putting them into water toilet bowl water dish any help lol the little thief yes your cousin should put her hair ties where they belong in a closed container inside a drawer of course it sounds like she is like the rest of us who pull them out of our hair and set them to the side wherever we happen to be clearly the kitty likes to play and since the kitty clearly adores your cousin her things are sought out plus hair things are small stretchy bouncy and easy to tote about the whole water thing is just way too funny and i'm betting that the reason the stuff stays in the water is because it puts a damper on the fun of the toy so the cat loses interest but the kitty is always willing to try again to see if there is a new result or put the great toy in a safe place because clearly since there is no way that the kitty wants to dive in and fish out the hair tie then obviously no one else will want to either for the cost of hairties i think your cousin can probably handle this for the few months or year that this will continue and she'll probably talk about it fondly or at least you will for years to come because it it legitimately funny Poker jargon Hamster Care Bears Cat Garfield Kender Japanese toilet Modem Professional wrestling match types Swimming pool Kimi Finster Shaggy dog story Something Positive Late Night with Conan O'Brien Squidward Tentacles Weebl and Bob Ron and Fez Japanese tea ceremony EastEnders Trailer Park Boys Ranma __ characters Eric Cartman Cruising (maritime) English cricket team Bat Wheel of Fortune Social rule Textile manufacturing Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Fruits Basket Fast bowling Craps Badly Drawn Kitties Salad Fingers Hello Kitty My Little Pony Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Swingout Condom USS Kitty Hawk (CV-63) RuneScape quests Funny Farm (comic) Plane (tool) Expanded Universe (Star Wars) Dog training Sinfest Blackadder 2000 Australian Grand Prix Chopsticks Ages of Myst Futurama (TV series - season 2) Sports betting Kodocha M16 (rifle) Girly Toy train Kitty Kelley The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Aladdin (1992 film) Bonus Stage AFI 100 Years series Baccarat 2005 English cricket season Palindrome Naval mine Siphon Grandview, U.S.A.
