when to get a kitten spade we have a kitten who we think is around months old and she has just recently started calling or so we think she is a lot less agressive than normal and is rubbing around everything and meowing a lot while laying on the floor would you say that this is typical behaviour of a kitten who is calling and when is the best time to get her spade if she is we have been advised by a relative to wait until she is not calling to get her done because if you get them done when they are calling they tend to stay in this behaviour pattern but given the fact that she is a lot calmer and generally a nicer cat when she is calling should we get her spade now or wait until she is no longer calling as advised so confused help in the uk cats are neutered from months old the second answer is likely to come from the us should the cat be in season it is advisable to wait a couple of months a pre operative visit to the vet is necessary prior to the operation this is usually provided free of charge therefore i recommend you take advantage of it and ask a vet to check out your kitten and advise accordingly good luck Cat Kitten Ferret Domestic rabbit Pet skunk Housebreaking Feral cat Guinea pig Manx (cat) Poker jargon Socialization Drill bit Garfield RuneScape quests Dog Randomness CPU cache Siamese (cat) Social rule The Amazing Race Finesse Computer virus Redundant array of independent disks GSM services Prostate cancer Hearts (game) Fancy rat RuneScape Random Events President (game) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Phoebe Buffay's songs Atomic Kitten Microeconomics Stud poker Kakapo Sleeping Murder Maine Coon Jury trial Education in Australia Lie C plus plus Draw poker Bulgarian language Tai shogi Sheepshead Asiatic Golden Cat Acne Skat Sudoku Divorce 2000 Australian Grand Prix Bulk vending Contract bridge Grammatical gender Purr Semiconductor device Speed of light Evil reptilian kitten-eater from another planet Ethology Investigations since the Fiji coup of 2000 American and British English differences Equine conformation Human sexual behavior Autism Chocolate Goatse.cx Betting (poker) Spanish pronouns Squirrel Tick Badly Drawn Kitties Polish language Paragliding Cats (musical) Economics Strap-on dildo Pretty Good Privacy Theory of conduct Feral Azumanga Daioh Basic English StarCraft: Hybrid Bamboo Surreal number Shogi Bank Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 6 Bast (goddess) Big Brother UK series 5 Publicly funded medicine Monarchy in Canada Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Sarah Kerrigan Airport Lithium ion battery Monty Hall problem Puma
