crazy wild cat help needed i found this tiny kitten about two years ago in the gutter she had oil on her and was desperately hungry she was so young definitely not young enough to leave her mother she wasn't even ready to eat regular cat food yet the way she acted and bonded with my dog i am guessing she never ever had a mother she was wild she treats my dog like her mom unfortunately she hasn't taken to humans i played with her as a kitten and held her everyday i still hold her and interact with her all the time giving her lots of attention however she stil hisses and spits and acts crazy all the time she acts very wild and is very susipicious of anyone even me she sees my other two cats walk on me and let me hold them and i can play with my crazy cat and my other cats all the time and she joins in and loves it she gets along with my youngest cat pretty well however she still doesn't let me love her what do i do sad to say that some wild cats never really change even with years of love we have four barn cats that were born there and have had them for four years they still will barely let us touch them let alone hold them some cats just have it set in their mind that they don't won't adjust to humans but slowly they are coming around letting us pet them a little more each day they still scatter sometimes when we come out to the barn try seeing if ignoring her will make her curious to where she will come to you most of the time cats will choose when they want to be loved and when they don't one of my indoor cats trip hisses or growls even swats when he doesn't want to be held anymore it is just their nature and way of saying okay thats enough she is young it will take alot of time for her to adjust just as it is with my wild barn cats it has been years and we can't even hold them so don't get discouraged the good thing is is that you can hold her and pet her when she starts acting crazy leave her alone until she decides to come and get more goodluck Cat Phoebe Buffay's songs Shaggy dog story Theory of conduct Pet skunk Socialization Garfield Milton H.
