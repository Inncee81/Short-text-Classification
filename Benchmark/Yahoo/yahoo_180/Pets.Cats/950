how to get rid of fleas our two cats are ate up with fleas we've given them at least flea baths and got them flea collars but they still have fleas is there anything else that we can do to get rid of the fleas or should we take them to the vet unfortunately i don't know of any cheap or free way to get rid of fleas here are my suggestions it's what works for me i have four kitties and a rottie and live in the country where they go inside and out at will never see a flea i use revolution every month and treat my yard just the acre right around the house not the whole thing i have never had much success with home remedies for consistent flea prevention shampoos and powders kill the fleas on them at the time but don't repel more from jumping on you should try frontline over counter or revolution which usually requires a prescription and be consistent use it once a month the eggs fall off and then hatch in your carpets rugs bedding and furniture you need to go to your local pet store and ask for a spray that is safe for use around your cat and spray the entire house especially where the cats hang out or try a bomb also putting moth balls in your vacuum cleaner bag or canister will help to kill any eggs fleas or larva that are sucked up otherwise they will hatch in the vacuum and crawl out later if the pet goes outside you should also treat your yard i use sevin dust apply just before a rain shower or use a hose or sprinkler to wet the lawn immediately after application if the infestation of the home is too bad you may see persistent fleas and need to treat more than once or call a professional i know it's a lot of work but once you've got them bad it can be expensive to fix also once your cats are flea free if they scratch a lot then they may need to see the vet they can develop a topical or skin infection from digging themselves flea collars should not be used with any other type of topical treatment such as frontline or revolution plus they just don't work well and pose more health risks to the pet than to the fleas good luck to you Flea Cat Diseases of the honeybee Gypsy moth Fancy rat Bedbug Pet skunk Psoriasis Hamster Guinea pig Acne Malaria Scabies Domestic rabbit Kakapo Rabies Common cold Baylisascaris Heartworm Tungiasis Ascariasis Hazing Siphon Chicken Chinchilla Tuberculosis Glossary of firefighting equipment Minor Harry Potter Beasts Fire extinguisher Plastic Theory of conduct Breastfeeding Red Hot Chili Peppers Urinary incontinence Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Shampoo Ranma __ characters Animal Crossing Strap-on dildo Dog Livestock Herpes simplex virus Autism Chronic fatigue syndrome Richard Chase Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Spidey Super Stories Black Death American Alligator Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Sento Bubonic plague Nuclear power Linked list Pediculosis Anthrax Childbirth Zerg Bathing Swimming Candidiasis Hookworm Genericized trademark Dracunculiasis Thermal power station Glossary of American football Tobacco Biological pest control Dandruff Schistosomiasis Eczema Tattoo Bat Solar power Clothing Garfield Otitis externa Wildfire Dairy Hydrotherapy Egg (food) Crab louse Hay fever Combine (Half-Life 2) Smallpox Upholstery Tooth enamel Vampire Beetle Vacuum Domestic AC power plugs and sockets
