cat walks funny ever since my cat was spayed over a year ago she walks funny its kind of hard to explain how she walks but her legs kinda go outward first kinda like shes waddling like a duck she also started getting fat around the same time she has one of those cow bellies going probably the worst thing of all tho is she sheds more then any cat i have ever encountered i have never had less then cats my entire life i consider that alot of experience with cats by sheds alot i mean she will shed handfulls of hair with every stroke i can comb her outside on the deck for hours straight and she will still be shedding as much as when i started when you look at her you can see the hair just barely hanging on ready to fall off if i pick her up my shirt is instantly covered would take an hour to pick each hair off she never has any bald spots tho i feel bad for her cause people want to play with her less due to the shedding i would never trade her for anything but i want her to be well first off the spay was free as it comes as part of price you pay from spca so i certainlly didn't choose the cheapest vet i could find i just went to the local vet i sure hope the vet didn't just do a poor job i have taken her to the vet since the spay and the vet didn't seem to think there was any problem i can't help but feel there is tho also for the shedding i have tried buying some of the more expensive brands of catfood i had recommended to me to help with the shedding that didn't seem to help severe shedding can be a real nuisance to groom your cat a steel toothed dog comb will get down to the skin and remove more of the loose hair when you're done combing wet your hands and pet her that will also pull off loose fur but not all of it as a last resort you can get a furminator which is a special de shedding tool that gets off more cat hair than i've ever seen you need to use this in an easy to clean place like the bathroom because every time you pass the tool over the cat you will get more and more off it took me different sessions my hand got tired before any significant reduction in the amount of hair coming off the plus side of this is that the cat loved it apparently it's something like humans having their backs scratched his coat felt much better after a couple of sessions with this tool you can get it in most pet stores and on line through pet supply places or amazon it was definitely worth the price Domestic rabbit Cat Guinea pig Dairy Dog Fancy rat Shaggy dog story Poker jargon Hair Garfield Pet skunk Ferret Knife Textile manufacturing Conker's Bad Fur Day Aerial (dance move) Trailer Park Boys Drill bit Hamster Microeconomics Manx (cat) Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Breastfeeding Keeshond Baldness Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Mattress 2000 Australian Grand Prix The Death Gate Cycle Siberian Husky Clothing Plastic Laserdisc The Amber Spyglass Horse 1957 World Series Sin City Dog training Time Out of Mind Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Socialization Red Dwarf characters Hypoglycemia Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Friends Jackass: The Movie Escape from New York The Price Is Right Glossary of climbing terms Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Baldness treatments Dilbert Housebreaking Jennifer Lopez Social rule Feral cat Equine conformation Sears Holdings Corporation Randomness Textile manufacturing terminology Weaving The Inside Kodocha Androgen insensitivity syndrome The Apprentice 2 Menstrual cup Rent (musical) W.I.T.C.H.
