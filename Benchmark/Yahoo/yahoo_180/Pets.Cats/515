my cat is peeing and pooping on the floor since we got a new cat what can i do the cat who is doing this is only yrs old i'm positive she doesn't have a urinary tract infection as this behavior started as soon as we got our new cat months ago my wife has tried rubbing her nose in it and such and it doesn't work she has a terrible attitude and we can't have her continuing doing this at this point we are close to taking her to a shelter but i very much don't want to do that nobody else would want her miserable butt and that would be condemning her to death essentially what adds insult to injury is that she is peeing and pooping on the floor only feet away from her litter box we even bought some plug in that is supposed to release motherly hormones to calm our cats down doesn't seem to work either any suggestions she is marking her territory because she is feeling threatened by the presence of the other cat cats can be jealous like people and they do things to show their discontent get her fixed and that should help if she is already fixed then separate them and gradually introduce them back together she has been queen of the house for a long time and now you brought in a princess to replace her and she is feeling the tensions and pressures and taking it out on her human parents Urinary incontinence Domestic rabbit Friends Pitaten Breastfeeding Ranma __ characters Shaggy dog story Infantilism Aerial (dance move) Tenchi Muyo!
