my kitten woke up with a completely closed eye he also sneezes alot we just gave him chicken canned food i heard that some cats are allergic to some foods we just gave him beef canned food and chicken as well can that be the cause my house is clean and we have no dust on the floors he has all his kitty shots and is a indoor cat he has no flees so im concerned cat's get a virus called cat flu and this may be what he has a course of antibiotics will get rid of it it's not dangerous but could lead to more severe problems so i'd have him checked out by the vet when you say kitty shots there is a shot to prevent cat flu so if you doc has it i would give it to your kitten after he's been checked out wash the eye out with warm water and try to keep it clean do this severa times a day and make sure his nose is not blocked you can use a baby nose aspirator for that when i got my kitten her immune system was low and she had two courses of antibiotics before it cleared up and both eyes were a mess she's fine now but does sneeze each day so i keep a close eye on her i would be most concerned if he has diarrhia or stops eating and playing watch him and see if he's changed and check with your vet Common cold Cat Fancy rat Kitten Hay fever Garfield Allergy Influenza H5N1 Domestic rabbit Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Avian influenza Pneumonia Chronic fatigue syndrome Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Livestock Hamster Chicken Antibiotic Guinea pig Urinary incontinence Foodborne illness Escherichia coli O157:H7 Pet skunk First aid Influenza pandemic Asthma Housebreaking Chinchilla Tattoo Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Food Ferret Taboo food and drink Immune system MRE Cirrhosis Toilet humour Hearts (game) Crohn's disease The Ashlee Simpson Show Factory farming Phoebe Buffay's songs Characters in the Smurfs Sneeze Transmission (medicine) Eczema Little Britain Diarrhea Spanish flu Obsessive-compulsive disorder Dialysis Poker jargon Big Brother UK series 5 Antiviral drug Psoriasis Russian joke Group A streptococcal infection Flea Elephant Infectious mononucleosis Fecal incontinence Rais massacre Ultraviolet Chlorpromazine Rosacea Blood (computer game) Kitchen USS Tunny (SS-282) Tuberculosis Paracetamol Escape from New York Chicken soup Genericized trademark Hygiene Cytomegalovirus Traumatic brain injury Diseases of the honeybee Girly Taikyoku shogi Insulin Hepatitis Happy Tree Friends Lighting Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Toxoplasmosis Cuteness Socialization Salad Fingers Goatse.cx Dean Koontz Eye Gastroparesis Rocko's Modern Life Acne Camp Lazlo Chocolate HIV test Smallpox Doctor Who (Enemy Within)
