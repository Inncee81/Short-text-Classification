cat flea infestation please help we've had cats for a number of years but for some strange reason we have massive problems with fleas and it's driving our youngest one mad he's about years old if that matters we don't use flea collars as we don't believe in them especially as they could get hung by accident or after hearing some horror stories on purpose we've also tried a couple of flea sprays powders but with little success so what other methods are there what do people recommend should we take them to a vet my mother vaguely heard that there should be an injection please help my sympathies my two cats had this problem some years ago they were totally infested and nothing worked until a new product came out called frontline it is widely used now and most vets stock it though not usually pet shops as it is prescription strength it kills the fleas ticks and lice stone dead in hours you just put the drops on at the back of the neck so they can't get to it and it keeps them free for a month i use it on my two every month a three month supply or one month for three cats is around but is well worth the money as it really will totally rid them of it mine haven't had a single flea since and that was over a decade ago you may also need to get some proper flea spray for the house if there has been an infestation the vet can recommend a good one some of them just don't work i seem to remember there was a good one called something like nuvan but i'm not sure you will only need it once as the frontline will prevent re infestation from good luck it drives you mad Red Hot Chili Peppers Heartworm Fancy rat Guinea pig Diseases of the honeybee Plagues of Egypt Pet skunk Dog Livestock Sarah Kerrigan Cat Domestic rabbit The Marshall Mathers LP Flea Theory of conduct Equine conformation Tick Socialization Shaggy dog story Dog training The Amber Spyglass Hair Poker jargon Dairy Friends Bat Boy Kakapo Bedbug Combine (Half-Life 2) Rod Stewart Glossary of American football Phantasms (TNG episode) Microchip implant (animal) StarCraft Secret Missions Little Britain Blood (computer game) Lethal injection Conker's Bad Fur Day Rabies Donald Rumsfeld Joker (comics) Fire fighting Luck Arguments for and against drug prohibition Methamphetamine Garfield Terran (StarCraft) The Shining (film) Treehouse of Horror VII Richard Chase Hyperinflation Great Depression Keynesian economics Sin City Headcrab Neighbours Typhus MapleStory Blonde on Blonde Mad Money Girly Good Morning, Vietnam Ron and Fez Ceramics Donald Neilson The Suffering (game) Jam (TV series) The Dalek Invasion of Earth Pet Sounds 2000 Australian Grand Prix StarCraft Episode VI Monopoly (game) Tiny Toon Adventures Doctor Who (Enemy Within) Bubonic plague Night (book) The Death Gate Cycle Piccolo Junior Saga Capital accumulation Siege Password Clinical depression Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Gypsy moth Docking Feral cat Medical prescription Butters Stotch DDT One Piece minor characters Suicide methods Chris Amon Paracetamol The Subtle Knife Kalimdor StarCraft: Hybrid Dr. Seuss Controlled Substances Act Space opera in Scientology doctrine
