ok serious question good answers would be appreciated thanks im planning on becoming a veterinarian doctor and hopefully i do become one but i heard that vets also have to perform abortions on some dogs if asked to by clients can i get in trouble for refusing do abortions the reason why i wanna be a vet is cause i love animals but i dont wanna perform abortions i wanna help animals save them etc any of u guys know what can happen if i refuse perform abortions on dogs yes there is that problem with many dogs out there in animal shelters being put down cause there are no homes for them but thats why ppl should spay or neuter their pets once they adopt and or buy or recieve a pet asap of course if an animal was suffering i would put he she down so they wouldnt suffer anymore we had put down my pitbull puppy because she had distemper it's a tough issue most people are having pets fixed that are already prego and your right most of these animals would be put down because of overcrowding you might run into problems because part of being in medicine is doing things you might not like or agree with you might have a problem finding a regular job you might look for a job at a no kill shelter but again you won't get the pay you might have gotten somewhere else good luck you might consider working at shelter for awhile and make sure it's something you really want to do Dog Veterinarian Cat Pet skunk Ferret Animal shelter Socialization Docking Microchip implant (animal) Avenue Q Abortion Guinea pig Housebreaking Rabies The Beach Boys Feral cat Contract Domestic rabbit Dobermann Puppy mill Animal rights Pitaten Knots Landing Jon Secada Working dog Roe v.
