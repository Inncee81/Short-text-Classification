kittens robbed i got two cats who were taken from their mama at weeks what kinds of deficiencies will they have weeks is too young but sometimes circumstances occur that make that necessary there are kitten milk replacements that they can drink if they'll lap it up i think they should at weeks or use small bottles available at the pet store like petsmart etc don't give them cow milk they can't digest it properly and will get diarrhea and intestinal distress not to mention it's not nutrionally adequate for them have them checked out by a vet very soon and he she can recommend a course of action care for them they'll have to learn everything from you unless you have an older cat that can act as a mom or dad to them my older cats made great parents for my rescued kittens even though they weren't as young as yours more like wks also make sure they are in a safe area they have no idea what is out there they can will fit into the darndest places ie under the bed even into the box springs also they won't know what to do with a litter box yet so you'll be busy about every hours or so feeding littering feeding etc they are absolutely adorable at this stage but also fragile i hope you have help with them good luck it'll be worth it in the long run Guinea pig Kitten Domestic rabbit Cat Hamster Pet skunk Fancy rat Milk Dairy Ferret Phoebe Buffay's songs Fecal incontinence Insulin Diarrhea Hypoglycemia Socialization Poker jargon Lactose intolerance Stomach cancer Food allergy Chocolate Escherichia coli O157:H7 Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Feral cat Manx (cat) The Fairly OddParents Protein-energy malnutrition Dog Tick RuneScape quests Glycogen storage disease type I Kangaroo Tooth Coeliac disease Childbirth Ren and Stimpy Domestic goat Joke Fathers' rights Nutrition Ulcerative colitis Animal communication The Marshall Mathers LP Kurt Cobain Ron and Fez Growth hormone treatment Veganism Botulism Pet store Breast milk Episodes of Lost (Season 1) First aid Diseases of the honeybee Terri Schiavo Mattress Azumanga Daioh Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Cirrhosis The Adventures of Pete & Pete Prostate cancer Premature birth Vitamin D Feline leukemia virus Infant formula Sin City Folic acid Vitamin C Silent Night, Deadly Night Coffee Indianapolis 500 Omega-3 fatty acid Rabbit Paracetamol The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Urinary incontinence Hello Kitty Kenny McCormick Cat litter Flatulence Sewage treatment Xiaolin Showdown Microchip implant (animal) Violin Polyethylene terephthalate Osteoporosis Animal rights Neopets Lie Care Bears Taboo food and drink Dairy cattle FLCL Gastrointestinal tract Diabetes mellitus Calvin and Hobbes Joy Division (band)
