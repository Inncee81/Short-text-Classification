cat scratching herself raw help we have a year old female cat that scratches and cleans herself until she has huge raw spots on her back she doesnt have fleas the vet actually told us she has in human terms obsessive compulsive disorder we have to keep a cloth coat on her to try to heal some of the sores she has been like this over years does anyone know what we could do for her if you haven't already done so it's a good idea to get the vet to test for things such as diet sensitivity and allergies psychogenic or nervous dermatitis is often a reaction to severe stress or recent illness the normal adult cat spends over a third of it's waking day grooming aside from the obvious benefits like ridding themselves of parasites and keeping the coat clean cats also find grooming therapeutic in helping to relieve tension some sensitive cats use grooming as a comforting diversionary activity when faced with some kind of challenge or perceived threat is she a fairly timid cat try to think back to when this behaviour began and see if you can remember anything that might have been a trigger some less confident cats will become stressed by changes of any kind even something like new furniture or decorating is she allowed outside at all cats also require a lot of mental stimulation to stop them from becoming bored if she is an indoor only pet then it might be a good idea to allow her outside for brief periods on a harness this will divert her attention away from grooming and on to new interests which will also build up her confidence at coping with new situations if you are unable to do this make sure to set aside regular time every day to play and interact with her as this will help keep her mind off grooming while her wounds are healing they will itch and your cat is responding by grooming the areas and so the vicious cycle continues i don't know how well she tolerates wearing her cloth coat but if you haven't tried it already you might consider fitting her with an elizabethan collar to stop her doing this sometimes a tapering dose of sedatives prescribed by your vet in conjunction with treatment of the original psychological cause will resolve the problem if she's a particularly sensitive cat you may need to build up her competence levels so that she doesn't revert back to this behaviour should she become stressed again the web article below offers further advice on this subject http www bsava com virtualcontent if all else fails you may need to ask your vet to refer you to an animal behavioural therapist hope you find a solution good luck Clinical depression Chronic fatigue syndrome Cat Insomnia Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Addiction Fancy rat Psychotherapy Allergy Milton H.
