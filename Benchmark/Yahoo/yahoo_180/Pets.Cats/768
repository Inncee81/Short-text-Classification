what the hell happened to this cat ok so i got back from a day trip and walk into the house my brother goes and finds the cat and brings it upstairs he sets the cat down and it walks off to do whatever it was gonna do a minute later we hear the cat crying louder than i've ever heard it cry so we run over to see what happened and the cat is just laying on the ground with it's mouth open panting and crying we couldn't figure out was wrong with it we checked it's feet legs mouth everything it was lying on the ground for about seconds until it finally got up slowly and walked away it's been acting completely normal ever since then and i have no idea what had happened to it my only explanation is that it may have chewed on a wire and got shocked from it but i checked all the wires where it was laying and none of them were exposed and none have bite marks what the hell happened to this cat i thought the cat was gonna die for sure by the way it was crying it's been a week since this happened and the cat has been acting like this never happened i'm guessing it had a seizure because that is the only explanation that makes sense the cat didn't get hit with anything step on anything eat anything or jump off of anything weird shit also it's mouth was open the whole time it was on the ground it was like it was paralyzed and freaking out but couldn't move don't know if that helps actually you were right when you said your cat had a seizure seizures can happen any time any where some animals make noise while other's don't keep an eye on your cat if it continues to have seizures call the vet he'll probably prescribe meds your cat can to take there isn't much you can do for your cat when it's have a seizure but to protect it from hurting it's self be sure to use caution too they are not aware of what his happening to them some animals will thrash around and you could get bit or scratched there's nothing wrong with holding them but again use caution some animals will be very tired after having a seizure and will want to sleep let your cat sleep as long as it wants to your cat will be just fine good luck and don't panic Ferret Piccolo Junior Saga Pitaten Cat The Shining (film) Out-of-body experience Milton H.
