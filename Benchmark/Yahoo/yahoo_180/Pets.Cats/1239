anyway to stop my cat my cat is very jelous when it comes to other cats he will come and bite you when you pay attention to one of the other kitties or when you brush one of the other cats he'll come and push them out of the way im fine with it but it kinda ticks me off when the other cats dont get much attention and it hurts when he bites you people are nasty i would never hurt my kitty it might help to set aside a few minutes where you tell this cat you are going to focus just on him but after that it is the other cats' turns give him that focussed attention brushing playing petting whatever he wants then move on to the next cat if when he tries to butt in on the other cats' attention you can give him a time out by putting him under an upside down laundry basket for minutes if you see him coming you might snap your fingers and point at him while making a shht sound to tell him to back off use this to make a boundary say feet or so where he cannot come any closer if it is not his turn if you give him a time out make sure the laundry basket is in the middle of the room and you might need to put something heavy on top of it to keep him from escaping this should put the social pressure on him to change his behavior because he will be embarrassed and also it will give him a chance to cool down if he is angry i do this with my two cats when they get to fighting or when they insist on jumping up on the table during our mealtimes after a couple firm no s have been tried the first time it's a minute time out if they keep fighting i increase it by a couple minutes and that usually is plenty when they interrupt meals if they keep it up after the first time out i leave 'em in the basket until we have finished eating but i certainly would not advise leaving a cat in the basket for too long and also it is best to not use a cat carrier for a time out because you don't want them to associate the thing that takes them to the vet with a punishment that will make the trip to the vet even more unpleasant for them whenever he bites you tell him a firm no and push in toward the bite you aren't trying to stick your finger down his throat but to show him you aren't scared like a mouse then shut him out of whatever activity is going on by simply ignoring him for a time yay for social pressure or by using a time out do not under any circumstances let him get away with biting your nose this is a play for social dominance i have dealt with attempts to bite my nose by holding the cat's head and placing my mouth around her nose and mouth not biting down just holding her there for a moment any time he is good and patient while you give attention to another cat be sure to praise him and reward him either with a treat or with some more special attention Aerial (dance move) Milton H.
