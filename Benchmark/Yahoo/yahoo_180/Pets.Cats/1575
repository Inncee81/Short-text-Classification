the cat came back originally i found a injured cat in my backyard i tried helping it and it jumped outta my box and ran away http answers yahoo com question index ylt aizwjm flc n ras nmv bpsy ix qid aa ljc this morning it was laying next to my car with blood on its lip it could barely move i called animal control but they told me they would probably just put it down so i picked up the cat by its tail because it was trying to attack me but it couldnt move it was like a fish outta water flopping around anyways i picked it up put it into the cardboard box and closed it shut i took the cat to the vet the examination cost and they said the cat seems to have brain and spinal trauma x rays and treatment would cost so they offered to adopt the cat try to rehabilitate it and then find an owner for it i hope the kitty will be okay oh david that's a wonderful outcome i am so sorry the kitty was in such bad shape and so glad you could get it into a box and to a vet it sounds like the kitty was most likely hit by a car to cause so much trauma even if he does not make it you are certainly a hero as are the vets to give it as much help as possible Poker jargon Traumatic brain injury Pet skunk Escape from New York Chiropractic Cat Sin City The Inside Felix the Cat Rabies Jennifer Lopez Equine conformation Ferret Ayrton Senna Zagreus (Doctor Who audio) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Garfield Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Huang Na USS Kitty Hawk (CV-63) Rose (Doctor Who) Intracranial pressure Gambling RuneScape Random Events Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Badly Drawn Kitties Guinea pig Conker's Bad Fur Day The Apprentice 2 USS Waters (DD-115) Terri Schiavo Shaggy dog story 1957 World Series Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Carolina Panthers The Dalek Invasion of Earth Tom and Jerry (MGM) Kitty Genovese Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) New York Giants Multiple sclerosis Sport The Cat in the Hat Skateboarding trick Cat Stevens Random Harvest Richard Chase EastEnders First aid Stroke Moe Berg Microchip implant (animal) Sydney Riot of 1879 Best Buy Let's Make a Deal Hello Kitty Pitaten Animal communication 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake Dr. Seuss Confidence trick 2004 American League Championship Series AFI 100 Years series Animal Liberation Front Triage HyperText Transfer Protocol Physical therapy New York Mets Veterans Stadium Mattress Neurosurgery The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases The Star Wars Holiday Special The Flintstones Fancy rat Monty Hall problem Medicine Professional wrestling attacks Road traffic accident The Contender (television series) RKO Pictures Syringomyelia OpenBSD Sonic the Hedgehog (16-bit) Genesis (band) Gunsmith Cats Boom Town (Doctor Who) Hip hop rivalries Blink-182 Hearing impairment Gray Wolf Tooth enamel Futurama (TV series - season 5) Book of Isaiah Paranoia Agent Suicide methods Kain (Legacy of Kain) Sonic Heroes
