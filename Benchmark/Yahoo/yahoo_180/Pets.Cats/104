need advice quickly on cat my cat has been very sick the past few months it started out with him just dropping a lot of weight we took him to the vet but being away from us made him sicker so they sent him home we pumped him full of fluids via an iv and he eventually got better never all the way better but better to the point where he was eating he's had little episodes of this off and on in the recent months but now is his worst spell he hasn't eaten for days he is thin as a rail and his ears and eyes are yellow his gums are very white should we take him back to the vet in risk of him getting worse without us should we just wait and see what happens i am getting so worried he is my baby and i love him he is so much like a dog no other cat is like him and i don't want to lose him he's only three years old could this be fatty liver syndrome or does it sound like something worse like cancer okay i'm definately enjoying the ridiculous answers whatever it is it sounds like he is becoming extremely malnourished as a result your only option at this point is to take him to the vet for a full diagnosis while animals can be extremely loyal it doesn't seem right that he would let himself get progressively worse it goes against an animals basic survival insticts simply because he is homesick you might want to see another vet its possible he was mistreated at the other if you are sure beyond all doubt that the problem did not lay in the vet's office but in your cat's undying dedication to you then talk to your vet about any more treatments you can do for him at home maybe a high fat diet could help but you'll need to talk to the vet to be sure if not arrange frequent visits to stop and say hello let him know you're thinking about him also you might let him take a dirty t shirt of yours with him so he can still smell you prepare yourself if the condition continues to worsen you may not be able to do anything but let him go Prostate cancer Garfield Breastfeeding Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Ferret Fancy rat Social rule Obesity Cat Guinea pig Hypoglycemia Stomach cancer Coeliac disease Kodocha Colorectal cancer Pet skunk Multiple sclerosis Chronic fatigue syndrome Shaggy dog story Insulin Binge eating disorder Cancer Dog Traumatic brain injury Atkins Nutritional Approach Tobacco smoking Sin City Crohn's disease Trailer Park Boys Recurring South Park characters Diarrhea Gout Hedgehog Domestic rabbit Glycogen storage disease type I Nutrition Growth hormone treatment Theory of conduct Fecal incontinence Piccolo Junior Saga Anorexia nervosa Pitaten Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Childbirth Phoebe Buffay's songs Dieting Folic acid Bipolar disorder Urinary incontinence Homer Simpson Rabies Stuttering Hamster Diazepam Spidey Super Stories Autism Gastroesophageal reflux disease M__ni__re___s disease Pneumonia Hypertension Ovarian cancer Elephant Tasmanian Devil Hearing impairment Milk Baldrick Egg (food) Irritable bowel syndrome Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Parkinson's disease EastEnders Omega-3 fatty acid The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Friends Tocopherol AIDS reappraisal Stroke Androgen insensitivity syndrome Chlorpromazine RuneScape quests Cowboy Bebop Carburetor Little Britain Monster Rancher monsters Eating disorder Babe Ruth The Ashlee Simpson Show Liver Vitamin C
