please help me what would you do okay i am moving from wisconsin to arizona sept st i have this cat named meow meow that i love so much i even have a tatoo of his face on my ankle the thing is is he was a indoor cat but at the place i stay at now i could let him out so now he is more of a outdoor indoor cat but he loves being outside and lately he had a reaction to a flea and tick collar so he has been trapped in the house so i don't have to worry about finding him to give him his meds on time well he has been in the house now for about days or more and he has cryed by the door the whole time and if he gets one chance he'll bolt out of it i was going to take him to arizona with me but now i don't know because he doesn't like being inside and in my apt complex i'll be staying in he can't just go roam the streets he'd have to stay in i am heartbroken at the idea of giving him away but i don't want force him to come with me if he isn't going to be happy just for my selfish reasons the other option is the is woman that works at my vets office wants him she has a home in the country and she would have him as a indoor outdoor cat and mostly indoor in the winter which is like his life now so my questions are do you think he would get used to being in an apt or do you think he would always have that urge to go outside and what would you do if you were me the cat is about years old nuetered male my main concern is his bolting out the door he is so fast and what if that happens in arizona and i can't retrieve him the thought of him being lost in a desert is scaring the heck out of me about him being outside he is a half main coon he is pound cat also if he stays then he will get any treatment from a vet i love that sort of makes me happy thank you for thinking of the cat first not yourself i am proud that you admit that well i think you can keep the cat with you and yes sometimes take him out on a leash i also think you should buy a friend for him so he won't be lonley but on the other hand you are right he might like it better being an outdoor cat and all to live with the lady in the country but as someone said it is kinda bad to let your cats outside they could be hit by cars and other reasons the choice is up to you tell us your decision later good luck and more good luck on deciding Cat Luck Phoebe Buffay's songs Avenue Q Shaggy dog story Volleyball Pitaten Social rule Poker jargon EastEnders The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Monty Hall problem Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Smoking Room Jon Secada The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Fairly OddParents Sin City Ferret Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Humphrey Bogart The Time Machine The Dalek Invasion of Earth Winning Streak Mojave people Ben Johnson (athlete) Dean Koontz The Book of Five Rings Theory of conduct Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Amazing Race Tag The Amber Spyglass The Boy Who Knew Too Much Customs and etiquette of Japan Friends 2000 Australian Grand Prix Care Bears Rich Mullins Blonde on Blonde Samuel Goldwyn Knots Landing Garfield Bernard Williams Cliff Richard Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Girly Trapped in the Closet The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Time Out of Mind Housebreaking 2004 Republican National Convention Piccolo Junior Saga Coming of Age (TNG episode) Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Professional wrestling holds Phoebe Halliwell Nicomachean Ethics Maine Coon The nature of God in Western theology Equine conformation Skinny Dip Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Freddy Fender McDonald's Drizzt Do'Urden Viva La Bam The Suffering (game) The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Meme The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Atlas Comics (1950s) The Inside Andr__s Galarraga Kasparov versus The World Ed, Edd n Eddy God Emperor of Dune Past teachings of Prem Rawat Combine (Half-Life 2) Kodocha Economics Muslim ibn Aqeel True Crime: Streets of LA Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, manga or movie only characters The Contender (television series) Theodore Roosevelt Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Syphon Filter She Loves You Prisoner's dilemma RuneScape quests
