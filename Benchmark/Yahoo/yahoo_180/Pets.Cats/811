why does my cat urinate on other cats i have a wonderful cat named gatto that is italian for cat for those of you that have never lifted your head out of your cat's litter box now i love my cat because he keeps me company and everything keeps the nyc rats away now my girlfriend is a pain in the ass and she brings her cat over to play with gatto now they're both males my cat gatto is ehhh a real bull dick you might say for lack of a better term everytime she brings her cat over gatto urinates on the other cat and they start fighting and my girlfriend starts breaking my balls because my cat is being an animal as she puts it when i say all cats are animals she says no just yours but anyway my girlfriend wants to move in now i don't want my cat pissing on the other cat or on anything other than his litterbox for that matter it's not like he pisses on anything other than his litterbox or other cats that he doesn't like how do i train my cat not to piss on his enemies first and foremost you can't train cats if your cat isn't neutered then i suggest you do so that will help the problem tremendously but only if her cat is also males tend to fight with each other more than with females since it is in their natural instinct to what your cat is simply doing is marking his territory neutering usually fixes this problem but not always they aren't used to each other either bringing a new cat into the picture is always negative at first no matter what the gender after they are both neutered if not already done so put them both together regardless of urination deal with it at the moment and give them some time to get used to it i can't guarantee that this will eliminate the problem completely but more than likely it will it varies by cat and attitude unfortunately Cat Gender-neutral language Gender Feral cat Guinea pig Dog Euphemism Shaggy dog story Kitten Housebreaking Hamster Ranma __ characters Vulgar Latin Pet skunk Toxoplasmosis Doraemon Castration Manx (cat) Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Calvin and Hobbes Bulgarian language Ben Johnson (athlete) Eric Cartman German grammar Ron and Fez Something Positive Trainspotting (novel) Theory of conduct Friends The Smoking Room Homeschooling Toilet humour House Mouse Beavis and Butt-head Abstraction Homer Simpson Penis Harem anime Spider-Man Fancy rat Electrophysiology Fruits Basket The Cat in the Hat Weebl and Bob Philosophy of language Toilet Brown Bear Felis sapiens Gender role God and gender Carolina Panthers Fritz the Cat (movie) Non-native pronunciations of English Domestic violence True Crime: Streets of LA Polish language Urination Sinfest The Catcher in the Rye Pok__mon Chronicles Military slang Hybrid Cat litter Spanish nouns YuYu Hakusho Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man Territory (animal) Andr__s Galarraga Urinary incontinence Procrastination Animal communication Ranma Saotome Cheshire cat Ren and Stimpy Anne Rice Diving Piccolo (Dragon Ball) The Death Gate Cycle Sin City Friendship Old French Kyle Broflovski Leopard Professional wrestling slang Gender identity Dualism (philosophy of mind) Atheism Peanuts Pitaten Prolog Kim Possible Tenshinhan FLCL Esperanto as an international language RuneScape quests
