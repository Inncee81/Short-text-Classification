serious cat problems i have a month old male cat and he is very naughty when we went to pick out a cat at the shelter they just had all of the kittens running around he was very quite and alone and would get picked on by all of the other kittens he was also one of the littlest ones there he was around weeks when we picked him up from there when we brought him home he adapted to the litter box right away and i would take him up into my room at night so that he would not bother my mom and disabled brother at night after about week of taking him up into my room he ended up pooping under my bed we thought it was because of me taking him up to my room everynight we felt as if he felt restrained or that he has to stay up there so the next night i didn't bring him up stairs and he was fine for about month then my brother had a bath chair in the bathtub and my cat peed in that chair then he was fine for a while and then my mom found a wet spot on the bathroom rug she thinks he peed there he also tends to be very agressive i know that it is play agression but then he tends to pee on things after we make him mad how do you stop this oh and more thing the cat has always been very nice and only play agression was the problem but now he will bite my ear chin lip or nose when he is around me it seems as though he is saying that he is the boss how do you stop this as it is very annoying as when i try to sleep and someone is biting my face it is not a hard bite just a soft nibble but his soft nibble can still be a little annoying i have tried scruffing him by the neck when he does this but he just waits seconds and then does it again in usually the same spot please help me cause if the cat keeps peeing my mom says that we will have to get rid of him and i do not want and neither does she but she does not want him to ruin the house sry this is soo long one last thing his urine doesn't smell right away normal cats pick their places to eliminate on the basis of it feels safe and private and they have been there before they go back to the place where they've left their smell the cat's litter box may not be in a place he perceives as safe and private you might need to relocate it it may also not be clean enough for him don't give him this excuse scoop it out often at least twice a day more often if you can and change the litter at least once a week to get rid of the smell where he has made a mess outside of his litter box get the preparation called get serious from pet smart you may also be able to order it online if a pet smart store is not near you use it exactly as directed everywhere the cat has made a mess with a brush and some rags to blot the surface dry then wash that surface with hot soapy water with a cup of white vinegar in it when you get rid of the smell he should stop returning to these places good luck failing to use a litterbox is a way that a cat lets you know that something about his life is not quite right or not to his liking in that situation people smoke overeat undereat drink sleep with strangers and do drugs cats crap the floor i have a nervous cat who has the occasional discontented spell and pees on the floor right next to the litterbox no matter how clean i keep it he has done so recently because he wants to go out and i've been making him stay in because we've got a heat wave on here the get serious stuff will at the very least help you keep your home smelling clean despite the little cat's lapses Hamster 2000 Australian Grand Prix Sin City Social rule Garfield Sento Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story Pitaten Guinea pig Domestic rabbit Friends The Inside Phoebe Buffay's songs RuneScape quests Fancy rat Toilet Toilet humour Japanese toilet Ron Weasley Ron and Fez Textile manufacturing Dog training Customs and etiquette of Japan Sauna Humphrey Bogart The Adventures of Pete & Pete Characters in the Smurfs Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an EastEnders Dog The Fairly OddParents Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Pet skunk Japanese tea ceremony Jackass: The Movie Mattress Shit Red Dwarf characters Blood Simple Russian joke Calvin and Hobbes Milton H.
