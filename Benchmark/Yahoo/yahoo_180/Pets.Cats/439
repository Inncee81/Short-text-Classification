what is up with my cat i have a year old female cat who's been acting weird lately just days before i got the dog she sensed something was up i didn't have the cat bowl in the house anymore she was more affectionate and clingy to me letting me hold her longer than usual so when we got the puppy a breed that loves cats she's been acting like a wild cat she'd be knocking baby gates down pounce on things and run like lightning while the dog was in the other room sleeping why would she do this is she upset another animal is sharing her domain she doesn't like dogs much she chased a stray lab a big dog not a puppy off of her property lol and it ran but the puppy is waiting for the cat to warm up to him cats can tend to be more territorial than dogs have a reputation for and cats are very temperamental animals it takes them a while usually to warm up to changes in their household and yes she's having to share the space and affection with you with another animal so she's reacting to that as well it's just one great big stressful situation for her and that's why she's darting around the house spacing out as it were the best thing for you to do is keep the two away from each other for a while reassure you kitty that you're still here for her and that she's still number one spend one on one time with her playing with her talking to her and giving her her favorite treats or food a couple of times in solitude away from the dog it'll take some time but she will probably eventually warm up to having someone else in the house you and the dog are just going to have to win her trust again good luck Dog Cat Housebreaking Garfield Ranma __ characters Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dog training Pitaten Characters in the Smurfs Lady and the Tramp Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Kim Possible Shaggy dog story Animal rights Maison Ikkoku Labrador Retriever Miss Saigon Kodocha Pet skunk Ren and Stimpy Trailer Park Boys Skinny Puppy Ferret Scooby-Doo 101 Dalmatians: The Series Socialization Hamster RuneScape quests Poker jargon Girly Friends Fancy rat German Shepherd Dog Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Great Teacher Onizuka Guinea pig Jennifer Lopez Golden Retriever Shetland Sheepdog Social rule Game show Domestication Kakapo Billboard Hot 100 Black Pete Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography God Emperor of Dune Dean Koontz AFI 100 Years series W.I.T.C.H.
