how to get my cat used to the harness my cat is starting to get curious about our garden and she really wants to be let out shes not spayed yet so i cant let her go on her own i bought this harness but she just doesn't seem comfortable walking with it she runs away when i try to put it on is there anyway i can get her to get used to it i can't get her spayed yet shes too young and the vet won't do it till next month i'm also not sure if she'll be allowed out on her own yet so i really need the harness try associating it with a treat show it to her and give her a treat after you've done that a few times pick her up and touch her with the harness just press it against her body briefly and give her a treat work up to draping it over her and give her a treat put it on her and buckle it and give her a treat you get the idea cats aren't as food motivated as dogs but if you associate the harness with something she enjoys i think you can get her used to it later of course the something she enjoys will be geting to go outside and explore she'll probably run around like she has a monster on her back the first time you actually get it on her so have the leash attached so you can reel her in from behind the washing machine or whatever or she may collapse into a pathetic heap like one of my cats did the first time i put a harness on him trying to convince me that it was simply too heavy for him persistence and food usually works by the way i wouldn't let her out to roam free even after she is spayed there are too many things that can happen to a cat outdoors exploring on a leash is enough Dog training Pet skunk Cat Strap-on dildo Ferret Guinea pig Leash RuneScape quests Dog Kitten Kitesurfing Paragliding Shaggy dog story Textile manufacturing Theory of conduct Humphrey Bogart Socialization Garfield Wheel of Fortune Housebreaking Equine conformation Fancy rat Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Price Is Right Hamster Lawn mower Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Ecco the Dolphin Parachuting Characters in the Smurfs English grammar Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling match types Doctor Octopus Alfred Hitchcock Montreal Screwjob Beer Hall Putsch Ben Johnson (athlete) Punisher Mid-levels The Twelve Labours The Amber Spyglass Satchel Paige Swimming Horse Dog agility Milton H.
