my cat's too skinny any ideas on what to feed her to get her to gain some weight my cat about years old seems too thin to me i feed her regularly and keep regular checkups with the vet she's healthy but even the vet said she's a little thin but i don't know what to give her to get her to gain some weight does anyone have and ideas to share with me i've tried canned food treats i don't want to give her table scraps but she still isn't gaining weight thanks i talked to the vet about a prescription food but right now i can't afford it i'm saving up for it but i'm not sure how long it will take you see i'm an intern with a part time job in college so money is tight right now she does eat when i feed her sorry about not making that clear i feed her iams dry food meowmix wet food i follow the feeding instructions even give her more sometimes too as your vet has checked her over and you're saying she's healthy i'm assuming that there are no health problems to explain why she's not putting on weight if she's only a little bit underweight and otherwise in good health you probably don't have to worry too much about her to put weight on her your best bet is to feed her a food formulated for kittens and or lactating queens as these will have the highest calorific content the premium foods are better quality but if you can't afford them some of the better supermarket brands are reasonable if she's happy to eat whatever you feed her hopefully you can change her food over without too many issues even so change over a few days to a week to prevent any gastrointestinal upsets Breastfeeding Guinea pig Chocolate Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Obesity Hamster Theory of conduct Garfield Domestic rabbit Health insurance Fancy rat Anorexia nervosa Stomach cancer Milk Cat Atkins Nutritional Approach Dairy Folic acid Medical prescription Publicly funded medicine Organic farming Adjustable gastric band Mutual fund Confidence trick Binge eating disorder Food and Drug Administration Dieting Livestock Insurance Gasoline Poker jargon Prostate cancer Nutrition The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Life insurance Wal-Mart Fecal incontinence Diarrhea Veganism Organic food Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Education in Germany Rabies Genetically modified food Kitten Time travel Foie gras Hormone replacement therapy (trans) English grammar Mattress Social rule Knife Phoebe Buffay's songs Peanut Insulin Handloading The Amazing Race Sugar substitute Scientology beliefs and practices Diseases of the honeybee Raw food diet Gastroparesis Super Size Me Omega-3 fatty acid Ramen Year 2000 problem Neopets Intellectual property Internet fraud Urinary incontinence Little Shop of Horrors Goodness and value theory Ron and Fez ITV Vermicompost Credit card New Coke Inflation Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Eric Bischoff Open access Fasting Internal ballistics Annuity Tooth enamel Equine conformation Health care in the United States Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Potassium bromide Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Taboo food and drink Kashrut Animal rights Draw poker Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Pretty Good Privacy Tuition Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an
