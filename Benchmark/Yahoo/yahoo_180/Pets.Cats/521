how can i help a slowly starving stray cat without taking it home last night on the way home from picking up my brother at work we stopped at walgreen's to buy some milk on the way home as i was waiting in the car i saw a small skinny young grey and white cat it looked like it had not had food and water for a while and had no tags but was domesticated i approched the cat which was about year old and tried to pet him he pulled away at first but then let me pet him i was able to pick him up and wanted to take him home but my mom would not let me keep him and told me to leave it out in the cold parking lot i later learned the next day via store employees that the cat usually hangs around the parking lot looking for food at night i want to help this cat but can't call animal control because they will most likely euthenize him i do't know of anybody who could take it in how can i help the cat get proper nutrition and save it's life without taking it home my grandma bless her has been doing this kind of thing ever since she's been able to coherantly think if you want to help the cat try bringing it food and lots of it it's hard for strays to find food especially in crowded areas and water and if you want to spoil it some milk dont bring it too much milk though thats just a treat if if has no shelter try and find a potentially hidden area to put the food down with a blanket that the cat could snuggle or feel safe with try giving it a few small toys that it could play with when its bored it can be nerve wracking and it could be putting extra expenses in your life but strays need a home too try and put up flyers little old ladies who need some companions love older calm cats my grandma as well as my mother and i carrying on her duty in life lol have fostered homes for cats for a few weeks until someone could come and orient themselves with the cat that they could love pay attention to the cat for awhile doesnt have to be long and then bring a friend or a family member with you so the cat will get used to humans it could cut into your life but you will feel alot better about it after you've done it it's a nice kind thing to do especially when you have my karma hah the shelter is not a good place for older cats they dont give them much adoption time especially when they are feral outside cats and the poor thing will be scared to death it will probably end up with the cat being put to sleep try and put flyers around grocery markets and convience stores or wherever your little old ladies like to hang out even a vet's office is a good place both of my cats are strays and i feel that they are loveable friendly beings getting a stray is potentially better than buying one and many people know this so finding a home shouldnt be too hard from what you've said the cat is rather friendly and that is alot better than trying to find a home for a feral cat good luck Cat Garfield Socialization Feral cat Dog Kodocha RuneScape quests The Amber Spyglass Guinea pig Shaggy dog story Pet skunk EastEnders Phoebe Buffay's songs Time Out of Mind Ranma __ characters Conker's Bad Fur Day Humphrey Bogart Silent Night, Deadly Night Dog training Sin City Taboo food and drink Breastfeeding Ferret Fiddler on the Roof One Tree Hill (TV series) Kangaroo The Subtle Knife Charmed YuYu Hakusho The Lovely Bones The Family from One End Street Friends Singlish Feral The Contender (television series) Rabies Fancy rat Care Bears Aerial (dance move) Maison Ikkoku Ed, Edd n Eddy Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Mattress Animal euthanasia Rent (musical) Piccolo Junior Saga One Piece minor characters Dairy Atomic Kitten Ocean's Twelve Domestic rabbit The Inside Tag The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Knots Landing Rabbit Franklin (television series) Little Britain Incarnations of Immortality The Fairly OddParents 2000 Australian Grand Prix Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Animal shelter About a Boy Comanche Marilyn Monroe Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Tofu Neighbours Sant Thakar Singh Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Rocko's Modern Life Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Dead Like Me Social rule Animal rights The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Domestication Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Lady and the Tramp SpongeBob SquarePants The Simpsons Blood on the Tracks Everwood Supermarket The Pet Sounds Sessions The Life and Times of Juniper Lee The Adventures of Pete & Pete Characters in the Smurfs The Brothers Karamazov Kitten
