rare calico cats i just want to know why are male calico cats rare i have a female but a lot of people tell me the boys are rare and i should find one for breeding and make i don't want to breed i just want to have another friend i am just curious to know why they are rare though it is true that male calicos are rare however breeding them isn't going to make you money unless you have baby males which is rare so that is a waste of your time and effort calicos are predominately female this is a result of the way that the feline genetic code accounts for the orange and black colors the gene for fur color appears on the x chromosome therefore calicos need two x chromosomes which usually gives them a set of xx this should result in a female cat the y chromosome does not contain any coding for fur color therefore since male cats are xy and not xx calico cats are very rarely males however this is not always the case cells do not always divide correctly so sometimes instead of an xx or xy sex chromosome pairing the kitten ends up with three chromosomes for instance such a kitten may have xxy if the two x chromosomes contain codes for different colors then it is possible to end up with a male calico this is very rare as it requires that the correct colors of cats mate as well as that there is an error in the formation of the cat embryo calico cats are generally considered to be lucky throughout several different cultures male calicos are so rare and almost always sterile it is impossible to breed calicos with each other however females can be bred by mating orange and black cats if an orange male is bred with a black female for example there is a good chance that any female kittens will be calico while you may end up with a calico male however there is not currently any way known to purposefully breed male calico cats Cat Tortoiseshell cat Cat coat genetics Intersexuality X chromosome Y chromosome Chromosome Liger Twin Platypus Meiosis Cheetah Mitosis Eye color Gender role Sex Panthera hybrid Plant breeding DNA Color blindness Puma Cell (biology) Sexual differentiation Gene Sex assignment House Mouse Barr body Parthenogenesis Genetic disorder Chimera (genetics) Abortion debate Genetics Reproduction Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Sex-determination system Domestic rabbit Androgen insensitivity syndrome Turkish Van Lion Mutation Congenital disorder DNA repair Cephalic disorder Spider Turner syndrome Intersex surgery Hirschsprung's disease Incest Hybrid Chimpanzee Genome Project Color Sexual identity Cancer Mixed-breed dog Genetic linkage Border Collie Feral cat Bengal cat Dragons (Pern) Eugenics History of intersex surgery Hardy-Weinberg principle Flowering plant Japanese Bobtail (cat) Genetic algorithm Siamese (cat) Gamete Black panther Morphogenesis Kitten Francis Crick Non-human animal sexuality Gender identity Maine Coon Wheat Cats (musical) Tigon Recessive gene Sexual selection Human genome Biology and sexual orientation Haemophilia Phoebe Buffay's songs Evolution Maneki Neko Sexual dimorphism Cytogenetics Genetic recombination Eusociality SRY Debugging Jurassic Park
