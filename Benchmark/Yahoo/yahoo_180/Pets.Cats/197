is it really a popular danish custom to put a black cat in a barrel to hang from a tree and hit with a bat a danish couple told me that it is a happy age old custom across denmark to put a living black cat in a sealed barrel suspend it from a tree at a party and then pound it with a baseball bat they said little danish children love this tradition and everyone cheers when the cat screams inside the barrel when it is hit it's like a gory pinata the first person to knock the bloody cat out of the barrel would be the queen for the day and the person who knocked the last board would be king for the day these looked like regular people and they are educated but were they telling the truth i was horrified i told them it would be a crime in the usa but they didn't understand why they couldn't understand why i was horrified either it may or may not be a traditoin but it is in my opinion the stupidist i have a black cat and just hearing that makes me glad i am not danish that is horrible the person who beats the poor cat out should be in jail for a day plus the other people so the tradition would be better if they put a person in a barrel then they would know how it feels to get the crap beat out of you in a barrel just to make someone have fun just because of an old stupid tradition Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Babe Ruth's Called Shot 2005 ICC Trophy Birthday Futurama (TV series - season 5) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Fancy Crane EastEnders Ty Cobb Shaggy dog story The Catcher in the Rye The Shining (film) Sin City Ren and Stimpy Joe DiMaggio Invader Zim Flag of Denmark Garfield W.I.T.C.H.
