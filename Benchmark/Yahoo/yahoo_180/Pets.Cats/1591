how can i get my cat to stop waking my boyfriend and i up at night see more details below i normally get up at on a weekday and feed my cat then get ready for work but for months now she has been jumping on the bed and running across the pillows or batting our heads with her paws to make us wake up and feed her at sometimes onwards in the morning she won't stop until we either give in and feed her or get up and put her outside until we're ready to get up i haven't had a decent sleep in so long i can't even remember can someone please help us we moved house months ago and we used to lock her in the garage at night there and that worked fine but we live upstairs in a storey house and she can get out of the garage here we tried locking her in the spare bedroom but she scratches the door and we're renting so we can't let her wreck the house we have a balcony we thought we might be able to close off and she could sleep out there so that's an option but i thought i would try and get some more ideas any help is appreciated if you don't go for the automatic pop up dispenser someone else just mentioned you can get a scratching resistant rubber mat that you can put on the door either on the outside of your bedroom door or on the inside of your spare bedroom you can find them at any major pet store this may be a less expensive solution to the automatic feeder though the feeder sounds good if you can afford it Shaggy dog story Mattress The Shining (film) Avenue Q The Brady Bunch Max Payne The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Friends Cat Sin City Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Door EastEnders Rent (musical) Doctor Who (Enemy Within) Futurama (TV series - season 5) Odyssey Rose (Doctor Who) Elvis Presley McMansion Trapped in the Closet Chatsworth House Eastern Illinois University Christmas tree Guinea pig Out-of-body experience Wood carving Bristol Grammar School Housebreaking Kurt Cobain Satchel Paige What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?
