when is it too late to get a cat declawed my cat was two years old this past july we are getting new furniture and he destroyed my old furniture is it too late to get him declawed before the new furniture arrives meaning is he too old don't worry i know his front claws are his only defense but he is a total indoor cat never outside a cat can be taught to not claw furniture in about days provided you do it right and keep up the maintenance first get some kind of scratching post even a little foot high one is perfect next get some cat nail clippers and cut your cat's nails don't use people nail trimmers as this will split the cat's nails and it's really painful to cut the cat's nails grab your cat's foot and push on the back of one of his fingers this causes the claw to stick out cut the nail just below the pink quick make sure you get the cat's thumbs too whenever the cat tries to sharpen his claws grab the cat and tell him no then take the cat to the scratching post and move his paws up and down on the post to simulate the scratching motion praising your cat the whole time be consistent and do this every time your cat claws something you don't want him to never get upset at the cat and be sure to praise him when you move him to the scratching post and especially when he does it on his own he will trust me the maintenance is then up to you you should trim the cat's nails about once a week eventually he'll lose all interest in your furniture and fall in love with his scratching post Cat Manicure Nail (anatomy) Professional wrestling holds Woodworking Aerial (dance move) Wood carving Pet skunk Ferret Claw Milton H.
