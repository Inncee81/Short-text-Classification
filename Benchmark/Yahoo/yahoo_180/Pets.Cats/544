my cat hurt her leg yesterday i noticed my cat was limping on her front left leg and it's sort of bent and it's really painful for her my mom refuses to take her to the vet saying she'll heal by herself but i don't believe her she's a little bit better today she's able to walk on it a bit more but she's still limping when it starts hurting her really badly she'll hiss and growl it sort of looks like she twisted or sprained something i hate seeing my cat in pain so is there anything that i can do to help her the reason she isn't taking her to the vet is one she lost her job and two we had another cat that broke her leg and we took her emergency and all they did was x rays and she healed on her own and that was a very expensive trip to the vet i asked for advice how to make my cat feel better not for people to insult my mom so if your just going to say bad things about my mom then don't answer my question please take this seriously i'm sorry to hear that but really the only best option is to bring her to the vet i know it might be costly but hey what goes around comes around to let her heal by itself well it just ain't right your cat really need a doctor and i'll pray for your cat to heal k Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story Social rule The Shining (film) Professional wrestling holds Sydney Riot of 1879 Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Theory of conduct Mojave people Phoebe Buffay's songs Kyle Broflovski Characters of Lost Cindy Sheehan Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Little Britain Futurama (TV series - season 5) Kodocha Piccolo Junior Saga The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Equine conformation Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan Avenue Q Satchel Paige Rent (musical) Spanking Pok__mon Live!
