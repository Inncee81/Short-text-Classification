get roundworms from a cat when i first got my kitten about three weeks ago i found out he had roundworms coming out from him and he sometimes had accidents on me while i was laying down or sleeping before i got him treated should i be worried about having caught them okay everyone who answered is talking about ringworm ringworm is a fungus on the outside of the cat roundworm is inside the cat and he may throw them up it's gross but they look like bean sprouts but i don't think you have any reason to be worried cats mostly just pass them on to each other you should try ringing your vet and just asking them over the phone but i highly doubt it if your pet gets ringworm that's a different story because humans can get ringworm from cats Ferret Shaggy dog story Garfield Ringworm Kitten Roundworm Animal Cat Socialization RuneScape quests Ascariasis Guinea pig Friends Fungus Phoebe Buffay's songs Feral cat Dog Fancy rat Manx (cat) One Piece minor characters Social rule Piccolo Junior Saga Brian Griffin Flea El Goonish Shive The Amber Spyglass The Fairly OddParents Roswell UFO incident Baldrick Heartworm Pet Sematary Apoptosis Baylisascaris Hookworm Pet The Secret of NIMH Girly The Pilgrim's Progress Tiger Treecat African American Vernacular English The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents Animal rights Puss in Boots Domestication Chocolate Sin City Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist God Emperor of Dune Dilbert Taboo food and drink Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Xiaolin Showdown Rabies Goatse.cx Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog Rent (musical) Veterinarian Tekken characters Minor Harry Potter Beasts The Subtle Knife Avenue Q AFI 100 Years series Running gag Doraemon Ocean's Twelve Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Cheetah Shrek 2 Catwoman Toilet humour Soil life Puma Ron and Fez Tokyo Mew Mew Tick Killian documents Immortality Mr. Bean Azumanga Daioh The Inside Chronic fatigue syndrome Yin Shun Parasite Turkish Van Rocko's Modern Life Hamster Greebo Catgirl Shawn Michaels Rabbit Philadelphia Eagles Krypto the Superdog Garfield and Friends The Catcher in the Rye Alley Cat Phaedo Mycosis Zagreus (Doctor Who audio)
