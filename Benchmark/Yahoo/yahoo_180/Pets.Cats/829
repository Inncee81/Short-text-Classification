how do i get my cat to stop urinating outside her litter box my female cat is three years old soon to be four and i can't get her to stop urinating outside her litter box it is cleaned several times a week i've tried cleaning up around the box so she doesn't have any kicked out litter to go on and i've gotten her a new different litter box to go in that is taller so she can't kick litter out but she still goes outside her box i have also had her checked for urinary problems and she had a clean bill of health we recently moved into a new apartment and i was hopeful that with a change in the location of the box maybe she wouldn't anymore but when we came home today she had peed on the mat i have sitting under the litter box she seems to just want to pee right next to the box instead of in it i don't know how to correct this behavior i don't want to give her up since i have had her since she was about five months old but i can't keep her if she is going to continue peeing on the floor any help would be greatly appreciated kay first of all put lots of news paper underneath the litter box covering the areas where she would urinate if you see her urinate outside say loudly and firmly to her no and place her inside the litterbox straight away if she comes to you for attention after don't give it let her know that you do not like what she's doing this is pointless if you don't do it straight away if she does use it pet her a lot and give her some treats afterwards d make a big fuss of her preferably straight away my cats used to have a serious problem doing this but at least yours does it next to the box so she does know what its there for if you ever see her walk towards that area with a i'm about to urinate and annoy you look on her face pick her up and put her in the box after she urinates outside of it don't give in and give her lots of attention this will only make her think that it's okay to do it keep up doing this and you should see an improvement edit if you do what the first answer says she will protest when you let her out if you do do what he she says expect lots of mess to clear up afterwards Hamster Domestic rabbit Shaggy dog story Aerial (dance move) Pet skunk Social rule Fancy rat Japanese toilet Guinea pig Urine Poker jargon Toilet Dog training Calvin and Hobbes 2000 Australian Grand Prix Prostate cancer Tobacco smoking Professional wrestling holds Toxoplasmosis Mixed martial arts Columbine High School massacre Swingout Garfield Theory of conduct Friends Dog Cat litter House Mouse Japanese tea ceremony Little Britain Humphrey Bogart Urination Boxing Skateboarding trick Monty Hall problem Toilet humour Russian joke Glossary of partner dance terms Ferret Ben Johnson (athlete) Kitten RuneScape quests Jumpstart 3rd Grade The Pet Sounds Sessions Professional wrestling throws Kevin Smith Drug test Strap-on dildo American Psycho Cleveland Browns Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Kasparov versus The World Characters in the Smurfs English grammar Fast bowling Volleyball Tick Penis 1957 World Series Kangaroo Escape from New York Richard Chase The Catcher in the Rye The Beach Boys Diseases of the honeybee The Fairly OddParents Phimosis Brown Bear Equine conformation Ocean's Twelve Labrador Retriever The Washington Times Sento Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Dog agility Breastfeeding MapleStory Futurama (TV series - season 5) Violin Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Menstrual cycle Dairy Buffalo Bills American football strategy Anderson Cooper The Apprentice 2 Blood Simple Toilet paper The Ersatz Elevator Burning Man Atlas Comics (1950s) Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Avenue Q Ice hockey
