who agrees with the ending of harry potter i want to know if anyone else liked disliked the ending of harry potter warning spoiler alert personally i thought the whole scar sentence was obvious i loved everything about the book except for one thing the only thing that i would have changed was georges death other than that i think everything was great i loved the fact that it wasn't harry himself that killed voldemort i liked that jk didn't suddenly give harry any powers that made him more skilled than voldemort because that would have been weak he just used the magic he knew and voldemort was defeated anyways Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Death Eater Harry Potter (character) Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Lord Voldemort Dates in Harry Potter Severus Snape James and Lily Potter Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Magic (Harry Potter) Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Albus Dumbledore Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Ron Weasley Order of the Phoenix Ginny Weasley Harry Potter: Book Seven Ministry of Magic Sybill Trelawney Magical objects in Harry Potter Blood purity (Harry Potter) Lucius Malfoy Harry Potter Rubeus Hagrid Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter Hermione Granger House-elf Bellatrix Lestrange Horcrux Harry Potter newspapers and magazines Minor Ministry officials in the Harry Potter books Diagon Alley Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film) Remus Lupin Sirius Black Hogwarts subjects Rita Skeeter Hogwarts Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film) Horace Slughorn Weasley family Barty Crouch Minor members of the Order of the Phoenix Dark Mark Azkaban Peter Pettigrew Tom Riddle's diary Hogwarts Houses Cedric Diggory Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game) Wizarding world Minor Hufflepuffs Tom Riddle Dolores Umbridge Triwizard Tournament Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film) R.A.B.
