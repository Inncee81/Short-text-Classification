why was peter pettigrew ever put in gryffindor i definitely see he does not have the qualities of a gryffindor he is not brave courageous he doesn't stand up for what is right and he is lured to the dark side because he seeks approval and protection from voldemort he is even cowardly enough to betray those who trusted him lily and james on his master's orders we know from j k rowling that the sorting hat has never been wrong also if we were to take into account what dumbledore said to snape in the pensieve at the end of book that sometimes he feels they sort people too early for some of their true qualities to show we can still argue that pettigrew's weakness and cowardice that allowed him to become a death eater and traitor can still be seen when he was young he always looked up to those greater than him and hung around them at school this was james and his friends who were famous after school this was the dark lord lamia i don't believe the sorting hat takes choice into account for every student and for all circumstances because that way everyone would simply end up in whatever house they wanted regardless of their true qualities or characteristics it worked for harry though because he truly fulfilled the qualities of a true gryffindor i don't understand why the hat wanted to put him in slytherin in the first place anyhow i guess he was just put into gryffindor by the author to make the events work out so that he could be a friend of james lily and later betray them however i agree with i hearts sirius black that pettigrew wasn't so dark to be put in slytherin so maybe he would've been made a hufflepuff anyway again it's not a big deal the books are perfect well harry chose his own way into gryffindor maybe peter had already chosen sirius and james as the leaders he needed and thus wanted to go into gryffindor but i can definitely see your point about him not being brave or courageous however do you think he redeemed himself when he didn't kill harry wasn't that a show of bravery even if he had shown none before it's also very possible that peter started out brave and well intentioned but the idea of the dark lord scared the brave out of him i guess it's not true anymore though that there was never a dark witch or wizard that wasn't in slytherin Ron Weasley Hogwarts Minor Hufflepuffs The Hogwarts Founders Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Blood purity (Harry Potter) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Ginny Weasley Horace Slughorn Horcrux Hogwarts subjects Albus Dumbledore Minor Ravenclaws Hermione Granger Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter Minor Slytherins Magic (Harry Potter) Half-Blood Prince (character) Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Weasley family Rubeus Hagrid R.A.B.
