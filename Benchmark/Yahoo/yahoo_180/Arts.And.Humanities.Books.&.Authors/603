question for tom clancy readers are there any books by tom clancy besides hunt for red october that don't include sexual descriptions and themes i am only nearly seventeen and while i enjoy a good techno thriller i am sick of closing books because of things i don't approve of thanks from the books i've read they all seem to have a tint of sexual behavior in them though it's always pretty brief if you don't feel comfortable reading that specific part i'd suggest skipping over it you never miss anything important anyway and it rarely even lasts a page tom clancy is an amazing writer and i think it would be a shame to miss out on his amazing works because of one page you don't agree with it's like watching a great movie like the godfather if you don't agree with the one unimportant scene that lasts about seconds you can just skip over it if something contains material that doesn't agree with your beliefs you shouldn't necessarily steer clear of it but just avoid the small imperfections so you don't miss out on a great work of art tom clancy incorporates many life principles into his stories and by no means glorifies violence or sex but uses them to create a fascinating story that illustrates many important life principles Tom Clancy Infantilism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Theory of conduct A Course In Miracles Extreme Programming Motion picture rating system Television rating system Joke Literature Theodicy The Lovely Bones Spidey Super Stories Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Charles Dickens Sharon Tate Evil God and gender The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Procrastination Goodness and value theory Serial killer The Shawshank Redemption Cruising (film) Arthur Machen BDSM Sexual revolution Mary Sue Deconstruction American Psycho The Godfather David Hume Discordianism Hentai Clear and Present Danger Homophobia Sexual orientation Rape The Catcher in the Rye A Series of Unfortunate Events Paul Is Dead Don Rosa Transactional analysis Steve Ditko Children's literature Species Epistemology Nihilism Horror film Rick Santorum Will Eisner Philosophical Investigations Gay Animism Friends Airport novel Motivation Milton H.
