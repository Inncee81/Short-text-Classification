harry potter plot questions has spoilers why was draco malfoy the true master of the elder wand if dumbledore actually died from the cursed ring shouldn't the elder wand have lost its power when he died why did neville longbottom have the sword of gryffindor at the end i thought the goblin had stolen it page numbers for referencing answers would be greatly appreciated thanks draco was the master because he disarmed dumbledore which is really the only thing necessary as revealed by ollivander and dumbledore didn't die because of the cursed ring he died because he got cursed off of one of the highest towers at hogwarts he was just weakened by the ring and nearing his end and there was something about him dying on his own terms im sorry i can't be more specific on that neville my hero has the sword because as stated in the nd book by dumbledore a true gryffindor can get it from the hat so i don't think it really matters where it was before because if you think like that then you really have to wonder where it was before harry pulled it out in book two and i am really sorry that i can't give you page numbers i'm not really in possesion of my book right now Magical objects in Harry Potter Lord Voldemort Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Dates in Harry Potter Diagon Alley Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Hogwarts Neville Longbottom Death Eater Ginny Weasley Harry Potter (character) Hogwarts subjects Ron Weasley Hogwarts Houses Albus Dumbledore Minor Ravenclaws Blood purity (Harry Potter) Battle of Hogwarts Dumbledore's Army Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Severus Snape Magic (Harry Potter) Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Harry Potter: Book Seven Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game) Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Rubeus Hagrid Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Hermione Granger Minor characters associated with Quidditch Minor Hufflepuffs Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Draco Malfoy Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter House-elf Hogwarts Floor Directory Wizarding world Minor members of the Order of the Phoenix Horcrux Minor Ministry officials in the Harry Potter books Rita Skeeter Sirius Black Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game) Fred and George Weasley Fawkes Cedric Diggory Minor Slytherins Tom Riddle's diary Horace Slughorn Luna Lovegood Minerva McGonagall Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film) Order of the Phoenix Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film) Bellatrix Lestrange Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game) James and Lily Potter Weasley family Portraits in Hogwarts Ministry of Magic Pansy Parkinson Cho Chang Lucius Malfoy Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film) Unbreakable Vow Nymphadora Tonks Dolores Umbridge Dobby Quidditch Harry Potter newspapers and magazines Hogwarts ghosts Harry Potter: Quidditch World Cup The Hogwarts Founders Remus Lupin Link (Legend of Zelda) Minor Hogwarts teachers Minor Harry Potter Beasts Princess Zelda Mary Sue The Slug Club Harry Potter Castle of the Winds Wizard St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries Spoiler (media) Kreacher Narcissa Malfoy Half-Blood Prince (character) Beauxbatons Dark Art Regulus Black Secret of Mana Charmed Pomona Sprout Wand
