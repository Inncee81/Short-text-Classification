where can i learn about roderick marshall author i bought an old book which he once owned his copy was dated by him and the author gertrude rachel levy roderick william marshall's best known work if it can be called that is william morris and his earthly paradises both this and the falstaff book have been kept in print by various publishing houses and can be ordered through the internet or bookshops though god knows they are not for the general reader for seven years marshall and his wife lived at kelmscott manor william morris's summer home on the thames and this is where he wrote this work other than this there is very little available on marshall's own life even his dates there is though an interesting analysis of his views on morris the link is below which gives a side on portrait at least of marshall's take on morris and through that something of his own perspective for example in marshall s view the earthly paradise was not merely a hallmark of morris s literature it reflected his deep yearning to find fellowship and love in his own life analysing morris s life through this prism he is deeply sympathetic to the desires that paradise represents nevertheless he suggests that the dream like world morris wished to create reflected a nostalgic conservatism the connection with levy is interesting and may reflect something of marshall's interests in 'alternative' theologies and cosmologies following the radical openness of morris it's not much but i hope it's useful William Morris A Course In Miracles C.
