i have a synopsis fo the book i'm writting what do you think i've try to aim the book at the ages of but i think the book sounds more mature than the synopsis i would say teh genre is fantasy sci fi and i've tried to aim it at both girls and boys let me know what you think before time began there were untimely gods they protected the earth from aliens and invaders from other planets but one of them betrayed the others he was the samurai warrior the force was broken and the other gods were hidden amongst the normal people only one can defeat the samurai warrior and stop him destroying the world and her name is syran an ordinary girl from bath will she be able to find the untimely gods before it s too late it s not as easy as she thought the book is called the untimely tale the was once told a tale about the untimely gods and there existent about a million years ago and she is curious to stop the evil reign of the samurai warrir who has been reining the world and universe for hundreds of years so she has to find the five original untimely gods the untimely gods used to protect the earth until the samurai warrior betrayed them and the earth's protective spell was broken the gods are completely helpless because when the hsamurai warrior took over he placed an enchantment on the remaining gods so they are hidden inside for humans on earth and unless someone unlocks the secret the samurai warrior will rule forever by the way i'm only going on so you've got to give me credit this has potential but your greatest risk is doing something that has been done before like a hobbie called frodo sets out on a voyge to destroy evil but if you twist it in a fresh way you could be up to something before you start writing your book its important to write a step by step guide or outline of it it gives you a star to stear by and keep you away from getting stucked writers block keep the book in the to word area there its easiest sold i guess that you know that your heros trouble should accelerate eq you start with easy problems and finnish with the major fight against the evil a question for you to answer why does it have to be your hero that kills the evil sammurai why not someone else or maybe your twist could be that a dozen different persons set out to destroy him and have equal chanses then your hero must so to say defeat her oponents to good luck and keep writing johan Kain (Legacy of Kain) Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Link (Legend of Zelda) Rifts Messiahs in fiction and fantasy The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Obi-Wan Kenobi Rayden Sub-Zero Conan the Barbarian W.I.T.C.H.
