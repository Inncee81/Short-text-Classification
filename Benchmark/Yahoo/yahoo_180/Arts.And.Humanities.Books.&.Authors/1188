what are the names of these two classic sci fi stories there are two great stories i would like to read again but i don't even know where to look i read them in high school in sci fi anthology books i don't remember titles or authors the first was about a boy who discovers he can't be taught to read instantly as is normal in this society he considers himself a failure who must go to a special school until he discovers that his aptitude is so great that he has been pulled out of the system to be one of the designers of the system he has to learn to read the old fashioned way because the process of learning which has been superceeded by hi tech instant ability methods is a privilege reserved for the elite few the second story is about a man who finds himself suddenly with a nameless voice in his head this voice accompanies him to get his haircut to his girlfriend's apartment it reveals the world to him to such a depth that he discovers he is the voice lost in his own head back at the beginning of the story any ideas damn i think i read the first one too in a story collection is it asimov's the guy is in a special institution as a child he wanted to be a computer guy or something and saw a few edu films on the subject hoping that tht would make it more likely for him to be chosen for the job in the future they give people the jobs that a computer decides they have the aptitude for and ppl can't decide what they want to become in life but the officer tells him that reading about computers hoping he would be chosen for that field is a stupid superstition like a pregnant woman listening to music so her child would be a musician the guy escapes from the facility and then eventually they recognize his potential and he finds out that his room mate in the facility was an agent to spot talent among those sent there One Tree Hill (TV series) Education Friends Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Earthsea Science fiction Milton H.
