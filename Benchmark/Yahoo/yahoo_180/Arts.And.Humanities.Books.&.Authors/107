so is tom riddle a yr virgin or what most sarcastic creative witty gets the pts i'm gonna say no voldy certainly never loved anyone and wouldn't have married and had kids although i believe that's a better way to ensure your immortality than by cutting up your own soul just create more souls a part of you lives on in your children even after you die so in a way you live forever anyway although i don't think voldy ever loved anyone i hardly think that he was a virgin first of all he was a teenager once he had hormones i find it hard to believe that in his years at hogwarts he didn't have sex at all and he was supposed to be a decent looking young man girls especially slytherin girls who liked the dark arts were probably all over him he wasn't like snape slimey and greasey voldy always presented himself well also voldy always prided himself on his ability to persuade people to do things that he wanted them to do so i think voldy could have gotten girls to have sex with him even if they really didn't want to furthermore and here's my best reason voldy always was interested in power he always wanted to be more powerful he wanted to be the most powerful wizard ever he did everything he could to become more powerful and isn't sex the iconic act of exhibiting power over another isn't that what motivates rapists it's not just the feeling of having sex it's the idea that they're forcing the other person to do it voldy always liked having control over people so i'm pretty sure he wouldn't have passed up that opportunity to exhibit his power Lord Voldemort Hogwarts subjects Blood purity (Harry Potter) Pedophilia Hogwarts EastEnders Hermione Granger Hogwarts Houses Theory of conduct Half-Blood Prince (character) Horace Slughorn Magical objects in Harry Potter Tom Riddle Ron Weasley Humphrey Bogart Dates in Harry Potter Severus Snape Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Albus Dumbledore Rubeus Hagrid Incarnations of Immortality Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix YuYu Hakusho Marilyn Monroe Human sexual behavior The Catcher in the Rye Magic (Harry Potter) The Hogwarts Founders One Tree Hill (TV series) Transsexuality Phoebe Halliwell Supergirl Polyamory Jon Secada Draco Malfoy Street-Legal Methos The Emancipation of Mimi Harry Potter (character) Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll James and Lily Potter Jean Grey Neighbours Spice Girls Mojave people Little Britain Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Summa Theologiae Soul Horcrux AFI 100 Years series Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Time Out of Mind Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Hall & Oates Kim Possible Sexual orientation Adolescence Buffy Summers Eastern Orthodox Church Motivation One Life to Live Blood on the Tracks Earth Girl Arjuna Theodicy About a Boy Friends Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game) Janet Jackson Dark Art Gay slang Pride and Prejudice Satchel Paige Obi-Wan Kenobi TLC Rape Empire Burlesque Veronica Lake Gender role Pet Sounds Paul Is Dead Sex and the City Buddy Guy Raven (comics) Dawson's Creek Charmed The Critic George Costanza Marriage Stock character Sex Death Eater Sex Pistols Remus Lupin Pitaten Episodes of Lost (Season 1)
