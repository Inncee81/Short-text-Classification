melchezadek i heard a small portion of a conversation something about morpho gentic grids sounded interesting maybe they didnt know what they were talking about id like to read more about it do you know of a few books or perhaps a website that explain more about it melchezadek according to melchezedek our planet is covered with geometrically constructed 'morpho genetic grids' these grids extend from about feet under the earth's surface to about miles above the earth arranged in geometric patterns see 'sacred geometry' each species has its own grid which supports life and connects the consciousness of its particular species before any species can come into existance or make an evolutionary step a new grid must be completed when a species becomes extinct that particular species' grid dissoves a new grid was completed in the 'christ consciousness' grid this grid will allow humans to evolve into our next version we'll develop two additional chromosomes which are really 'geometrical images' designed to resonate with our specific grid for a total or the main change will be a shift to the unity consciousness every cell in your body has its own consciousness and memory you the higher being that occupies your body make the millions of different consciousnesses in your body work together as one being how does this relate to this grid think of yourself as a cell and the grid as the higher being we will still have individual consciousness but will be united in the form of a higher being in order to work as one entity drunvalo melchizadek collective human consciousness the idea of collective human consciousness is wide spread these days and is underlying principles related to chromosomes and jungian theory some of the ideas behind this are based on the teachings of drunvalo melchizadek here's a snip of an interview with him leading edge there are three totally different kinds of humans on the earth meaning that they perceive the one reality in three different ways interpreted differently the first kind of human has a chromosome composition of they comprise a unity consciousness that does not see anything outside them as being separate from them to them there is only one energy one life one being ness that moves everywhere anything happening anywhere is within them as well they are like cells in the body they are all connected to a single consciousness that moves through all of them these are the aboriginals in australia there might be a few african tribes left like this then there is our level comprising chromosomes we are at a disharmonic level of consciousness that is used as a stepping stone from the level to the next level these two additional chromosomes change everything according to drunvalo the grid of the third level was destroyed years ago the grid was reconstructed by the hidden sects of the ascended atlantean masters a process that came to its end in in the olympic games that took place in sidney australia during the closing ceremony the whole stage came out of the ground and took the shape of a huge dodecahedron with all the different competitors from the different nations standing around it with the aboriginals as well the grid is the akashic library of this planet it also allows us to know future events and that is the reason so many channelers have appeared since Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Species Sri Aurobindo Gene Human Cell (biology) Y chromosome Evolution Ecology DNA Meme Biology Sociocultural evolution Spiritual evolution The Origin of Species Evidence of evolution Brain Color Biodiversity Cognitive science Culture Regular polytope Fermi paradox Anthroposophy Flood geology Religion Emergence Franz Boas Computer Renewable energy Solar cell Eye Race Intelligent design History of evolutionary thought Archaeology The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Senescence New Age Meiosis Borg Stone Age Macroevolution Reincarnation General relativity Earth Gaia philosophy Barbara McClintock Geographic information system Solar system Creationism Scientific method Marching band Nicolas Oresme Genetics Milton H.
