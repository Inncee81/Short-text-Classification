is the book the sun also rises by ernest hemingway a hard book to understand for a freshman i have to read and i jus wanted to noe if it was a fun book to read the sun also rises is one of those books which fit into hemingway's easy to read novels in his writing hemingway employed basically two different styles one being a highly literary and rather complex one the other being a style that uses simple composition and simple language somewhat similar to journalistic a style that newspapers and magazines use this novel was written in the latter hemingway was a journalist by the way so he knew how to write a story that everybody can easily read and understand the book is basically about a group of americans who waste their time in europe have nothing to do besides roaming the countries staying in hotels watching the bullfight like hemingway and his companions used to do in their time their lives are empty they do not have any real goal in life i found the story also simple but thought provoking although it is simple there is a deeper layer to it just like in any good book something that is not written but implied and the reader has to figure it out hemingway's work is difficult to interpret indeed it may not be obvious for you at first the message that the book is trying to drive home but i guess if you think about it and read some criticism about it you may find it a very interesting novel all in all the sun also rises is easy to undestand in superficial terms but difficult to interpret but it is definitely worth reading Ernest Hemingway John O'Hara Novel Deconstruction F.
