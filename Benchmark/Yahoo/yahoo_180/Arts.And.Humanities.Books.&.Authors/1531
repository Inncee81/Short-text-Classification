question about the book the giver what are the major theme's in the book i read it and couldn't get the themes out of it well it has been years since i've read it but it is a great book from what i remember people are born with a purpose there are people born to be 'breeders' or whatever they were called in the book the horrors of the world are forgotten so it is a controlled perfect society and the boy he is the one chosen to learn all the horrors of the world and i can't remember what was going to happen with that little baby they were going to kill it i think and he ran away with it anyway the point of the book is that even though there are horrible things in this world they have their reason you can't truly be happy if you've never felt sadness and pain what would you rather live in a perfect world with nothing that is truly real or live in reality A Course In Miracles Theodicy Theory of conduct Rich Mullins The Giver Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Hellraiser Goodness and value theory Philosophical skepticism American Psycho Fahrenheit 451 Memento (film) Scenes from a Memory All Quiet on the Western Front Leo Wyatt Jon Secada Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind House of Leaves Utilitarianism Avenue Q Out-of-body experience Necronomicon What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?
