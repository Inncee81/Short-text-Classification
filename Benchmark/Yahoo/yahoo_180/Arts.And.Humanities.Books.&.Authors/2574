any comments are your opinion about the book love story by eric seigal well i bawled my eyes out when i first read it back in the s i still think it's a real tear jerker and remember specific scenes from it of course looking at it from a practical viewpoint there are a lot of things wrong for one love means never having to say you're sorry is well ridiculous unless you take it to mean that you behave so that the other person knows you are sorry oddly enough i was thinking of a line from that book this week when jenny says oh what a falling off was there and can't remember where it comes from then says you never fell off a cliff in your life preppie and he responds sure i did when i met you don't know why that all came back to me but it did so obviously it made a lasting impression Social rule Theory of conduct Garfield One Tree Hill (TV series) Little Britain Stoicism Jon Secada Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Anne Rice Scenes from a Memory Rush Limbaugh The Catcher in the Rye Epistemology Transactional analysis Knots Landing Real Love (song) Cliff Richard Time Out of Mind Blood on the Tracks EastEnders Lucid dreaming Homer Simpson Samurai Deeper Kyo Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Capital punishment She Loves You Socrates A Course In Miracles Big Brother UK series 6 Sunset Boulevard (1950 film) Empire Burlesque Emotions (album) Saved by the Bell Running gag Piccolo Junior Saga Have I Got News For You The Inside One Life to Live Emanuel Swedenborg Storytelling All My Children Shaggy dog story I Want to Hold Your Hand Kodocha Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Plame affair Cyberspace I Am the Walrus Philosophical skepticism Negima The Contender (television series) Humphrey Bogart Paradise Lost Forrest Gump Religious Society of Friends Hey Jude Roswell UFO incident Scientology beliefs and practices The Shadows Milton H.
