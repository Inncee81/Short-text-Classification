who has read teh th harry potter if yes who was surprised that snape was a good guy i wasn't i didn't expect dumbledore to ask snape to kill him but i knew there was a reason for it i figured he was a good guy i think that when dumbledore said please before he died he was really asking snape to go through with the plan i knew dumbledore had asked snape to kill him because hagrid had mentioned to harry about hearing the two argue one day and it was revealed in the pensieve that dumbledore's plan was actually part of the reason why they were i had no idea that dumbledore was about to die anyway but i thought snape would be an important character to keep alive since he's basically spying on voldie plus dumbledore was an incredibly brilliant wizard i guess jkr was just trying to throw us off with the whole 'wise men make the biggest mistakes' logic i wasn't expecting snape to be in love with lily i had heard the theory before and shivered at the thought but then when the book actually came out and i read it i thought it was so sweet it was a tragic love story that made me cry the most when reading the book Severus Snape Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Albus Dumbledore Magical objects in Harry Potter Harry Potter (character) Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Rubeus Hagrid Order of the Phoenix Horace Slughorn Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Sirius Black Dates in Harry Potter Hogwarts subjects Harry Potter: Book Seven Death Eater Hogwarts Houses Remus Lupin Ron Weasley Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Hermione Granger Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter Blood purity (Harry Potter) Half-Blood Prince (character) Hogwarts Professor Quirrell Tom Riddle's diary Minor Hufflepuffs Magic (Harry Potter) R.A.B.
