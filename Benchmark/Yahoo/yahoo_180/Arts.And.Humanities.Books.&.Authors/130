do you think that fiction is a valid source for knowledge i think it depends on what you mean if you are referring to assertions that a work of fiction uses to help set up a good plot or something da vinci code style or even thousand splendid suns or portrait of an artist no that is not valid some works of fiction e g state of fear offer footnotes if you want to 'learn' from the book you should check those footnotes which ought to be valid sources that are scholarly works but don't trust the work of fiction on the other hand if you are looking to study the way people interact or how they go about their daily lives or even how biases work i would say that fiction can sometimes be a better source than non fiction although less citeable the reason i think this is because fiction has to sell itself on a different level than non fiction does non fiction gains believability based on the repute and education of the author and of his sources fiction gains believability by portraying people and lives in a way that is consistent with what the readers know occurs from personal experience if the readers knew that people in a book are behaving in a way that is not defended by everyday experience they would set down the book because they wouldn't be able to connect to it by contrast people may dismiss such flaws or be more receptive to an incomplete portrait of a character in non fiction because they know that truth is stranger than fiction i think i'm stumbling over my words here so i'm going to hope to do better with an example for these observations about characters to be valid a large number of people have to buy into the novel so i'll try to use harry potter to support what i am saying the premise of these books are that a large wizarding society exists in secret throughout the world and that their is a notable society of wizards in england it also goes on to describe various magical plants and creatures that seem to exist without muggles ever noticing them obviously this premise is false and should not be used to support knowledge most books have more believable premises than these ones but they are still no more valid than these however there are things that would destroy the books if they weren't believable i will just use examples from the second and fourth books in the second book one of these elements is that fred and george seem to find pleasure in the chaos unfolding around them for at least a while as they torment their little sister with this knowledge etc if readers didn't know that their were people who behaved like this they wouldn't buy into these characters and be able to laugh with them and sympathize with them for the rest of the series once again in the forth books there are people desperate enough to attempt foolish things at the risk of injury to try to prove themselves like fred and george also harry's guilt after winning and not wanting the money is believable because it is consistent with trauma this is not schoarly research but if you want to defend your belief of a certain idea to yourself seeing whether or not a character who behaves in a way consistent with that idea is believable can be a good guide Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Religion Epistemology Presuppositional apologetics Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Harry Potter Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Theodicy Blood purity (Harry Potter) J.
