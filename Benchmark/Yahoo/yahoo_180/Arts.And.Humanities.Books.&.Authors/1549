in what order should the hannibal lecter series be read i know the order in which thomas harris wrote published them red dragon silence of the lambs hannibal hannibal rising but should they be read in that order or in chronological order putting hannibal rising first i have seen all of the movies but have just recently purchased the novels and am ready to begin reading i've read all in the series and i read them red dragon silence of the lambs hannibal and then hannibal rising the first but expecially hannibal gives you little insigths into lecters past and hannibal rising is all about lecters childhood so i would recommend reading them in that order this is also the order they were published in so it would also make sense to read them in this order that way the plot is a lot more gripping i particuarlly enjoyed them myself i hope you do too Hannibal Lecter The Silence of the Lambs Red Dragon Anthony Hopkins Manhunter (film) Hannibal (film) Clarice Starling Buffalo Bill (The Silence of the Lambs) Supervillain AFI 100 Years series Prequel Brian Cox The Foundation Series Cannibalism Mason Verger Psychiatric hospital Francis Dolarhyde Monomyth Serial killer Timeline of fictional historical events Legacy of Kain Dolores Umbridge Antisocial personality disorder Hannibal Jaundice Yellow journalism Novel Tom Clancy Pazzi Ancient history Grendel (comics) Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Double Dragon Ted Bundy Damn Yankees Care Bears Vicia faba Thriller Crime Story (TV series) Minor Harry Potter Beasts Thomas Pynchon Harry Potter Will Graham Canon (fiction) The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Sonic the Hedgehog Fighting Fantasy Game Books Dragonriders of Pern Resident Evil Hannibal Hamlin Arnold J.
