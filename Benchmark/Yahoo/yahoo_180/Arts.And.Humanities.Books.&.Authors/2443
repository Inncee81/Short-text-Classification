does this sound like a good story or does it sound boring and cliched yes i need you to be brutally honest because i want to be able to write a really good story or if this story is worthy of publishing sooo there's this girl who lives a normal life until she auditions for a musical in her school she sings exceptionally well that she becomes a famous singer by accident somehow however she never wanted to become famous in the first place the only reason she got what she didn't want is because someone placed a curse on her someone who knew her past and knew what she always hated so what this girl has to do to remove this curse some stuff i'll think of that later well okay what she has to do to remove this curse is to travel to a far away place and solve some mysteries sooo what do you think i know it's kind of weird but please if it sounds boring and uninspirational please say so thanks it was an accident that she became famous because she never wanted to be in real life everyone has some control over whether they want to be famous or not here she was more like forced to be famous somehow i'll think of that more also does it sound like any other story you've heard of before i don't wanna be plagarizing or anything like that oh i really don't know yet who it would be directed towards lol i know this story sucks i edited a lot more i'm not trying to be mean at all so i don't want you to take offense it sounds like you have a great imagination and could really write a great book however this does not sound like one of them perhaps with some major plot changes and making the character a little bit more interesting it could be a good story but don't worry you're not the first one to go through this for me i went through dozens of stories that sounded good at first but after a while i realized they just weren't good enough it took quite a while before i finally thought of a story that sounded good enough to write and it took several years after that to come up with the full storyline i wish you the best of luck with your writing and i know you'll do well Shaggy dog story The Emancipation of Mimi Jon Secada Avenue Q Highway 61 Revisited Kim Possible Street-Legal W.I.T.C.H.
