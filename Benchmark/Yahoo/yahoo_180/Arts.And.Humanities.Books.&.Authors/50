what are some socratic seminar questions i could ask on the book the awakening for example i need a world connection question close ended question open ended question and a universal theme core question the book is by kate chopin i'm not sure what a socratic seminar question is exactly but from the brief description of what kinds of questions you're looking for what about something along the lines of how did the protagonist's desire to be independent foreshadow the feminist movement or a question about edna's death at the end a suicide or a realization that she will never be free and happy as a woman in society did she drown herself in an attempt to gain control of her own path perhaps a question about the significance of the title was the awakening edna's decision at the end or could it be a message from the author by reading this book which was written before the feminist movement will there be an awakening by the rest of society will they see the desperation of being a female in a male dominant society i don't know if any of that helps but maybe it will give you something to work off of to create your own questions Phaedo Jiddu Krishnamurti Plato Deconstruction Fight Club Feminism Chuck Palahniuk Andrea Dworkin Anthroposophy Suicide Ancient Greek literature A Course In Miracles Fr__d__ric Chopin Philosophy of language New Testament David Hume Power (sociology) Book of Mormon Trial of Socrates Milton H.
