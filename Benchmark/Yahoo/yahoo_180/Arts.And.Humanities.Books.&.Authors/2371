when will marking questions as harry potter spoilers end i was just wondering when everyone thought an appropriate time frame for marking things as harry potter spoilers would end a month a couple months a year when's an appropriate time to make sure that everyone has had an equal chance to read the book people ask questions about the earlier books and don't mark them as spoilers so how long for deathly hallows i do agree that there should be an entirely harry potter section in yahoo answers it really would free up space and that way those of us that are looking for certain information could find it easier as well as it might stop people from asking the same harry potter questions over and over until people learn to read faster it's unbelieveable to me that people aren't done yet and if they're not done they shouldn't be any where near the computer Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone J.
