writers lawyers infringement or not say i'm writing a short story are there any legal issues if the story is published about having a character go to burger king for example instead of the local burger joint i'm not talking about deliberate product placement just random referencing of brands products slogans for example and not to harm either if what's his face can make supersize me i feel a little better about it but i've always wondered would i have to obtain permission somehow if so how easy or hard is that no not trying to promote any company just used it as an example i think with a big company like burger king it would be all right a possible exception would be if say you had a series of apparent deaths by poisoning which later turned out to be the natural result of eating the food at burger king they could then sue you for defamation of character or libel but if it is only mentioned in passing i'd think they would consider it free advertising a few concerns however are very fussy your publisher would be the one whose business it would be to see that such names were edited out i'm taking it for granted you're in the us in great britain they are much stricter for example in the old kinks song 'lola' when the american lyrics say 'coca cola' the british version says 'cherry cola' the laws may have changed some but they're still much stricter then us copyright law Burger King McDonald's Fair use Coca-Cola Copyright Freedom of speech Trademark Public domain Intellectual property UK Singles Chart Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Hamburger Fan fiction Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Pharmaceutical company Logo The Kinks First Amendment to the United States Constitution Supreme Court of the United States Corporation Advertising GNU General Public License Software patent debate Plame affair Digital rights management SCO-Linux controversies Copyright infringement of software Tobacco advertising Prior restraint Spyware McLibel case Tort George Galloway Software patent Bernice Summerfield Sony Corp. of America v.
