is my cat pregnant hi my cat had six kittens about weeks ago she was fine up until know but know if i touch her belly she always looks at me and is always licking her private parts and she hasnt went to the toilet either she is always meowing aswell and i dont know about the teets because she has had kittens already this was not meant to happen she got out whilst i was on holiday my nan was looking after her and she got out so thats why mayby b ut could you tell me some other signs to look out for thanks sorry i was looking at something on the arts and humanities and i pressed the ask button wrote my question and forgot to put it on the pets sorry ummm it wasn't me you may want to take her to the vet just to make sure there were no complications from the previous delivery the vet will be glad to tell you what the situation is there could be something that wasn't quite expelled or it might just be the normal cleaning out process which sometimes takes longer than you might think anything is possible however and it would be best to know so you can make plans you may want to talk to the vet about sterilization as well your cat will be a bit more prone towards staying around the house which may be healthier in the long run Cat Socialization Garfield Manx (cat) Guinea pig Pregnancy EastEnders Fancy rat Pet skunk Rabies Pitaten Big Brother UK series 5 Toilet humour She Loves You Friends The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Veterinarian Blood on the Tracks Kitten Cats (musical) Dilbert Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Social rule Tooth enamel Puma Dog Lion Girly Poker jargon Feral cat Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Xiaolin Showdown Phoebe Buffay's songs Azumanga Daioh Shaggy dog story Tick Big Brother (USA TV series) Goatse.cx Chocolate Animal communication B3ta Breastfeeding Hygiene 2000 Australian Grand Prix Atomic Kitten Hey Jude Domestication Milton H.
