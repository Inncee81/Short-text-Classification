question about hp the deathly hallows if you haven't finished the book i suggest you don't read my question at the end of the book why doesn't snape's picture appear in the office dumbledore's showed up right away in book and in the epilouge who's child was victorie j k rowling answers a similar question laura trego was the absence of snape's portrait in the headmaster's office in the last scene innocent or deliberate j k rowling it was deliberate snape had effectively abandoned his post before dying so he had not merited inclusion in these august circles however i like to think that harry would be instrumental in ensuring that snape s portrait would appear there in due course because snape had in mcgonagall's words done a bunk pretty much quitting his job his portrait did not appear right away it might have been rather awkward for harry anyway her name is spelled victoire it's french for victory which refers to the defeat of voldemort the french name is a clear hint she is bill and fleur's daughter this is further proved by james calling her his cousin ginny and bill are siblings our teddy teddy lupin snogging our victoire our cousin and i asked teddy what he was doing you interrupted them said ginny you are so like ron harry potter and the deathly hallows page jo confirmed this in an interview rowling said her original epilogue was a lot more detailed including the name of every child born to the weasley clan in the past years victoire who was snogging teddy lupin and tonks son is bill and fleur s eldest Dates in Harry Potter Hermione Granger Severus Snape Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Harry Potter: Book Seven Hogwarts subjects Harry Potter (character) Hogwarts Ron Weasley Battle of Hogwarts Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Blood purity (Harry Potter) Order of the Phoenix Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Magical objects in Harry Potter Albus Dumbledore Lord Voldemort Minor Ravenclaws Hogwarts Houses Weasley family Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Magic (Harry Potter) Sybill Trelawney Remus Lupin Death Eater Peter Pettigrew James and Lily Potter Minor Hufflepuffs Draco Malfoy Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Ministry of Magic Sirius Black Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game) Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film) Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Horace Slughorn Lucius Malfoy Fred and George Weasley Fleur Delacour Hogwarts Floor Directory Minor Harry Potter Beasts Cho Chang Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game) J.
