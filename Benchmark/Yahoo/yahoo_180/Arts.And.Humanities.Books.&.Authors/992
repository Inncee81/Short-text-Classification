do you think jkr's writing has increased in it's difficulty with each book ie more aimed at adults now i've seen all the films and have read no and i've just started the philospher's stone which seems much more babyish and aimed primarily for kids as she originally intended compared to the later books if my yo picked up one of her later books i know he'd put it down because he just wouldn't understand it there was a definite increase in difficulty and i just wondered do you think it was intentional on her part as her readers grew up with hp and thus her language changed weegangsta i do enjoy the books for what they are thank you but that has nothing to do with my q and actually you are quite wrong i work with kids and a child will not necessarily ask if they do not understand a word and if that one word becomes words then suddenly the whole comprehension of the story is lost to them what i'm saying is that now that kids do not have to wait for the next hp book to be published i believe they would struggle to finish the series i agree with your assessment of jkr's writing style i think she wrote in a more grown up fashion because she wanted to show that the main characters were growing up as well as the fans who were reading the books i thought this final book had too many deaths in it for very young kids especially the deaths of some of the beloved characters furthermore the plot was more complexed and quite frankly it needed to be fine tuned a tad bit more the mere fact that she's going around doing interviews to explain points in the final book says a lot about the writing of this final installment Novel J.
