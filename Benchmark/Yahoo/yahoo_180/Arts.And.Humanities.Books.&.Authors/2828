harry's lightning scar spoilers ok everyone whos read hp i have a few logistical questions here how come harry's scar has disappeared during the kings cross scene but years later he has the scar again and touches it seeing as dumbledore is ashamed about his fixation on the deathly hallows how come he willed the snitch deluminator and book to the kids when harry survives voldemort after thinking he'd die is it due to lily's enchantment all those years ago or simply due to his own bravery harry never actually became the master of death so it must have been something else that helped him survive the king's cross scene was all in harry's head whatever happened in there stayed there kinda like vegas dumbledore wasn't ashamed of his interests in the hallows but rather the methods he used to pursue that interest he gave harry ron and heirmoine the clues to the hallows but didn't tell them about them because he wanted them to mature to the point that they would use them properly a point that it seemed only harry really reached as demonstrated by ron's ideas about getting rid of the wand at the end harry survived the curse because voldemort was still alive when voldy had used harry's blood as the catalyst for reforming his body he transfered some of harry's protective spell into himself since harry would still be protected by that spell as long as it lived on as it did in voldemort the curse voldemort used snuffed out the only unprotected part of harry's life which just so happened to be the piece of voldemort's soul that harry carried inside hope i helped Lord Voldemort Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Harry Potter (character) Magical objects in Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Death Eater Sirius Black Dates in Harry Potter Hogwarts subjects Albus Dumbledore Hogwarts Severus Snape Harry Potter: Book Seven Magic (Harry Potter) Ron Weasley Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Battle of Hogwarts Rubeus Hagrid Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone James and Lily Potter Blood purity (Harry Potter) Horace Slughorn Minor Ministry officials in the Harry Potter books Order of the Phoenix Ginny Weasley Horcrux Ministry of Magic R.A.B.
