when you read a novel which do you value more the storyline or the writing style while i sometimes enjoy reading i must say that fiction books always disappoint me so far i have just read one fiction novel that i liked it was an historical novel that gave an amazing picture of seville during the age of discovery all other fiction books i have read were a waste from my point of view yes they were amost all well written but that was all about them the storyline was very poor and when i finished reading the books i sensed like i had walked a very long way for nothing there was nothing at the end or even in the middle for this reason i like to read non fiction at least those stories happened in real life and often they change my perception of reality so i would like to ask you which do you value more when you read a novel the storyline or the writing style and is this the point in literature is the storyline irrelevant and what matters is how the book is written for me storyline is tantamount then the writing style in most literary fiction it is the opposite u r meant to focus on the author's style as opposed to the thinly woven plotline the reason to me most commercial fiction has neither a decent plotline nor a workable style is laziness and ignorance nowadays with overworked editors and the advent of self publishing any fool can write a book whether or not the person is functionally literate or not u r left w drivel plain and simple that's why so many of our fellow readers on this forum keep asking for decent books to read Science fiction Mathematics Fictional character Literature Narrator Jacob Neusner Anne Rice Frank Herbert Deconstruction Daredevil Tl__n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius Children's literature The Skeptical Environmentalist Narrative Ye Shengtao C.
