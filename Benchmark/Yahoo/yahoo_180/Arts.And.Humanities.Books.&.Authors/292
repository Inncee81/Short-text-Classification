what message is conveyed through hills like white elephants after reading ernest hemingway's short story hills like white elephants i'm wondering what message is hemingway trying to get through to the readers of this story i am not convinced that hemingway is trying to get across an ideological message in this story he seems ready for the audience to make their own judgements about the characters and the situation if anything i think his message is that every moment is significant and fraught with meaning and weight this is a moment caught in time between two significant events most stories would deal with the abortion or with the love affair hemingway deals with the snapshot of time between them he captures it and preserves it and holds it up as worthy of attention despite the fact that it is not a climatic or active moment in so doing he focuses attention on the way we live our daily lives and the importance of the moment one might say he is encouraging mindfulness For Whom the Bell Tolls Storytelling Short story Advertising Narrator Soap opera Minimalism The Garden of Eden The Old Man and the Sea F.
