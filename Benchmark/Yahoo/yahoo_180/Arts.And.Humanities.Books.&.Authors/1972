getting writings published as anyone who has been to my site knows i am a prolific writer some of it it very good actually my question is how does one go about getting published i know not to send anything unsolicited and it's kind of difficult for me being in iraq right now since i can't just pick up a phone and call someone but i know you need an agent so how do you know which are the good ones and which are the scammers points plus an autographed copy of my first book to the best answerer first you need to get a list to work from there are many lists on the internet most are free look for an agent and you can also send to publishers that take unagented work that deals with your genre check their submission requirements and procede as they instruct part of their test to see if an author is willing to follow their rules and edits is to see if you can follow their submissions instructions i will caution that if you get a lot of rejections don't be discouraged but it could be a sign that your work needs more polishing and if you've put work on an internet site of any kind it is consider published and you can only sell it as a reprint speaking of short stories and articles which don't need an agent as a matter of fact an agent won't consider selling short stories or articles you're on your own again check all the submission guidelines and comply to them http www anotherealm com prededitors gives you a list of agents and editors with comments from others http writingcorner com publishers publishers htm epublishers http www duotrope com free listings http ralan com home htm another free listing http writersmarket com not a free market HyperText Transfer Protocol Publishing E-mail spam Academic publishing Advance fee fraud Plame affair timeline Fan fiction Plame affair HTML Chuck Palahniuk Open Directory Project Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Spam (electronic) Mail-order bride Web crawler HTTP cookie Domain Name System World Wide Web Ajax (programming) Harlan Ellison Public domain Website Theory of conduct H2G2 Fair use Biblical inerrancy Session Initiation Protocol CPU cache Crime fiction Screenplay Wget Legal research MapleStory Autograph Slashdot subculture Newspaper Contract Crossword Anne Rice Deconstruction Novel Erotic literature Telephone numbering plan Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Oxford English Dictionary The Internet Movie Database XHTML Style guide Software patent debate Warez Internet fraud WebDAV MSN Messenger Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Internet Speculative Fiction Database Copyright Uniform Resource Locator UK Singles Chart Freedom of speech GNU Free Documentation License Terry Pratchett Nuclear proliferation Wikipedia Microeconomics Orson Scott Card Encyclopedia Probation officer Slashdot trolling phenomena Frank Herbert Garth Brooks Poker jargon XRI Wireless Application Protocol J.
