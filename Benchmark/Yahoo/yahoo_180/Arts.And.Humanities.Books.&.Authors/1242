what do you think of this cassandra lay awake listening to the rain pounding down on the roof she had been trying to go to sleep for four hours but found herself unable to drift off whenever she closed her eyes her mind was racing with half formed thoughts that hid in the shadowy recesses of her brain unwilling to come to light glancing at the red led display of the clock on her bedside table cassandra could see that it was already two o clock in the morning sighing she decided that it was pointless to even try to get to sleep even if she somehow managed it she would only have a few hours of sleep before she had to leave to go to her morning classes at the university cassandra pulled away the blankets and got out of bed every muscle in her body protesting the decision aching from hours of tossing and turning as she had tried to get to sleep after rubbing what little sleep there was from her eyes she walked across her bedroom to the living room door this is the first part of a science fiction horror story that i'm writing i'm wondering if my writing style is alright or if i should change it a little judas rabbi bite me major quibble over use of unnecessary infinitives which you can detect by your repetitive use of to she had been trying to go to sleep for four hours how about trying to fall asleep i'm sure you can find the others yourself think about how many times you say to when you read this i couldn't help but notice major quibble cassandra cassandra cassandra we know her name after the first sentence small quibble sighing she decided that it was pointless to even try to get to sleep the wording of this sentence is awkward particularly the way even is used split infinitive and then the same word used better hits me again in the next sentence also the repetitive to at the end of the sentence a simple rewrite of this sentence is needed small quibble cassandra sleep this sentence just seems too long run on unless you are intentionally using the length of the sentence to instill the feeling of monotony which technique would be better found in an earlier sentence i would divide the sentence into two after got out of bed this is also the rd use of some form of to go to sleep i know i've been pretty critical but i hope you find the criticism constructive the content of the story is fine it's just the grammar mechanics that give me some slight pause jim http www life after harry potter com Out-of-body experience Shaggy dog story Sin City The Shining (film) Milton H.
