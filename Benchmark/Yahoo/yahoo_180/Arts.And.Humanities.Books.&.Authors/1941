eclipse by stephenie meyer i was sooo dissappointed when i read eclipse bella wanting edward so badly well she is only human but she is still more than that to me at least i felt sorry for edward when she was begging him the whole thing with jacob didn't really bother me at all even though i've been sort of anti jacob all along i guess that it took sooo much purity out of bella and edward's relationship when she talked about wanting him sooo badly enough to bribe him that she'd get married to him which is technically a double bribe that he'll turn her into a vampire anyway about the purity of their relationship in this book they'd been together for about years correct well that entire time they were content and loved each other like crazy and never needed the physical aspect the kissing was fine it didn't bother me i thought it was very romantic but idk what do you think about the story on a scale of being best i'd sadly give it a i wanted so bad for it to be better i'll still faithfully preorder the fourth book breaking dawn and await it anxiously even after my dissappointment ya i'd say a stephenie meyer is focusing on bella and jacob's relationship way to much this story is supposed to be about bella and edward not jacob i think stephenie meyer wants bella and jacob to be together and if they do then that would ruin the whole story i don't think that bella loves edward that much anymore no one wants jacob and bella to be together eclipse was very messed up One Tree Hill (TV series) Glen Jacobs Survivor: Palau Avenue Q Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) EastEnders The Amber Spyglass Knots Landing Garfield Jon Secada Humphrey Bogart Shaggy dog story The Sims 2 Jacob Hey Jude K' Negima Marilyn Monroe The Good Soldier The Ashlee Simpson Show Mina Mongoose Kodocha Sharon Tate Dawson's Creek Book of Isaiah Russian joke Jennifer Lopez Charmed Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Anne Boleyn Time Out of Mind Doctor Who (Enemy Within) Gambit (comics) The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Friends The Apprentice 2 Resurrection of Jesus One Life to Live The Smoking Room Badly Drawn Kitties Social rule The Marriage of Figaro Code: Lyoko Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Jacob Pavlovitch Adler Tris Speaker AVN Awards The Catcher in the Rye Anne Rice Fancy Crane Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Tony Award for Best Musical A Course In Miracles Theodicy The Death Gate Cycle Descendants of Darkness Edward Gibbon Wakefield Indianapolis 500 Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind God Emperor of Dune Love and Theft Alanis Morissette Calvin and Hobbes Philosophical skepticism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Tom Cruise Buffy Summers Anti-Mormonism Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Another World (TV series) Will & Grace Bat Lash Blood on the Tracks Milton H.
