harry potter reading harry potter and trying my best not to read the last page how do i ensure i don't read the last page before im done my book its from the library so i can't rip it sticky notes it is first of all you shouldn't really be online until your done anyone could spoil it for you but a good way to not read it is to know that j k rowling will loathe you this quote is her own the author seemed more bothered by readers who peek at the ending first i loathe people who say 'i always read the ending of the book first ' that really irritates me she said it's like someone coming to dinner just opening the fridge and eating pudding while you're standing there still working on the starter it's not on J.
