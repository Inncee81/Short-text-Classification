how can i look up my library card barcode number online i can't find my card right now but i want to check whether i've got any books still due to be returned and want to do that from the comfort of my home computer since the library is miles from here web services or ideas that could help anyone you're going to have to call your library to get your barcode then you can go to the library's website and it should have an option to log into your account but if you call to get your barcode you might as well ask about your books instead of wasting the time to get online also if your library has a strict privacy policy they may not give the barcode to you over the phone my suggestion would be to just call them and ask them to check your account for overdue books RFID Barcode ISBN Enterprise content management Windows XP Gmail MSN Messenger Data retention Librarian E-mail spam America Online Surveillance Machine vision Book Identity theft Open access Library reference desk Interlibrary loan Password CueCat CompuServe Online shop Legal research E-mail Japanese mobile phone culture Library catalog Internet fraud Universal Product Code EGovernment SmartRider Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Google GSM services Spam (electronic) Neopets Telephone tapping Automated identification and data capture Library (computer science) Library of Congress Steam (content delivery) United States Postal Service British national identity card Telephone booth Octopus card ZIP Code DNA barcoding Website Bodleian Library Password cracking Exception handling World Wide Web Prolog Associative array Secure Digital card Public transport Java programming language Bluetooth HTTP cookie Slide rule Loyalty program CompactFlash Public-key cryptography Windows 2000 Web crawler Mach kernel LiveJournal Game programming Scrip Betting (poker) Internet Barcode reader AOL Instant Messenger Privacy Orson Scott Card Internet privacy Poker jargon Pseudonymity Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Voice over IP MDAC OpenBSD Video poker Optical character recognition IP Multimedia Subsystem Anonymity Stopping e-mail abuse Python programming language Academic publishing System/36 Skype Mapua Institute of Technology Linux Phishing Library Hong Kong Central Library Peripheral Objective-C MapleStory Grid computing Virgin Mobile
