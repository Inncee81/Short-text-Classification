harry potter question ok in book almost at the end why dumbledore told harry that he is a half bloof just like voldemort i mean lily and james are both wizards they were at hogwarts so he must be a pure blood some examples ron weasley pure blood neville pure blood harry pure blood or half bood voldemort half blood his dad is a muggle tom ryddle hermione mudblood their parents are both muggles so is harry pure blood or half blood thank you and good day wow this is unbelievable some people say harry is pure blood and some other people say harry is half blood im really confused dumbledore said in book that harry is half blood thats why voldemort picked him as his worst enemy instead of neville cause he is a pure blood and voldemort is a half blood ann lily is not a muggle she went to hogwarts just wizards can be at hogwarts this is a very good question with an extremely complicated answer in short i would say it depends on who you ask and by that i mean in the wizarding world technically there is no such thing as a pureblood hagrid says at some point that no one is really more than half and that the term mudblood is silly and mean spirited however people like voldemort and the other pureblood lovers considered themselves purebloods even though they weren't voldemort was truly a half blood but as you said both harry's parents are wizards it was convenient for the death eaters to overlook voldemort's and snape's ancestries if they knew them but for harry the enemy it was better to call him half blood without using any other fractions of blood i'd therefore say it is best broken down as being two magical parents pure blood one magical parent half blood no magical parents muggle born or mudblood however as you pointed out in your question it is inconsistent and the reason is that the blood status is based on hate of muggles and is manipulated for hateful reasons it isn't based on fact also j k rowling said on july th that muggle borns were the decendents of squibs and didn't know it so they technically had wizard blood somewhere on their family tree Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film) Order of the Phoenix Hogwarts Houses Draco Malfoy Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Weasley family Neville Longbottom Minor Hufflepuffs Minor members of the Order of the Phoenix Ministry of Magic Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film) Peter Pettigrew Minor Harry Potter Beasts Rita Skeeter Sybill Trelawney Harry Potter newspapers and magazines Dumbledore's Army Wizarding world Half-Blood Prince (character) Minor Ministry officials in the Harry Potter books Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game) Remus Lupin Luna Lovegood Minor Slytherins Dursley family Lucius Malfoy R.A.B.
