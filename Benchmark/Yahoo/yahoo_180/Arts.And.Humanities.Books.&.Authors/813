when i was younger all fairy stories seemed to include a frugal princess anyone else remember this and why was her skill with all things monetary so important she was a princess just raise a few taxes that'll pay for your royal balls i did a study of fairy stories across the world for one of my special papers at college many years ago the opies are the absolute experts on this topic not all fairy stories included a frugal princess many have no princesses at all let alone a frugal one those that did also had nasty or snobby or lazy princesses too the whole point in fairy stories is that they evolved from folklore and go back a very long way to times when living conditions were harsh and difficult so all these beautiful industrious talented and well off princesses were imbued with all sorts of qualities which made them role models for children those that did not were as a rule punished by the fairies or made to reform through unpleasant experiences to the ordinary people who lived in huts or miserable dwellings parsimony and frugality were essential rules for survival so what better way to drive the lesson home than to describe princesses who were superior beings and with whom children had no contact as having all the intellectual moral and practical attributes which supposedly made them what they were in fact they were idealised creatures with no more substance than elves or bogeymen Fairy tale Fairy Elf Toad Patrol Immortality Mythology God Human Ethics Scrapped Princess Andrew Lang The nature of God in Western theology The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time characters Determinism Sleeping Beauty Inflation Abortion debate Economic inequality The Legend of Zelda series races Han Dynasty Capital accumulation Troll Narcissism Trinity Changeling: The Dreaming Al-Ghazali Soul The Fairly OddParents Witches (Discworld) Ontology (computer science) Spanking Theory of conduct Abduction Phenomenon David Hume Billiards Supernatural Races in the Warcraft universe Economy of Russia Socrates Storytelling Simone Weil Victor Cousin Theodicy Quest for Glory Law of value Sociocultural evolution Sexual orientation Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Education in the People's Republic of China Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Microeconomics Anti-intellectualism Incest British Royal Family Education in the United States Coercion Martial art Dwarf Philosophical skepticism Insurance Economics Religion Industrial Revolution Rifts Princess Zelda The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Dark elf Winx Club Capitalism Link (Legend of Zelda) Tamriel Infantilism Undead (Discworld) Arthur Cayley Postmodernism Human nature Magic (Harry Potter) The Water-Babies, A Fairy Tale for a Land Baby Jade Emperor Fantasy subgenres Folk music Ayyavazhi mythology Discworld Zoophilia Democracy Consciousness Primitive accumulation of capital Golf Elves (Discworld) Changeling Culture The Hobbit Poverty American Dragon: Jake Long Love Hina main characters Free trade Minor Harry Potter Beasts Rayman Summa Theologiae Occam's Razor
