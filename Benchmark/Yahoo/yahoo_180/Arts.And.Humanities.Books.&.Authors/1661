i want to write a story on fanfiction net but i don't exactly get how too i am a good writer but i'm scared people will think i'm bad but my friends say i'm really good please someone help me like maybe a really good writer on fanfiction net well i haven't posted a story on there in a long time so i don't exactly remember how but i know it made it a lot easier for me to type out my story on wordpad not microsoft word for some reason maybe that was just some computer error on my part but i think the file had to end in doc or something and when you type on wordpad the saved file ends in doc so after you type out a story and save it go to fanfiction net log into your account or register if you don't have one and then follow the steps to put your story up a tip to writing well is to read often read everything from old classics to new stuff write a lot to expand your vocabulary so you sound educated in your writing because on ff net there's nothing more annoying than reading a fanfic written by an author who has no idea how to write or use basic grammar lastly don't second guess yourself if you believe you are a good writer that should be enough if your friends back you up then that's even better you have nothing to lose if people think you are bad then take their constructive criticism and don't take it personally they're entitled to their opinions and it shouldn't matter to you whether they think you're bad or not just try it out and hope for the best good luck Theory of conduct Fan fiction FanFiction.Net Forth programming language Real person fiction Visual Basic Password Compiler Rich Mullins BASIC programming language Esperanto as an international language Anne Rice Computer virus Logo programming language Deconstruction Thread (computer science) Newline Time Out of Mind Volleyball Microsoft Unicode Non-native pronunciations of English Scrooge McDuck Public domain Debugging Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Singlish Ranma __ characters British national identity card English grammar Perl ALGOL 68 Theodicy Slash fiction American and British English differences Legal research Little Britain Shit Chinglish Bad Wolf Windows 2000 Domain Name System I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers Trigun The Apprentice 2 Objective-C Marty McFly Commodore DOS Screenwriting Internet troll Gmail Comment Scenes from a Memory Expanded Universe (Star Wars) Computer Crime fiction Baroque chess PaX XML Korean language Quantum computer Redundant array of independent disks Chinese character Hungarian language Literature Stardock Slashdot subculture Notepad Ra (board game) Socrates Passphrase Sesotho language Esperanto orthography Mary Sue Back to the Future Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?
