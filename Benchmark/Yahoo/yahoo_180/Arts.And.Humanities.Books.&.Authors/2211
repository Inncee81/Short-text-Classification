what does it feel like to be in a car accident just explain your experiences i'm writing a story and never been in a car accident before but in the story there is a car crash so please if you could just jot the things you remember or don't remember and then everyone will be happy and healthy been in two here's the scoop out of body sensation best described feeling like a viewer of those discovery channel slow motion absolutely silent video segments of disasters it's happening but it feels like it's not happening to you mounting excitement tension akin to the sort of sweat you get into when watching the cliffhanging moments of a movie you can't get hit won't get hit it's impossible right the other car comes closer you can see their faces the hands gripping the steering wheel and even then you hope bang you're jerked forward the seat belt digs into your flesh then you slam back again as the car slides to a halt first thing you do you check for injuries luckily i escaped both crashes utterly unscathed as did the driver and the other three fellow passengers then you try to get out of the car nothing on your mind utter blankness mental void except for the one thought get out of this thing you climb out hopefully through a car door but you can't be picky and realize how horrible the damage to the cars was in both cases the car i was in was completely mangled tangled metal fit for nothing but the scrap heap then you get down to the mundane matters the police come they start questioning the driver starts digging for his license that's when you notice the bystanders gaping at you i'll skip the rest not worth talking about just glad that i'm alive and healthy to talk about it thank god and i mean that from the bottom of my heart a helpful note life doesn't flash before one's eyes the closest i came to that was wondering when if at all my life would start flashing before my eyes it never did which did much to erode my faith in novels Shaggy dog story Sin City Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Amber Spyglass Theory of conduct Ayrton Senna Airbag Indianapolis 500 Milton H.
