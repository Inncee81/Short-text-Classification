what did you think of the eclipse were you disappointed with bella like me well i always thought of bella as being really innocent and that disappointed me that she kept insisting that edward and her sleep together well i liked the book overall but the ending confused me was jacob the new narrator well i hope that i can find someone that relates with my question thanx for listening yeah i didnt like her forcing herself on edward she knows he has control issues so why bother i think the point of the jacob thing was so we could feel his pain and realize just how much he loves her Jon Secada Avenue Q Knots Landing Fight Club Book of Isaiah A Course In Miracles Karen Horney Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Scenes from a Memory Edward J.
