the catcher in the rye i read the book because it is a classic and i wanted to know what all the fuss was about i don't understand it i just thought it was a story of the boy that ended really weird can someone help me out it's hard to follow this book because it's told from the st person and the guy telling it holden is disjointed and tends to exaggerate if you really want to know what's going on you have to go back and sort out what really happens and then you can appreciate holden's take on it here is the basic timeline the story is told in the summer after the events the events take place over days close to christmas break at the start of the book holden is being told he has flunked out of his preppy boarding school holden is a bored rich kid right when he is getting kicked out told to stay until christmas break he starts to make a friend holden gets into a fight with his cocky roomate and his roomate wins holden decides to ditch the last days of school and go into the city by this time you can already tell he is really depressed you have also gotten information that holden's little brother allie died of luekemia in the last couple of years holden goes into the city meets various people asks all the women if they want to have a drink with him it was the 's checks into a hotel goes to a bar to get drunk and gets into a tiff with someone he knows and all the while is getting more and more depressed and feeling lonlier and lonier when he gets back to the hotel the clerk can see how depressed he is and orders him a hooker it's the 's holden is too depressed to do it the next day he takes his ex girlfriend ice skating they get into a fight and she takes off he gets even more depressed he runs into his little sister at central park and makes sure he gets home ok he sneaks out when his parents come back and goes to see an old teacher he nearly gets molested the final day he goes to meet his sister at a museum because he's decided to run away for good and wants to say goodbye she meets him and wants to come with him he is sooooo sad and depressed at this point it's almost too much to bear for the reader he lets his sister ride the carousel and the site of his little sister who he loves so much on it well at this point the book says he felt so much better but it also says he is overcome with weeping most people say he tried to commit suicide because he's telling the story from a hospital but i never get that it always seems to me that he had more of a break down of some sort and had to be hospitalized Sin City About a Boy Kodocha One Tree Hill (TV series) Pitaten Holden Caulfield J.
