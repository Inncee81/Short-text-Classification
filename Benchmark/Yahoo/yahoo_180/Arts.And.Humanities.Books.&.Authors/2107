can u give me review over any book u have read that u liked make me want to read it please tell me the name and author thank you for ur answers i am a big fan of any meg cabot book she is the author of the princess diaries books which are good for young readers but she has like an adult series consisting of some really great like romantic comedies type books not romantic like the romance section at your local bookstore though depending on your liking that can be good or bad the kite runner by khaled hossini is an amazing story of a man and the story of his life living in the mid east and eventually coming to america the story is amazing because it takes you through so many emotions the author is an amazing story teller he isn't afraid to make you hate him because of what he has done a million little pieces by james frey is one of my favorite stories of all time it's a true story or somewhat true somewhat embellished about him struggling with drug addiction and the will to live he takes your through his time in rehab it's a true page turner he tells you stories that will make you cringe like you're there experiencing the pain he's going through his stories of his time in rehab have also made me cry because of how great he is with detail his writing style is different from any writer i've ever seen but it's just great and if you like that story there is a sequel called my friend lenord which is almost better than the first if you do end up reading a million little pieses and want to read my friend lenord also don't read the last page of a million little pieces where it tell you what happens in the rest of his life it will ruin the sequel i would give you more but i'm getting sick of writing p but hope there is something you think might be a good read jane marie Mary Jane Watson Novel Fan fiction Megan Griffin Kurt Cobain One Tree Hill (TV series) Kodocha Fight Club Days of our Lives Peter Pan Spider-Man 2 The Catcher in the Rye Shaggy dog story Timeline of alternative rock Manga Extreme Programming Jon Secada Charles Dickens The Ashlee Simpson Show Daredevil Night (book) Knots Landing Theory of conduct Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Friends 1957 World Series W.I.T.C.H.
