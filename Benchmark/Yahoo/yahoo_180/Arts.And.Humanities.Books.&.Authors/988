how do you read your books i have just finished the th harry potter book my mind was completely bogled during the last action y part with so many things happening at once inside out after i finished it i wondered did people have the same reaction to such a situation so i ask what goes on in your mind when you read is it clear and sharp enough to count the freckles on a cheek is it surreal fuzzy or even dream like does your mind run like a movie or some sort of rd person perspective how about the characters themselves i always thought some characters in the dune series shared resemblances to star wars characters while i think some fanpics are better than movie counterparts so what pictures can does your mind paint while the only thing in front of you is a book when i think of it i read that action part really fast because i just watch the movies and i replace the picture in my mind with the same actors and then i make my own movie thats why most readers expect so much from the movies Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Harry Potter Fictional character Canon (fiction) Children of Dune Our Gang Discworld Social psychology Theory of conduct The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) A Series of Unfortunate Events The nature of God in Western theology Manga A Course In Miracles Severus Snape Idealism Frank Herbert Philosophical Investigations The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Drew Struzan Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Motif of harmful sensation Harry Potter (character) Surrealism Tet Offensive Care Bears Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Librarian God Emperor of Dune Indiana Jones Milton H.
