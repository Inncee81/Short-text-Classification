''a classic is a book every one wants to read but nobody reads '' what is your comment on this quotation friends here in this quotation let us understand that many people want to read but postpone reading there are peiple reading and it is not correct to say ''none ''reads but that was the quote and i quoted as it is so let us understand majority postpone reading the great classics and epics dear autumn crocus it seems you have not read completely what i typed i quoted the quotation as it is under it i added that i quoted the quotation as it is but let us understand majority postpone reading these classics i think you agree with me now thank you a lot god bless you dear freigeist good i said majority post pone reading clssics so you are there lready in the minotity group let us hope the number of persons in the group increses gradually in the united states where i live it was once fashionable for even the uneducated to read and know the classics certainly now the un or under educated and i mean many of us not all have come to distrust intellectualism our president who is presumed by many to be educated is distrustful of intelligent and thoughtful individuals to some degree the poor and middle class the wealthy and educated are worse even than the poor for they have traditionally been exposed to the classics which they now deny as relevant to their situation and time in this country are rushing quickly away from many of the benefits of living in this time to chase trivial and base pursuits refinement of thought and of ones soul rank low or do not emerge on the list of what is important for most of us to make matters worse we seem to be unwilling to just leave other people nations alone and are actively exporting the same shallowness quite aggressively to the rest of the world so to say in this country that a classic is something that everyone wants to read is not true in fact few really wish to read them it might at this time also be proper to define what we mean or once meant by a classic traditionally the term classic referred to an artifact whether a well known document an architectural motif or a belief pattern that had its foundation in classical that is archaic roman or greek culture this is a distinction that is seldom reserved for such material today and we typically mean simply older material that retains some value or relevance in some regard or that was popular in a previous era i suspect that the quote that you employ uses the latter and more often used connotation and i am addressing your question in that regard so it would be my contention that no we citizens of the united states by and large see classics as something to be avoided and to re work the quote to reflect the mood of most of us i would re state it as a classic is a book that few wish to read and even fewer do personally i read many classics the former and the latter definition applies when i was very young or young and a few in college during my early s but very few since there are a number of reasons for this one is that my vision has become quite poor and reading has become difficult and i have to choose more carefully what i wish to spend my time on i have found other classics more valuable than the western classics that are often recommended as culture bound choices in the u s i read the bhagavad gita and the upanishads over and over again and slowly in small bites digest the ramayana and the yoga sutras of patnanjali if i read newer material it is usually non fiction and of a political sociological or historical nature also many of the volumes that we call classics in the west are used to promote a cultural trend or bias this does not include just books but also classical music which the wealthy use to define themselves as just that the upper superior class ask them pointed questions about their beloved classical music and you find that they know very little and most know the same points that they all wish to discuss and nothing more i offer the classics by jane austin as used in a similar fashion the books are beloved by people who wish to associate themselves with values of the era in which they were written and to claim that they have a certain level of class or taste when in fact the books are vapid and devoid of any other value so i reject many classics on those or similar terms and how about the condescending classics of say rudyard kipling i must confess that i enjoyed them very much when i was seven years old and hope you do not find jungle book as offensive as say the poem the white mans burden or cato as far as the vedas or the brahma sutras it is my understanding that they are quite dense and difficult to understand even for contemporary hindus and i find the gita and the upanishads complete and satisfying still i foreword to trying the brahma sutras one day i did try the rig veda some years ago and found i was not up to it Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Culture
