in what order do i read dark tower in there are the books in the series the dark tower the gunslinger born the little sisters of eluria the dark tower i the gunslinger the dark tower ii the drawing of the three the dark tower iii the waste lands the dark tower iv wizard and glass the dark tower v wolves of the calla the dark tower vi song of susannah the dark tower vii the dark tower but i was wondering do you read the dark tower i the gunslinger first or the prequels first i wanna find out before reading it so that i don't get things messed up the gunslinger born is just a non canonical comic based on flashbacks from book one the gunlinger i read the little sisters of eluria first simply because i was reading everything's eventual at the time and it sounded interesting but it has really nothing to do with the series the correct order is the dark tower i the gunslinger the dark tower ii the drawing of the three the dark tower iii the waste lands the dark tower iv wizard and glass the dark tower v wolves of the calla the dark tower vi song of susannah the dark tower vii the dark tower but take it from me you can skip the gunslinger it's really boring and king has an arguement at the beginning of the drawing of the three which recaps everything in it The Dark Tower (series) Wolves of the Calla Stephen King Wizard and Glass Randall Flagg The Gunslinger Crimson King Expanded Universe (Star Wars) The Dark Tower (2004 novel) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Sequel Neil Gaiman The Wheel of Time Sword of Truth Modesty Blaise Wizard Time Out of Mind Places in the Wheel of Time series The Lord of the Rings The Two Towers Roland of Gilead Lightsaber Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) 'Salem's Lot Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire King's Quest Conan the Barbarian The Ashlee Simpson Show Events in the Wheel of Time series Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening Gunslinger Girl The Chronicles of Narnia Anne Boleyn Elric of Melnibon__ Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser Final Fantasy VII Mordred Deschain Henry VII of England Tarot Grendel (comics) The Amber Spyglass Wizards of High Sorcery The Hobbit Quest for Glory Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Bible Star Trek Saruman Princess Zelda The Dark is Rising Sequence Star Wars Middle-earth Darth Vader Highlander (film) The Drawing of the Three References to the Cthulhu mythos Final Fantasy IV Negima Gargoyles (animated series) Indiana Jones RuneScape locations Bad Wolf Canon (fiction) Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog Ganon Lone Wolf Raistlin Majere Douglas Adams Robin (comics) Starfleet ranks and insignia Charles III of Spain DC Comics Dark Shadows Concepts in the Wheel of Time series The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Tower of Druaga The Wonderful Wizard of Oz Land of Oz Apocrypha Fantasy subgenres Harry Potter Necronomicon Dark Horse Comics Masters of the Universe Fighting Fantasy Game Books Sin City Gunslinger Ron Weasley The Care Bears (television series) The Chronicles of Amber Force (Star Wars) Pink Floyd trivia Usagi Yojimbo Transformers: Cybertron Palpatine Ages of Myst Tosca Dungeons & Dragons Drizzt Do'Urden
