do you think scene cards for a novel is too restrictive when it comes to writing the novel i have a really hard time structuring and elongating a story and i have tried jotting down scenes and ideas on index cards but i am afraid as i go to write the novel i would have the whole story already in my mind and writing it would be boring i guess what i am looking for is a chapter by chapter outline how do you make a chapter by chapter outline when usually one scene is about words when a chapter is about words in order to fill in the gaps for that you would need to map out every single incident in the story and like i said that would probably make the writing part boring any suggestions thanks for your answer but i really don't know how much outline is too much and how much is not enough any organizational method that works for you is fine generally index cards aren't my favorite but plenty of people use them or synopses story boards outlines it sounds to me as if you might be jumping the gun knowing that a scene runs words and a chapter you can't know those word counts unless you're writing i'd recommend only a bare bones synopsis or outline or set of index cards which tells what event s transpire in each scene i e jason confronts dee about the cell phone or jeremy and dina fight each goes to a bar and drinks too much dina goes home with a guy while jeremy sleeps it off sprawled across her front door this way when you write each scene you know where it's going but you're writing it fresh and new of course since you're likely to rewrite it several times before it's ready to market you may get bored with it later The Hobbit Little Britain Time Out of Mind Trapped in the Closet Screenwriting Floppy disk Theory of conduct The Parting of the Ways Avenue Q Extreme Programming Poker jargon Dominoes The Exorcist III The Time Machine Shaggy dog story Anne Rice Sin City The Star Wars Holiday Special Friends CPU cache Whose Line Is It Anyway?
