do you like the pairing of couples for the hp books i for one do not really like the pairing for the books some people may criticize me for saying this but i think that hermione and severus should have ended up together what are your views i think hermoine and severus harry and ginny ron i am not sure about i can't really think of anyone that he would be good with oh well i can live out my thoughts on fanfiction net the way my mind figures it that the marriage law went ary and she had to get married to severus my mind may be a little twisted well maybe a lot but i am intitled to my thoughts i need to write a little book of my own with my own ideas on the subject then i could make whatever i want happen yup yup i may just do that i do like harry ginny but i agree i've never been a great believer in ron hermione i mean i know what they say about opposites attract and such but really they are very different hermione so intelligent and interested in her books ron so much into quidditch and according to an interview i read he joined george in the joke shop too i think they'd do great as friends close friends even but those differences could easily become too much when they lived together and yes i am a hermione severus supporter too not right yet she's only but a few years later i could see it happen in the movies severus looks much older because alan rickman is or something but remember in the books he is only years older than she i know some real life couples who are years apart and they're doing fine with the longer life span of wizards it should matter even less i think hermione isn't so very different from what we've seen of lily really both very intelligent brave and severus i have also read the interviews where jkr claims he is truly a nasty guy whose only reason for supporting dumbledore's side was his love for lily and nothing else but let's take a look and compare james severus at james was an arrogant rich kid already making nasty remarks towards severus at severus had made friends with lily a muggleborn at james turned severus upside down in the air 'because he exists' and around that time he sirius pull that werewolf prank on severus not a cool thing even if james gets cold feet and saves him just in time at severus loses his temper calls lily a mudblood but afterwards sincerely tries to apologize up until then they have been friends this means he has maintained a friendship with a muggleborn gryffindor for whole years in spite of all the slytherin gryffindor rivalry in spite of all the peer pressure he must have had from his fellow slytherins while james his fellow marauders were happily bullying around giving in to peer pressure to behave really lousy i must add from that point on it seems james has been slowly wising up while severus became more and more bitter but still these things should say something about their inner nature how they truly would be inside i think jkr created a much better man than she herself realized Hogwarts subjects Hermione Granger Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Dates in Harry Potter Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Harry Potter: Book Seven James and Lily Potter Sirius Black Rubeus Hagrid Minor Hufflepuffs Draco Malfoy Magic (Harry Potter) Lord Voldemort Minor Ravenclaws Blood purity (Harry Potter) Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game) Weasley family Death Eater Minor Slytherins Fred and George Weasley Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Fan fiction Half-Blood Prince (character) Social rule Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Remus Lupin R.A.B.
