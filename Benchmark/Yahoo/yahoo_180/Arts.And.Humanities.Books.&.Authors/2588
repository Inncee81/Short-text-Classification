good setting i need some suggestions of a good region to set a book in i want it to be set in either the s or the s but i'm not sure which i do not want it to be in the united states or anything close in culture when and where should i set the book what you are doing is setting yourself up for a massive amount of research you cannot fake it if you choose a place and a century to write about you will need to research that century and be accurate as to the details right down to mundane little things faking it is cheating your readers there were specific names for articles of clothing cosmetics and hairstyles there were specific types of transportation there are many little every day details i would guess you probably haven't even considered like ummmm using the potty yes they all matter you will need to spend several weeks really studying the period and the place you choose when i chose to set a portion of one of my books in the past it took me weeks to get it all right right down to the names of the streets yes you can do that all i also interviewed a person who is a curator at the costume institute at the met museum regarding clothing how they got dressed what was underneath what they wore in different seasons hygiene etc i have it all completely accurate you can go a lot of research online i also communicated with a man who was an expert on military uniforms to get the exact details about a certain regiment that a real person belonged to right down to the buckles on the boots you should also buy yourself a book called a descriptionary which gives you the exact names that were used for common items in different periods trust me it is no easy task when they say write about what you know it applies here to do this you will have to become an expert on a certain place and time it is a massive undertaking especially since you don't want it close in culture to the us i would suggest japan but that would be quite difficult to communicate with people to gain information unless you speak japanese be authentic do not cheat your readers believe me they will know but more importantly a publisher or agent will know and then your book will never see the light of day pax c Surveillance Japanese tea ceremony Clothing Social rule Password Funeral Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Cryptography RuneScape Science Church of Christ, Scientist Autograph Killian documents Animal Crossing Legal research MapleStory Kilt RuneScape cheats Greco-Buddhist art Customs and etiquette of Japan Autism Professional wrestling match types Marshall McLuhan Investigations since the Fiji coup of 2000 The Amazing Race PaX Polyamory I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Flag of Hong Kong The Skeptical Environmentalist Suit (clothes) The Apprentice 2 Roswell UFO incident Alcoholics Anonymous Tattoo XML Corset Fashion America's Army Biblical canon American Psycho Chinese character Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Deconstruction Graduate school GED American and British English differences Pok__mon (video games) Microeconomics Kimono Sento Japanese name Scientology beliefs and practices Storytelling Society for Creative Anachronism Order of the Garter Dissociative identity disorder Perl Corporation Breaker Morant Patterson-Gimlin film Religious Society of Friends Margaret Mead Archaeology and the Book of Mormon Social aspects of clothing Undergarment Black hole United States Marine Corps Biblical inerrancy Trust (Law) USA Advance fee fraud Contract Linguistics and the Book of Mormon Academia MMORPG Tasaday Sexual orientation Consensus decision-making Light pollution Open access Downing Street memo Cheating in Counter-Strike Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Democracy Carnival Central processing unit Second Battle of the Atlantic Transsexuality Han Chinese clothing Sauna Eugene Onegin EastEnders
