did anyone else keep expecting more familiar magic spell phrases in harry potter abracadabra hocus pocus obviously there's avada kedavra abracadabra i was hoping to get some more real versions of muggle known incantations like of hocus pocus alakazam etc horcrux is approaching hocus pocus but i don't know if that was the intentions probably not what are some other stereotypical magic words that jkr could've played with presto chango bibidy bobity boo well okay so some people think it's dumb or childish anyone else think it adds depth to the story something so big in the wizard world coming into muggle consciousness as myth or fairy tale hmmm i think because from a literary standpoint she wanted to show that the common spells we know like hocus pocus etc aren't really magical spells at all but words made up by muggles because they don't understand the magical world Abracadabra Magical objects in Harry Potter Lord Voldemort Magic (Harry Potter) Albus Dumbledore Dates in Harry Potter Wizarding world Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Severus Snape Death Eater Horcrux Dark Art Hocus Pocus (film) Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Hogwarts subjects Minor Harry Potter Beasts Wizard Harry Potter (character) Horace Slughorn Blood purity (Harry Potter) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Ron Weasley R.A.B.
