had a miscarriage last week and want to know about concieving again hi i had a miscarriage last week i should have been weeks but i started spotting on sunday night went to the dr on monday and he said that the baby's development was only at about weeks i miscarried naturally with no d c i have read different things about wait time my dr said to wait a cycle or two because it would be easier to determine how far along i was but he didn't give me any medical reason why i physically couldn't start trying right away has anyone else tried right away and had a healthy baby i just want to know if i can go ahead and start trying any thoughts i'm very sorry for your loss the same thing happened to me when i was about the same ammt of time along i did wait one cycle but then went on to conceive almost immediately after my baby daughter is seven months old and was born completely healthy it might be best to take a month off if not for medical reasons but to distance yourself from it for a bit my husband and i used that month to reconnect and stop the work of trying so hard to have a baby we used protection and just tried to enjoy sex for sex medically i think it's more important to wait if you've had a medical proceedure like a d and c and your body needs to heal or if you were further along at weeks lots of people don't even realize that they were pregnant and just go on to do what they normally would i doubt you'd need more than a cycle to get things back to normal and go back to trying again Miscarriage Pregnancy EastEnders Infantilism Prostate cancer Abortion debate Intact dilation and extraction Marilyn Monroe Neighbours Breastfeeding Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Theory of conduct Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Charmed Niddah Jon Secada Menstrual cycle Knots Landing Urinary incontinence CPU cache Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Sexual abstinence Negima Childbirth CPU design The Apprentice 2 Abortion Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sharon Tate Twin Hall & Oates StarCraft: Uprising Coeliac disease Obstetrics The Inside Hollyoaks The Contender (television series) Premature birth Jean-Luc Picard Operation Market Garden Intersexuality Phoebe Halliwell Beatles for Sale Bipolar disorder Fertility awareness Fasting Traumatic incident reduction Miscarriage of justice Piccolo Junior Saga Time Out of Mind Shaggy dog story AIDS Ben Johnson (athlete) Milton H.
