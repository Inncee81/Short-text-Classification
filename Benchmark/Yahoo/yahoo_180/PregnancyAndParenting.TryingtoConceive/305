what to expect going for a hysterosalpingogram next week been ttc for and a half years just wondering what to expect has anyone had one okay i went through this just a few months ago it's really not a big deal take some tylenol or ibubprofen about an hour before you go to the doctor's office hospital be sure to pack at least one pantyliner for afterwards i did mine at a hospital so unless yours is being done elsewhere your experience will probably be the same after doing all the preliminary check in stuff the nurse will have you change into a hospital gown and lie down on the x ray machine table they will insert a speculum just like a gyno exam next they put a clamp on your cervix the sensation is somewhere between moderate to moderate severs period cramps while it's not comfortable it's not the most painful thing in the world either the doctor will then insert a catheter into your uterus and slowly inject the dye as the radiologist takes images of your reproductive organs as the dye is expelled your uterus fallopian tubes and ovaries will show bright white on the image ideally your uterus fallopian tubes and ovaries should light up then the dye will spill into your abdominal cavity the dye itself isn't painful unless they hit a blockage in your fallopian tubes this can be painful but as i had no blockage i can't describe the sensation some docotrs use an oil based dye others a water based the water based can be less painful in the case of a blockage but the oil based can sometimes loosen a blockage on its own if one is found you won't get a choice in which they use but i thought i would let you know that once the test is done they'll remove the catheter clamp and speculum and you can get dressed remember the pad as the dye can sometimes leak out and some people experience light bleeding afterwards the entire process takes less than minutes the doctor will review your x rays to see if anything is out of place shaped wrong or blocked Menstrual cycle Endometriosis Dialysis Gynaecology In vitro fertilisation Sexual reproduction Ectopic pregnancy Stomach cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Prostate cancer Urinary incontinence Childbirth Menstrual cup Pregnancy Abortion Uterus Intravenous therapy Gonorrhoea Ovary Androgen insensitivity syndrome Ovarian cancer Intersex surgery Endometrial cancer Pelvic inflammatory disease X-ray Puberty Cystoscopy Fertilisation Traumatic brain injury Stroke Infertility Sex organ Breastfeeding Ovulation Gastroparesis Sexual differentiation Intact dilation and extraction Acupuncture Cervix Medicine Diabetic retinopathy Pneumonia Apollo 8 Myocardial infarction Colorectal cancer Casting First aid Sterilization (surgical procedure) Cancer Migraine Human sexuality Sexual intercourse Textile manufacturing Terri Schiavo Electrophysiology Lethal injection Ebola Penis Fertility awareness Strap-on dildo Shark Aortic dissection Sex reassignment surgery female-to-male First Battle of the Atlantic Blood on the Tracks Compact disc Professional wrestling match types Fecal incontinence EastEnders Upholstery Chlamydia Radiology Tobacco smoking Carbon dioxide Coronary catheterization Pain Cholecystitis Cathode ray tube Chemical abortion Cruising (maritime) Peritoneum Massage Vaginal bleeding Stenberg v.
