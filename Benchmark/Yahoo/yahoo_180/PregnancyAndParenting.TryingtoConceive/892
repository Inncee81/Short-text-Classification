how long do you ovulate i bought an opk thurs and been getting positive reading since the test line is darker than the control line so i'm doing it right i know your suppose to get two lines but my test line has been darker than the control line since thursday is this normal opks predict your lh surge the first day you get a positive result you ovulate anywhere from hours later there is no need to keep testing once you get that first positive it's totally normal to get a positive reading for up to days in a row if you catch your surge on it's way up it will give you extra time then if you catch it on the way down if you continue to get positives days or more in a row it may be a problem i would say if it happens one cycle not to worry everyone is entitled to a strange cycle they can't explain once in a while but if you cotinue to get positive readings days in a row or more for and cycles in a row consult with your doctor when using the opks with color lines sometimes it's hard to distinguish between positive and negative i'm wondering if one of those days you tested was borderline and you took it as a postive reading that's just a thought in any case good luck a hope a positive hpt is next Menstrual cycle CPU cache Poker jargon Ovulation Pregnancy test Cheating in Counter-Strike Pregnancy Polycystic ovary syndrome Prostate cancer Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Volleyball The Structure of Scientific Revolutions 2000 Australian Grand Prix Social rule Apollo 8 In vitro fertilisation International cricket in 2005 Signed graph HIV test Experiment Thermal power station Pascal's triangle Transformation problem STS-62 Operation Market Garden Infertility Entropy Kasparov versus The World Extreme Programming Hard disk Chaos Emerald Normal distribution Maya calendar Jet engine Liquid crystal display Fast bowling Infantilism Sun Milton H.
