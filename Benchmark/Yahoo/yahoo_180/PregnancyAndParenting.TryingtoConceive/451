specific answer aboout mirena birth control ok i get really emotional about a week to days before my period but the dr explained that mirena the iud the bc i'm supposed to get next week will go straight to my uterus and not in my bloodstream at all and eventually i won't even get my period question is will i still get emotional around the time i normally get my period thanks yes this is not going to change your hormones at all the estrogen that it releases will not go past your uterus and will act to stop cramping and lessen your period it's not like any of the pills which work by changing your body levels of hormones you will still be ovulating which will still release the same hormones as it does without the iud which will trigger the hormones that makes you emotional hope this answered your question Menstrual cycle Emergency contraception Endometriosis Birth control Fertility awareness Intrauterine device Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Puberty Ovulation Estrus cycle Urinary incontinence Hormone Gonadotropin-releasing hormone Androgen insensitivity syndrome Signal transduction Pregnancy Progesterone Ectopic pregnancy Estradiol Cancer Homosexuality and transgender Ovary Hormone replacement therapy Human chorionic gonadotropin Sexual reproduction Prostate cancer Polycystic ovary syndrome Abortion Glucocorticoid Childbirth Transsexuality Biology and sexual orientation Growth hormone Morning sickness Obstetrics Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Sexual orientation Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Testosterone Growth hormone treatment Nutrition Luteinizing hormone Depo Provera Sleep Sex assignment Heterosexuality Dysmenorrhea Intersexuality History of intersex surgery Traumatic brain injury Acne Secondary sex characteristic Endocrinology Gallstone Breast cancer Gynaecology Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Endometrial cancer Breastfeeding Anabolic steroid In vitro fertilisation Endometrium Thyroid Delayed puberty Alanis Morissette Gynecologic hemorrhage Tour de France Sadism and masochism Androgen Orgasm Oxytocin Stomach cancer Chemotherapy Swyer syndrome Dehydroepiandrosterone Baldness Vitamin D Autoimmune diseases Amenorrhoea Turner syndrome Osteoporosis Estrogen Tocopherol Cryptorchidism Panic attack Antidiuretic hormone Female reproductive system (human) Ovarian cancer Pregnancy test Motivation Clinical depression Non-human animal sexuality Uterine fibroids Blood sugar Gynecomastia Cholesterol Niddah
