is there any hope for me ttc at i just went on fertility ties com and aked a fertlity doctor about me ttc at and he answered that he really doubt it i have a year old from my st husband but i would like to have with my new husband i plan on starting on clomid as soon as my cycle starts but that doctor made me feel like there is no hope for me i have been ttc for months using ovulation strips and we bd every other day any hope or other women out there ttc after without using ivf don't listen to naysayers and especially some doctor online who doesn't know you or your history he's going by statistics and yes statistics aren't in your favor but people beat the odds in everything everyday i got pregnant on the first try at age unfortunately my baby had a bad heart and passed away in utero i needed time to grieve and we are now trying again i'm hopeful it will happen before the year is over i'm now the odds also say that women in their s are fertile fertile fertile well guess what not all of them i talk to women here every day in their s who can't conceive who have problems i don't have in my s so what do experts have to say about that as long as any woman is ovulating she's capable of being pregnant some can do it quickly and some need more time now i'm sure you know the risks for women our age so it's possible you may need some help at months of trying you're on the borderline if you want to go see a fertility specialist or keep trying for a while longer you've just started to chart your temps i would say give it a couple of cycles and see what happens actually if you end up in a fertility specialist's office it will help the doctor if you've got a few months of charting for him her to refer to i would only suggest you run to the specialist now if you know for sure you don't ovulate or if you have other obvious female problems that could get in the way irregular periods endometriosis etc but you haven't mentioned any of that so i'm assuming that they're not a problem for you also there's a slight chance that hubby may have a lower sperm count or some other sperm issue the path of least resistance points to him getting tested first fixing male parts is a lot easier than female so while you're charting for the next couple of months you may want to send him to a urologist for a sperm analysis it wouldn't hurt good luck and stay positive Fertility awareness In vitro fertilisation Infertility Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Birth control Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Oral contraceptive Prostate cancer Miscarriage Puberty Endometriosis Social rule Polycystic ovary syndrome Androgen insensitivity syndrome Urinary incontinence Abortion debate Friends Jam (TV series) Blackjack Craps Fertilisation Emergency contraception Ovulation Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Doomsday argument 1957 World Series Breastfeeding Poker jargon Toronto Subway and RT Philosophical skepticism Extreme Programming Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Twin Stomach cancer Toronto Transit Commission Phoebe Halliwell Obstetrics Species Jon Secada Domestic violence Sexual reproduction Multiple birth 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, vote suppression The Death Gate Cycle Equine conformation Toronto Streetcar System Human cloning Sheepshead Survivor (novel) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) ELO rating system Conifer cones Hebrew calendar Breech birth Pitaten Kasparov versus The World Autism Medical analysis of circumcision Niddah Estrus cycle Time Out of Mind 2000 Australian Grand Prix Adoption UK Singles Chart Surveillance Fecal incontinence Eugenics Coeliac disease Ashton-Tate Oh My Goddess!
