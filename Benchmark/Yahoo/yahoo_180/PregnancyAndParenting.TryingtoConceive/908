ovulation predictor kits i know that on the leaflet it says not to test whilst pregnant not that i understand why you would because it would give an inaccurate result what i was wondering is if i was pregnant would the line be dark or light surely if i was already pregnant i wouldn't be ovulating just wondering since i am on day and have not had a positive result yet and since we have been actively trying for a baby could this be that i am in early stages of pregnancy thanks usually the kits show a light line for a couple of day before ovulation and then a dark line at ovulation if you get pregnant then they will show up as a continual faint line thorughout the pregnancy i had a miscarriage last pregnancy and so this time the doc suggested i use up my ovulation sticks testing every couple of days to check i was still pregnant that said the cycle that i got pregnant which was a cycle following miscarriage i tested every day from period right through and there was never even a faint line so i assumed i had not ovulated i was also charting my mucas and dates on fertility friend so knew when i was expecting to ovulate the mucas for me was more of an indication as it turned egg white before the date i expected to ovulate however at the end of the cycle i got more egg white mucas and then started getting faint lines on the fertility sticks i did not understand it did a preg test on the off chance and it was positive so i would advise getting to know your cycle and body as the most accurate way of predicting ovulation Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness In vitro fertilisation Polycystic ovary syndrome Pregnancy test Ovulation Miscarriage Oral contraceptive Obstetrics HIV test Twin Birth control Estrus cycle Friends Maya calendar Human chorionic gonadotropin Abortion debate Abortion Multiple birth Coeliac disease Ovarian cancer Ovarian cyst Branch predictor Niddah Tsetse fly Precession Ovum Folic acid Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Ovary Gonorrhoea Flowering plant Fruit Marilyn Monroe Sexual reproduction Religion and abortion Sexual abstinence Prolactinoma Spina bifida Health issues and the effects of cannabis Cytomegalovirus Hipparchus (astronomer) Origin belief Pelvic inflammatory disease Neighbours Gynecologic hemorrhage Prostate cancer Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Female reproductive system (human) Breastfeeding Kasparov versus The World Luminiferous aether Hubble Space Telescope Methotrexate Humphrey Bogart Kodocha ELO rating system EastEnders Normal distribution Junior (film) Milton H.
