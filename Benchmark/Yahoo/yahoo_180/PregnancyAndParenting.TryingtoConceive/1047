first morning urine i've read everywhere that you should use first morning urine when taking a pregnancy test but i was wondering what if you don't wake up till sometime in the evening night shift schedule is it the same thing and could a kidney infection mess with your results just curious because i'm almost a week late which is really weird for me i had af like cramps for about days sometime last week but the pass few days haven't had any and my boobs have been sore for a week now which is really weird for me i don't even get sore boobs before af they're kind of swollen and i have a lot of blue veins but i got a negative test days after i was supposed to start my period i don't know i'm just confused maybe i just have my hopes too high since i've been ttc for soo long first morning urine is just a way of getting women to use urine that has been held for at least hours and they didn't drink anything during that time it just ensures that the urine is concentrated so really you can test anytime just hold it and don't drink for at least hours i don't think the kidney infection would interfere with teh results of a home preg test as for your symptoms it really sounds like pregnancy is a possibility make sure you are using a very sensitive test go here to see all the tests and the levels they detect www peeonastick com Urinary incontinence Kidney Pregnancy Group A streptococcal infection HIV test Gonorrhoea Cytomegalovirus Obstetrics Gout Menstrual cycle Prostate cancer Urinary system Diabetes mellitus Dialysis Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Herpes simplex virus Ben Johnson (athlete) Urine Breastfeeding Kidney stone First aid Diabetes insipidus Insulin Social rule Housebreaking Time Out of Mind Diabetic nephropathy Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Marathon (sport) Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Milton H.
