my ob gyn put me on birth control pills to see if i could get pregnant is this right she only prescribed me for three months but see what she told me is that i should be on them for months and quit taking them after the last course my periods are really irregular and me my husband are ttc so the ob gyn thought that this would be a good way to get my periods back into sync and to get me ovulating we are not sure if i even ovulate or not yet and i have been doing the basal body temps for almost months now we have been ttc for almost a year now we already have a year old daughter but the ob gyn said things ppl can change in that period of time i'm supposed to start the pills on sunday i'm kind of iffy about it and i'm supposed to call the ob gyn tomorrow anywho what do you think about this situation the last time i was on birth control pills it did regulate my periods but afterwards my periods just stopped again and it took about months for a so called period to start again and it's been the same ever since without regular periods ttc is difficult birth control gives your body a routine that often does help conceive after you come off of the pills it is a common practice when pregnancy is not occuring i hope it helps for you Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Emergency contraception Oral contraceptive Birth control Polycystic ovary syndrome Urinary incontinence In vitro fertilisation Ovulation Puberty Ovarian cyst Abortion debate EastEnders Neighbours Friends Tocopherol Childbirth Folic acid Knots Landing Niddah Sexual abstinence Acne Miscarriage Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Endometriosis Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Fasting History of sex Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Search for Tomorrow Fertilisation Premature birth Daylight saving time Toronto Transit Commission Breastfeeding Apollo 8 Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Hebrew calendar Toronto Subway and RT Charmed Milton H.
