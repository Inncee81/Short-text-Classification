emotional and moody i have very irregular periods i had one in nov and found out i was pregnant in jan had a baby in sept then i got an iud i had it removed in april i had my first period july since i am being very hateful and emotional my husband and i have been having unprotected sex since i stopped my period like every days sorry if tmi i had cramping last saturday and it quit around wed my lower back is hurting i took a pregnancy test today and it was neg i can't remember been this emotional since i was pregnant but the test said no i was guessing i should start on because i've heard you regulate after having a baby any ideas of what could be going on or what other signs i can look for like if i'm getting ready to start or getting ready to have a hpt i know you're not a dr just need some ideas of what to try or do to feel better from someone that can relate thanks i've had dreams in the past week about me being pregnant and having a little girl do you believe dreams mean anything we aren't trying but if it happens it happens its hard to say if you had the iud w the hormones this may just be your body's way of adjusting and you may be getting ready to start but being moody and emotional is definitely a sign of pregnancy too any other symptoms like nausea sore breasts etc being emotional was definitely as sign for me give it another week or so and test again best of luck Pregnancy Breastfeeding Menstrual cycle EastEnders Stomach cancer Cytomegalovirus Prostate cancer Miscarriage Emergency contraception Obstetrics Neighbours Oral contraceptive Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Urinary incontinence Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Endometriosis Fertility awareness Ectopic pregnancy Marilyn Monroe Friends Prolactinoma Birth control Abortion Chronic fatigue syndrome Premature birth Marriage Psoriasis Days of our Lives Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Health issues and the effects of cannabis Everwood Breast cancer Transsexuality One Life to Live Androgen insensitivity syndrome Charmed Childbirth In vitro fertilisation Haloperidol Tobacco smoking Traumatic brain injury Pornographic movie Dawson's Creek One Tree Hill (TV series) Sharon Tate Jon Secada Puberty Group A streptococcal infection Cancer AIDS Leeds United F.C.
