could i be pregnant hello i have been ttc for a few months now i got pregnant a few months ago and had a miscarriage when i was weeks a long i started keeping track of my cm and cervical position so that i could have an idea of when i am going to ovulate again i had a period on july st my boobs got tender a two weeks after my period so my husband and i had sex on august st i was exspecting to ovulate around the rd th but never did i have been having mild cramps and my boobs are still tender could i be pregnant cervical mucus can be a good indicator but from everything i've read cervical position isn't always the best indicator of ovulation your best bet is to either start charting your basal body temps and or use the ovulation predictor kits it's impossible to tell if you ovulated or not without an ultrasound or bloodwork otherwise with any certainty it is still possible you could be pregnant but save yourself the stress and wait until your period is late to test remember that the more you try the harder it is for your body just try and have fun instead it takes most couples anywhere from months to a year to conceive so hang in there and i hope when it happens it sticks for you best of luck Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Pregnancy Miscarriage Birth control Abortion Pregnancy test Polycystic ovary syndrome Stomach cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Obstetrics Puberty Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Gynaecology UK Singles Chart Endometriosis EastEnders Oral contraceptive In vitro fertilisation Prostate cancer Niddah Premature birth Flowering plant Survivor (novel) Emergency contraception Apollo 8 Endometrial cancer Infectious mononucleosis Autism Neighbours Social rule Childbirth Prenatal diagnosis Premenstrual stress syndrome Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Conifer cones 2004 Republican National Convention Health issues and the effects of cannabis Billboard Hot 100 Sharon Tate Drawn Together Madonna (entertainer) Vertebral column Gonorrhoea Cervix Friends Estradiol 2000 Australian Grand Prix Hanging Pitaten HIV test Pelvic inflammatory disease Futurama (TV series - season 5) Blackjack Kodocha Ovarian cyst Marriage Ovarian cancer Urinary incontinence Coeliac disease Game show LSD Poker jargon Bulgarian language Civil Marriage Act Acne Weather lore Ben Johnson (athlete) TLC Heartworm The Inside Spina bifida George Costanza Vaginal bleeding Phoebe Halliwell Cervical cancer Fertilisation Craps Fasting Abortion debate Philosophical skepticism Psoriasis Guinea pig Elvis Presley Human height Ectopic pregnancy Human sexual behavior CPU cache Great Teacher Onizuka Sex and the City Kylie Minogue Chiropractic Sexual abstinence Kurt Cobain Cancer
