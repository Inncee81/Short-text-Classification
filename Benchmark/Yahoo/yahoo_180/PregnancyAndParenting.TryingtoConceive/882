i am due to start my period in days my husband and i have been ttc this last cycle and i am wondering if we did conceive or if my period is coming do the blue veins on your breast usually appear before starting your period or is that a sign of pregnancy i have noticeable changes enlargment of breast more apparant veins on my legs and on my stomach i have child already he is years old and i was so young when i had him i didnt pay much attention to the symptoms so any help would be great i have been searching and searching for some information and i know all the symptoms to expect but i cant find any info that suggests any thing helpful to my situation ok i think that yes it's possible that this could be a sign of pregnancy when a woman gets pregnant her blood vessels start to expand which puts more pressure on your veins this could make the veins in your body become more apparent this is why a lot of pregnant women get nosebleeds it's also a possible reason for increased sex drive i have not read or heard about a similar sign of getting your period i'm going to give you a link to an article about the expanding blood vessels and nose bleeds during pregnancy i haven't read the whole article but if you do there might be something talking about veins becoming more apparent i hope this helps and i hope you're pregnant good luck Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Abortion Bleeding Breastfeeding Turner syndrome Miscarriage Oral contraceptive Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Stroke Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Polycystic ovary syndrome Breast Traumatic brain injury Folic acid Breast cancer Intracranial pressure Autism Blood vessel Stomach cancer Cirrhosis Puberty Blood pressure Urinary incontinence Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Hypertension Subdural hematoma Alcoholism Tocopherol Anemia Teenage pregnancy Hemorrhoid Birth control Abortion debate Paget's disease of bone Prenatal diagnosis Premature birth Gonorrhoea Nosebleed Prolactinoma Childbirth EastEnders Coeliac disease Diabetic retinopathy Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Androgen insensitivity syndrome Multiple sclerosis Gastroesophageal reflux disease Milton H.
