fertility question i have little girls ages and we have been trying for about months for baby number my husband is and i am i know that it gets harder to conceive with age but neither of us is that old my question is this after having absolutely no trouble getting pregnant with the first could a fertility problem suddenly be affecting one of us if so what thanks all lol my husband is in the army he does not smoke weed or do any other kind of drugs honey it gets harder to conceive with age over age not age lol the bottom line is no two pregnancies are the same so even though you got pregnant on a sneeze the last times this one is obviously different you shouldn't even consider there's a problem until it's been months of trying it could be that having rugrats running around has added extra stress and therefore running some interference with conceiving i would suggest buying an ovulation predictor kit an opk will tell you exactly when you're fertile so you know when you need to have sex good luck Pregnancy Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Infertility Abortion debate Urinary incontinence In vitro fertilisation Birth control Friends Miscarriage Twin Multiple birth Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Illegal drug trade Oral contraceptive Episodes of Lost (Season 1) EastEnders Folic acid Common cold Childbirth Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Psoriasis Obstetrics Fertilisation Postpartum depression Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Breastfeeding Boston Public Pregnancy test Ovulation Tobacco smoking Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Spina bifida Puberty CPU cache Tocopherol Emergency contraception Ectopic pregnancy Health issues and the effects of cannabis 2000 Australian Grand Prix Prolactinoma Autism Guinea pig Sexual intercourse Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Marilyn Monroe Premature birth Neighbours Infantilism Gonorrhoea Biology and sexual orientation Stroke Coeliac disease Days of our Lives Hollyoaks Human chorionic gonadotropin Sexual reproduction Knots Landing The nature of God in Western theology History of sex Teenage pregnancy Elephant X chromosome Humphrey Bogart Schizophrenia Human cloning Meditation Rugrats Sharon Tate Clinical depression Prostate cancer Mojave people Theory of conduct Kurt Cobain Paroxetine Sex and the City Free trade Androgen insensitivity syndrome Baby Blues Osteoporosis Conifer cones Genital wart Drug test Flowering plant Herpes simplex virus Pelvic inflammatory disease Polycystic ovary syndrome Cannabis (drug) Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Redundant array of independent disks Social rule Marriage Abortion Stomach cancer Sexual dysfunction Agriculture Mary, the mother of Jesus Niddah
