male infertility question we did one of those home male fertility tests and my hubby says the color is lighter but i say its not we wanted to know things how do you get a sperm analysis done and where do you do it do they really put you in a room with porn and a sticky magazine and expect you to masterbate til you get the sample second question is this my hubby was riding a bike with no seat when he was like and he hit a tree root and the bike pole where the seat would go hit him in the testicles he has a really bad scar from it and there is no pigmentation on it and the scar is rough and bumpy could this have hurt his sperm or made him infertile i am so scared he is infertile since we are trying to conceive our first child he should really just go see the dr from what i've heard the infertility tests aren't really accurate he may be able to produce the sample at home and bring it in to the dr office right away but different dr's may have different ways of doing things make sure he also tells them about the scar Infertility Testicular cancer Testicle In vitro fertilisation Androgen insensitivity syndrome Lance Armstrong Fertility awareness Adoption Mountain bike Endometriosis Avenue Q Christmas tree Friends Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Anchor X chromosome Pregnancy Cryptorchidism Simone Weil Moby-Dick Intersexuality Gonorrhoea Boom Town (Doctor Who) Color theory One Tree Hill (TV series) Fertilisation Jackass: The Movie Shaggy dog story Prostate cancer Mystique (comics) Menstrual cycle Leaf Male reproductive system (human) Time Out of Mind Pelvic inflammatory disease Puberty Theory of conduct Chicken Soul Sperm Whale 1957 World Series Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man Normal distribution Bicycle Stem cell Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Sampling (music) Horus Pornographic actor The Inside Germaine Greer Horse Color blindness The Handmaid's Tale Bicycle frame Childfree Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Turner syndrome Sin City Race Isis The Marshall Mathers LP Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Sterilization (surgical procedure) Valentino Rossi Ages of Myst Death Scarlet's Walk Babe Ruth Tour de France Little Britain 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Drum and bass Semen Ryuzo Yanagimachi Meiosis Drag racing The Shining (film) Midnight Run Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Presuppositional apologetics Rei Ayanami Coming of Age (TNG episode) Luther Vandross Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hip hop rivalries Species Salad Fingers Fred A.
