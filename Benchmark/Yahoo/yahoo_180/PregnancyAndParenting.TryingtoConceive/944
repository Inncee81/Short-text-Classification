what are my chances well i've been off the shot for about months and i was taking the pill but then i stopped last week me and my husband had sex out of days and then on the weekend i started my period do you think i was ovulating during the week and do you think there is a high chance that i might have gotten pregnant honestly months off of the shot and you're probably not ovulating yet it takes some women month or years to get back to normal after the shot also even if you did ovulate it would have been two weeks before you got your period not one week i doubt you got pregnant good luck Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Pregnancy Oral contraceptive Emergency contraception Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Ovarian cyst Pregnancy test Birth control Ovulation Niddah Estrus cycle Psoriasis Puberty In vitro fertilisation Infertility Abortion debate 2000 Australian Grand Prix Social rule Polycystic ovary syndrome History of sex The Contender (television series) EastEnders Knots Landing Ovarian cancer Endometriosis Fertilisation Progesterone Sharon Tate Neighbours Winning Streak Gregory Goodwin Pincus Angel (vampire) Ginkgo Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia USS Yorktown (CV-10) National Football League Phoebe Halliwell Marilyn Monroe Eddie Guerrero Depo Provera Tocopherol Urinary incontinence Twin Japanese calendar Lucille Ball Alanis Morissette Premenstrual stress syndrome Fanny Blankers-Koen Mid-Autumn Festival Kodocha $ale of the Century USS Ticonderoga (CV-14) Acne Ernie Irvan Miscarriage Prolactinoma The Inside Folic acid Katelyn Faber Amiodarone Reservoir Dogs Week Mountain Gorilla Conifer cones USS Wedderburn (DD-684) Madonna (entertainer) Troy Glaus Marriage TLC USS Aspro (SSN-648) Sexual reproduction USS Chicago (CA-136) Estradiol Game show Paroxetine Fasting Steffi Graf USS Wallace L.
