don't want to miss ovulation could opk be missing it noticed cm today i've been using a digital opk for the st time this month i'm getting impatient nervous i'm on day of a day cycle thought i would have ovulated by now i just noticed cervical mucuous today don't want to miss my ovulation how late could it be any later than tomorrow we just started trying kind of have to schedule sex b c hubby works rd shift i don't check my temp or anything else thanks for your help hi there okay for a day cycle you would be ovulating on day which is today so if your anticipated day of ovulation is august your total fertile phase is august hopefully you had sex at least every other day if not every day during this time so by all means have sex today and tomorrow it appears your body is right on schedule with the calendar method so i would go with it now about opks opks are designed to predict your lh surge which happens hours before ovulation so the fact that you haven't gotten an lh surge means a few things you missed your surge you haven't had a surge yet and therefore aren't ovulating yet or you aren't ovulating this cycle catching your lh surge can be like trying to catch a falling star one blink and you miss it because of this some women have to test twice daily if their surge is short also unlike pregnancy tests that recommend morning testing opks work best in the afternoon try to test at the same time every day between pm pm testing too early or too late can give you a false negative for some women cm starts appearing a couple of days before ovulation so it's also possible that even though you're seeing it now you're still a day or two away from ovulation if it were me i would keep testing you may just get a positive saturday or sunday if you do extend your fertile period a few more days and try to have sex on those days too i mentioned the possibility of not ovulating this cycle but i wouldn't go there yet especially if you are having signs of ovulation you can revisit that possibility if you keep not testing positive on your opk after a few cycles hope this helps feel free to contact me if you have any other questions good luck Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Ovulation Pregnancy Polycystic ovary syndrome Sexual abstinence Oral contraceptive Pregnancy test Emergency contraception Estrus cycle Birth control In vitro fertilisation Niddah Maya calendar Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Hebrew calendar Puberty Infertility Gregorian calendar Childbirth Progesterone Extreme Programming Liturgical year Social rule Sharon Tate Philosophical skepticism Hipparchus (astronomer) Chinese calendar Month Poker jargon Drug test Sydney Riot of 1879 HIV test Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Anal sex Autism Marilyn Monroe Lucid dreaming Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Sexual intercourse National Football League Ovarian cyst Shaggy dog story Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Sexually-transmitted infection Easter Monday Night Football Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina New York Giants Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Julian day 2005 Atlantic hurricane season Cancer CPU cache Blonde on Blonde Pedophilia Cyberspace Breastfeeding Apollo 8 Entropy The Ashes STS-62 2000 Australian Grand Prix Attic calendar WNNX (FM) Miscarriage Orgasm Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Ravi Shastri Ovarian cancer Billboard Hot 100 Theory of conduct Dominical letter Time Out of Mind Oral sex The Chemical Brothers Herpes simplex virus Estradiol Coeliac disease Human papillomavirus Hurricane Katrina timeline Prostate cancer Solar eclipse Germaine Greer Indianapolis 500 Old wives' tale Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Urinary incontinence Calendar Rosa Parks Software testing
