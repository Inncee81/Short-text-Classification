how to help a friend deal with a miscarriage one of my best friends found out weeks ago she was pregnant after years of trying she has an year old daughter everyone is so happy for her however yesterday she went for a transvaginal ultrasound to determine fetal age because she was irregular and didn't know how far she was well they did not find a viable heartbeat they scheduled her for next week tuesday to try again because maybe she's not very far along the hard part is i have a newborn and so does her cousin and a close friend i've heard people have issues seeing babies etc i want to be there for her but what can i do or say i've never had to deal with this kind of situation before i'm sure it's not the last time either so any advice to help me be a good supportive friend would be greatly appreciated i've had healthy children and lost by miscarriage once was my st pregnancy and once was my th no matter what if you miscarry it's hard to deal with you feel a sense of profound loss wonder if it was your fault even if every healthcare professional tells you there was nothing you did wrong and you just miss that baby mostly because even for a little while you had all the hopes and dreams for them that will never happen now it's tough then on top of it hormones are crashing and physically don't feel right she will get through it because she has such a good friend like you the worst thing to say i think is don't worry you can always have another because you don't want another you wanted this baby sometimes saying nothing but being there for her is the kindest thing you can do i don't know her so i can't tell you but i did have some really stupid people try to make me feel better at the time and i wanted to wring their necks for the comments they made i had one woman from church say well it was god's will okay that is the worst idea i've ever heard i let that one in one ear and out the other protecting her from others that might say inappropriate things would be a kindness that she would be forever grateful for telling her to focus on the daughter she already has would be bad too i was told that also people can be really insensitive when they don't know what the right thing to say is if she needs to hear anything remind her the baby is in heaven god has a plan even if we can't understand it now speak the truth and tell her you understand this is the absolute worst thing and you're so sorry that will mean everything to her it feels like the worst to her losing a husband or a child you already know is the only thing that would compare i have come to a place that i have to raise and i'm so thankful for them and i have waiting for me and i will see them someday it gets much easier with time like everything else it's a loss if she miscarries but she will be okay take her for a special girls day out and just do something fun to take her mind off of the situation when she feels healed up best wishes hope i could help i'm so sorry too Miscarriage EastEnders Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Humphrey Bogart Jon Secada Pregnancy Theory of conduct Pitaten Abortion debate Social rule Sharon Tate Neighbours Hearing impairment The Lovely Bones Intact dilation and extraction Breastfeeding Infantilism Abortion in the United States Abortion K' Urinary incontinence Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Cliff Richard Kodocha Shaggy dog story Good Times Knots Landing The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie God Emperor of Dune Rick Santorum Obstetrics Marilyn Monroe Poker jargon Laura Schlessinger Breech birth AFI 100 Years series Miss Saigon The nature of God in Western theology Anne Boleyn Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Time Out of Mind Childbirth Religion Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Androgen insensitivity syndrome Prostate cancer Transsexuality The Amber Spyglass Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Religious Society of Friends Theodicy Characters of Lost In vitro fertilisation Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Jennifer Lopez Friends Fahrenheit 9/11 Mojave people Care Bears Slow Train Coming Autism Transactional analysis Karen Horney Mary, the mother of Jesus Sex and the City Glen Jacobs Friedrich Schleiermacher One Life to Live Kimi Finster Boston Public One Tree Hill (TV series) Scientology beliefs and practices Sant Thakar Singh Rais massacre Avenue Q John Berryman Arjuna Aristotle The Inside The Emancipation of Mimi Lauren Bacall Married... with Children Ocean's Twelve Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind CPU cache Book of Isaiah Incarnations of Immortality Evil About a Boy Jacob Spidey Super Stories Prenatal diagnosis The Apprentice 2
