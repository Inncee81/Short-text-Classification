is this spotting the last two days i have had slight lower backache and cramping yesterday morning i had a few drops of light brown discharge and later last night this got darker brown but there was only about a pinch amount now today theres still nothing apart from when i went to the toilet and wiped again this is light brown sorry to be graphic but i need your views me n partner of years want a baby and havent had protected sex for about a month now is this spotting how soon can i take a preg test yes it sounds like spotting we need some more details though like when was the first day of your last period how long are your cycles and when do you think you ovulated implantation spotting usually happens about days before your period is due and lasts no more than a day or and there shouldn't be any bright red blood if it is implantation bleeding then the pregnancy hormone hcg would shop up in first morning urine within about days most likely but you could still get a false negative if you don't have your period when it is due then take another one at that time a lot of women can get a positive pregnancy test at days past ovulation or about days before their period is due just don't get yourself all worked up and overanalyzing every symptom because it will make you really disappointed if your period comes it takes most women months to conceive i had implantation bleeding with my son but the cramps didn't start until a few days later but it wasn't planned so i just felt like my period was coming period and early pregnancy symptoms are very similar also remember that implantation spotting is pretty rare and most women don't experience it good luck Menstrual cycle Pregnancy Fertility awareness Urinary incontinence Pregnancy test Oral contraceptive Endometriosis Miscarriage Polycystic ovary syndrome Birth control Obstetrics Puberty Emergency contraception Progesterone Gonorrhoea Ectopic pregnancy Prostate cancer Time Out of Mind HIV test Estrus cycle In vitro fertilisation Breastfeeding Diabetes mellitus Ovarian cyst Coeliac disease Abortion Childbirth Hypoglycemia Infertility Condom Anemia The Beatles discography Drug test Multiple sclerosis Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Clinical depression Niddah Ebola Solar eclipse Diabetic retinopathy Sexual abstinence Capercaillie Cytomegalovirus Sexual intercourse Vitamin C Psoriasis Hiberno-English Guinea pig Insulin Stroke Gynecologic hemorrhage Stomach cancer Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Blood type Endometrial cancer Cervical cancer Tocopherol Oral sex Turner syndrome Ben Johnson (athlete) Prolactinoma Toilet humour 2000 Australian Grand Prix Group A streptococcal infection Singlish Herpes simplex virus Premature birth Social rule Transsexuality Dialysis Postpartum depression Shaggy dog story Sleep Chronic fatigue syndrome Infantilism Prenatal diagnosis Gynaecology EastEnders Sharon Tate Traumatic incident reduction Malaria Haloperidol Jon Secada Gastroesophageal reflux disease Cliff Richard Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Menstrual cup The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Medicine Androgen insensitivity syndrome
