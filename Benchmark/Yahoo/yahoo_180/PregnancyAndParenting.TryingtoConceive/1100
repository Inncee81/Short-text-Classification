what could it be my husband and i have been trying to have our nd child for about months now we sorta guesstimated when i was ovulating based simple facts we tried almost every night we were supposed to for about a week my last period started july th then about days ago the th i started to notice some blood when my husband and i were having sex since then for about days i have had some light blood and just tonight i had a brown discharge sorry to be so graphic could this be implantation bleeding or an early period my period isnt due for about days i think i did a home pregnancy test tonight but it still said not pregnant what do you think and when is it a good time to test nurse alexa is my aunt im using her name there is a good possibility that it may be implantation bleeding because people that have experienced it say that it usually lasts around three days and is very very light if i were you i would wait a few more days and take another test and if it is negative wait another week or so and test again because if it is implantation bleeding then that means the egg and the sperm have just met so it may be a while before the test will show positive good luck best wishes and lots and lots of baby dust to you Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Oral contraceptive Miscarriage Hormone replacement therapy (trans) In vitro fertilisation Sexual reproduction Urinary incontinence Niddah Obstetrics Emergency contraception Childbirth EastEnders Ovarian cancer Prostate cancer Ovulation HIV test Endometriosis Gonorrhoea Melanie Wilkes Birth control Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Blood type Twin Puberty Abortion debate Prenatal diagnosis Gynecologic hemorrhage Neighbours Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Stroke Estrus cycle Diabetic retinopathy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an One Life to Live Abortion Ebola Ovary Friends Fertilisation Soap opera Rod Stewart Androgen insensitivity syndrome Breastfeeding Cytomegalovirus Polycystic ovary syndrome Endometrial cancer Ectopic pregnancy Triage Big Brother UK series 6 Female reproductive system (human) Coeliac disease Premature birth Maya calendar Drug test Sami Brady Social rule Tom Coburn Extreme Programming Piccolo Junior Saga Endometrium Babe Carey Bleed Like Me The Chemical Brothers Sexual intercourse Sperm Whale Cephalic disorder Bringing It All Back Home Clinical depression Timeline of alternative rock Multiple birth Medicine Bleed Like Me (single) The Jazz Singer Stem cell Blood on the Tracks Sam Sheppard Ventricular fibrillation Hiberno-English Victoria of the United Kingdom Psoriasis Fetal development Child sexuality Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Progesterone Lightning UK Singles Chart Billboard Hot 100 All My Children George W.
