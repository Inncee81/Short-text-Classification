do you think that this is odd me and my bf have been together for over years we are currently trying to have a baby we have been using the pull out method before we started trying is it odd that i never once got pregnant in those years using the pull out method by the way i'm he's statistics show that a couple using the pull out method could end up pregnant within a year i would like to say to hottiecj thanks for your rude comment but we are getting married in may hi there i don't think it's as odd as everyone else does people on this board love to say that the pull out method is a sure fire way to get pregnant but its actual failure rates are not that bad with perfect use with typical use says wikipedia http en wikipedia org wiki coitus interuptus my partner and i have also used the withdrawl method for three years without a pregnancy he's caused a pregnancy in the past and i miscarried at weeks about five years ago so there doesn't seem to be a problem with our fertilities presuming of couse that the miscarraige was one of the normal one in five fertilized eggs that fails to result in a viable pregnancy i ovulate and have a regular cycle we also avoid having sex when i'm ovulating i've spoken with my ob about it and he agrees that the pull out method can be very effective if the male is good at it my partner is and the other side of the coin of course is that if you are relying on any imperfect birth control you have to be prepared to embrace the consequences we like you are hoping one day for a baby so if we happen to be one of the of couples that will conceive unintentially while using the withdrawl method this year we will be happy to start our family don't stress over being infertile yet if you still haven't become pregnant after a year of keeping track your ovulation and him not pulling out then might be the time to investigate your fertility not now good luck to you Fertility awareness Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Infertility In vitro fertilisation Sexual intercourse Birth control Miscarriage Oral contraceptive Twin Abortion Sexual abstinence Childbirth Knots Landing Multiple birth Abortion debate Coitus interruptus Emergency contraception Obstetrics Androgen insensitivity syndrome Puberty Condom Prenatal diagnosis Polycystic ovary syndrome Pelvic inflammatory disease EastEnders Breastfeeding Marriage Ovulation Days of our Lives Safe sex Ectopic pregnancy History of sex Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Teenage pregnancy Estrus cycle Natural family planning Sexual reproduction Progesterone Neighbours Prolactinoma Coeliac disease Adoption Unemployment Psoriasis Craps Kodocha Theory of conduct Social rule Spina bifida Spanish verbs Childfree Polyamory Infantilism Urinary incontinence Maya calendar Autism Hillary Rodham Clinton Kender Human cloning Flower Elephant Gonorrhoea Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Famine Endometriosis Anne Boleyn Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Breech birth Tocopherol Microeconomics John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Herpes simplex virus Sexual dysfunction Human sexual behavior Intersexuality The Fairly OddParents Fertilisation Ovary Medical analysis of circumcision Drawn Together Health issues and the effects of cannabis Poker jargon Abortion in the United States Charmed Folic acid Laura Schlessinger Causality Satanic ritual abuse Chicken Biology and sexual orientation Inflation Divorce
