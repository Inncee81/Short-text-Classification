possibly pregnant vitamins the night of the th actually the th as it was in the morning my husband and i had unprotected sex my cycles are regular only fluctuating one day in length if at all and i should have been ovulating on the th just in case i end up pregnant i was thinking of taking a women's one daily multivitamin the equate version of women's one a day because i know it is important for women who are trying to conceive to take a supplement during and even before if possible their pregnancies it doesn't say anything about not taking it if you can be pregnant on the back so do you think it is safe would this help do you have any opinions on how possible it is that i could be pregnant my husband and i have had unprotected sex before but only during the infertile times in my cycle since i am very regular we aren't really trying to conceive but we weren't being too careful either i started my last period on july th and my period are always or days probability the vitamin contains mcg of folic acid which is what is recommended for pregnant women or people who are ttc it only contains the recommended amount of calcium and the recommended daily percent of vitamin a the two vitamins that i m pretty sure you don't want to have too much of during pregnancy it's pretty much identical to a prenatal vitamin's supplement facts i weigh lbs but don't worry i'm not nicole richie or anything i'm only ' and years old of course i will go to the doctor and get a prenatal vitamin if i am indeed pregnant but for the days i have until my period comes i would like to take something if it would be beneficial first of all you totally could be prego and good for you being so on top of your health folic acid is key it is awesome that your vitamin has fc in it but i really would say taking more would be better prenatal vitamins are the easiest way to know you getting all you need for you and your growing baby even if your just thinking about getting pregnant taking a prenatal is a great way to help your baby in those delicate first few weeks also try to find one with omega its a fatty acid found in certain types of fish like salmon it is very important for the brain development of the baby it is not always found in prenatals so in my case i just took extra supplements flax seeds have a good source of this as well calcium is super important as well if you don't have enough in your system the baby will begin to use your supply which is bad for your bones and theeth hope this helps a bit Pregnancy Omega-3 fatty acid Breastfeeding Fertility awareness Tocopherol Vitamin D Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Spina bifida Vitamin C Veganism Psoriasis Guinea pig Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Nutrition Alzheimer's disease Menstrual cycle Human skin color Vitamin Bipolar disorder Herpes simplex virus Osteoporosis Anorexia nervosa Multiple sclerosis Coronary heart disease Vegetarian nutrition Egg (food) Atherosclerosis Prenatal diagnosis Garlic Prenatal care Emergency contraception Coeliac disease Primidone Infertility Anencephaly Twin Abortion debate Antioxidant Prolactinoma Anemia Friends Dietary fiber Marriage Retinol Pet skunk Transsexuality Clinical depression Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Fecal incontinence In vitro fertilisation Gonorrhoea Fish oil Schizophrenia Breech birth AIDS Childbirth Isotretinoin Migraine Acne Theory of conduct Methotrexate Cyanocobalamin Urinary incontinence Chronic fatigue syndrome Social rule Premature birth Malaria Flax Estradiol Domestic rabbit Osteoarthritis Birth control Turner syndrome Endometriosis Atkins Nutritional Approach Vegetarianism Vitamin poisoning Midwifery Soybean Gastroesophageal reflux disease Neighbours Infantilism Rickets Tooth Trans fat Roe v.
