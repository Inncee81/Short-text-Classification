question about conceiving me and my hubby have been trying to conceive for going on months i have had pain in my ovaries and abnormal bleeding so i got checked out and was diagnosed with bacterial vaginosis and recieved antibotics so now the pain is gone and bleeding is back normal my question is would this have effected me not getting pregnant because i got an ultrasound done to my ovaries and the doctors said everything looks normal and please no rude answers thanks alot hi there bacterial vaginosis is basically a vaginal infection this would have nothing to do with your reproductive organs and being fertile so the fact that you've not gotten pregnant in months has nothing to do with a vaginal infection the average couple can take up to a year to conceive so at months you are still well within the norm you could try an ovulation predictor kit an opk will tell you when you are fertile using one will confirm you ovulate and confirm you are having sex precisely at ovulation i would try it for at least one cycle see how you like it it's good you cleared up your vaginal infection because while it doesn't impede fertility it can cause problems in pregnancy good luck Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Pregnancy Infertility Oral contraceptive Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Puberty Miscarriage Polycystic ovary syndrome In vitro fertilisation Endometriosis Pelvic inflammatory disease Obstetrics Stomach cancer Ovarian cyst Childbirth Gonorrhoea Ectopic pregnancy Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Endometrial cancer Gynaecology Ovary Estrus cycle Progesterone Fertilisation Sexual reproduction Sexual intercourse Abortion Ovulation Autism Sex assignment Prostate cancer Androgen insensitivity syndrome Chlamydia Anal sex Cancer Guinea pig Female reproductive system (human) Prenatal diagnosis Cervical cancer Chronic fatigue syndrome Cephalic disorder AIDS Urinary incontinence Intersexuality Medical analysis of circumcision Carpel Habitual abortion Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency Sexual dysfunction Emergency contraception Coeliac disease Premature birth Intersex surgery Flowering plant Amenorrhoea Strap-on dildo Pneumonia Oral sex Multiple sclerosis Leukemia Pregnancy test Depo Provera Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Breech birth Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Medicine HIV test Tobacco smoking Placental abruption Herpes simplex virus Human chorionic gonadotropin Estradiol Sexual abstinence Tsetse fly Cirrhosis Human sexuality Intact dilation and extraction Flower Breastfeeding Endocarditis Malaria Gynecologic hemorrhage Hepatitis C HIV Spina bifida Psoriasis History of intersex surgery First aid Diabetes mellitus Crohn's disease Diabetic retinopathy Bipolar disorder Vulvovaginal health
