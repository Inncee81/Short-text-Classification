could i be pregnant after miscarriages in the last year my husband and i are ttc my period was due today and i took a hpt this morning and it came back neg i have a day cycle and according to an online ovulation calculator i should have ovulated july we tried on july what are the chances that i just tested too early and my hcg is not strong enough yet how long should i wait to retest if i don't get my period for those of you who are also ttc especially after miscarrying you'll understand how the wait is just awful and the temptation to keep on taking hpt's is so strong i haven't said anything to my husband that i was due for my period today because i feel so bad to get his hopes up and then get my period any advice or suggestions is greatly appreciated thanks ovulation occurs days before you next period is due so if you have a day cycle you will ovulate on day give or take a day either way if you have had miscarriages get a got vitamin like centrum and break it in have before taking it then get wheat germ oil in capsules the wheat germ oil has trace minerals and vitamin e in it that helps the integrity of your blood vessels get some sub lingual vitamin b they do have a brand called b total sub lingual that is good it will help you with morning sickness they used wheat germ oil for a long time for infertility but have dropped it by the wayside because now they have infertility drugs you need to try to eat a healthy diet and not junk food wait until you are absolutely sure that you are pregnant do get the vitamins and wheat germ oil capsles take these and it will help you it is what i recommended in the hospital to those who had miscarriages i would usually see them again in a year to have a baby when my son in his mid 's married his wife in her mid 's she had been married before and never used birth control and never had gotten pregnant she complained of being tired all the time so i brought her the above mentioned vitamins she was good about taking them with in a year they had a baby i still smile about that if you start spotting and think you are pregnant go to your ob dr because you made need progesterone for a while to keep you from miscarrying normally the ovary produces it during implantation to help with implantation if the ovary does not produce the hormone then the implantation will not take Menstrual cycle Pregnancy Polycystic ovary syndrome Tocopherol Fertility awareness In vitro fertilisation Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Ovarian cancer Miscarriage Prostate cancer Puberty Oral contraceptive Obstetrics Human chorionic gonadotropin Ovulation Stomach cancer Ovary Pregnancy test Coeliac disease Infertility Folic acid Birth control Emergency contraception Morning sickness Vitamin C Breastfeeding Endometriosis Cryptorchidism Vitamin Androgen insensitivity syndrome Nutrition Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Chronic fatigue syndrome Veganism Acne Vitamin D Fruit Urinary incontinence Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Twin Psoriasis Egg (food) Friends Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Estrus cycle Sexual reproduction Anemia Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Cancer Bodybuilding Milk Knots Landing Vegetarian nutrition Anne Boleyn Antioxidant Hypoglycemia Neighbours Fecal incontinence Coronary heart disease Kodocha Paget's disease of bone Guinea pig Anorexia nervosa Omega-3 fatty acid Oily fish Elephant Bipolar disorder Dieting Obesity Diarrhea Food Gynaecology Abortion Tooth Infantilism HIV test Baldness treatments Flowering plant Common cold Premature birth Clinical depression Cyanocobalamin Tlingit Dietary supplement Cytomegalovirus Endocrine system Food guide pyramid Ectopic pregnancy Scar Pelvic inflammatory disease Flour Potato Endocrinology
