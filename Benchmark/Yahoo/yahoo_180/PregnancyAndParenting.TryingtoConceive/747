i want a baby so bad help i want her to have a baby but i dont know if she is it isnt something i can talk to her about she said a few months ago she was ready but i dont know some one help and when is the best time to try i understand you not wanting to talk to her about this for fear of what might happen women can be unpredictable especially when confronted with something they aren't really ready for but if you don't talk to her you could just be setting yourself up for a long sad wait it's nice to hear a man for a change say that he desperately wants a baby most men have to be pushed and prodded into agreeing to it what you need to do first is sit down and write out your feelings on paper and organize your thoughts and what you want to say you can even practice it a few times if you want and then approach her don't try to corner her as she comes in from work or while you're in the middle of making love or something crazy find a time when you guys are both calm and relaxed and gently bring up your desire to have a baby if she hesistates at all then don't push her into it because she will hate you for it Shaggy dog story Jon Secada Humphrey Bogart Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Milton H.
