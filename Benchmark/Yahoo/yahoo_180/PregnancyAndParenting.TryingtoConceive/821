ovulation mood swings pregnancy i have been reading some past q a's and from what i can gather it is normal to have mood swings after ovulating so my question is if you fell pregnant during ovulation would these mood swings still occur also i usually get sore breasts a week before my period is due but this time i have had sore breasts since a few days after my period why is this i used some ovulation tests and i think i ovulated between the st and th of august could the sore breasts be related to pregnancy if i was feeling the symptom as early as when i ovulated if you check your boobs for veins this may help sometimes they will stay tender after your period but if you notice over the next few weeks the veins are really blue and prominent this could be a sign of pregnancy also if you brush your teeth and you gag take a hpt had experience in both the above good luck Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Pregnancy Obstetrics Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Polycystic ovary syndrome Ovulation Pregnancy test Oral contraceptive Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Estrus cycle Breastfeeding Stomach cancer Progesterone Cytomegalovirus Haloperidol Equine conformation Ovarian cancer Miscarriage Abortion Emergency contraception Traumatic brain injury Urinary incontinence Psoriasis Folic acid Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia In vitro fertilisation Ovarian cyst Breast Prostate cancer Group A streptococcal infection Hypoglycemia Bipolar disorder First aid Breast cancer Alcoholism Endometriosis Paroxetine Endometrial cancer Niddah Clinical depression HIV test Cephalic disorder Chlorpromazine Stroke Gingivitis Human chorionic gonadotropin Prolactinoma Ectopic pregnancy Diabetes mellitus Syphilis Maprotiline Androgen insensitivity syndrome Gynecologic hemorrhage Oral sex Childbirth Cocaine Mouth ulcer Lucille Ball Elephant Coeliac disease Infertility Hip fracture Clomipramine Adult attention-deficit disorder Turner syndrome Premature birth HIV Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Gonorrhoea Guinea pig Psychosis Borderline personality disorder Stillbirth Sharon Tate Graves-Basedow disease Bulgarian language Infectious mononucleosis Radiation therapy Birth control Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency Spina bifida Dog Cancer Tocopherol Chronic fatigue syndrome Postpartum depression Grammatical mood Schizophrenia Antiphospholipid syndrome Cat Aortic dissection Methotrexate Deep vein thrombosis Hypertension Grammatical tense Sexual reproduction Isotretinoin
