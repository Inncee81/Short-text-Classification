the duggars just had their th child when is enough kids enough i became interested in the duggars when i saw their first special on cable when they were expecting their th child i thought gosh thats a lot of kids i also thought there was no way they could have more i continued to follow them and to my surprise it seems like everytime you look up michelle duggar is pregnant again they recently had their th and many sites have become devoted to debating their choice to continue to have children and though i believe that its god's will for a woman to reproduce and that we shouldnt interfer w that but i wonder when is enough kids enough although the duggars are not the only large family chronicled the jeubs and heffners are other large families who have just as many kids and similar ways of life they are the most famous im curious as to know has this effected moms health in anyway being that she spent about the last yrs having kids and when do they find time to have sex tell me what you all think i have watched a few of the shows and she said her self that the older kids take care of the younger kids except for the little babies i don't think that is right i do not think that you should have a crap load of kids if you cannot care for them yourself it appears as though the kids are sheltered from the outside world i am not against thrift store shopping as i have found some wonderful things in thrift stores but i think if they cannot afford to buy their kids clothes that are not used that they need to stop reproducing they said they only buy used clothes i think the prairie ish clothes are pretty bad not only is their mom a baby factory but she dresses them in used prairie clothes i feel very bad for those kids they do not appear to have any sense of self they are like little christian robots Clothing About a Boy Abortion debate The Contender (television series) Humphrey Bogart Avenue Q Infantilism Married... with Children Gender role Theory of conduct Sexual orientation The Fairly OddParents K' Kyle Broflovski Sesame Street EastEnders My Life as a Teenage Robot The Adventures of Pete & Pete Futurama (TV series - season 2) Craps Baby Blues Shaggy dog story Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film) Care Bears Sex and the City Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Koopa Kid Destiny's Child The Inside Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Cliff Richard Futurama (TV series - season 5) Strap-on dildo Coin collecting Doug Treehouse of Horror V Sento Sears Holdings Corporation Salvation Army Britney Spears Birth control Charles Goodyear Code: Lyoko Science fiction on television Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Melanie Wilkes Knots Landing Shit Malcolm in the Middle Series finale Transsexuality Japanese tea ceremony Childfree Jennifer Lopez Teamo Supremo Beavis and Butt-head Kim Possible Evil Phoebe Buffay's songs Kid Rock Neighbours Church of Christ, Scientist Theodicy Rich Mullins Simone Weil Friends Social rule SpongeBob SquarePants Human sexual behavior Social aspects of clothing Kimi Finster Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Adoption Prostate cancer The Catcher in the Rye W.
