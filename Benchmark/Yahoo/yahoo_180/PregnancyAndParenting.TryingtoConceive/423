i'm just curious about the chances a woman would have to become pregnant if she had unprotected sex and then started her period a day later as usual with no changes to her normal flow and if she was pregnant would she already show signs less than two weeks later me and my friend were debating this and i'm on the side that she couldn't be pregnant and less than weeks is way too early to have morning sickness or what not unless it's a phantom pregnancy d the chances she could be pregnant are extremely slim if she had a normal period following the sex if it was a light or an abnormal period then the chances are even higher because it may have not been a period at all it may have been spotting which can occur with ovulation or break though bleeding two weeks after sex is not to early to experiance pregnancy symptoms even morning sickness have her take a test to be sure hth Pregnancy Obstetrics Fertility awareness Turner syndrome Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Premature birth Cephalic disorder In vitro fertilisation Prostate cancer Polycystic ovary syndrome Stroke Ovarian cancer Diabetic retinopathy Pregnancy test Endometrial cancer Infertility Emergency contraception Abortion Twin Prolactinoma Childbirth Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Abortion debate Anemia Morning sickness Psoriasis Estrus cycle Cytomegalovirus Pelvic inflammatory disease Ectopic pregnancy Cancer Prenatal diagnosis Folic acid Ovulation Birth control Stillbirth Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Urinary incontinence Thalidomide Hyperemesis gravidarum Schizophrenia Multiple sclerosis Anal sex Traumatic brain injury Gynecologic hemorrhage Radiation poisoning Von Willebrand disease Neighbours Acute myelogenous leukemia Ovarian cyst Androgen insensitivity syndrome Atrial septal defect Oral sex Stomach cancer AIDS Hepatitis C Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Diabetes mellitus Progesterone Big Brother UK series 6 Haloperidol Coeliac disease Ebola Vitamin C Autism Duchenne muscular dystrophy Hypoglycemia Seizure Spina bifida Cardiac arrhythmia Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Hearing impairment Sexual dysfunction EastEnders Breastfeeding Decompression sickness Friends Malaria Breech birth Sex assignment Sex Pistols Narcolepsy Sex and the City Psychosis Anencephaly Intelligence quotient Human height Sex education Chlamydia First aid Teenage pregnancy Knots Landing Placental abruption
