can a spider seriously hurt a hamster i woke up this morning and found a large spider in my hamsters cage he was up in his lookout and the spider was below in his main cage i got rid of the spider it was alive for spider lovers out there i did not squish it i released outside where i live we do not really get poisonous spiders my hamster seems fine but it is hard to tell since he is sleeping but sleeping in his usual spot in his usual way would my little guy have killed the spider if it tried to attack bite him i would think that spiders pose the same threat to small animals as they do to us poisonous or not i'd think that your biggest concern would have been spider bites a spider bite can be painful and in some case maybe cause an allergic reaction depending on the temperament of your hamster i'd imagine that he'd probably stay clear of the intruder until you removed it unless the spider openly intruded upon it in which case your hammy probably would either fled or fought overall i'd say just keep an eye out for unwelcome critters in your hammy's cage but don't fret too much about it Hamster Spider Doom enemies Blood (computer game) Tarantula Unreal Venom (poison) First aid The Legend of Zelda series enemies Garfield Spider-Man (film) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Donald Neilson Characters of Naruto Cat Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an David Bowie Minor Harry Potter Beasts Sub-Zero Naruto jutsu Professional wrestling match types Shannara creatures Sin City Spider-Man Vegeta Animal Liberation Front Monster Rancher monsters Hobo spider Black widow spider Poison Piccolo Junior Saga Shaggy dog story Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater Dog One Piece minor characters Shark Monkey Year of the Spider Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Mushroom hunting Pok__mon Abilities Anxiety The Big Sleep Pok__mon Live!
