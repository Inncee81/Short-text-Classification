my new rats are biting and drawing blood and i have rats in another cage and this two are in another cage drawing blood as in they bite you or bite each other it sounds like these new ones either weren't socialized well or are very scared or if they're adolescent males it could be aggression caused by too much testosterone which may mean the offender will need to be neutered to hopefully prevent the aggressive behavior if they're just biting you and not each other it's going to take some time to convince them that the big scary hand coming toward them isn't going to hurt them a soft voice and treats may help but some take a long time to come around and some never do if they're biting each other and drawing blood separate them if both bite then both may need to be neutered if they're young males check with the vet if one bites the other you may want to relocate the one that doesn't bite to the cage with the others but do this cautiously introduce the 'new' rat to the others on neutral ground outside the cage and use a bit of vanilla to mask the difference in scent and prevent aggression Ferret Guinea pig Cat Fancy rat Domestic rabbit Pet skunk Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Kim Possible Castration Gender Bulgarian language Testosterone Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Legend of Zelda series enemies Dog Puberty Mosquito House Mouse Alcoholism Blood (computer game) Kakapo Poker jargon Dog training Zone of the Enders: The Fist of Mars Adolescence Breastfeeding Ancient Greek Pedophilia Milton H.
