where should i go to get a guinea pig are they a good childerns pet so im and im think about getting a guinea pig i was wondering if i was making the right decision about a guinea pig it would be living outside and in a really big cage i would get so they would have company i would most likly get a male and femal i would be able to spen alot of time with them and i would have food ready and water ready at all times if you could just let me know if im doing the thing that would be great if you have a oppinion about another animal please aware me of this thank you i've already had a rat two mice and a hamster i loved all but my rat was my favorite the best place to get a guinea pig would be from a friend or breeder but a clean pet store with healthy friendly looking guinea pigs will do guinea pigs bite when they're scared so be careful when handling them for the first time i suggest you get two of the same gender unless you want babies and as cute as babies are they really are a handful i know this from personal expierience it's true some guinea pigs do bite and if your unsure about that whole ordeal you might want to get a pet that's less likely to bite like a rat who are great with children anyway good luck with your guinea pigs Hamster Guinea pig Domestic rabbit Rat Pet Pig Animal testing Pet skunk Taboo food and drink Care Bears Pig (zodiac) Pet store Garfield Fancy rat Timon and Pumbaa Ferret El Goonish Shive House Mouse Chicken Breastfeeding Rodent Ranma __ characters Cat Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Ed, Edd n Eddy Animal Liberation Front Play School Dog Chinchilla Kim Possible Eric Cartman Azumanga Daioh Kangaroo Murinae Pok__mon Live!
