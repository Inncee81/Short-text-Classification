i have new pet rats i'm told they should be handled and played with for about an hour each day i don't mind handling them at all but i would love to just let them be near me and not have to worry constantly that they were going to run away and get lost somewhere are they prone to doing that type of thing or would they stay near me and not go chew on a wire somewhere my rats have little harness leashes made for ferrets it's very adjustable because they have to be tight so they can't wiggle out if i have them in a place where they might get too far away from me or there are other dangers i keep the leashes on but i usually play with them in the bathroom it's a safe place with no wires no other animals nothing for them to crawl under where i can't reach them and easy to clean up in case they pee in this safe place they can learn to come to me when i call and just have fun and i don't have to worry about them getting away or getting hurt Ferret Dog training Fancy rat Hamster Leash Paragliding Kitesurfing Social rule Unclean animals Domestic rabbit Obedience training Pet skunk Ethernet Strap-on dildo The Fairly OddParents Energy development Trapping Dog agility Macbeth Sin City Diving RuneScape quests Textile manufacturing Rat Professional wrestling match types Garfield Kim Possible Aladdin (1992 film) Ai Yori Aoshi Dog collar Aerial (dance move) The Shining (film) Naval mine Ron Weasley Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Timon and Pumbaa Scuba set Cruising (maritime) Knife Glossary of climbing terms Petplay Epistemology Snowboard Lady and the Tramp Sail-plan Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Sailing Mattress Tag Have I Got News For You Guinea pig Team Fortress Classic Papa's Got a Brand New Badge The Secret of NIMH Wire wrap The Adventures of Pete & Pete Car handling Dead Like Me Battles of Lexington and Concord Comanche Ron and Fez Jon Secada Fecal incontinence Pet Sematary Blonde on Blonde AFI 100 Years series Sundial The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents Perl Futurama (TV series - season 5) Breastfeeding Saturday Night Live commercial Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles Chinchilla Cat Handloading Spirit rover timeline for 2004 February The Beach Boys Elevator Care Bears Spidey Super Stories Humphrey Bogart Stereoscopy Land mine Craps True Crime: Streets of LA Glossary of nautical terms Behaviorism Thermostat Pet Ex-gay The Death Gate Cycle The Tracey Ullman Show shorts House Mouse Guadalupe Mountains National Park One Tree Hill (TV series) Chewing gum Equine conformation Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March
