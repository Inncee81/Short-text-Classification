winter white dwarf females chinese dwarf females i just went to the store and bought two winter white female hamsters they were in the same cage so there were no fighting issues i want to get chinese dwarf hamsters too i want to know from a reliable source if this is ok because i don't want to have to return them i'd like to keep all of them in a large cage is that possible without any fighting killing i have two female dwarf hamsters from the same litter we adopted them both from our animal shelter after a hamster is about weeks old they will start to fight any other hamsters that are in the same cage all hamsters aren't socail when we had brought them home they fine for the first few days but then they started to fight we came home one day about a month after adopting them to one of them with a bloody eye luckily she was ok but we quickly seperated them and that's where they are now getting more dwarf hamsters will only make it harder watch the two dwarf hamsters that you just got if you notice any fighting please remove one and put her in a seperate cage see if you get more and they start to fight will be cleaning cages every week it will be a lot better and you will be saving money and time if you just keep the two that you have now i hope that this changes your mind a little bit thanks and good luck with the two dwarfs future vet Hamster Guinea pig Domestic rabbit RuneScape quests Pet skunk The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Tenshinhan Estrus cycle Johnny Cage Social rule Ferret Fancy rat Mixed martial arts Golden Hamster Skinny Puppy Bob and George Days of our Lives Theory of conduct The Ashlee Simpson Show Drizzt Do'Urden Equine conformation Dorama RuneScape locations Hoarding Eddie Guerrero Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Treehouse of Horror V Zones of EverQuest The Hobbit (1977 film) House Mouse Animal testing Dog Luke Skywalker Japanese calendar The Death Gate Cycle Rings of Power The Life and Times of Juniper Lee StarCraft: Uprising Money Paintball Gandalf Time Out of Mind Red Dwarf characters Twelve Monkeys Sub-Zero Battles of Lexington and Concord Fur farming Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories Bat Boy Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Chicken Pysanka Ture Nerman Chinchilla M16 (rifle) Pinky and the Brain British Rail Class 86 Locations in the Warcraft Universe USS Yorktown (CV-10) American lobster Chu-Han contention Pok__mon Chronicles John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Maiev Shadowsong Cruising (maritime) Internet fraud Trapping Daylight saving time Diseases of the honeybee Sharon Tate Renewable energy Chinese calendar Chris Jericho Meriones unguiculatus Pikmin RuneScape economy Progress of the SARS outbreak Poker jargon Alaga__sia Vegeta Saruman Red Dwarf Supernova Pet store Marcus Licinius Crassus Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Runaways (comics) Butters Stotch L__ Bu Dates in Star Wars Narnia Paul Levesque UK Singles Chart MMORPG Sacrifice Animal Crossing TNA Lockdown One Ring The Codex Diwali
