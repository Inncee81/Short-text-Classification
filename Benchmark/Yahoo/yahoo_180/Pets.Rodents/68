can i keep two male mice together in a ten gallon tank i want to start raising mice and i heard from a bunch of rat and mouse clubs that male mice can live together but i've also heard that they'll fight eventually and it gets really bad so should i keep one male mouse alone or should i keep two and in how large of a tank don't worry about me breeding because its not like they don't have a purpose yes especially if they are brothers kept together since birth most american breeders never try it because they think all male mice are mean but a select few do including myself almost all european breeders and mouse owners keep males together american breeders say its because european mice have better temperments but this is a bunch of bull all male mice have the same chance of getting along or not after breeding they may fight though mostly because you have to seperate them when you use one for breeding House Mouse Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Guinea pig American Pit Bull Terrier Domestic rabbit Rat Cat Docking Staffordshire Bull Terrier Dog show Mickey Mouse Mouse Discus (fish) Dog breeding German Shepherd Dog Monster Rancher monsters American Kennel Club Breed registry Dog breed Fast breeder Pit bull Jack Russell Terrier Animal testing Mickey Mouse Club Hamster Selective breeding Hybrid Tenterfield Terrier Cattle Livestock Elephant Pet store Ferret Dog Border Terrier Chicken Australian Shepherd Platypus Kakapo Great Dane Mixed-breed dog Domestication Dachshund Modest Mouse Dairy cattle Bird migration Alaskan husky Tasmanian Devil Dobermann Puppy mill Bullfighting Feral cat Breed standard Common Eider Irish Wolfhound Mouse (computing) Game controller Sunday Silence Aquarium Animal husbandry Taboo food and drink Genetically modified organism Havanese Fancy rat Plant breeding Black Pete Best of Breed Fish farming Mike Smith (jockey) Domestic sheep Chocobo Gay slang Rat Terrier Domestic goat Ralph Bunche Griffon Bruxellois Moose Canary Rottweiler Disney's House of Mouse New York-New Jersey English Marine aquarium Tarantula Dog hybrids and crossbreeds Decepticon Labrador Retriever Tennessee Walker Artificial selection Whippet Britney Spears German Shorthaired Pointer Nuclear power Nitrous oxide Inception of Darwin's theory Saga (band) All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival) True Crime: Streets of LA Rabbit Charly Garc__a
