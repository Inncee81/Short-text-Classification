what kind of pet is best i want a small rodent like a hamster or guinea pig something like that but what would be best less stinky and more friendly easiest to take care of and cute i already have dogs so i want a small rodent i've had cats before and dont want any more i dont like birds and not enough room for any more dogs something small is perfect i spend time with each of my dogs and theirs people in my house so they get plenty of attention all of them are up to date on their shots and checkups our shih tzu goes to the groomer every weeks hamsters tend to be a little grumpy and will bite if woken up during the day but are easy to care for because they don't need that much handling do be sure to handle one if you get one though so it'll become friendlier if you don't handle them at all they can become lethargic and mean guinea pigs a good choice but take up a lot of room 'cause they need big cages and need attention rats very friendly and smart but need lots of handling and time out of the cage mice can be skittish at first and are liable to jump out of your hands if you aren't careful but can still become tame with patience don't take up much room too and can have relatively small cages compared to other rodents not sure about gerbils kinda ironic given my username but oh well d Hamster Guinea pig Pet Fancy rat Rodent Domestic rabbit Garfield Pet skunk Chinchilla Dog RuneScape quests Gerbil Animal testing House Mouse Rat Cat Muroidea Flea Ferret Taboo food and drink Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Care Bears Eumuroida Brown Rat Monster Rancher monsters Chicken Pet store Exotic pet Kangaroo Kim Possible Cricetidae Murinae Professional wrestling match types Taikyoku shogi Homer's Enemy Feral cat Domestication Mouse Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Shih Tzu Tai shogi Bat Social rule Canary Humphrey Bogart Pekingese Equine conformation Mickey Mouse Meriones unguiculatus Blood (computer game) The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Conker's Bad Fur Day Mouse-like hamster The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents Socialization Unreal Chinese astrology Estrus cycle Island Fox Creatures in Bionicle Internet phenomenon Invader Zim Lemming Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Animal rights The Sims Trapping Degu Dog training Stoat The Legend of Zelda series enemies Island restoration Animal Liberation Front Falconry Azumanga Daioh Shaggy dog story Pig (zodiac) Lisa the Vegetarian Nocturnal animal Alaskan husky Border Collie Meat Theory of conduct Rabbit Golden Hamster Disney's House of Mouse People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Brown Bear Gambian pouch rat Kender Russian space dogs The Family from One End Street The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius New World rats and mice Galaxy Angel Livestock Computer numbering formats The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland Dean Koontz
