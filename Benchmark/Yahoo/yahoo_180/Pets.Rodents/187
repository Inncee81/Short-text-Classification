help with my grumpy guinea pig i got my guinea pig from a pet store and had him for about yrs he also had a mate who died a while ago even with a mate he was grumpy and now on his own he is he s always nipped and as a result i handled him less for the last year ive tried to handle him more and it doesnt seem to have worked he is alot calmer and has never broken the skin but god it hurts and i thought guinea s were meant to be fab and for kids my other nipped too and i handled them correctly as babies help me do you think getting a guinea pig from a breeder would make a better pet or have you had any of these experiences getting a pig from a breeder is not going to help some guinea pigs are naturally a bit grumpier than others just like people it's good that you're handling him more and as you said he's gotten calmer most pigs do calm down in their old age guinea pigs do nip as a sign of affection but if he's doing it all the time it's not likely to be that i had female pigs and one used to bite the others ear she was always really p d off about something do guinea pigs get pmt however once the other one died and i put a nice neutered male in with her she get a lot more friendly and much easier to handle i've also had a really aggressive male pig neutered and this helped him a lot it's maybe just the particular mate that he had he didn't get on with does he get out to run about some guinea pigs do get grumpy if they get no exercise let him out to have a wee run about and keep an eye on him if you're the one letting him out he'll feel better towards you best of luck with this one Guinea pig Domestic rabbit Cat Pet skunk Hamster Care Bears Dog 2000 Australian Grand Prix Grumpy's Three Wishes Horse breaking Social rule Spider Pet Stuttering Ranma __ characters Monster Rancher monsters New Guinea Pig Theory of conduct Land of the Lost (1974 television series) characters and species Castration Tarantula Donkey Kender Estrus cycle Garfield Debugging Domestication Charles Ives The Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation Taboo food and drink Baboon Pitaten Nine Inch Nails Animal Crossing Urinary incontinence German Shepherd Dog Dragon Booster Atomic Kitten Cheetah Negima Pet Sounds Dragons (Pern) Kim Possible Elephant South Park Breastfeeding Border Collie Semen Lycanthropy Radiohead Dog training New Zealand English Rottweiler Vulgar Latin Southeast Asia Platypus The Critic Orgasm The Pet Sounds Sessions Vitamin C Gender God Emperor of Dune Side Characters (Xenosaga) Fancy rat Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Experiment Domestic goat Lion Nuclear power Shark Animal Liberation Front Rocko's Modern Life EastEnders Kimi Finster Chicken Sexual differentiation Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Supporting Characters (Xenogears) Bugs Bunny The Apprentice 2 Socialization Australian Cattle Dog Characters in the Smurfs Jack Russell Terrier Panthera hybrid John Peel Prisoner's dilemma Super Mario 128 The Contender (television series) Taikyoku shogi Manx (cat) Gender-neutral language Animal euthanasia God and gender Craps Ed, Edd n Eddy Rei Ayanami
