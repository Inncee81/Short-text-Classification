why does my guinea pig bite me when i handle it i dont handle it wrong we got it months ago and it always runs away from me and straight back to its cage and im not evil if theres a way to disapline it ho do i do that hey you no don't discipline your guinea pig as prey animals they are naturally skittish i've had mine for over a year and although they are quite socialized they always run when its time to be picked up how big is your cage trying to pull a bigass guinea pig out the small door of those little cages is just asking for trouble i'd make sure i had a cage big enough for two pigs about sq feet i would advise you to make the room very quiet when you want to talk to your little guy offer yummy treats and do this and only this for a couple days after that pick him up very carefully you cannot scoop them up with one hand because they are not as robust as they look there bones are very brittle don't show fear of being bit just pick it up with two hands hold your piggie to your chest for about minutes they have very tiny bladders and talk gently to it while holding and pet gently put him back and try it again a few times per day but always speak gently and softly for a second or two before picking up your pig will come around you might also consider getting another guinea pig for a companion guinea pigs are highly social and often get depressed when housed alone Guinea pig Domestic rabbit Hamster Ferret Aerial (dance move) RuneScape quests Chinchilla RuneScape Random Events Shaggy dog story Equine conformation Dog Chicken Unreal Dog training Shark Fancy rat Diving Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Swingout Lisa the Vegetarian Bat Pig Fishing Blonde on Blonde Trapping Salad Fingers Professional wrestling match types Timon and Pumbaa Menstrual cup Professional wrestling throws Domestication Customs and etiquette of Japan Eric Cartman Tetrapod Whaling Knife Breath of Fire III Daffy Duck Drill bit Chopsticks Conspiracy (TNG episode) Bladderwort Professional wrestling holds Japanese tea ceremony Billboard Hot 100 Wood carving The Ersatz Elevator Milton H.
