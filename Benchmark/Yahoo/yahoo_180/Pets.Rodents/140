my hamster almost everyday when i wake up i look in his lil cage and i c water im wondering if he is sweating or if it is the water that he got on his body giving himself a shower basically can hamsters sweat and if they can what should i do if you have a male hamster you will notice a large dark patch of fur on both sides of the hip area these are called scent glands and every so often your hamster will rub against certain areas of the cage to mark his scent and claim the cage as his own hamsters are fiercly territorial and must be housed seperatly often the oil from the scent glands can give the fur a slightly greasy damp look this could be the cause however if your hamster is defenatly wet like water has splashed over him then get a cloth and dry him immediatly and find out where the wetness is coming from hamsters are dry desert animals and contact with water on their bodies can make them very sick Hamster Animal communication Sweating Dog Trapping Fancy rat Sento Skunk Hyperthermia Chinchilla Japanese toilet Fur farming Golden Hamster Clothing Jock itch Skin Cat Ferret Hypothermia Territory (animal) Platypus Sauna Hair Domestic rabbit Diving suit Hiking Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor Pet skunk Dandruff Sugar Glider Soap Cheetah Earwax Leaf Social aspects of clothing Fire extinguisher Printmaking Leather Survival skills Gland Pottery Mattress House Mouse Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Linen Hydrotherapy Spotted Skunk Sexual fetishism Perfume Psoriasis Cruising (maritime) Sulfuric acid Salad Fingers 2003 United States Grand Prix Professional wrestling aerial techniques Humidity Great Basin Textile manufacturing Jam (TV series) Towel Potto Carnivorous plant Tlingit The Young Ones (TV series) Thermoregulation Fecal incontinence Olfaction Desert Beaver Hippopotamus Common cold El Ni__o Sage Epithelium Autonomic nervous system Guinea pig Rebreather American Beaver Upholstery Bottlenose Dolphin Bathing Thermal power station Radiation therapy Utah Dehydration Semen Geography of China Sock Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Lake District Horse Mortal Kombat Priestly Code Tanning Mosquito Swamp cooler Yarrow Glossary of partner dance terms
