mexico and the world cup how good are mexico's chances of winning the world cup and be realistic i mean i'm a big fan and i would do anything to see them win before i die hopefully they win soon though it just seems to me every time they play good they choke i mean the loss to argentina last world cup they played their asses off but still lost that is rather acceptable they couldn't have played any better it just wasn't our year to win but in korea when they got usa i was like finally we're going to advance and they played horrible i mean they start off every world cup playing like gods then just choke later i mean what's the saying translated version so all english speakers can understand once again we played like never before once again we lost like always i mean its true they play amazing but just can't manage to win it all they beat brazil in the final in the confederations cup in and i thought would be the year but i was wrong i just hope they'll win with the young kids the new kids coming up the u champions give me slight hope but that's about it i just hope they can bring a world cup home when they grow up at taurus i'm not stating mexico is going to win the world cup if only you would read and quit being so ignorant i myself said to all those that were going to answer to please be realistic so i'm guessing you're the poor kid seeing as you can't read any more answers would be appreciated by those who can read of course realistically the chances of mexico winning it in are ok because brasil argentina italy france etc will be competitive if mexico wanted a better chance then it is mainly up to hugo because he will be the one deciding who will play and how they will play unless the federation replaces hugo lavolpe did a good job in ' with a team that was not the best but still did very well much better performance than in ' the problem with hugo's team is that the defense seems to be shaky and too many scoring chances are given to the opponents if hugo is the coach in mexico will have difficulties again because hugo seems unwilling to make the necessary changes like dunga is doing in brasil if there is a new coach who is not afraid to use younger and better players and to change the style of play then their chances are very good Norway national football team Brazil national football team Germany national football team Football World Cup Gustavo Kuerten Italy national football team Gordon Banks Alex Ferguson Football World Cup 2002 Peter Shilton Football World Cup 1986 R.S.C.
