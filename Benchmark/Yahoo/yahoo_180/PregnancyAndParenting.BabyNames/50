why do so many people insist on giving their kids these unusual names that nobody can pronounce studies show that these poor children are automatically at a disadvantage to people with normal names it has been shown that when looking for a job a lot of people with these original names are not called first just because of their name if you have people with the exact same skillset then michael or calvin will be chosen before deandre or gob yeah someone was actually going to name their kid that i understand your idea of being original and unique but should it really be at the expense of your child not to mention spending their entire life having to tell people how to pronounce and spell it at the very least can you give them a normal middlle name so they have something to fall back on when they get older and need a real name weeder sammy understood but i'm not talking about others just us americans of course someone form a different country will have a name m ore geared to their ethnicity dynamic my family is from europe but i'm not going to name my kid gunther for crissake maybe your kids success should be more important than your heritage or you could go back where it's normal i guess most of these parents do not think about what kind of impact the names will have when the children grow up what sounds unique and cute now can really have a downside when the child enters to job force you are absolutely correct in saying that kids with normal names will get the job before the unusual one i see this happening all the time at my place of employment hopefully parents can perhaps use the cute name for a middle name and save their child future Theory of conduct The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Garfield Rich Mullins The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie She Loves You Freeters Hangul Justification (theology) Education in the People's Republic of China Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Inflation Our Gang Original sin Baby Blues Unemployment Intelligence quotient CPU design Crossword Second language acquisition Republic Invader Zim Predestination Law of value Wolof language W.
