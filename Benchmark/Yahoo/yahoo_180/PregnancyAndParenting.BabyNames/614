my parents are adopting sisters from mexico do you like the names they picked out alivya maria a leev yah adriana sarainya ah dri on ah sa rain yah our last name is varanova btw the names are very pretty i'm wondering how old the girls are though my guess is that they have names that they are already accustomed to since they'll be moving to a new country a new culture a new school and a new family i wonder if it might be comforting to hold on to something important like their first names maybe talking with the girls to discuss whether or not they want to change their names and if so to what would be a great way to show that your family values their past and who they already are congratulations and best of luck to you and your growing family Cliff Richard Pitaten Milton H.
