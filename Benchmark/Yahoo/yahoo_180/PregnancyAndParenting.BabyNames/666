need a second name for raphael or ralph any idea perhaps something from the bible oh and as the family name is quite long perhaps the middle name should be a bit short thanks for any idea first name as last name what's that supposed to mean raphael is a second choice btw my first choice of name was shaun for a name like raphael which is fairly elaborate but lovely i'd choose a very simple short middle name like john or david ie raphael john particularly as you say your family name is long because it could sound like a bit of a mouthful otherwise for a shorter version like ralph you could pick something a little longer ie two syllables such as michael thomas william etc ie ralph michael ralph thomas ralph william lovely choice in names btw so nice to see someone using a little originality and not just following fashion i named my son arthur after king arthur which is pretty unusual today his middle names are david william after his uncles Academy Award for Best Art Direction Hangul William Blake Utopia (book) Raphael (archangel) History of modern literature King James Version of the Bible Academy Award for Original Music Score Lyric poetry Harmonica John of England Richard III (play) Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood Forbes family J.
