do you think the name ruby sounds too old for a little girl i had a great aunt named ruby and i think it's such a beautiful name what do you think i was thinking ruby lorene ruby varia sounds like maria ruby jean let me know whenever you are picking out a name for your baby you need to keep a few things into consideration the first one is that the baby will not remain a baby so look towards the future to make sure that you feel that the name you are picking out is also good for that child grown up second keep in mind that we live in a 'harsh world' and some people can be 'very cruel' at times so give the child a name that will not deliberately produce any horrible nicknames from the bully's or any negative peer pressure we all eventually get some sort of nickname and some are cute we named our oldest daughter therese but she lost so much weight when she was first born that her clothes were so huge on her we called her big t that soon fazed out once she gained her baby weight back and started growing for awhile we just called her theresee but once she was old enough to eat candy she fell in love with reces pieces when they came out on the market all her friends started calling her that by the time she was in the nd grade and she liked it now she has shortened it as an adult to rese she uses that all the time and most of her friends don't even know her full st name ruby jean is a pretty name so is ruby lorene and ruby varia i would pick one of the ones you like that you think will be a good one for her growing up years with her friends as well as her adult years sometimes it means a whole lot to a child growing up that their name is a good one and not something that their peers laugh at or joke about for example out youngest daughter is named rebekah and we just shortened it to bekah leaving off the re in the beginning of it for her nickname everyone likes it but somewhere along the way in her growing up years she started being kidded with a chicken clucking sound to start her name like bekbekbekbekbekah for a long time she was humiliated by it and we had to help her overcome it now as an adult she can look back at it and laugh but she still doesn't like it used on her oh i also had a great aunt ruby she was a very short foot robust lady that was as big around as she was tall she had a huge bosom as well and when her babies were tiny my mom said she would rock the babies on her bosom rather than in her arms one thing i do know about naming babies you can pick a dozen names you like for them but until you see them in person andhold them the first time there is no definites that first encounter is when you know for sure what you are going to name them Kodocha Pitaten Baby Blues Ed, Edd n Eddy Characters in the Smurfs Ranma __ characters Jean Grey Social rule Piccolo Junior Saga Rugrats Our Gang Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Friends Charmed Garfield Joke Time Out of Mind The Ashlee Simpson Show Spice Girls Rave Master Doug Trailer Park Boys Vegeta My Life as a Teenage Robot Transactional analysis Shaggy dog story The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Knots Landing The McGuire Sisters Humphrey Bogart Treehouse of Horror V Shen Gong Wu Pok__mon Ruby and Sapphire AFI 100 Years series Mnemonic Love Hina main characters Recurring South Park characters Biff Tannen Situation comedy The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius Hall & Oates Buttocks Cardcaptor Sakura Stewie Griffin Marilyn Monroe Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Theory of conduct Mario Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Equine conformation Quarashi Little Britain Ron and Fez Care Bears The Amber Spyglass It's Walky!
