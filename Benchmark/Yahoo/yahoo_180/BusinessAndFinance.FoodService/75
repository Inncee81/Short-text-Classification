i'm an inexperienced teenager and i want to apply for a waitressing job but have no idea how to waitress help like it is i started waitressing when i was and no it may not be rocket science but there are some things you can keep in mind that may make your shift go smoother or to impress management i can't tell you how to waitress because each restaurant is different but i can tell you how to make things easier as you are learning the ropes six things to keep you from going crazy balance your time don't put things off if you get an order put it in as soon as you can never be afraid to ask for help that was hard for me because i'm so independant find someone who you feel comfortable asking just keep in mind they are all working too if you get swamped let someone know you need things to ease up your employer will know you are inexperienced and won't hold it against you be good to the kitchen staff if all the waiters waitresses hate you that's no loss but always keep the kitchen on your side they determine whose orders go out quickly and correctly and if you mess up they will be more likely to fix it for you without complications keep an eye on your tips and your money and don't burn bridges remember that how big of a tip you get is completely decided by you a customer can decide if they are going to have and enjoyable experience as soon as they meet you good attitude good tip waitresses make next to nothing on a paycheck so tips are very important just treat customers how you would want to be treated if you were dining if you establish a good relationship in the beginning they may be less likely to be upset if something happens with their meal iif you are calm and happy you will make your customers feel at ease don't get me wrong you will have quite a few douche bags who you will never make happy no matter how hard you try but don't let it get you down and don't give them any extra attention do a few check backs when a table gets their meal but don't be pushy it helps if you walk by the tables often so they can flag you down if they want something don't leave the bill on the table for a long time because if they are ready to leave they won't want to wait for you to notice it's sitting there so after you drop it off glance back to see if they are getting the money together so in that case you know they are ready to leave if they don't start to get the money together than they probably wil sit for awhile also by not wondering to far away if they have a question with the bill you will be close by to answer it always try your best to look your best and i don't have to tell you why take on any extra duties you can so that you can learn as much as you can because the more you know the more money you will make if your restaurant has a bar try to work that section it means alot more money but with it comes alot more action because it is seated faster so try to take it on when you feel comfortable with the slower sections finally i can say that if a seated table who has there meal asks for something extra like steak sauce get it for them first if they are sitting there looking at there food and they can't eat it your tip will suffer if you are doing something else than ask someone to grab it for you on the way out try to determine what someone may want with there order before there food comes like extra napkins or a small plate to share that will make things easier when you are busy goodluck Shaggy dog story Restaurant Waiter Dog training Friends Rain Man Poker jargon Little Britain Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Tip The Apprentice 2 The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Cuisine of Denmark Aerial (dance move) Theory of conduct Betting (poker) The Contender (television series) Kitchen Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Milton H.
