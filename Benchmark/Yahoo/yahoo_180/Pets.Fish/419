my guppy died suddenly mysteriously ok so i have a gallon tank with guppies surpae tetras and blackskirt tetras i change water about times a month and i feed them twice a day it's been like that for about months now and all of them had been perfectly fine and happy i think until yesterday then this morning when i went to feed them one of the guppies was dead and not just dead but with a hugh black hole in his stomach and the other guppy had his tailed ripped a little bit the ph and temperature and other things are fine and i think it's either that the guppies attacked each other or the tetras attacked the guppies or possibly the dead guppy caught a disease i don't know about but every one of them looked healthy just last night what was going on in my fish tank last night while i was asleep i don't know what's happened to my guppies and also one more question should i buy more guppies b c i've heard that guppies like to live in groups of at least help please you don't mention if the dead guppy was a male of female if a female this could have been related to a birthing problem in either case it could have also been an internal infection but the huge hole was probably made by the other fish after your fish died minor fin rips are common and i doubt was related to the problem that killed your fish since you don't see any problem with the other fish it's really impossible to say if any other fish have a disease or not all you can really do at this point is carefully watch your fish for any signs of a disease guppies will do fine alone or in groups you don't have to buy more mm Paul Is Dead Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Discus (fish) Shark USS Yorktown (CV-5) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Shaggy dog story Pocket cruiser Urinary incontinence Abortion debate Theory of conduct Fish farming Nerpa Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Fugu EastEnders Aquarium Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Social rule Phaedo RuneScape quests Myxobolus cerebralis Breastfeeding Ecco the Dolphin Guppy Fish Have I Got News For You Dead Like Me Cat Physical paradox The Beatles discography Smallpox American Alligator Foodborne illness Vampire Opie and Anthony Brewery Marine aquarium Supernatural Creatures in Bionicle Cliff Richard The Shining (film) American Pie (song) Coeliac disease Tocopherol The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Rabies Thermal power station Goldfish Marilyn Monroe Duesberg hypothesis Legionellosis Dairy 2001 anthrax attacks Fishing Nile crocodile USS Tench (SS-417) Tasmanian Devil Blue Whale Sea-Monkey Cardinal tetra Bubonic plague Death Axolotl Piccolo Junior Saga Mammal USS Tunny (SS-282) Entropy Gar Orca Characters of Lost Stomach cancer USS Wasp (CV-7) USS Trigger (SS-237) P-47 Thunderbolt Steven Wright Shrimp farm Charles Peace USS Threadfin (SS-410) Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Amber Spyglass Gypsy moth Pneumonia Phoebe Buffay's songs Spanish flu Vitasoy Jumpstart 3rd Grade Saturn V Pontiac's Rebellion Good Morning, Vietnam Debugging Whale Cytomegalovirus Poker jargon Ron and Fez Diseases of the honeybee Jam (TV series)
