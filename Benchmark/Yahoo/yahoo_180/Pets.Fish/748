a plastic peanut butter jar for a betta my betta lives in a reg large size plastic peanut butter jar despite that he's five years old and just seemingly start to have problems should i change the jar and how is ammonia poisoning created because he has kind of reddish gills now should i change the water everyday now for a change he also has this small gole in his pectoral fin the front fin someone suggested pimafix but does betta water conditioner work like pimafix two years ago i used betta water conditioner when his tail got this hole too and he healed i would say yes change the jar or change the water in the jar i wouldn't recommend anything less than a gallon filtered tank for bettas they sell these tanks cheap at petsmart under you can buy a gallon kit top aqua scene for or get a standard rectangular gallon aquarium and buy the filter air pump substrate and a silk plant after buying everything you'll be out tops make sure you read up on tank cycling prior to adding the betta to a new tank and that will give you more insight into ammonia and nitrate levels you may want to keep the betta in a cleaner jar until the tank has sufficiently cycled ammonia levels are caused by waste from the betta and excess food in the jar in a peanut butter size jar you'd have to conduct a water change every few days to keep the ammonia level under control the redness on his gills is most likely caused by by irritation from high ammonia levels or high chlorine levels if his water is untreated his gills are essentially burning from the ammonia he may also flare his gills more often in order to sooth the burn if he had more room he would be swimming rapidly or darting to also help cool the burning if you haven't already change the water now use a betta conditioner to remove any heavy metals chloramine and chlorine from any water you add to the jar pimafix treats bacterial and fungal infections he could have fin rot but fin rot generally starts on the outer edge of the fin and works it's way to the base betta water conditioner doesn't treat infections as i mentioned above if you used it two years ago it possibly cleared his water and he healed on his own try looking for medications dosed for bettas to avoid complications remember drop the cash and get that gallon tank setup the betta will be happier and it will be much more attractive to look at than a peanut butter jar good luck and take care of that little guy and keep him around for many more years edit hey your betta is fairly old if old age is his problem and he's unforuntately on his way out then there's not too much you can do about nature always takes its course however you'll have a nice and proper setup for your next betta or your current betta will have a very comfortable and happy reamainder of his life Marine aquarium Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Ammonia Aquarium E85 Dairy Hydrogen economy Plastic Thermal power station Fish farming Carburetor Dry cleaning Nuclear power Asthma Peanut butter Fossil fuel power plant Autonomous building Air conditioning Ozone depletion P-47 Thunderbolt Motor oil Jet engine Water (molecule) Ozone hole Coffee Explosive material Carnivorous plant Biodiesel Alternative biochemistry Nutrition Solar power Swimming Psoriasis Reef tank Poison Sodium hypochlorite Microeconomics Common cold Veganism Omega-3 fatty acid Natural gas Peanut Fire fighting Insulin Energy development Malaria Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Iron Breastfeeding Nitrogen Ocean thermal energy conversion Vitamin C Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Sterilization (microbiology) Bong Sun Diseases of the honeybee Cancer Chlorine Toyota Prius Hydrogen sulfide Alcohol fuel Floppy disk Tank Titanium Fecal incontinence Crohn's disease Tofu Hydrogen Town gas Glass Dwarf gourami Terran (StarCraft) Tetrapod Loudspeaker Hypoglycemia Sauna Seismic retrofit Swimming pool Diarrhea Haloalkane Diving suit HIV test Acne Diesel engine
