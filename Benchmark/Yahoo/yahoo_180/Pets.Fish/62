how do i clean my glass gallon aquarium i just bought a gallon aquarium and whoever used the glue to attach the glass walls together was a little sloppy and got glue on the glass walls how can i get it off i know you can't use soap but water isn't getting it off the glue is or at least better be silicone and really the only way to remove that is with a razor blade using a solvent might disintegrate the sloppy parts but it could also compromise the integrity of the part you want to remain that holds the glass together Aquarium Dry cleaning Marine aquarium Solvent Coffee Goldfish Razor Fishing Printed circuit board Genericized trademark Knife Sandpaper Biodiesel Soap Hard water Dishwashing Soldering Hamster Reef tank Dairy Menstrual cup Shaving Inhalant Adhesive Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Upholstery MEMS M60 machine gun Osmosis Ethyl acetate Semiconductor device Bong Autonomous building Chlorophyta Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Cross-country skiing Concentration Champagne (beverage) Paint Stucco Washroom Combine (Half-Life 2) Fenway Park Detergent Roof Disinfection Mikoyan MiG-29 Water Tilapia Electrophysiology Fossil fuel power plant Georgia Aquarium Beard Seismic retrofit Shampoo Cyanoacrylate Fish farming Soap bubble Cookware and bakeware Shedd Aquarium Clinker (boat building) Water cannon Professional wrestling slang Fiberglass Monterey Bay Aquarium Laundry Vacuum tube Wound Dialysis Vinegar Leeboard Oxygen sensor Table saw Liquid crystal Sento Chainsaw Cello Concrete Tire Domestic water system Japanese toilet Surface Brewery Anarchist symbolism Obsidian Paramount Canada's Wonderland Zebra Danio Violin Silicon Printmaking Vitreous enamel Tattoo Glasses Jellyfish Mosaic Glossary of climbing terms Cast iron Window
