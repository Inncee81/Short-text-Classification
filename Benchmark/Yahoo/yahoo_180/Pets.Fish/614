feeding question last night i got a male betta along with dwarf platies and i give the platies flake food and i give the betta betta pellet food however my betta seems to eat both flake and pellet food is this good for him i'm also afraid that i'm polluting the tank with too much food also of my platies is eating and looks healthy but the other are hiding behind plants and don't know there's food i'm afraid they'll starve please help thanks i am assuming that you have a filtered tank in a new tank water quality is much more important than food your tank needs to cycle adding fish all at once is going to increase your ammonia all the food you give them will increase the ammonia as well you should feed your fish but only very small amounts once your tank is cycled and you are doing water changes on a regular schedule you can feed a little bit more your fish will not starve to death email me if you have any questions Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Fish farming Sewage treatment Autonomous building Dwarf gourami Hamster Organic farming Discus (fish) Goldfish Maize Spider Shrimp farm Omega-3 fatty acid Marine aquarium Sea-Monkey Thermal power station Ecology Eutrophication Carbon dioxide Chinook salmon Water Agriculture Seabird Nuclear reactor Axolotl Clownfish Town gas Domestic rabbit Environmental vegetarianism Dairy Clown loach Veganism Biodiesel Nutrition Hydroponics E85 Ammonia Natural gas Aquarium Crayfish Green roof Shark Halfbeak Cochineal Tilapia Healthy eating Apple Rice Vegetarianism Water (molecule) Factory farming Nutrient Salmon Biological pest control Dieting Fugu STS-59 Pine Stomach cancer Brewery Twelve leverage points Economy of the People's Republic of China Chicken Tidal power Cannabis cultivation Trophic level Gar Kosher foods Wetland Anorexia nervosa Albatross Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Krill RuneScape skills Space Shuttle external tank Diseases of the honeybee Antarctic krill Carburetor RuneScape Random Events Fish and chips Carbon dioxide sink RuneScape Mini-Games Nuclear power Energy development Alcohol fuel Sandworm (Dune) Frog Ecology of Hong Kong Nitrogen Iron Global warming and agriculture Environmental concerns with electricity generation Kissing gourami Earthworm Vermicompost Poison Capercaillie Spam (electronic)
