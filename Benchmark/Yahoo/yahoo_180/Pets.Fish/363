marine fish i'm looking at setting up x x tank but not sure what lighting to go for if i use flouresent tubes comes with will this be enough to keep corals anemamies and fish or should i invest in arcadia series as these are quite expensive for fish the amount of lighting doesn't really matter the corals and anemones also giant clams it does since all these have photosynthesic bacteria in their cells and need enough light intensity to produce their own food the extra of which provides food for the host the depth of your tank won't allow much light to penetrate to the bottom if this is a standard fluorescent tube regardless of the number you have at the very least you'll need to use a compact fluorescent or t system but adding some metal halides even a small one in combination with the cfs would be better for the distance the light needs to travel to the bottom what fivespeed suggested with the light meter is the best way to be sure that your corals are getting enough light the output wattage you have doesn't matter nearly as much as the amount of light received lumens along with intensity you also need to have the correct wavelengths since only a few are used for photosynthesis there's also color temperature to consider this refers to the color produced by heating to different temperatures have you ever noticed that when you take a photo using film indoors that the color looks off by turning everything orange under normal household bulbs this is due to the color temperature of the film which is balanced for the color temperature of sunlight which is warmer aquarium bulbs also have differences for color temperatures which involve how close to the water's surface the light would be since the deeper you go the more light that's lost in the red end of the spectrum so the color looks bluer reef lighting of k simulates what it would look like around feet underwater which is a good depth and light coloration for corals there's also an actinic which is a deeper blue almost to blacklight which shows off the photosynthetic organisms by making them appear to glow this can be used to simulate a dawn or dusk by themselves if they're on a separate circuit and enhance the colors of the corals when the ks are also on there's also tubes which are a combination of k and actinic but they don't operate separately see the links below and additional links to articles at the top of each page for more info on lighting for saltwater tanks Reef tank Incandescent light bulb Light-emitting diode Fluorescent lamp Ultraviolet Photosynthesis Marine aquarium Color temperature Lighting Solar power Light Ecology Sun Color Glass Coral reef Carburetor Aquarium Compact fluorescent lamp Headlight Carbon dioxide Brewery Bicycle lighting Solar cell Plasma (physics) Houseplant Laser Stage lighting Tank Diamond simulant Algae Marine biology Cannabis cultivation Transformer Diode Mercury-vapor lamp Swimming pool Rayleigh scattering Sewage treatment Gamut Thermal power station Temperature RGB color model Swimming Leaf Renewable energy Clownfish Sea-Monkey Diamond Vacuum tube Fluorescence Microscopy Opportunity rover Electrodeless lamp Tire Solar variation Acne Antarctic krill Items in the Metroid series Planetary habitability Plant Gas metal arc welding Coral Spectroscopy Explosive material USS Tunny (SS-282) Nuclear power Eye Planetary nebula Nuclear weapon design Optical fiber Cyanide Ocean thermal energy conversion Television Stereoscopy Technetium Hydrogen economy Drag racing Infrared Energy development Electrophysiology Hydrogen Firework Heat Liquid crystal display Scuba set
