there are bubbles under algea on my live rock what does this means is this good or bad what should i do algae undergoes photosynthesis just like plants so whenever the lights are on it takes in water and carbon dioxide from your fish and it releases oxygen so this might be what you're seeing is small bubbles of pure o that are being released in general this won't be a problem although you don't want to have it trapped under live rock being exposed to oxygen air will kill the beneficial bacteria on that part of the rock if what you're seeing is bubble algae like what's shown in the link above you'll want to try and remove this from the tank bubble algae will get to be a nuisance and if you break open one of the bubbles when it's in the tank it will release spores and reproduce i recommend removing the entire piece of live rock in a plastic bag or container before your next water change and cut scrape the bubbles off from the very base while the rock is in the bag container this way if one breaks it's not in the tank you can replace each piece and move on to another as long as none break if one does dump that water and get more from the tank you want the rock exposed to air as little time as possible then you can replace any dumped water as part of the water change just be certain that any bubbles are coming from the algae itself and not from a powerhead skimmer or the filter if these are your source adjust the water level filter flow rate or flow valves just enough to eliminate bubble production the bubbles these produce don't add dissolved oxygen to the water water movement circulates dissolved oxygen that dissolves at the water's surface the only piece of equipment that should produce bubbles is the skimmer but the bubbles should remain inside the column and not be carried out the return Rebreather Sewage treatment Photosynthesis Aquarium Marine aquarium Water purification Brewery Biodiesel Bong Energy development Sea-Monkey Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Scuba set Algae Fish farming Thermal power station Reef tank Fossil fuel power plant E85 Pebble bed reactor Eutrophication Cell (biology) Decompression sickness Hydroponics Swimming pool Motor oil Hyperbaric oxygen therapy Plant Ecology Corrosion Carburetor Carbon dioxide sink Carnivorous plant Intravenous therapy Glossary of firefighting equipment Ice core Explosive material Fire fighting Plastic Diving regulator Hydrogen economy Cavitation Oxygen Liquid breathing Water (molecule) Wine making Gas metal arc welding Diving cylinder Chlorophyta Disinfection Carbon cycle Snowball Earth Siphon Terraforming Bacteria Soil life Acetic acid Irrigation Environmental concerns with electricity generation Blood Copper extraction RuBisCO Gasoline Water Casting Dry cleaning Water pollution Renewable energy 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Plankton Erosion Seabird Apollo 13 Lung Hydrogen sulfide Pulmonary alveolus Earth's atmosphere Pollution Welding Champagne (beverage) Sugar beet Coffee Respiratory system Shrimp farm Permian-Triassic extinction event Bubble Bobble Mosquito Stoma Wind power Drill bit Weathering
