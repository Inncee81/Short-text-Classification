is my platy pregnant i've had a male and female platy for some time in a tank and i have been closely watching the female for a gravid spot i noticed that when she is in good light my tank doesn't have a lamp i can see kind of a triangle behind her body right before her anal fine she is orange and the spot looks kind of red it doesn't look black but i think the triangle is new because before she had a string of red going from behind her body now it's a full triangle pointing back at her tail fin but the spot is not black what do you think theres no doubt that its pregnant it may just have become mature anough to start producing fry the gravid spot can be lighter in colour on some guppies as well as light colourer live beares such as your platy so yes she is preg gg Snooker Leopard Color Sailfin Molly Discus (fish) Rail terminology Meriones unguiculatus Archery Iris (anatomy) Human skin color Lighting Cat Fish anatomy Black triangles Color temperature Extraterrestrial skies Wassily Kandinsky Equine conformation Traffic light Parallax Stage lighting Wallpaper group GunBound Eight ball Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Capercaillie Southern platyfish Cheetah RGB color model Color blindness Abortion debate Battlefield 2 Clownfish Professional wrestling holds Live-bearing aquarium fish Sperm Whale Trigonometric function Pregnancy Faster-than-light Color theory Drag racing Glossary of partner dance terms Horse Australian salmon Saturn V Unreal Red Squirrel The Covenant Rainbow Tobacco Beret Blue Whale Triangle Bicycle lighting Tofu Birthmark CIE 1931 color space Animal communication Neptune Tetrapod Solar system Railway signal Collision detection Green swordtail Chaos Emerald Spot the Dog Futurama (TV series - season 5) Muskellunge Fibonacci number Light-emitting diode Grunion House Mouse Pottery Chromotherapy Viviparous lizard Poeciliidae The Legend of Zelda series enemies Crazy Horse Charge (heraldry) Prolog Nix American lobster Kender Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Terminal ballistics Sea-Monkey Tank Anti-tank Eye Common bean Cigarette Smoking Man Formula One regulations Mercury-vapor lamp Fencing Parrotfish Kerosene lamp Gamut
