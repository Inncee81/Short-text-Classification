african cichlid my mom just rescued an oscar that is about almost inches long we met this lady at walmart who said that she had just moved in to a new apartment and she found the oscar a african cichlid and a plecostomus all in a gallon tank she doesn't know how long they had been there but their water was absolutely filthy we moved the oscar in to a gallon aquarium but we don't have anywhere else to put the african cichlid so my mo put him in with the oscar until we can find him a good safe home we put the plecostomus at home in our gallon tank with small angel fish a small clown knife gouramis and another plecostomus this one being long we know that the oscar will eventually eat the african cichlid but we need to know what the african cichlid is compatible with so that we can move him hopefully before that happens we just need to know what he can go with and what he can't go with any links tips and suggestions will work thank you so much here is a link to a picture for jon v but it says unidentified african cichlid fish so i don't know but it is him http images search yahoo com search images view back http a f fimages search yahoo com fsearch fimages fp dafrican bcichlid ei dutf fr dyfp t b d w h imgurl www oceanlight com fthumbs f jpg rurl http a f fwww oceanlight com fspotlight php fimg d size kb name jpg p african cichlid type jpeg no tt oid d e ei utf i have to say that your intentions are noble i think that you have bitten off more than you can chew the picture is of a yellow lab which is usually a fairly mild mannered mbuna cichlid from lake malawi this is what i would do move the angels clown knife and the gouramis to the gallon place the oscar in the you should try to give the yellow lab to a pet store use the phone book and tell them that you have a yellow lab ciclid that you need to get rid of and ask them if they will take it many will the reason i told you to put the oscar in the is because the clown knife is going to need to get a little bit of size on him but he does not need to be with the angels for too much longer the knife will get huge eventually it should get along with the oscar in the when it gets around inches long the reason i said you should give the yellow lab away is because it should really be only with other mbuna cichlids and they would need at least a to gallon tank please email me if you have any questions Cichlid Dwarf gourami Lake Malawi Digital photography JPEG Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Knife Garfield Drill bit Gmail Panama Canal Lake Tanganyika Shaggy dog story Freshwater angelfish Clownfish Goldfish Friends Tilapia Hamster The Inside Marine aquarium Sluggy Freelance The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an HyperText Transfer Protocol PNG Aquarium Ajax (programming) Rift Valley lakes Johnny 5 Search engine Plame affair Zambezi RuneScape quests Jack Dempsey (fish) The Fairly OddParents GIF The Amber Spyglass Good Morning, Vietnam Suckermouth Catfish Phishing RuneScape cheats Sin City Oplan Bojinka Fishing World Wide Web Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Clown loach PHP Bob and George Refrigerator car Insulin Floppy disk Piccolo Junior Saga Resident Evil: Apocalypse The Subtle Knife Thermal power station HTTP cookie ITunes Cross site scripting Live-bearing aquarium fish Mushroom hunting Rei Ayanami Web page Goatse.cx Associative array Opera (web browser) Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children Ron and Fez Infantilism Oscar Wilde Bratislava The Critic Samuel Goldwyn Sailfin Molly Team Fortress Classic USS Yorktown (CV-5) Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Uniform Resource Locator Axolotl Autonomous building Homer Simpson Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) P-47 Thunderbolt Theory of conduct Good Times Nicomachean Ethics Night (book) Killian documents One Piece minor characters The Ersatz Elevator New England Aquarium Fugu
