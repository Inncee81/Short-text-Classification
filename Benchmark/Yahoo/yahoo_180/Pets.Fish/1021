gone belly up today i just purchased a goldfish and it's already gone belly up on me it looked like a healthy fish when i bought him but it was an hour long trip back home before i could put him in the gallon tank and i imagine he was stressed from the journey the water is clean as i just changed it this morning so it can't be that the filter was primed and a new cartridge put in a good hours before the goldfish came home do you think it's the stress that made him go belly up anything i can do that might help him live i forgot to add that this is a fantail goldfish in case that makes a difference yes i'll often float the bag for about minutes i feel so sorry for the poor guy i bring him home and i kill him this is actually my first goldfish i've had many tropical fish but never a goldfish so perhaps i did something wrong in treating the water i know goldfish need slightly colder water temps than tropicals yup water was conditioned as well i used a ph regulator to bring the water to does a goldfish require a different level thanks for the information if the water isn't fully prepped yet then would it be better to transport him to my second gallon which has tropicals in it could that potentially help him out despite the temperature difference i really feel bad for the poor thing some good answers but in my experience this upside down syndrome sometimes happen to goldfish especially fantails because they have trapped air in their swimming air bladder they use it to stay balance and when stressed or moved from tank to tank they develop the condition now i have seen the fish naturally fix the problem but some can not and usually die some people try gently massaging the fish or squeezing ever so slightly and sometimes a spin in a bag cures it too hope it works out good luck Goldfish Aquarium E85 Drowning Poker jargon Samuel Goldwyn Thermal power station Theory of conduct Water purification Urinary incontinence Marine aquarium Swimming pool Brewery Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Dairy Menstrual cup Dialysis Social rule Fish farming Fossil fuel power plant P-38 Lightning Sewage treatment Dry cleaning Coral reef Ocean thermal energy conversion Combat stress reaction Sea-Monkey Bladderwort 2000 Australian Grand Prix Breastfeeding Messerschmitt Bf 109 Thermoregulation Professional wrestling holds Hypoglycemia Rebreather Short selling Insulin Solar power Water (molecule) God Emperor of Dune Bong Lake USS Yorktown (CV-5) Shrimp farm Sento Aerial (dance move) Chronic fatigue syndrome Shaggy dog story Fugu Equine conformation Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Daylight saving time Asperger syndrome Autonomous building Firearm Scientology beliefs and practices Agar plate Carbon dioxide Carnivorous plant Hydrogen economy P-47 Thunderbolt Microeconomics Ecco the Dolphin First aid T'Pol Diseases of the honeybee Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Decompression sickness Strategic management Diving suit 2004 Atlantic hurricane season Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Ashton-Tate Iowa class battleship Futurama (TV series - season 5) Mattress Water Temperature Jet engine Cross-country skiing Shark Growth hormone treatment Textile manufacturing Procrastination Explosive material Gar Carburetor Climate of the United Kingdom Diving Free trade Color B-47 Stratojet
