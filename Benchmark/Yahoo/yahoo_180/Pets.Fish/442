question about betta's if bettas are so territorial how do they produce it s been bothering me i need to know male bettas siamese fighting fish are intolerant of other males most females will tolerate other females if the aquarium is large enough the reproductive cycle of the betta is fascinating male bettas will build a bubble nest of their saliva this next can be several inches across and extend up to half an inch out of the water then the male wraps himself around the ripe female and squeezes the eggs out of her and fertilizes them as they fall he then picks them up in his mouth and blows them back into the nest if the female doesn't leave after her eggs are all extruded the male may beat her up frequently ripping her fins in about hours the eggs hatch at first the male tries to put the babies back into the nest then as the babies become free swimming in about days he must be removed or he may eat them i understand that in thailand these fish live in water that is fairly cloudy and muddy so they are not as aware of each other as they are in our clean small aquaria and that's why they can breathe air with an organ somewhat similar to our lungs beautiful fish and smarter than people think they are relatively easy to train Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Clownfish Halfbeak Tilapia Spider Bird Goldfish Egg (biology) Sea-Monkey Grunion American lobster Kakapo Nile crocodile Octopus Dwarf gourami Leatherback Sea Turtle Atlantic herring Shark Tarantula Platypus Sexual reproduction Coconut crab Kissing gourami Gar Elephant Bong Salmon Carbon dioxide Fishing Drowning Textile manufacturing Percula Clownfish Gourami American Alligator Sex Live-bearing aquarium fish Sea Otter Bottlenose Dolphin Menstrual cup Killifish Paper wasp Harmonica Myxobolus cerebralis Aquarium Emu Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Swimming Seabird Parthenogenesis Breaststroke Chicken Sawfish (fish) Marine aquarium Mallard Non-human animal sexuality Cat Grasshopper Cantonese cuisine Ostrich Batoidea Professional wrestling holds Zerg Cuisine of the Philippines Hamster Marine biology Tuatara Krill Siphon Scuba set Jellyfish Tofu Swimming pool Whale shark Zeidae Sailfin Molly Freshwater angelfish Oral sex Sea turtle Diving Kosher foods Tetrapod Goby Dragonet Rhea (bird) Flute Hermaphrodite Murray Cod Sushi Combtooth blenny Egg (food) Frog Soap bubble Parrotfish Aphid Glossary of firefighting equipment Chris Kanyon Breastfeeding In vitro fertilisation Condom
