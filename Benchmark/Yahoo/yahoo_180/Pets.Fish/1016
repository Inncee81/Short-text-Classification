why is my anenomie jumping around the fish tank anenomie is floating or jumping around the tank its crazy it looks like its hi or something lol what is it doing i assume you have a bubble tip anemone these anemones move around quite often if it is moving towards the top of the tank it most likely means you dont have good enough lighting anemones have high lighting demands to be kept happy and healthy if you are using just regular flourescent lights then you dont have proper lighting for the anemone you should really be using vho lighting or preferably metal halides you should also check your sg salt content this should be at for anemones and you should also be adding iodine to the water for it hope this helps and good luck Marine aquarium Sea-Monkey Reef tank Clownfish Aquarium Cannabis cultivation Sewage treatment E85 Atomic Kitten Edible salt Milk Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Thermal power station Carburetor Bubble Bobble Jellyfish Oxyacetylene Iodine Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Sodium chloride Robot Master Water purification Fish farming Bread Water (molecule) Knife Percula Clownfish Gas metal arc welding Mineral Biology Hydrogen economy Dodge Charger Lighting Relative clause Staining (biology) Nutrition Symbiosis Volleyball Silver Corrosion Titanium Coulometry Bong Parachuting Haloalkane Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Hydroponics First aid Incandescent light bulb Aerial (dance move) Hamster Glossary of firefighting equipment Halogen Ammonia Rainbow Islands Tank Palindrome Aluminium Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Uranium Dimmer Siphon Klonoa 2: Dream Champ Tournament Care Bears B3ta Quake III Arena Fly fishing Gasoline Alcohol Wine making Idli Unreal Fish Seismic retrofit Acetic acid Sugar beet Halo 2 Discus (fish) Black Carbon dioxide Final Fantasy XI Wild ARMs 2 Equine conformation Solar power Manicure Tank destroyer Bromine Lightning rod Sea anemone Cantonese cuisine Patrick Star Butterflyfish Anemone Mechanical Animals Sake Welding Veganism
