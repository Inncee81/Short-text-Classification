goldfish just sitting in bottom corner of his tank new tank new fish any advice weve had our fish for four days and he just got put in his new gallon from a gallon bowl last night when we put him in he immediately set out exploring not swimming fast like he was scared but picking at the rocks and plants and just swimming around this morning he is just sitting in the bottom of the aquarium he could be asleep but its am so i doubt it so my question why might this be he was energetic last night the only thing i can think of is the cats were evidently watching him this morning he was swimming around today before that but they are only kittens and hes never had any bad experiences with cats right now i have his tank covered with a blanket for privacy and have been keeping the cats away dont know if its better to keep the cats away from him or let him get used to them s thanks for any advice i have a lid and have conditioned the water what gets me is that he was not acting the least bit stressed when he got in there even while we were floating him it just looked like he wanted to get out and explore his new home which is just what he did i know fish are hard to read but i swear he was not scared he was excited and he spent a couple of hours swimming around before we turned out his light so it just seems odd that today he doesnt want to swim around yet but maybe he was up all night exploring and is resting now who knows right now his light is on in his tank so he can tell that its day time in no uncertain terms our living room is kinda dark and he has a blanket over his tank so he isnt distracted it occured to me that maybe last night with his light on he couldnt see what was outside his tank well and now that he can he is being more timid what do you think oh and his water is right around degrees we didnt have time to cycle for days or weeks but we did the cycling of the filter and prepped the water floated his bag and added tank water gradually to the floating bag over the course of like min to let him adjust to any change in ph we couldnt cycle the tank for a long time cuz he was a rescue fish and was in a gauranteed more toxic bowl than the tank thought that might be useful info you seem to have done a good job of acclimating your new fish to the new tank fish will often show different behavior when put into a new environment whether it be excitement or just trying to find out where the nearest cover is in case there's a predator they don't see and the period of inactivity may be just as natural while they get used to a new water chemistry and activity going on around them or staying immobile so the cats don't attack he's probably never seen one before so doesn't know if these might be a predator you don't need to worry about your fish being up all night exploring becasue once the lights go out goldfish will rest they aren't like some catfish or others which are more active nocturnally i would keep the tank uncovered and let him get used to the cats if you keep a cover over the tank and there's no light underneath his day night cycle will be thrown off if there is a light the blanket may trap too much heat goldfish prefer cooler water if your fish is large enough it may have produced enough ammonia in the tank that this is starting to affect him you also want to make sure you aren't overfeeding him only give him the amount of flakes or pellets that he can eat in minutes twice a day if there's any extra food after the minutes are up you should remove it with your net as uneaten food decomposes it also produces ammonia plus you will be wasting the food and you'll need to clean the tank more often for their health it's best if you vary his diet a little goldfish especially yours since it's a deep bodied type which are prone to problems with constipation and swim bladder disorder should get plenty of fiber in their diets you can give him some cooked green peas with the skins removed dark leafy lettuce or slices of zucchini or cucumber shredded carrot or small sections of oranges the vegetables should be cooked slightly or frozen then thawed so the plant cell walls break down and are easier for him to eat so whenever you have any of these for yourself consider sharing a little with your fish also see the article below Goldfish Aquarium Marine aquarium Hamster Cat Sewage treatment Domestic rabbit
