two part filter question the instructions on my filter says that i should replace the filter cartridge every four weeks i thought bacteria were supposed to develope in the filter so how can they if i replace the cartridge monthly the other day i fished something out the aquarium with my hand just then i realized that i had just washed them with anti bacterial soap can this act kill off the bacteria i am trying to grow the instructions say to replace the cartridge every weeks because the carbon is unable to adsorb any more stuff by that time filters that have two replaceable cartridges are good because you can replace one and leave the old one in if your filter only has one pad then usually there is enough bacteria in the filter plants decorations gravel etc to prevent any fluctuations be careful with feeding right after replacing it you can also rinse the filter and reuse it there just won't be any activated carbon left you will want to stay on top of water changes if you decide to reuse your filters though the anti bacterial soap has been recently debated over it's effectiveness as long as the soap was completely rinsed from your hands there is nothing to worry about at this point there are people claiming that it doesn't even kill bacteria on hands so i wouldn't be too concerned for your biological filter medications on the other hand can wipe out your entire bio filter so be aware of this carbon will adsorb the chemicals so you would want to remove the filter anyway please email me if you have any questions Sewage treatment Dry cleaning Water purification Agar plate Bacteria Common cold Carbon dioxide Marine aquarium Menstrual cup Anthrax Aquarium Sugar beet Dairy Textile manufacturing Brewery Hard water Carnivorous plant Shroud of Turin Tooth enamel Disinfection Activated carbon Escherichia coli O157:H7 Foodborne illness Photosynthesis Body piercing Coffee Immortality Cell (biology) Biology Gaia theory (science) Hand washing Acne Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Iron Wok Swimming pool Please Save My Earth Biodiesel Water Water pollution Soap Fountain Halitosis Manicure Slow sand filter bed B3ta Food preservation Eutrophication Sugarcane Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Fluoride therapy Global warming Autonomous building Dialysis Car washing techniques Theory of conduct Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Veganism Cheese Biogeochemical cycle Mosquito Biological pest control Nuclear fallout Bread Sterilization (microbiology) 2003 Invasion of Iraq Omega-3 fatty acid Origin of life Pneumonia Light pollution Fecal incontinence Hard disk Biochemistry Acetic acid Ulcerative colitis Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Ozone depletion Yerba mate Spam (electronic) Gram staining The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Shrimp farm Tilapia Sodium hypochlorite Breastfeeding Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Dishwasher Smegma Hydroponics Carbon dioxide sink Dishwashing Futurama (TV series - season 5) M16 (rifle) Abiogenic petroleum origin Abortion debate Organic farming Thermal depolymerization
