i bought mollies yesterday and today i have babies so yeah i woke up and found some little black fry swimming around i have females and male balloon mollies in a gallon tank can someone give me guidelines for raising them well done you are a grandparent ha ha go down to your local petshop and buy a separator net that you can put in your tank put the adults in the net and keep them away from the babies the adults tend to eat some of their babies and this will help you keep your survival rate better the reason i say get a separator net and not move the adults out of the tank is that you obviously have perfect conditions for them to lay their eggs so i'd keep them in that same water i would then put little bits of bloodworm in for the babies to eat and feed your adults in the net as normal i hope this helps you out goodluck and well done Sea-Monkey Clownfish Infantilism Platypus Leatherback Sea Turtle Salmon Kakapo Fish farming Egg (food) Discus (fish) Sailfin Molly Shark Goldfish Chicken Elephant Tuatara Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Jon Secada Spider Marine aquarium Asthma Halfbeak Conker's Bad Fur Day Grammatical aspect Family Guy Knots Landing Nerpa Ramen Hamburger Microeconomics Anopheles Brewery Albatross Terri Schiavo Phimosis Mortgage Breastfeeding Episodes of Lost (Season 1) In vitro fertilisation Dwarf gourami Abortion debate Anti-aircraft warfare Cerebral palsy E85 Vegetarianism Little Britain Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Mosquito Azaria Chamberlain disappearance Ocean's Twelve Chao (Sonic the Hedgehog) American lobster Live-bearing aquarium fish Confidence trick Left-handed The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Grunion Education in the People's Republic of China Intersex surgery Tilapia The Tracey Ullman Show shorts Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pikmin Head louse Shrimp farm Tarantula Krill RISC Nile crocodile Childbirth Gypsy moth Pregnancy Hippopotamus Squidward Tentacles Egg (biology) Fugu Phase (matter) Black widow spider Mallard Sex assignment Fire fighting Futurama (TV series - season 5) Wealth Capitalism Chocobo Bladderwort Ron and Fez Beetle Taxation in the United States Tank locomotive Liquid breathing Seabird Mark I (tank) Neighbours Fishing Aquarium Seine (fishing) Tooth Sauna
