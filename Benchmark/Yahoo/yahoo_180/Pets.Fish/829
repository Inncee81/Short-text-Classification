what kind of food is best for a small ryukin in response to a question i asked regarding my ryukins strange behavior see ryukin being silly one of the ya members answered that it is normal so long as he isnt stressed and i havent been feeding him on the surface my question is this is it for some reason bad to feed a ryukin on the surface the question was regarding his pattern of swimming up the current created by his filter is there a connection between feeding him surface food and swim bladder problems he usually eats flake food on the surface he has floating pellets but doesnt seem to like eating them he always spits them out i know goldfish do this playfully before eating them but he just leaves them floating when hes done i have never heard of feeding goldfish sinking food is that what they are supposed to eat i have the kind of gravel they sell at petsmart its a mid size gravel not as fine as some but not huge either the biggest rocks are about the size of my pinky nail and bear in mind i am a small female would he be able to eat the pellets or would they sink out of his reach hi kii creating buoyancy problems by surface feeding is just another of those pesky goldfish urban myths like the bowl the second memory if you watch fish for any length of time they will almost certainly come up for air blow it out their gills this is what they are designed to do so rest assured you are not creating problems this way there is nothing nicer than being able to hand feed your goldfish regarding the food what they are supposed to eat in the wild much of a carp's diet consists of plants mulluscs so it's good to try to replicate that healthy balance so i would advise weaning him off flakes as they are the 'junk food' of the goldfish diet a good staple pellet food like pro gold or any of several made by hikari are excellent supplemented by small daily amounts of variously frozen brine shrimp bloodworms cooked shelled peas cooked broccoli citrus fruit finally regarding your mentioning the size of the gravel your fish will have no problem 'grubbing' through it foraging for food they positively love doing this but i would say that your gravel is irregularly shaped then it is a very real danger of getting stuck in their mouths choking i would advise the tiny mm rounded fine stones or alternatively large 'pond safe' polished river rocks from garden centres are far better if only for your peace of mind than risking choking with pea sized gravel Hamster Breastfeeding Vitamin C Fishing Fish farming Antarctic krill Axolotl Guinea pig Swimming pool Shrimp farm Salmon Carburetor Sea-Monkey Food Shark Shotgun Bengali cuisine Aquarium Maize Carbon dioxide Blood (computer game) Tilapia Internal ballistics Diving Veganism Krill Anorexia nervosa Anchor Korean cuisine Livestock Lake Burley Griffin Jewish cuisine Cat Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Olduwan Glacier Seabird Gravel Scuba set Omega-3 fatty acid Bong Nerpa Pea Pikmin Loudspeaker Agriculture Gar Stone Age Tea Diving regulator Cuisine of Malaysia Tetrapod Apple American lobster Acorn Urinary incontinence Dog Tlingit Swimming Healthy eating Mountain Gorilla Thermal power station Dieting Japanese tea ceremony Dairy Autonomous building Sperm Whale Atlantic herring Folic acid Handloading Fancy rat Terminal ballistics Tomato Cuisine of Denmark Carnivorous plant Elephant Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Flood geology Obesity Bladderwort Electrophysiology Chopsticks Desert Raw food diet Fusion power Prostate cancer Naval mine Stomach cancer Drill bit Floppy disk Shotgun shell Iron
