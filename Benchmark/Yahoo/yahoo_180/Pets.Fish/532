just emptied and cleaned my fish pond after refilling i have an oily film how do i shift it the film is almost like tracing paper have tried to drain the top level running newspaper over surface to collect the film but no success what has caused it and how do i get rid of it did you add a water conditioner after you refilled the pond some of these leave a residue by cleaning i hope you only meant that you drained it to remove debris from the pond and that you didn't use any cleaning products no soap should be used when the water level was lowered you might have disturbed a pocket of decaying leaves from pond plants or fish wastes the decomposing material can leave an organic film of dissolved proteins and bacteria which feed on it i tended to get this in a tank of catfish i have and found a surface skimmer that attaches to an aquarium filter that got rid of it by drawing water off the surface http www thatpetplace com pet group product web you might be able to attach something like this to your pond's filter with a pvc adapter Sewage treatment Aquarium Marine aquarium Dry cleaning Brewery Fish farming Water purification Shrimp farm Motor oil Sulfuric acid Bong Nuclear fallout Autonomous building Reef tank Ecology Siphon Seabird Lake Tooth Thermal power station Water Cell (biology) Soap Carnivorous plant Slow sand filter bed Bladderwort Biodiesel Dialysis Drainage Water pollution Aquaculture Town gas Tilapia Nuclear power Swimming pool Ice core Kidney Ecology of Hong Kong Water (molecule) Tooth enamel Pond Radioactive waste Hydrochloric acid Biochemistry Goldfish Tofu Essential oil Vacuum cleaner Gar Waste management Soil pH Soil Abiogenic petroleum origin Acetic acid Disinfection Hamster Coal Hemp Carbon dioxide Geyser Antarctic krill Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Mosquito Hydrogen peroxide Origin of life Iron Domestic water system Menstrual cup Fishing Coffee Toilet paper Clownfish Carbon dioxide sink Avalanche Corrosion Diseases of the honeybee Vegetarianism Renewable energy Amino acid Loudspeaker Natural gas Hydrogen sulfide Dishwasher Veganism Glossary of firefighting equipment Halitosis Polyvinyl chloride Tire Carburetor Cyanide Osmoregulation Hydroponics Biodiversity Deforestation
