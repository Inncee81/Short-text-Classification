could my goldfish get sick from a dead algae eater i have had an algae eating fish for about two years now and he recently died of some kind of infection that caused the fish to occasionally get a white film on him i took the algae eater out of my gallon aquarium tank and buried him but in the tank i also have a rather large goldfish and what i'm wondering is is there any type of infection or disease that my goldfish could catch from being in the same tank with a dead algae eater and if so what kinds of medicine could i put into the water any help would be appreciated thanks avoid medications unless you have signs of a specific illness the first thing you need to do is get a master test kit they are around but well worth it test for ammonia nitrite and nitrate i would recommend these tests any time you have a mysterious death in your fish tank if they all come back at or near zero then you shouldn't have much to worry about closely observe for signs of illness but you should be fine Marine aquarium Aquarium Fish farming Goldfish Pneumonia Cyanide Eutrophication Samuel Goldwyn Sewage treatment Shrimp farm Cancer Biogeochemical cycle Common cold Reef tank Nutrient Sexually-transmitted infection Death Eater Coeliac disease Koi Biodiesel Decompression sickness Gar Hypoglycemia Coral reef Vitamin C Sea-Monkey Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Spanish flu H5N1 Diabetes mellitus Antiviral drug Fugu Urinary incontinence Color First aid Prostate cancer Biological warfare Anorexia nervosa Lake Burley Griffin Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Fish Ulcerative colitis Homeopathy Supernatural Medicine Cytomegalovirus Diarrhea Timeline of AIDS E85 Nitric acid HIV test Hydrogen economy Helicobacter pylori Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Ebola Influenza Danio Asthma Funeral Virus Mojave people Rabies 2001 anthrax attacks Tuberculosis Ammonia Algae Brewery Halfbeak Kashrut Tilapia Chagas disease Myxobolus cerebralis Krill Chlorophyta Shark Charles Darwin's illness History of medicine Computer virus Traditional Chinese medicine Infectious mononucleosis Multiple sclerosis Sickle-cell disease Glossary of firefighting terms Infectious disease Foodborne illness Stomach cancer Antarctic krill Pharmaceutical company Insulin Malaria Myocardial infarction Syphilis Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Marburg virus Chronic fatigue syndrome El-Fish Cirrhosis
