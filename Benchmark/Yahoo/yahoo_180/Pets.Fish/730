fish tank and sand advice i have a fish tank with sand instead of rocks i think the silt is killing my filter motor has anyone had experience with this any advice i have had some issues with this as well i solved my issues by removing everything from the tank except the sand and the water from here you can do things depending on weather it's cycled or not uncycled remove the sand and put some of it into a bucket remove the water from the tank and refill fill the bucket about way with water and stir the heck out of it wait seconds and dump the water repeat untill it runs crystal clear then do it for all the sand return it to the tank let it settle try the filter and do water changes on any remaining particles then cycle the tank and add you stuff cycled this is risky but it could save your filter remove everything and turn off the filter stir the heck out of you tank let it settle for about seconds to min then do a water change after a few days repeat untill you water is cleared up shortly after stirring min this will save some bacteria and hopefully not ruin your chemistry to bad definatly test your tank and let it cycle since your filter will still have bacteria and some will be left from the sand it won't take to long mine was done in about weeks or less if your sand is very fine then wait longer befor dumping the bucket changing water since it will take longer to settle that should work and if not find new larger grain sized sand for the top layer i hear play sand works well for this but you need to clean it really good i don't know about that personally i'm testing it in a tank right now actually and it seams ok so far but i haven't tested the water yet Brewery Sewage treatment Water purification Opportunity rover Dry cleaning Marine aquarium Sand Dairy Casting The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie E85 Thermal power station Ecology of Hong Kong Bong USS Tunny (SS-282) Electrophysiology Nuclear fallout Motor oil Biodiesel Fire extinguisher Pebble bed reactor Hash table Polymerase chain reaction Cruising (maritime) Apollo 8 Web crawler Heinkel He 100 Soil Carbon dioxide Tank Shot of Love Water pollution Golf Time Diesel engine Apollo 13 STS-51-L Drill bit Sedimentary rock Fossil fuel power plant Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Sento Dredge Dead Sea Shen Gong Wu Space Shuttle Columbia disaster Yerba mate B-47 Stratojet Liquid crystal display Agar plate STS-114 CPU cache M60 machine gun Aquarium Poker jargon Liquid crystal Diseases of the honeybee Fast bowling Tier One Acetic acid Anchor Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Fire fighting Coming of Age (TNG episode) Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Sandstone Environmental concerns with electricity generation RuneScape quests Nuclear power Hardware random number generator Mattress Mars Exploration Rover Dialysis Bloom filter Sediment Volleyball Glacier The Dalek Invasion of Earth GunBound Cannabis cultivation M16 (rifle) Extreme Programming Refrigerator Campfire Lightning John F.
