sunset gouramis died after becoming bloated i think they ate the betta food as it fell down from the battas my sunset gouramis died after becoming bloated they seemed fine one day and then were dead the next with big swollen bellies they liked to hang around underneath the betta tank attached to the side of my tank and they would eat the betta food that fell out the bottom i was wandering if this could be the reason they died coz all the other fish in the tank seem fine including other dwarf gouramis no the betta food wouldn't do that most fish food is all the same just may have different percentages of proteins and such that each fish requires i'd say it was due to something else like water quality or bacterial infection or like mentioned parasites being as it was the gouramis and i'm guessing you bought them from the same place i'd say it was something they had from the pet store breeder Gourami Kissing gourami Domestic rabbit Bloating Fancy rat Discus (fish) Hamster Sewage treatment Dog Sea-Monkey Fish farming Guinea pig Diarrhea Brewery Foodborne illness Taboo food and drink Fasting Food preservation Fugu Axolotl Virus Chicken Aquarium Crohn's disease Shrimp farm Domestic goat Koi Perciformes Tofu Tick Dairy Livestock HIV test Diseases of the honeybee Finding Nemo Dieting Dietary fiber Myxobolus cerebralis Kashrut Food Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Lutefisk Cat Trapping Egg (food) Vegetarianism Stomach cancer Salmon Shark Insulin Chocolate Apple Gypsy moth Unclean animals Clownfish Tooth enamel Marine aquarium Protein-energy malnutrition Bird Frog Vitamin Crayfish Goldfish Giardia lamblia Wheat Body piercing Halitosis Ecology Toxoplasmosis Pneumonia RuneScape economy Kitchen American Alligator RuneScape quests Nuclear power Allergy Professional wrestling throws Seafood Tlingit Pet skunk Snake Nutrition Cell (biology) Japanese tea ceremony Organic food Ulcerative colitis Biological pest control Whaling Veganism Cheese Dinghy Banana Conjunctivitis Ferret Potato Gar Gray Wolf Colorectal cancer
