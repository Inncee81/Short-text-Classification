do i have to cover the bottom of my glass tank with some kind of styrofoam what do people mean by that does it mean to put the tank on top of a thick piece of styrofoam if so where can i buy that it's a gallon tank the reason people put there tanks on styrofoam is a way to make sure the tank will level itself this way if the floor is uneven then the tank will be able to evenly distribute its wieght by pressing into the styrofoam so you place the tank on top of the foam do not put the foam in your tank Mattress Brewery Plastic Polystyrene Shoe Fire extinguisher STS-114 Space Shuttle external tank Tank Loudspeaker Panzer I Casting Vermicompost Thermal power station Stairway Panzer II Foam Tank classification Bread Geodesic dome Polyurethane Flush toilet Strap-on dildo Mark VIII (tank) Fire fighting Public domain Coffee T-64 Diving suit Wheat beer Marine aquarium NASCAR Teller-Ulam design Glossary of firefighting terms Aquarium Shirt Door Upholstery Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Armoured warfare Space Shuttle program Dodge Charger Poker jargon Tank car Yohoho!
