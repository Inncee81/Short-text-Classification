aquarium plants i was wondering if i could put any regular plant in an aquarium with fish without the plant harming the fish because i have regular plants in pots that i would rather see in an aquarium than the kinds you buy in the store so i was hoping i could put them in my aquarium nope aquatic plants are of entirely different species than plants that grow outside of water and have different methods of absorbing nutrients sorry even those that are grown submerged roots in water leaves out by stores have to adjust and have a lot of leaves die out before they manage to recover and grow leaves that can handle being immersed in water if you don't want to pay money to buy your plants from the store go down to the nearest pond or lake and scrounge some plants up from the bottom just make sure you give them a good rinse in a weak bleach solution and then quarantine them for a week or two before you put them in with your fish so you don't introduce any aquatic pests or diseases into your aquarium Hydroponics Houseplant Goldfish Coral reef Textile manufacturing Fish farming Fishing Tilapia Irrigation Sewage treatment Flowering plant Wetland Poker jargon Weed control Fish Myxobolus cerebralis Carnivorous plant Comfrey Shrimp farm Zebra Danio Brewery Autonomous building Eutrophication Maize Japanese tea ceremony Cannabis cultivation Discus (fish) Invasive species in Australia Elodea Water garden Bonsai Lake Gypsy moth Aquatic plant Carp Introduced species Tomato Plant Crayfish Beaver Soil pH Taro Sugar beet Hamster Agriculture Great Lakes Water Jellyfish Bladderwort Weed Green Revolution Eucalyptus Hydrogen peroxide Leaf Dairy Koi Coffee Nutrient Sea-Monkey Nuclear power Invasive species Root Frog Chlorophyta Salmon Carbon dioxide Hemp Fern Acorn Halfbeak Hippeastrum Cycad Hydrogen economy Apple Brook trout Kelp forest Mattress Environmental concerns with electricity generation Suckermouth Catfish Ivy Aztec Gar Wheat Live-bearing aquarium fish Organic farming Peach Tetrapod Energy development Ecology Tillandsia Water purification Tea Hop (plant)
