so what fish can you put with your betta right so apparently goldfish are out of the question p and so are adult male bettas and female bettas i heard that after they have babehs the males have a little snack so what fish can you put in there depends on what kind of a set up you have a betta does fine in a tropical aquarium with most other fish as long as the aquarium is big enough i've had good luck placing them with catfish loaches plecos and others that prefer to stay near the bottom since the betta prefers to claim the top as his own i agree with keeping other bettas male or female out of that tank the betta can do well with tetras or other tropical fish that can move fairly fast to keep out of its way the larger showier fish such as angels and gouramis are probably not so good since the betta might snap at their long fins and possibly injure them and they do absolutely fine on their own they can be kept for several years in a bowl or as a specimen fish in a larger tank it's up to you if you want to keep one alone they're practically carefree just feed it once in awhile and change the water from time to time they can adapt to almost any conditions cold water is fine warm water is fine and they don't seem at all picky about whether the water is clean or dirty good luck and have fun Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Aquarium Gar Goldfish Tilapia Discus (fish) Clownfish Dwarf gourami Fishing Loach Kissing gourami Marine aquarium Bottlenose Dolphin Diving suit Halfbeak Gourami Fish Sea-Monkey Clown loach Carburetor Fast bowling Zebra Danio Coral reef Knife Fish farming Suckermouth Catfish Tetrapod Brewery Orca Koi Poker jargon Stingray Shrimp farm Japanese tea ceremony Tropical cyclone Catfish Social rule Cuisine of Denmark Dragonet Krill Tarantula Atlantic herring Marine biology Fangtooth Autonomous building Seahorse Sexual selection Galaxy Angel Humpback Whale Parrotfish Aerial (dance move) Moorish Idol Live-bearing aquarium fish Sailfin Molly Freshwater angelfish Reef tank Cardinal tetra Swimming pool Characiformes Flathead catfish Goby Fin Whale Crayfish Green swordtail Leatherback Sea Turtle Shark Whaling Nile crocodile Hamster Bong Cloud Equine conformation Nerpa Dinghy Salic law Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Bird migration Corydoras Chinatown White Cloud Mountain Minnow Hip hop collaborations Grunion Pitaten Species Clarinet Finding Nemo Paragliding Color Japanese toilet Ecco the Dolphin Gharial Toilet Textile manufacturing Georgia Aquarium Perciformes Murray Cod Whale Biodiversity Danio
