i'm not really familiar with aquariums but is the stand supposed to be this way i have a new gallon all glass aquarium i bought it with a wooden stand and canopy ok question the stand is basically a cabinet for a gallon full of water its going to be very heavy is it a safe design to leave the stand completely hollow the only thing supporting the tank is around the bottom perimiter couldn't the bottom just collapse you're stand should be just fine like soop said most stores are not going to sell you a stand that wouldn't work for the tank let me give you some examples here oh what you are looking at from an engineering prespecitve i asked a question in engineering and i work with three solar engineers that are certified in structural analysis and my answers i got were outstanding and on target first look at the weight of the water itself water weighs lbs per gallon times you have roughly lbs worth of water plus the tank weight let's estimate that to be about another lbs so alltogeather exerting force on your stand surface is say lbs spread over a four foot area you have roughly to lbs per square inch pressure on the stand which should not be overly stressful on that surface distrubute that same weight over a second floor if you are above and that doesn't even require you to place that near a load bearing wall your stand should be just fine and i would be shocked if it collapsed you have nothing to worry about collapsing your stand or the floor if you really aren't convinced i put a gallon tank calculated weight on the floor is lbs and with an inch and a half of plywood over ' it's like less then lbs per square inch on the floor and i'm in a second story floor haven't had anything collapse on me yet if you need further assistance you can get better answers at fishless cycling com or just use the link on my profile jv Pound Collapse of the World Trade Center Seismic retrofit Glossary of firefighting terms F-16 Fighting Falcon P-61 Black Widow Hard disk Saturn V Mattress P-47 Thunderbolt Thermal power station Hydrogen economy Wood Floppy disk Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Glossary of partner dance terms John Hancock Tower Shell (projectile) B-47 Stratojet Brewery Heinkel He 100 Cessna T-37 E85 Ammunition Tank Panama Canal Weight Wood carving Marine aquarium Mass Truss Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Pressure Douglas DC-8 Screw Iowa class battleship Apollo Command/Service Module Dog agility Solar system Equine conformation Geodesic dome Chair Force Goldfish IAR 80 Chevrolet Corvair Cruising (maritime) Solar power Professional wrestling holds Nuclear weapon design Motorcycle Glossary of wildland fire terms Paragliding Dundas Square Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Convair B-36 Weapon Firefighter Fire extinguisher Nuclear power Shaggy dog story Slide rule Autonomous building Space Shuttle program Scale model Naval mine Fossil fuel power plant Scramjet Glossary of firefighting equipment Heinkel He 112 Tide Tiger I Flood geology Flush toilet Biodiesel Diving Tire Douglas Skyrocket Panzer II Water (molecule) Opportunity rover Mitsubishi 3000GT M16 (rifle) C-5 Galaxy Stairway Ton Dry cleaning Mooney M20 Novelty (locomotive) T-72 Toyota Prius Mark VIII (tank) U.S. customary units
