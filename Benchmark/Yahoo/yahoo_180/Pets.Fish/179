can anyone tell me if they've experienced aggression in their goldfish tank i recently placed a rhyukin and a common goldfish in my gal tank with my fantail at first they got along however after a day or so they started chasing my fantail around a little then my fantail became so timid and avoidant that he actually got sick i have since removed him and treated him he's looking better perhaps he was already sick and that's why they singled him out or are they just incompatible i would like to put him back in the tank but i don't want to stress him out again does anyone have any advice i'd like to second the person above me on their comment about butting for eggs i once added a new fish to my goldfish tank and witnessed some horrific aggression however these were the same species and one turned out to be a male which was bullying it was actually trying to get the other one which was female to release her eggs once she did everything settled down i found out that adding a female to warmer water then what she is used to can cause her to spawn when faced with a rampant male however i am not sure if this is the case for you you have mixed breeds and i think that your goldfish is simply being aggresive they can swim much faster than a fancy and will eat all the food before your fantail can get any stress can cause a fish to become sick and this is when they are most at risk of developing a disease i would seperate your fancy fantail from your common goldfish and rhyukin and keep him in a seperate tank or donate him to a friend who has a similar breed but your fancy can live quite happily on his own he does not need a tank mate and will probably be glad of the space i hope this has helped Sea-Monkey Clownfish Chicken Platypus Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Dog Seabird Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Bottlenose Dolphin Discus (fish) Gray Wolf Salmon Kakapo Decompression sickness House Mouse Fancy Crane Aquarium Murray Cod Halfbeak Tilapia Hamster Fancy rat Domestic rabbit Psoriasis Sonic the Hedgehog Bird Acne Fish farming Ostrich American lobster Sewage treatment Swimming Social rule Livestock Diseases of the honeybee Zerg Tasmanian Devil Iowa class battleship Krill Mallard Hedgehog Samuel Goldwyn Vegetarianism Bipolar disorder Sleeping sickness Fugu Koi Cat Lake Burley Griffin Octopus Red Squirrel Gar Crohn's disease Spider Fantail Common cold Mountain Gorilla Mark I (tank) Shrimp farm Monogamy Sexual reproduction Neil Gaiman Mario series enemies Kodocha Factory farming Osteoarthritis Zebra Danio Leatherback Sea Turtle Guinea pig Health insurance Neolithic Revolution El-Fish Development of Darwin's theory Albatross USS Yorktown (CV-5) Eggerland series RuneScape quests Canary Brewery Carp Grunion Minor Harry Potter Beasts Poker jargon Plant breeding Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Frog Myxobolus cerebralis Urinary incontinence Tarantula GoldenEye 007 Antarctic krill Carbon dioxide Thermal power station Aerial (dance move) The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Emu
