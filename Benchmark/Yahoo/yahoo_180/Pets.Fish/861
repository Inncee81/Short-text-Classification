mollies babies and colors i have had some baby mollies for around three weeks maybe more and i bought the mom about two months ago she is almost ready to have more fry she was in the creamsickle lyretail molly tank and i picked her out because she was the only one that was creamsickle with black spots all over her and the rest were regular creamsickles well she came to my tank along with a dalmatian lyretail molly ready to have fry i looked at her lyretail fry last night and found that one was pale with black dots some where just pale one was orange with dark reddish orange spots some where just a reddish orange and three appear to have a gold dust pattern orange head grayish body i was wondering what genes do creamsickle mollies carry and what kinds of babies can they have since it seems i can t categorize my fry into one group except for lyretail also what types of colors do mollies come in pictures and websites would help thanks three weeks is really too young to know for sure what the colors will look like once the fish are mature the various colors you are seeing could easily change with time over the course of the next month to weeks i would suggest you wiat until they are about months old before attempting to really classify them by color for now just divide them by sex so you don't get the wrong male hooking up witht he wrong female and then select your breeding stock at about months of age the genetics will carry most all of the colors you are seeing anything from a very very pale yellowish orange to a deep red most livebearers show a huge genetic diversity and easily mutate from one generation to the next if i can help further feel free to email me or use the link in my profile mm Discus (fish) Cheetah Leopard Human skin color Cat coat genetics Horse Futurama (TV series - season 2) Sailfin Molly Color blindness Opportunity rover Cell (biology) Red Tofu Drosophila melanogaster Androgen insensitivity syndrome Hair color Live-bearing aquarium fish House Mouse Clownfish The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll Tabby cat Futurama (TV series - season 5) Wallpaper group Biology Capercaillie Beret Genetics Abortion debate Cat Potato Paramount Pictures Collectibles in Bionicle Yellow Lion Dragon Booster Iris (anatomy) AFI 100 Years series Jon Secada Runaways (comics) Extraterrestrial skies Species Genetic engineering Intelligence quotient Goldfish Black panther Geology of the Grand Canyon area Platypus Francis Crick Douglas Adams Lighting Joke Tour de France Marilyn Monroe Metroid (video game species) God Emperor of Dune Baldness Spider Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Biodiversity Black (people) Light-emitting diode Melanin Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Computer virus Dalmatian EastEnders Color The Parting of the Ways Human Senescence Black tea Cleveland Browns Fancy rat The Adventures of Pete & Pete Tomato Futurama (TV series - season 4) Sexual selection Liger Turkish Van Mark Calaway Mutation Tampa Bay Buccaneers Domestic rabbit Hall & Oates Paleoclimatology Biology and sexual orientation Keeshond My Little Pony RuneScape cheats Race Tag Sex and the City Sin City Academy Award for Costume Design History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Academy Award for Best Art Direction Y chromosome Yohoho!
