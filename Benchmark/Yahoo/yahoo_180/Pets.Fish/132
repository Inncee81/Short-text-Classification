digging fish i have a goldfish that keeps sticking pointing it's head and face at the gravel it says there untill you make it move or something scares it help goldfish love to redecorate this is one of the biggest fears with goldies because they sometimes swallow the gravel this is why some goldy keepers opt for large river rocks for their substrate have you looked closely enough to see if it's picking up pieces of gravel and placing them back down what's it doing while it's face down in the gravel you haven't said whether it's acting or looking sick so if it is just digging that's what goldies do just keep an eye out from time to time to see if he's carrying them and or possibly swallowing the gravel you may need to change out your substrate if you think he may be swallowing the gravel Sin City Gravel Tag Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Goldfish Aztalan State Park, Wisconsin Dead Like Me Characters of The Sandman Mario series enemies Goldie Erosion Punt (boat) Anchor Shaggy dog story Wa shogi Blue Peter Jurassic Park III Opportunity rover Garfield The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time characters Glacier Taikyoku shogi Happy Tree Friends Cliff Richard Comanche Trapping 2005 European Grand Prix Aerial (dance move) Tilapia Big Dig Kefalonia Mount Everest Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina RuneScape quests Tori shogi Collecting fossils Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 The Parting of the Ways Pok__mon Snap Glossary of climbing terms Atlantic herring Swiss plateau Aquarium 2000 Australian Grand Prix The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time weapons and items Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Diving Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Pok__mon Abilities Diving locations The Jam Time Out of Mind Shen Gong Wu Carcassonne (board game) Pachypodium ambongense Aquifer Peter Shilton Snake Young adult literature Canal lock Muslim ibn Aqeel Kerikeri Glossary of nautical terms U.S. Highway 66 The End of the World (Doctor Who) Macquarie Perch Volleyball The Contender (television series) Characters in the Smurfs Textile manufacturing Olduwan Poker jargon Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In Landmarks of Hoboken, New Jersey Pink salmon Chopsticks Jason Voorhees Murray Cod Piccolo Junior Saga Mining Blue Ridge Parkway Dredge Mario American Dad!
