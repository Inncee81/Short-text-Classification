catfish on the way out overheating i have two large inches long at least years old catfish in my tropical tank yesterday i noticed that the tank temperature had risen to deg c and one of the catfish was charging about the tank bumping into things i turned the thermostat right down and then back to normal and the temp has stabilised at around deg c however the catfish is clearly a goner still moving a little but eyes going opaque and a strange pale band around his body could the overheating be responsible for his condition of is it just coincidence i think the thermostat contacts must have welded because the temperature has remained at deg c since i reset the dial i did a water change at that temperature and checked the water ph and levels of nh n and no everything was normal but the catfish died however there have been no more casualties thanks for your interest sounds more like ammonia poisoning do a water change with a gravel vac make sure the water going in is the same temperature as what is in the tank don't use water changes to change tank temperature Heat Thermal power station Thermostat Refrigerator Solar power Aquarium Thermoregulation Hyperthermia Carburetor Autonomous building PID controller E85 Fish farming Fire fighting Ammonia Water (molecule) Temperature First aid Aluminium Sun Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Carbon dioxide HVAC Climate of the United Kingdom Welding Welsh language Geography of Africa Tropical cyclone Clear Lake Dishwasher Hydrogen economy Hydrogen Gas metal arc welding Goldfish Fever Climate change Seismic retrofit Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Sea level rise Pok__mon Abilities Hypothermia Degree Fahrenheit Phase (matter) Helium Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 Tesla coil Tilapia Fossil fuel power plant Sewage treatment 2004 Atlantic hurricane season Thermistor Ultraviolet Snake Marine aquarium Armored Core Slow cooker Titan (moon) Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Kosovo War Ocean thermal energy conversion Burglar alarm Homeostasis Cheating in Counter-Strike St. Louis County, Missouri Corrosion Brewery Energy development Fancy rat Combustion Glossary of firefighting terms Apollo 13 Items in the Metroid series Bird migration Relay Negative feedback Ceramics Titanium Gas tungsten arc welding Motor oil Catfish El Ni__o Severe weather terminology (United States) Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Fishing Car handling Ozone depletion Mark I (tank) Circuit breaker Dead Like Me Relative humidity Brewing National Weather Service Floyd Rose Coral reef Vacuum cleaner Bi-metal USS Seadragon (SS-194) Laika Gas absorption refrigerator Autism
