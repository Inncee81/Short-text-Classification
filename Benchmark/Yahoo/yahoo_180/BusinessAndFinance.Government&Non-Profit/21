would you continue the application process of a job if one of the interviewer completely disresrespected you i applied for this government job a year ago i recently had a nd interview for a background check the person who interviewed me mad me feel like an idiot she made fun of things that i wrote on the application told me how disappointed in me she was she doesn't even know me and made me feel like i should be kissing the ground she walked on because they were even still considering me as an applicant now am completely stressed out and not even sure i still want the job i shouldn't have to work with her much if at all once on the job the job would also be a much higher paying salary i am just afraid the way she treated me will effect my job performance if i do get the job like i will feel constantly on edge what do you think what would you do there are a few things to consider carefully before taking any action do you want that particular government job or you just want a better paying job if the job you interviewed for is really the one you want for various reasons then you should consider who would be your supervisor if it was a background check interview it's usually done by someone in human resources and unless that is the department you're going to work in you have nothing to worry about if you go ahead and take the job make sure you clear things with the person that made you feel bad use a calm tone and express your distress tell the person how her approach to your application and the things she said hurt you make sure you refer to her actions and don't label her for example don't say you are a mean person and you made me feel bad about myself but do say your behavior during the background check interview made me feel uncomfortable some of the things you said about my application like the fact that you were disappointed and you used humor in a serious and stressful context for me were really bothering me i just wanted to let you know how i felt about our meeting the point is to differentiate between the person and the behavior make sure she understands you don't resent her but you want her to be aware that her behavior hurt you a thing she might not be aware of about the thought you have on how her behavior would affect your performance clear the situation with the person it would help get rid of your feeling of inadequacy and then focus on doing your job right they wouldn't hire you if they weren't confident you could do the job the interviewer you feel bad about might have been stressed out herself had a bad day be new to the job or simply didn't have the skills to make you feel comfortable in the meeting don't take it to the heart because just like you said she doesn't even know you i can't say what i would do if i were you but if it was me in your situation and it was a job i wanted i'd go ahead and take the job deal with the interviewer's behavior and do my best i don't care much what other people think when they first meet me i care what they think after they know me and see what i can do alina Theory of conduct Social rule Milton H.
