if i want to work for the usps in or near my hometown do i have to wait for a test to be given locally does it matter where i go to take a usps civil service test i'm in northern nj currently the only tests listed on the usps website in nj are further south nowhere near where i live could i take a test down there and still work up here or is there more of a correlation between testing location and working location also is a test being given in a particular town at all indicative of job openings being more likely there they set up test locations wherever they can get a place big enough to handle all the applicants i've taken tests that were about miles away from where the actual work was going to be done just because they needed a large meeting hall to accommodate everybody but they're going to schedule a test where it's convenient for them there's hundreds if not thousands of people applying for the same test as you you'll see that if you show up for the test so they're not going to try to accomodate your needs you have to go where they're holding the test plain and simple United States Postal Service CHSH inequality Education in the People's Republic of China Delaware CPU cache Explosive material Postage stamp Normal distribution Intelligence quotient Heckler & Koch USP GED Graduate school Compiler optimization Psychology Psychometrics Hampshire Debugging Pharmaceutical company Bell's theorem Test plan Extreme Programming University of the South Pacific Embedded system Tropical cyclone Otakon Digital circuit Visual Basic Expert system ITV Computer City status in the United Kingdom Enterprise content management Kansas Motor oil CPU design Palace of Westminster Mach kernel Internet fraud Myers-Briggs Type Indicator PHP First Amendment to the United States Constitution South Carolina Law School Admissions Test North Carolina Parliament House, Canberra Big five personality traits Teletext Elevator Iowa Data mining American Red Cross Rugby union Hardy-Weinberg principle Legal system of Hong Kong Information Technology Infrastructure Library Hong Kong International Airport Game programming Windows 2000 Reliability engineering Anchor EPR paradox Boy Scouts of America Physics ELO rating system Human sexual behavior University of S__o Paulo Education in the United States Domain Name System Local hidden variable theory Trinity test Web crawler Concealed carry (USA) Japanese tea ceremony Rational Unified Process Proxy server Thread (computer science) .45 ACP Town meeting U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 AppleTalk Florida Barrister TGV New York City Subway Bayesian inference Construction Mouse (computing) Gmail Milpitas, California Make money fast Cessna T-37 Drug test M240 Reynolds number Auto Train (Amtrak) Croydon Genetic algorithm Master Control Program Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus
