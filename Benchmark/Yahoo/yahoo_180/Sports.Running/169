my nike plus system has been crapping out i start a workout and within a few seconds it will end the workout workout completed workout distance time seconds how annoying yesterday i had four three second workouts what is going on could the sensor be shot has this happened to anyone else i had to finish the last three miles of a six mile run without the pedometer and timer functions working and i don't want to go into an october marathon with the possibility of it doing this again but i'm also hesitant to buy a brand new sensor piece unless i know it's shot for good ideas i just had my nike plus system that i bought dec die on me too mine did the same thing it would just stop during my workout and wouldn't start up again i had an awesome experience with apple customer service if yours is still under warranty they have a one year warranty just go to their website you just have to fill in your information serial from the sensor your address name etc and within literally just a few days you will have a brand new kit via overnight mail for free the only caveat is that you have to provide a credit card because they require you to return your broken nike plus kit within days if you don't they charge you for the replacement i believe it was good luck i understand your frustration i love my nike plus and was miserable for the few days i had to run without it Warranty Craps Hard disk Marathon (sport) X Window System Anti-ballistic missile Weight training United States Postal Service Toyota Prius America Online Objective-C Shit Triathlon IPod The Adventures of Pete & Pete Copy protection Sears Holdings Corporation Bluetooth In The Groove (game) Extreme Programming E85 IBM PC compatible Mac OS X Indianapolis 500 Ashton-Tate Space Shuttle Columbia disaster Brand Project Nike National Weather Service Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina CPU cache Advanced Squad Leader Second Battle of the Atlantic Satchel Paige Teletext Domain Name System Apple IIGS Public transport Embedded system ITunes Music Store Electronic commerce Hey Jude Poker jargon $ale of the Century Yesterday (song) Product (business) Apple Open Collaboration Environment Western Digital Traffic light Trademark Anti-aircraft warfare History of Microsoft Windows Xbox Taxicab Microprocessor PowerPC IBook RISC Credit card Digital photography STS-62 Counter-Strike National Missile Defense Ethernet Peachtree Road Race Serial 2005 United States Grand Prix Atari 8-bit family CPU design Neopets Knots Landing Bubble Bobble Windows XP Nintendo IMac Filling station Copyleft Linux kernel Starsiege: Tribes Geographic information system RuneScape quests Cleveland Browns Gravity GunBound Cheating in Counter-Strike Nintendo Revolution New York Knicks Cross site scripting Mattress Addressing mode USS Tunny (SS-282) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Naval mine The Beatles discography Auto insurance Animal Crossing Mach kernel
