whats a good running stretching program i have started runnign again for the first time in years for about weeks ive been just heading out and banging around trying to build up some conditioning but now i need to start over as ive picked up my first case of shin splints so i need to come up with a more consistant stretching program and also a better time distance hill program any ideas and about the shin splints ive read about how to build up strength in the front of the leg and also to ice alot but ive found that as i fatigue on a run and i lose my stride i start pounding on the front of the legs almost in a contolled fall how do u prevent splints when you are getting more fatigued well i used to have that problem also i am ' and lbs if you are around these same dimensions or w e you want to call them it could be in the way you run i used to have short strides and ran flat footed what i do now is take longer strides and stay on the balls of my feet you really want to avoid being your heels also it is important to reach out with long strides or you will get that pounding effect i guess you kinda know that and that fatigue is more your problem what you need to do is run shorter distances untill you can build up enough stamina to run those distances with the stride type i wus speaking of above Equine conformation Fast bowling Cross-country skiing Running Show hunter Hurdling Marathon (sport) Chair Laws of cricket Batting (cricket) Mixed martial arts Marching band Pole vault Stress fracture Horse gait Weight training Backstroke Cricket Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling holds Bicycle frame Carpal tunnel syndrome Recumbent bicycle Baseball Triathlon Glossary of climbing terms High-heeled shoe Sprint (race) Glossary of American football Swimming Horse No ball Evolution of the Horse Fielding (cricket) Breaststroke Show jumping American football strategy ALGOL 68 Professional wrestling attacks Dog training Charles Ives Extreme Programming Psoriasis CPU cache Decompression sickness Field hockey Diving Skateboarding trick Yao Ming Water polo Vegeta Harness racing Vishnu Butterfly stroke Radar Tyrannosaurus rex Football (soccer) American football Casualty lifting Glossary of ballet terms Dialysis Badminton Buffer overflow Softball Muscle Tetrapod Computer virus Big Bang Compiler optimization General relativity Second Battle of the Atlantic MS-06 Zaku II Wind turbine C programming language Shoe Indian cricket team in Zimbabwe in 2005-06 Mouse (computing) Microphone Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Professional wrestling throws Military history of the Roman Empire Iliotibial band syndrome Figure skating Ski Monica Seles Parade (military) Combat stress reaction M16 (rifle) Random walk Carolina Panthers Brown Bear Glider Hair Suplex New York Giants Ethernet Black hole Yield curve Pound
