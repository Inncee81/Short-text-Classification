running hot weather sweatshirt can i run in the hot weather like it is now with a sweatshirt or will something happen i mean just a sweatshirt no shirt just undershirt and light sweatshirt i'm assuming you want to run in a sweatshirt to melt some weight off take it from me it won't work you will only loose water weight and you'll put it right back on when you rehydrate and as others have mentioned you run a higher risk of heatstroke to loose weight just run consistently at a slow to moderate pace and watch your diet loosing weight slowly is the only effective method Shirt Hyperthermia Weight training Hiking Internal ballistics Kilt Anchor Atkins Nutritional Approach Prostate cancer Nuclear reactor Albedo Softball Titanium Nuclear weapon design Mountaineering St. John Ambulance Dieting Hydrogen economy Fast bowling Climate of the United Kingdom Tofu Horse gait Sento Diarrhea Ammonia Naval mine Glossary of wildland fire terms Casting Rehydration Mattress Drag racing Glossary of American football Porosity Poker jargon Rugby league positions Glossary of partner dance terms Hypertension Roof Tocopherol Bob Jones University Alcoholic beverage Anorexia nervosa Time travel Car handling Hot air balloon Radioisotope thermoelectric generator Dialysis Bicycle brake systems Welding Avalanche Rocket fuel Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Fire fighting Effects of global warming Low-carbohydrate diet Bathing Cantonese cuisine Indianapolis 500 Explosive material Protein-energy malnutrition Jet engine Marathon (sport) Coffee Hypoglycemia Earth's atmosphere Inflation Ephedrine Frog Gasoline Nuclear power Nuclear thermal rocket Natural disaster Tank Solar power satellite Solar power Hormone replacement therapy (trans) The Day After Tomorrow Swimming Dehydration Rugby union positions Indian Oil Cup 2005 Decompression sickness Coeliac disease Heavy metal fashion Severe weather terminology (United States) History of Test cricket (1890 to 1900) Textile manufacturing National Weather Service Starfleet ranks and insignia Cryptosporidium Sodium Cancer Tesla coil Glycemic index Caffeine Equine conformation Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Dyson sphere Instant coffee White phosphorus incendiary
