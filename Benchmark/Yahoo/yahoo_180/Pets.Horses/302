my horse's behavior suddenly worsened i have a year old quarter horse gelding he was only broke a year ago now he has never been perfect but he was rideable and i even jumped him i went a way for a week and i asked my instructor to have some experienced people ride him ever since i came back he has been crazy he bucks when i ask him to do anything more than walk and he is spooking at everything litteraly everything i have no idea what's going on i think maybe someone might have messed with him while i was gone the vet will be out friday any ideas somebody obviously rode your horse and allowed him to get away with some things he shouldn't have and this is the result the bucking could be due to any number of causes such as back soreness from being ridden hard by a heavy rider or from an ill fitted saddle or girth i would look at your tack and check to be sure it fits and is adjusted properly the spookiness is going to be harder to cure this is something that probably developed because someone rode the horse and the animal spooked at something but instead of taking the time to help him get over his fears whoever rode him just either ignored him or overreacted and put him away without making him face what he was afraid of until he settled down having the vet out to check for physical problems is a good idea it's possible that the horse could be lame or sore somewhere and this is what is causing the bucking once the vet has seen the horse and any medical problems have been either treated or ruled out you can work on the spook problem to start with i would longe your horse until he's a bit tired and has had a chance to work off his energy somewhat a tired horse is less apt to act up when he's outside his comfort zone which is what you are asking him to do when you ride him anywhere except in the arena i would also take the time to sack the horse out that is rub him all over with a blanket with a plastic raincoat or with anything else you can think of that might spook him do this from the ground not from his back so he has a chance to feel and see it and get used to it before you get on him again take him for walks after longeing him for a few days and let him look around and see things if he spooks you will be in a better position to deal with it and give him some positive reinforcement when he behaves correctly while you are grooming him in the barn turn on the radio and let it play some loud music or news reports so he gets used to sounds not just sights again if he spooks when he hears this you will be there to calm him down and since he knows and trusts you anyway he is more likely to settle down after a while you can also play with him in the arena lead him up to the wall or fence and smack the wall or fence with your hands so he hears that noise this will show him that there is nothing to fear from that my mare had a problem recently with a plastic tarp which we were using to cover some hay and i took her up to the truck where the hay was and calmly picked up the tarp and rattled it repeatedly yes she spooked and pulled back at first but after a while she took it in stride and ignored what i was doing if you expose your horse to enough scary situations he will eventually get over his fears enough so that you can ride him again with some safety and confidence he will soon figure out that you aren't afraid and because he knows you are dominant he will follow your lead just make sure that you always introduce new or scary things while you are on the ground not his back both of you will be more comfortable that way not to mention safer good luck i hope this helps you Horse tack Milton H.
