are there other ways besides the vet to tell if my mare is pregnant the reason i am asking is because when i got her from my sister she said she wasn't pregnant but now lately i have noticed that her belly is becoming wider and lower she is a year old arabian mare now i know she was just in season around a month ago mares can't go into season if they are pregnant can they and please if most of the people who tried to answer jordan m's question about being able to ride during a horse pregnancy don't answer mine it's obvious most you don't know anything thank you to any real horse people can answer me lol paint pony that is what i was afraid of can a mare go into season if she is pregnant is she bagging up that means have her nipples started to swell and has her udder become firm to the touch feel her hindquarters the muscles around her tail will become quite soft and flaccid right before the delivery if she's pregnant this is nature's way of preparing for the birth if she was in heat a month ago though i seriously doubt she's in foal unless you either bred her by live cover or she got out and somehow got covered on her own by a stallion lincoln charmer though he may be is a little too young to be fertile yet so that's out i have never known a mare who was pregnant to come into heat so i think that you are probably seeing a grass or hay belly with her even if by some chance the mare was bred she would not be showing signs of impending birth yet mares carry foals for months or days give or take weeks either way i hope that answers your question Equine conformation Horse Pregnancy Welsh Cob (Section D) Fertility awareness Lipizzan Thoroughbred Pony of the Americas Obstetrics Welsh pony of cob type (Section C) Arabian horse Breastfeeding EastEnders Abortion debate Estrus cycle Connemara pony Selle Fran__ais Donkey Cat Dartmoor pony Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Comanche Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Domestication of the horse Dog Miscarriage Horus Elephant House Mouse The Ashlee Simpson Show Twin Days of our Lives Friends Childbirth Hackney (horse) Akhal-Teke Ocean's Twelve Kakapo Seabiscuit Horses of Middle-earth Pregnancy fetishism Menstrual cycle Knots Landing Abortion Exmoor pony Big Brother (USA TV series) Gray (horse) Trakehner Przewalski's Horse Karabakh Roan (color) The Red Pony Clydesdale (breed) Male pregnancy Satchel Paige Evolution of the Horse Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Melanie Wilkes The Apprentice 2 Oldenburg (horse) Only Fools and Horses Welsh mountain pony (Section A) Domestic goat In vitro fertilisation Sunday Silence Morgan horse Welsh pony (Section B) Gettysburg Address Charmed Poliomyelitis Sharon Tate Platypus Apollo 8 Kurt Cobain Mattress Origin belief Lammtarra Social rule Dressage Folic acid Spina bifida Tocopherol Mule Selective breeding Coffee Breaker Morant Wheat Capercaillie Year of the Spider Garth Brooks Wheel of Fortune Seahorse Species Docking Crossing Jordan Weather lore Cheetah Dairy The Joker's Wild
