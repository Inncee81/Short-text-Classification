what's with the show name i'm really confused here why does your horse need any special name other than what you call them unless they are registered is this a pretend registered name or just a new trend that is circulating through the horse showing world wow maybe i've been out of the hsw too long this is totally out of curiosity not trying to discount anyone i guess i don't have any problem with first place goes to nifty owned and shown by cindy even when i showed a registered aqha i entered him at open shows as face not another jim dandy interesting maybe it's personal preference it's just a way of making your horse more individual every horse i know has a show name even if they only go to the local pony club my current horses are all registered with proper names but when i was a kid i made up a 'posh' name for each of my ponies and used it in shows also in even a small show there's probably or entries called 'star' or 'flash' so it helps differentiate between them anyway there's no harm in it Horse My Little Pony Thoroughbred Horse show Connemara pony Arabian horse Selective breeding Morgan horse Appaloosa Password Equine conformation National Register of Historic Places Pony Express Domestication of the horse X86 assembly language Monetary policy Slash fiction Vehicle registration plate Docking EastEnders Dog show Fan fiction Zoophilia The Fairly OddParents Intellectual property Transsexuality Science fiction on television Target Corporation Microeconomics Chinese character CPU cache Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Opie and Anthony Rolex Kentucky Three Day 4Kids TV Hunt seat Spice Girls Megan Griffin The Life and Times of Juniper Lee The Guess Who 2005 Atlantic hurricane season Springfield Elementary School The Standard Filling station Town meeting Lady and the Tramp Mad Money Ferrari Aerial (dance move) American Quarter Horse Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Single Transferable Vote 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, vote suppression Gambling Celebrity Sing Tao Daily Plame affair Conscription Only Fools and Horses Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Pow-wow Ultimate Muscle Evolution of the Horse British comic Ben Johnson (athlete) Public domain Show jumping Care Bears Horse gait Chess Ferret Behavioral finance Lawyer Theory of conduct Boise, Idaho Lisp programming language Game show Captain Marvel (DC Comics) Security (finance) The Man From Snowy River IA-32 Achtung Baby Inflation Post office Telephone numbering plan Flash (comics) Windows registry Central processing unit The Stone Pony Compiler optimization The Red Pony Web traffic Scottsdale, Arizona Am730 The Big Break Goatse.cx Wal-Mart Register window Transformer
