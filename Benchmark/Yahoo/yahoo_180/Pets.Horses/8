how old will my horse live to be sorry posted twice sorry for posting twice i put it in the wrong catergory first i have a year old mostly retired ridden every once and a while healthy happy morgan pony he is and is at a good weight he has lots of energy and does not wear shoes he has only been lame once in his life and has never coliced i understand that ponies can live a long time and my pony does not look like he is going to be getting too old too quick but he is old and so i am wondering what age you think he might live to he gets constant hay and is turned out all day taken out of his dirt some grass pasture to a grassy paddock for a couple hours every day he is fed pound of senior twice a day and is given probios and cosequin he loves people and surprisingly is dominant over the two other hand horses he lives with so ideas i have a year old morgan pony and my aunt's welsh cob x quarter horse is and still very healthy your morgan pony seems very healthy make sure not to exercise him to much as he gets older and i would guess he could live to be as old as my aunts horse most ponies live longer then horses so our ponies will live quite a long time if they are cared for and healthy good luck p s make sure to make his last years his golden years Horse Equine conformation Laminitis Pony Horseshoe Hay Welsh Cob (Section D) Welsh mountain pony (Section A) Arabian horse The Red Pony My Little Pony Theory of conduct Roan (color) Morgan horse Only Fools and Horses Horsepower EastEnders The Wonderful Wizard of Oz Fast bowling Belmont Park Disneyland Comanche Guinea pig Domestic rabbit Welsh pony of cob type (Section C) Rocko's Modern Life Dairy Horses of Middle-earth Horse colic The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Evolution of the Horse Social rule Milk Marguerite Henry 2000 Australian Grand Prix Time Out of Mind Socrates About a Boy Pony Express Thoroughbred Piccolo Junior Saga Salad Fingers Sin City Welsh pony (Section B) Pony of the Americas Bondage (BDSM) Breastfeeding Scuba set Pitaten Penske Racing The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Domestication of the horse Super Size Me John McDouall Stuart Cleveland Browns Nicomachean Ethics Santa Claus John Steinbeck Futurama (TV series - season 5) Arjuna The Ashlee Simpson Show Jon Secada Force (Star Wars) Frankie Laine Ren and Stimpy American Quarter Horse Welsh Terrier Current teachings of Prem Rawat Barbed wire Atkins Nutritional Approach M16 (rifle) High-heeled shoe Wales Fancy rat Mahoraba Father Ted Steven Wright USS Wasp (CV-7) Milton H.
