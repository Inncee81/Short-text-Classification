bruised sole how long for recovery my horse is lame with a bruised sole on his off fore how long does recovery take its been two weeks already and he is still a bit pink any advice gratefully received it was my farrier who spotted the bruised sole as the reason for the lamness and he just said a week or two's rest should be enough and that was it but two weeks on there is no improvement you can used warm animalintex poultices and they are very good for bruised soles you could also have him shod and a pad put under the shoe and that can also provide relief i would have expected it to be resolving by now one of my hunters was always supposed to be getting bruised soles and he actually had deep seated corns again shod him with pads Equine conformation Bruise Horseshoe Shoe Diving Massage Laminitis Stomach cancer Breastfeeding Shoemaking Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Spirit rover timeline for 2004 February Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Opportunity rover High-heeled shoe Great Depression Emergency preparedness Milton H.
