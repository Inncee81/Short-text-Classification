errrr bot flies my horse gets tons and tons of bot fly eggs on her legs when i try to get them off her legs i just pick them off or scrape them off with a bot fly knife which doesnt get them completely off does anyone have any other more efficient ways to remove bot fly eggs just wondering if anyone had any other ways please do not gets defensive as i am not getting defensive either i try to be as natural as possible and at my barn we only worm our horses when a horse there has worms or when our horse looks like it has worms because when you add chemicals to a horse's body and they have nothing to get rid of aka worms then it is just sitting there in your horses body and chemicals are not natural at all for a horses body that is why i only worm sparingly horses didnt worm theirselves in the wild so i am trying to make my horse's life as natural and pleasant as possible thanks delta dawn but my stateline tack part of the petsmart isnt there anymore in the store i think they are getting rid of all of them because they sold everything in the stateline tack part for some reason i don't see them as much as i used to on my animals we have always used a bic razor an old one or new doesn't matter to scrape them off for me it was cheaper and easier than the bot knife Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Horse Aerial (dance move) Knife Team Fortress Classic Textile manufacturing Dairy Horse gait Botfly Computer virus GunBound Earthworm ZGMF-X56S Impulse Gundam Senescence Theory of conduct Tennessee Walker Snake Comanche Pet skunk Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Equine conformation Perfect Dark Agriculture MapleStory Crazy Horse Spam (electronic) Mosquito Sandworm (Dune) Volleyball Vermicompost Natural deduction Razor Professional wrestling attacks The Amber Spyglass E-mail Sailing Chicken Biological pest control Kitesurfing Sin City Guinea pig The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Philip J.
