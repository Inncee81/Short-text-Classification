i'm looking for a bomb proof horse and so far it hasn't been great does anyone have advice or a website it needs to be bomb proof because my sisters are still little and i've only been riding a little under a year i'm only so yeah if you have any tips please let me know the horses have to be in bc canada and anywhere close to the kamloops or vancouver area thank you karina if i were you i would look for an older mare or gelding you might look for one that has been trained to rope cut run barrels and is about yrs old i know it seems old but they actually do have a lot of years left in them i had a well trained mare that i rode until she was just remember in looking at a horse find some then that has been used and worked hard that way the horse can teach you usually an older horse will not freak out about anything they are more mature and have been rode a lot longer i've been riding horses for yrs and the worse experience i've had was on a green broke horse it's better to stick to a more mature and older horse that knows what its supposed to be doing that way you can learn more from the horse and the horse can learn about you good luck charity Horse Cowboy Seabiscuit Arabian horse Canadian Pacific Railway Equine conformation Horse tack Cavalry in the American Civil War British Columbia Japan Cup Pitaten Milton H.
