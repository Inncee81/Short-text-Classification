please help whats wrong with my horse since march this year my horse's behaviour is getting worse she's been taken off grass in case of staggers treated for stomach ulcers on a magnezium replacement and had hundreds spent on massage bowen and choirpractor type sessions she's bucking heavy not wanting to go foreward and has a short stride while riding she is also becoming uncontrolable while leading often rearing and trying to bolt it is not a dominance issue it has something to do with pain because she is not happy expecially walking down hills where she will actually hold her breath on occasion the vet keeps guessing whats wrong and my finances are running out she is normally a wonderful horse to be around and happy in her work which is mainly dressage no one seems to be able to help her and i am beyound frustration now i'm even starting to think i may have to put her down we live in rotorua new zealand wow did'nt expect so many replies thanks she is yo not shod and behaves best with me rather than anyone else the vet and myself have lunged her and yes she has been on pain killers which helped hugely but we havn't found the cause although i'm sure most the pain is coming from her hind quarters i will organise to have the mri thing and hopefully that gives us some answers thanks so much for all your help good job on all the treatments you have tried do they have nuclear medicine at any of the vet schools in your area personally that would be the next choice if she was a human would be to nm her and see if she had athritis areas of inflammation broken or healing bones etc that does cost alot of money and i know and can understand with your finances dwindling but i would check around ask the vet to refer you and see if there is a place over there that has one you may have to put her down sadly its so hard when animals can't talk to us but you are thinking about her wellbeing and i give you a big hug for that its a hard decision Equine conformation Stomach cancer Horse Theory of conduct Dressage Osteoarthritis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Horse gait Shaggy dog story Prostate cancer 2000 Australian Grand Prix Fast bowling Milton H.
