what are the advantages of t touch on horses i would just like to know what t touch does to a horse and how can i do it thank you for your help i myself use t touch all the time on my horse it helps to relax the horse especially before a big and stressful event or even during it i also use it to increase circulation especially when an injury occurs like a pulled tendon to encourage it to heel faster i also use it on any muscle soreness and it usually relaxes it enough to relieve the pressure start by applying light pressure with two or three fingers and move them in a circular motion and each cirlce is never in the same area as the previous onemove up and down the neck and over the whither's and wherever you want to go this technique is also very helpful to get a horse over being headshy or to get them use to you touching any other part of their body that they are unsure of just start a a comfortable place and slowly move your fingers towards his ears and then back down the neck and then back up again each time getting closer to his head until you're on it and then back off again and then proceed farther onto his head and so forth for me it is just a great training tool especially for nervous youngsters and even for other horses too hope this helps Equine conformation Urinary incontinence Repetitive strain injury Backstroke Breaststroke Professional wrestling holds Reflexology Aikido Horse gait Aerial (dance move) Weight training Eye Sin City Swimming Mixed martial arts Milton H.
