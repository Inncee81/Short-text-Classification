my horse show i am entering a horse show and i am nervous i am competing against my sister and we are both competitive so there is no point of trying to tell me 'just have fun ' last horse show i only placed second because the other girl's horse refused the same girl is entering and i don't think i'll be lucky enough to have her pony refuse my sister hasn't gotten to ride the horse she rides since tuesday after their big fall i've gotten to ride my mount though her mount june has been in her stall for two days i'm nervous but i think i can beat her we have been teasing each other of whose gonna win and now i don't think it's me and i do at the same time help stop freaking out about who will win if your sister had a big fall don't put on the pressure to push herself if she may be a bit low on confidence please don't brag to her or anyone else hoping the best rider's horse will refuse is not good sportsmanship she earned it if she is a good rider she took the time to perfect that all you can do is be a good sport practice all you can then the last day before the show go on a trail ride and relax just make sure at the show to be relaxed and see if you don't get the ribbon you still learned something that could always be improved don't put all that pressure on yourself about how you are going to be the best and win the blue ribbon if you have that additude of a push button pony snob then i suggest getting an additude change be glad that you are competing and the worst you can do is be nervous your horse can sense it and it will refuse and act up just do your best and you'll suceed in some way p s just second that is really good i haven't gotten a second place ribbon yet but are there only three people in your riding classes Horse Equine conformation Show jumping Horse show Tour de France Milton H.
