horseback riding without stirrups ok i put this question in the general sports section and it wasnt working so ill try it here my horseback riding trainer is on a big no stirrup kick i have been with different trainers in the last year and they all have different ways on how to do no stirrup work should i just let my legs dangle down or should i hold them as if i had stirrups my trainer now says they should dangle down i trust her judgement she is a olympic level rider but still just a fyi i would like the answer to be directed toward a h j rider thanks my trainer does pritty much everything she used to jump when she was younger and now is an olympic level dressage rider i dont have my toes pointed down my heels are actually down but as i am a jumper im used to short stirrups so having my legs almost straight feels weired im asking if ishould hold my legs as if i had stirrups or just relax them as long as i have my heels down riding without stirrups is for balance you need to find it as well as strengthening your leg muscles the proper position is to relax your leg sink deep in your seat bones relaxed and simply point your toes up you will be just fine its the best thing for you hopefully she will have you in a point without stirrups as well great riding comes from great pain and dedication Equine conformation Horse Show jumping Dressage Skateboarding trick High-heeled shoe Professional wrestling holds Stirrup Hunt seat Cowboy Diving Recumbent bicycle Figure skating Eventing Backstroke Aerial (dance move) Kitesurfing Cowboy boot Glossary of ballet terms Snowboard Parade (military) Swimming Comanche Boxing Equitation Swingout Weight training Archery Bull riding Clean and jerk Sport rowing Triathlon Breaststroke Bicycle Horse gait Aikido Obedience training Marching band Professional wrestling throws Bullfighting Chinese martial arts Professional wrestling slang Dog training Taekwondo Professional wrestling attacks Sport Muay Thai Connemara pony Cheerleading Massage Traveller (horse) United States at the 2004 Summer Olympics Norway national football team Glossary of partner dance terms Horse breaking Parachuting Netherlands at the 2004 Summer Olympics Arabian horse Squat (exercise) Spinning (cycling) Cross-country equestrianism Great Britain at the 2004 Summer Olympics Asana July 2004 in sports Horizontal bar Muscle Wassily Kandinsky Foot Lindy Basic Tai Chi Chuan International Olympic Committee Snowboarding Dog agility Motorcycle Brazil at the 2004 Summer Olympics Kurt Angle Ski Pointe shoes Childbirth Water polo FA Cup Germany at the 2004 Summer Olympics Eddie Guerrero Out-of-body experience Charisma (horse) Shin splints Windsurfing Wushu 1936 Summer Olympics Lance Armstrong Motorcycle helmet Reflexology Strap-on dildo Mixed martial arts Shoe Butterfly stroke Martial art Michelle Kwan
