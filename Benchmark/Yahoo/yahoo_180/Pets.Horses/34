can miniature ponys be kept in the house i've heard about people keeping miniature ponys in their house just like dogs let them sleep on their bed etc and i know they can be used for blind people instead of seeing eye dogs is it really a good idea to keep a miniature pony inside even if it gets adequate time and exercise outdoors if so can they be potty trained like dogs so they don't mess in the house how pricey are they how much money should be expected to be spent on food etc i sincerely hope that you are not considering keeping a miniature horse in your house miniature horses are used as service animals as someone already said but usually for epileptics or disabled individuals not blind people because they spook too easily and attract too much attention i have trained horses to poo in a muck bucket in the corner of their stall but as horses are hind gut digesters and are constantly digesting food you cannot house train them or keep them from pooing as that could easily constipate them and cause colic by impaction they do make horsey diapers but that is ridiculous as to your inquiry as to their cost minis can range from free to several hundred dollars to over for a show quality pet on average expect to pay between and they do not eat much and are often over fed a bag of grain between and will last months and a bale of hay averages like and will last about a week and a half vet bills will average at least a year don't forget hoof trims and wormers and grooming supplies and such you will need to build a shelter and fence in your yard if you are considering getting a mini Cat Horse Dog Hamster Toilet humour Guinea pig Poker jargon Pet skunk Dairy Livestock Equine conformation Social rule Laminitis My Little Pony Fancy rat Dog training Housebreaking Shaggy dog story Ferret Fecal incontinence Horse colic Shetland Sheepdog House Mouse Rabbit Hunting Public transport Comanche Fox hunting Horseshoe Hay Microchip implant (animal) Milk Ben Johnson (athlete) Community emergency response team Horse gait Gray Wolf Economy of Russia Socialization Arabian horse Homer Simpson Urinary incontinence Taboo food and drink Milton H.
