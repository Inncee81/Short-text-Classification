i have a y o horse what should i do next he is years old tb and off track he has little bad habits since he wasn't there long i feel like i am always hanging on his mouth yet if i let up he gets too fast i try useing my body to slow his trot but that doesn't help much he is also very stiff in the neck i work with him and he is getting better at giving me his neck but are there certain excersizes perfect for this i thought of ungling him with side reins is that worth it i don't want to bring him us to be hard at the mouth but i don't know how to give him rein without letting him speed up his pace he is very clumsy and still trips and sinks his hind i use a regular d ring snaffel and that is it please give me your excersizes or comments on what we shoudl work on and how to start pulling him into frame i have a similar problem with my year old while it sounds like you need some professional help temporary at least there are some exercises you can do in the saddle and on the ground to loosen him up on the ground put him in a halter rope halter preferably with knots tied in it along the noseband they push on pressure points and give you a bit more control with a lead stand at his left shoulder facing his head put your right hand on his withers and pull his face around to you with your left hand if he is really stiff it may take him a week or two before he can really stretch out try to get him to hold himself up when you do this if he is laying on your hand using you to support his neck release him a little then pull him sharply back into place don't let the rest of his body move if he does then put him right back where you had him and tell him firmly whoa if he persists then back him up several paces and tell him to whoa again do this on both sides twice every time before you ride also stretch his legs out if his legs are stretched before you ride then maybe he wont feel the need to stretch out too much while you are riding it will also keep him from getting a cramp if he starts running before he's warmed up with his front feet stand at his shoulder and lift his foot up as if you were going to pick his hoof out wrap your left arm underneath his upper leg and put your right hand under the fetlock pull his leg up and slightly forward keep pulling forward and slide your left hand to just under his knee and keep your right under his fetlock pull the leg out in front of him and downward you'll feel him relax and give the leg to you release and let him stand do this on both legs stretch him slowly so he doesn't get hurt the rear legs pick one up as if to pick out the hoof slide your hands down to the hoof and lifting the leg pull it as far forward to his shoulder as you can be sure to keep your face and body as far away as possible because sometimes they will reflexively pull it out of your grasp then pull the leg back and downwards do this on both legs at this point saddle him up i strongly recommend lunging him for at least five minutes before you ride don't lunge him for more than minutes everyday though because you'll strain his legs after you saddle him up lift both of his front legs up and forward before you excersise him this pulls the skin out from under the girth so it won't pinch him when he runs finally when you ride while stopped in the saddle slide your left hand down the reins a bit and pull his face towards your knee keep your right hand in contact with his mouth but dont pull only pull if he steps forward and then back him up several paces and tell him firmly to whoa if he starts to turn in a circle let him eventually he'll get bored don't release pressure try to get him to hold his own weight when you do this don't let him lay on your hands if he tries release him a little then pull him firmly back into place keep at it until you can maintain pressure just to hold him there not to hold his face up keep him held there until his mouth neck and eyes relax if he is chopping on the bit don't release him this will teach him to be softer on your hands if you keep at it i swear it works do this on both sides at least twice right when you get in the saddle repeat the process throughout your riding especially if you notice he is pulling on your hands sorry i blabbed so much my trainer taught me all of this and it has really helped good luck don't give up Weight training Casualty lifting Fast bowling Butterfly stroke Professional wrestling aerial techniques Boxing Parade (military) Horizontal bar Dog training Glossary of climbing terms Volleyball Diving Mattress Drowning Front crawl Neckbreaker Rugby union Glossary of partner dance terms Contredanse Glossary of ballet terms Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Swimming Bicycle Dressage Milton H.
