in a desperate fix for saddle bridle cleaning supplies no saddle soap any household items to substitute would a tiny bit of vegable oil and water and soap make the saddle and bridle look better and be more supple i am very desperate so please don't suggest buying supplies or ordering them this is for all of the people who have recommended murphy's oil soap to you when i lived in nj i worked for a time with a master saddler someone who makes saddles and tack for a living and who spent years as an apprentice learning his craft before he was allowed to work on his own he told me flat out that the worst possible thing that you can do to leather is to use murphy's oil soap on it it ruins it it dries leather out horribly and it will cause it to crack and break with continued usage murphy's also will rot stitching and this is definitely something that you want to avoid especially on things like girths and bridles because your safety depends on them being secure as far as substitutes go you can use a little bit of dish soap in a gallon of water to get the dirt and sweat off and then use something like shoe cleaner most shoe cleaners are made for use on leather and many of them contain the same ingredients as saddle soaps and harness cleaners to condition and preserve the leather once it's clean i would not use noxema that has alcohol in it which strips leather of its moisture and causes drying and cracking make sure that your tack is thoroughly clean and dry before applying the shoe cleaner and use it sparingly a little goes a long way when it comes to this type of product make sure as well that any sponges and towels you use are clean before you start since if they are dirty they can transfer any dirt they contain to the leather you are trying to clean i must admit to being a little curious about your question saddle soaps and cleaners such as horseman's one step are not that expensive to buy and they work much better than most of the remedies suggested so far they certainly are far better for your tack than murphy's is shoe cleaners such as those found in most shoe and sporting good stores will also work but they have to be used in small amounts what makes you so desperate i wonder anyway good luck i hope this helps Horse tack Leather Upholstery Equine conformation Dry cleaning Mattress Textile manufacturing Shampoo Drill bit Shoe Japanese tea ceremony Eczema Japanese toilet Car washing techniques Menstrual cup Tack Vacuum cleaner Fuel injection Shoe polish Inflation Sento Wok Soap Knife Veganism Strap-on dildo Bulk vending Climbing equipment Welding Solar power Comanche Violin Renewable energy Energy development Charles Goodyear Brewery Vinegar Lionel Corporation Cruising (maritime) Breastfeeding Tattoo Customs and etiquette of Japan Tofu Microeconomics Social rule High-heeled shoe Genericized trademark Clothing Fecal incontinence Soap opera Glossary of climbing terms Dishwasher Hemp Home repair Horse Sulfuric acid Drag racing Gas metal arc welding Sock Skin Thermal power station Bicycle E85 Cross-country skiing Dollar store Egg (food) Urinary incontinence Washing machine Livery Company Keynesian economics Seismic retrofit Alcoholic beverage Laundry detergent Alcoholics Anonymous Motorcycle Diaper Sailing Detergent Coffee Serial Psoriasis Plastic Illegal drug trade Ammonia Dishwashing Dialysis Casting Hunt seat Nuclear power Wound Justification (theology) Houseplant First aid Biodiesel Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Economy of the United States
