after weeks of nursing a sprained ankle i sprained my ankle weeks ago i can walk and run but everytime i run i feel a bit of disconfort and sometimes a bit of swelling is this normal that would depend on if you gave it enough healing time after the original injury since you are able to walk and run the probem is probably not the bones however some people are pretty tough and will continue on with normal activity with a small linear fracture or buckle fracture it could also be tendons or ligaments that were damaged in the original injury and have never healed appropriately a check of the ankle by an orthopaedic physician is really the best way to go Orthopedic surgery Equine conformation Tendon Hip fracture Carpal tunnel syndrome Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Bruise Bone fracture Traumatic brain injury Ulcer 2004 American League Championship Series Humerus Gary Sheffield First aid Skull fracture Kurt Angle Tibia Penis Prostate cancer Wrist Scapula Weight training Osteoporosis High-heeled shoe Stress fracture Hip (anatomy) Tattoo Triage Traditional Chinese medicine Wound healing phases Diving Bone Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Replacement joint Flat feet Medicine Jessica Lynch Osteopathy Survivor: Guatemala Donovan McNabb Bryan Robson Terri Schiavo timeline Cancer Fibula Osteoarthritis Healing Terrell Owens Urinary incontinence Emergency department Survivors of the September 11, 2001 attacks Ulna Leon White Subdural hematoma Elbow-joint RuneScape Random Events Enceladus (moon) Achilles' tendon Iditarod Radius (bone) Tuberculosis Knee Physical examination Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Hamate bone Stomach cancer Hiking Shoe Shoulder Glucocorticoid Live action role-playing game Clavicle Diffuse axonal injury Arm Sphenoid bone Carpal tunnel Fracture Mandible Sports medicine Stone Cold Steve Austin Metacarpus Chiropractic Evel Knievel Tyrannosaurus rex Cerebral palsy Unreal Michael Vick Yosemite National Park Troy Dayak Snakebite (bite) Stroke Phenylbutazone Paraplegia Radiation therapy Earring Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Aerial (dance move) Motorcycle helmet Biomechanics
