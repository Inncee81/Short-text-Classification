chest pain hey i'm almost and sometimes my chest will start to hurt the pain doesn't go beneath my sternum or above my neck it's all inside my body too like there's no muscle or skin pain at all nowhere else in my body hurts when this pain comes it starts hurting at completely random times i can't figure out any common factors between when it hurts one time and then when it happens the next time it starts very mildly and sometimes i don't even notice it but if i don't do anything about it the pain can get really bad one time i couldn't focus on anything but the pain it was so bad if i lower my upper body towards my legs or lay down the pain lessens and goes away within minutes when i was a kid i had a temporary form of asthma so at first i thought that maybe i developed a full case of asthma however i don't have a problem breathing taking deep breaths does hurt a little though usually if the pain gets bad i'll breath shallow but not because my breathing is constricted oh what i want to know is what's wrong with me sorry lol i got carried away with the description and forgot the question no i haven't suffered any injuries lately and i haven't been sick well i had a guy problem that seems to have cleared up by itself but one that definitely was not an std if the pain is primarily provoked by breathing i'd tend to lead to plurecy this isn't too horrible just extremely painfull plurecy is when the plura outside lining of the lungs separates or dries out the plura and the lungs then rub on each other causing pain upon inspiration breathing in pain can be moderate to severe depending on the severity of the condition either way consult your doctor they may have treatments for you or something to help with the pain Asthma Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pneumonia Diving First aid Traumatic brain injury Urinary incontinence Lung cancer Drowning Professional wrestling holds Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Massage Theory of conduct Hip fracture Spanking Myocardial infarction Angina Swimming Prostate cancer Pain Carpal tunnel syndrome Weight training Fecal incontinence Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Tai Chi Chuan Aerial (dance move) Childbirth Gastroesophageal reflux disease Pulmonary embolism Acupuncture Cephalic disorder Mesothelioma Medicine Radiation therapy Tuberculosis Sleep apnea Sternum Androgen insensitivity syndrome Lung Milton H.
