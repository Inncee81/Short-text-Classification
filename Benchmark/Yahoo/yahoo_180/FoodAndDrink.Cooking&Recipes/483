how do you make apricot preserves from fresh apricots i bought a big bag of apricots which i have to use up today kg or lbs plus a few more apricots of fresh apricots cups of granulated sugar see notes below cup water tbs freshly squeezed lemon juice equipment a heavy bottomed non reactive pan an enameled cast iron pan is ideal or a heavy stainless steel pan don't use aluminum or uncoated cast iron canning jars with rubber seal jar lids melt the sugar and water in the pan bring to a boil then simmer until clear and slightly syrupy watch the pot at this stage or you might end up with a potful of hard crystallized sugar carefully sort and wash the apricots halve them and discard the pits making sure to get rid of the stem end to halve them i just rip them apart with my fingers far easier than cutting them with a knife optionally crack open a few of the pits edit just a few no more than a small handful see the comments with a nutcracker or hammer wrap them in a cloth and smash wrap them in some cheesecloth and put in the pot this imparts an intriguing almond flavor to the preserves put about half of the apricots in the sugar syrup and simmer until the fruit is almost falling apart put in the rest of the apricots and continue simmering until they are almost falling apart but not quite the whole procedure will take about an hour or more depending on how soft your apricots were to start with add the lemon juice and stir simmer an additional minutes then take off the heat take out the cheesecloth with the pits if you put them in if the jam gets burned on the bottom at any point just pour out the unburned jam into a fresh pot and continue cooking don't scrape the burned bits into the new pot Coffee Tea Cookware and bakeware Horehound Tofu Bong Sugarcane Food preservation Barbecue Cuisine of the Philippines Casting Brewery Sugar Japanese cuisine Jewish cuisine Drill bit Textile manufacturing Cheese Cajun cuisine Cantonese cuisine Poker jargon Knife Breakfast Internal ballistics Ice cream Plastic Bread Pottery Chili con carne Wok Sugar beet Welding Japanese tea ceremony Apricot Kosher foods Turkish Delight Tooth enamel Peruvian cuisine Stainless steel Paneer Thermal power station Soft drink Recipe Bacon Glass Wine making Idli Wine Yerba mate Cocaine Tooth Titanium Turkish coffee Beverage can stove Fire fighting Menstrual cup Cuisine of Denmark Baklava Rice pudding Coca-Cola Date Palm Gilding Aluminium Fanta Champagne (beverage) Betting (poker) Comanche Cuisine of Brazil Soup Dumpling Sand casting Lemon Tattoo In-N-Out Burger Japanese toilet Seitan Beer Maple syrup Lemonade RuneScape quests Chewing gum Pancake Basil Sushi German cuisine
