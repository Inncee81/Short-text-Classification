how do you decide whats for dinner for myself we decide from day to day what we like to have but the problem with this is that we spend most the afternoon shopping and its usually late by the time we eat does anyone follow a weekly menu and if so how does that work for you and how do you put your menu together is this input from the whole family or based on whats on sale at the grocery would love to hear any thoughts or ideas thanks i sit down with my hubby on sunday and plan a list of meals for the week then when i go shopping i have a game plan i buy the stuff i need to make the meals on the list then we eat whatever we feel like off of the list throughout the week i usually go through the grocery ads before we sit down so i have an idea of what's on sale it helps me keep costs down planning meals around what's already on sale i usually plan super quick meals for those busy nights or i pick up a frozen pizza for nights when we don't know what we want Wal-Mart The Apprentice 2 UK Singles Chart Food Meal About a Boy National Football League Wall Street Pizza Teen Girl Squad Breakfast Monday Night Football Neopets McDonald's New York Jets Tesco Philip J.
