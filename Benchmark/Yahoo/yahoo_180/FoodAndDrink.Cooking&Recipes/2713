fake blood for rimming glasses for a halloween party this year yes i'm already planning it lol i want to get plastic cocktail glasses and rim them with fake blood to give it a nice dripping effect i have been experimenting with corn syrup cornstarch and red food coloring and a plastic parfait cup from dairy queen my only problem is that the blood mixture wont stick to the top of the rim of the cup it all drips down into the bottom its plenty thick enough but i guess its because the cup is slick that it just wont stick to it does anyone have any ideas of how to make this work it has to be edible and look like blood dripping down the inside of the glass inside because if it drips down the outside it will become sticky and messy i would prefer something that doesn't have a distinct flavor to it because depending on what kind of punch i make i don't want it to interfere with the taste so far the jello guy seems be the only one who seems to understand what i'm talking about i need something that will really stick to a slick surface that isnt all going to drip down into the bottom of the glass maybe half strength black cherry jello would work or even full strength if you put it on while it is still warm then chill it edit then how about making unflavored gelatin and coloring it with red and blue food coloring to the color you want bert Coffee Rum Milk Plastic Cuisine of Denmark Tofu Japanese cuisine Color Bong Starch Maple syrup Tea Ice cream In-N-Out Burger Rei Ayanami Casting Oreo Martini cocktail Glass Tire Cajun cuisine Menstrual cup Breakfast Dairy Poker jargon Pottery New York Rangers Caffeine Barbecue Electrophysiology Cuisine of the Philippines Bread Beer Sushi Kosher foods Diseases of the honeybee Bulk vending Intravenous therapy Paint Gatorade Honey Japanese tea ceremony Wood Christmas tree Hot dog Brewery Sake Chewing gum Cuisine of Brazil Molotov cocktail Peanut Strap-on dildo Mountain Dew Dr Pepper Turkish Delight Yoghurt Cheese Geology of the Grand Canyon area Wassily Kandinsky Champagne (beverage) Diving suit Wine Fish and chips Cha chaan teng Vinegar Textile manufacturing terminology Glacier Opportunity rover Bubble tea Fire extinguisher Hamster Bullet Harmonica Characters in the Smurfs Cross-country skiing Tin can I Am the Walrus Peach Blood Simple Marshmallow Food coloring Cannabis (drug) Fujian tea ceremony Ketchup Rice Boston Bruins Light-emitting diode Stanley Cup Stage lighting Carbon dioxide PNG Textile manufacturing Radio controlled airplane Irrigation Mattress Espresso Pizza She Loves You Theory of conduct
