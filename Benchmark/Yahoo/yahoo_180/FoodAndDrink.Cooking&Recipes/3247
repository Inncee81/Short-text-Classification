i have a about a pickling recipe need help asap i have made pickles for years but now i want to try new recipes the recipe i want to try says to cut up the cucumbers and put into a container and cover with a brine for three days stirring every day then drain them and cover with brine again and soak another three days stirring every day then you bottle them my is why what does soaking them for days before you bottle them do brining is the term used for soaking something in a salty solution the salt pulls water out of the cukes to make them cruchier the brine changes the color texture and flavor of the food brine may also contain sugar and spices depending on what food is being soaked maybe you remember osmosis experiments from school the brine has a higher concentration of salt than the cukes do so water flows from the lower concentration the cukes to the brine then you drain and repeat to give the brine that extra saltiness to pull out even more water try it and see if you like it as well or better than your old favorites Tofu Cheese Cantonese cuisine Pickling Sodium chloride Sushi Ham Sauerkraut Pickled cucumber Bread Bacon Soy milk Curing Cooking Idli Mayonnaise Jewish cuisine Japanese cuisine Hot dog Hydroponics Brewery Water Black pepper Ice cream Ramen Soup Sea ice Tapioca Edible salt Bong Soy sauce Cuisine of Brazil Beer Osmosis Great Salt Lake Hydrochloric acid Rice pudding Corned beef Cider Roman eating and drinking Cuisine of the Philippines Russian cuisine Chili con carne Common bean Yoghurt Acetic acid Honey Chowder Desalination Water (molecule) Salad Salt Reverse osmosis Tempeh Barbecue Calcium chloride Creating chemical solutions Diffusion Fish sauce Korean cuisine Potato chips Water purification Chocolate Salty Balls Chocolate Halva Milkshake Martini cocktail Meatball Pottery Tea Rice Autonomous building Bengali cuisine Cuisine of Denmark Salmon Cantharellus French fries Rum Cajun cuisine Coffee Haggis Mango Herring Salinity Wine Food Peruvian cuisine Basic taste Beef noodle soup Cuisine of Laos Chlorine Scotch whisky Alcoholic beverage Soul food
