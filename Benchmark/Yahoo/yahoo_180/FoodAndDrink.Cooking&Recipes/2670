has anyone ever worked with rolled fondant i want to cover my wedding cake with it i'm making it myself because i love the smooth finished look but i've never worked with it before i planned to purchase extra and do a practice cake over the weekend but got called in to work so i didn't have the time what i have is white fondant the instructions say all i need to do is roll it out drape it over the cake and smooth it is it really that simple there were little pots of color and little bottles of flavoring vanilla and butter creme my color is green so i bought a pot of the green coloring how do i use it do i just drop some of it in and knead it into the fondant or is it something that has to be 'painted' on the color came with no instructions also what is the flavoring for is fondant tasteless so i need to mix it in or is it just an 'extra' i didn't buy any of that do i need it the wedding is in weeks but i won't need the cake until the reception in weeks thanks for your help yes it really is that easy which is why so many bakeries use it you are on the right track about coloring add a bit of color and kneed you can also apply it with a brush i'd recommend that if your would like to use a brush to set aside sometime to get to know the materials you definitely want to see what fondant looks like after you apply color with a brush you want to know how much is absorbed with a stroke so you can get a feel for how quickly the depth of the color can change or how different brushes will streak the color as it is applied really well made fondant has as neutral a taste as possible so that the cakes flavor comes through it also allow you the end user to flavor it to your taste make a small cake and cover it with the plain unflavored fondant and taste does it have the profile you want if not begin experimenting to your hearts content congratulations on your pending nuptuals may the road always rise to meet your feet i hope this helps Bread Chocolate Pottery Coffee Japanese cuisine Tofu Rum Bong Drawing Honey Cake Tea Cuisine of Denmark Piet Mondrian XML Betting (poker) Alcoholic beverage Mattress Condom Color Pisco Oreo Cheese The Apprentice 2 Wine Cuisine of the Philippines Pizza Brush Cannabis (drug) Plastic Billboard Hot 100 Bengali cuisine Tire Breastfeeding Cookware and bakeware Hamster Kit Kat Impressionism Professional wrestling throws Vanilla Green Day Gumbo Vodka Paint Milkshake Knife Bulk vending Radio controlled airplane Jewish cuisine Strap-on dildo Breakfast Art Moonshine Massage Cold Stone Creamery Professional wrestling holds Chair Glass Common bean Wassily Kandinsky Trailer Park Boys Ramen Oakland Athletics RuneScape quests Barbecue GunBound Peanut butter Mouse (computing) U2 (band) Stud poker Woodworking Cigarette Cocoa Suplex Peanut Coca-Cola Color theory New York City Subway System/34 Houseplant Frans Hals German cuisine Cuisine of Brazil Recipe The Beatles' influence Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Dither Comanche Glaze Atari 8-bit family Cable television Spice Girls
