anyone know how to fix slightly scorched cheese dip thanks lauren has a good idea or any other addition you may prefer also when a food item is burning it is best to immediately transfer by pouring only pour do not scoop scrape into second vessel leaving the burnt material in first pan or you may also try to ladel the sauce to the second vessel pot leaving the last inch or so the most burnt flavor smelling part this avoids pouring the botttom part of the burnt sauce into your next pot in this way you avoid additional burnt flavors and aromas being imparted to your item the only other thing is to male another batch and blend them diluting the smoking burnt flavor however you need to consider cost and effectiveness will it take yet another rd batch of dip to accomplish this good luck Barbecue Coffee Cookware and bakeware Tea Japanese cuisine Cuisine of Denmark Rum Idli Tofu Casting Hot dog Cheese Pottery Fire extinguisher Moonshine Cajun cuisine Essential oil Jewish cuisine Customs and etiquette of Japan Sake Brewery Smoking pipe Pizza Hut Wasabi Soy sauce Fish and chips Japanese tea ceremony Tobacco Cantonese cuisine McDonald's Beer Cuisine of Malaysia Asparagus Fancy rat Cannabis (drug) Roux Ramen French cuisine Natt__ Honey Single malt Scotch Food Pasta Yoghurt Perfume Milkshake Korean cuisine Hot pot French fries Pizza Explosive material Espresso Cigar Chili con carne Chile pepper MRE Breakfast Bento Sushi Chocolate Cotton candy Kosher foods Pot Noodle Maple syrup Cuisine of Greece Cuisine of Argentina Wine Gilding Cuisine of Thailand Bacon Cuisine of Laos Draw poker Snooker Food preservation E85 Street food Yerba mate Chinese tea culture Miso Fujian tea ceremony Pancake Risotto Sand casting Mochi Plastic Cigarette Portable stove Single Transferable Vote Swimming Fermentation Mayonnaise Cheddar cheese Comanche Turkish coffee Pisco Alfredo
