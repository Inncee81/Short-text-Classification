how do i make pastry please the english way is to put ozs of s r flour into a food mixer then add ozs each of lard and butter which has been roughly cubed just to make it easier on the processor blades and just a pinch of salt though don't ask me why then give it a quick whizz to mix it all and chop the fats this takes it to the breadcrumbs stage if you were doing it by hand then you whizz it again but this time slowly pour a couple of tablespoons of cold water through the 'spout' and in about seconds you've got what is known as ozs of shortcrust pastry even though it weighs ozs repeat as necessary if you need more pastry than this and don't forget that if you make too much you can always freeze it i'll tell you what i'm quite a good typist but i could have made that pastry in less time than it took me to write about it of course if i was farting about making the pastry by hand i could have written a book probably explaining what all purpose flour and vegetable shortening is in english Bread Puff pastry Mayonnaise Flour Jewish cuisine Dumpling Coffee Cuisine of Denmark Breakfast Japanese cuisine Butter Tofu French cuisine Roux Peanut butter Soap Food preservation Dairy Cuisine of the Philippines Custard Chili con carne Pancake Cake Cuisine of Brazil Tea Pizza Brewery Ramen Doughnut Chowder Soul food Ice cream Knife Mashed potato Pottery Bengali cuisine Baklava Muffin Tortilla Cooking weights and measures Russian cuisine Purim Rice pudding Cuisine of Argentina Hamburger French fries Croquet (food) Confectionery Pie Cuisine of Greece Ketchup Polish cuisine Trans fat Kodocha Cuisine of Malaysia Magnesium Wonton Halva Chicken soup Sandwich Oscilloscope Curry Biscuit B__chamel sauce Singlish Pop-Tarts Tsampa Idli Cream puff Wiener schnitzel Barbecue Cheese Mooncake Mince pie Kosher foods MRE Soy protein Culture of Argentina Cuisine of Austria Sauce Chocolate Salty Balls Biodiesel Dairy product Fried dough foods Fish and chips Margarine CPU design Kebab Cuisine of the Southern United States Haggis Vinegar Soap bubble Plastic Cream (food) Gumbo Cuisine of Singapore Jala neti Table tennis Tamale Hemp
