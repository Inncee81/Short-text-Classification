cinnamon oil versus cinnamon extract i am trying to make cinnamon candy and the recipe calls for cinnamon oil all i can find at the grocery store is cinnamon extract are these the same thing thanks where can i find cinnamon oil no they are not the same thing the extract is made with alcohol the cinnamon oil will blend easier and have a stronger richer more natural flavor you can use the extract if you really want to using the extract will cause major splattering overflow and burning if you are not very careful when added so be careful i have used the extract in place of the oil before and it was ok and just ok the oil is by far the best choice good luck Cinnamon Coffee Essential oil Olive oil Vodka Beer Halva Root beer Rum Cassia Cider Ketchup Chocolate Cuisine of Africa Cuisine of Greece Cinnamaldehyde Curry Flavouring Ice cream Toothpaste Food preservation Tofu Apple pie Vegetable oil Perfume Mead Petroleum Handloading Tea Honey Aromatherapy Soy protein Cannabis (drug) Trans fat Soy sauce Vanilla E85 Alcoholic beverage Wine French cuisine Microeconomics Hydrogen economy Doughnut Future energy development Cold Stone Creamery Cuisine of Brazil Cinnabon Jewish cuisine Brewing Gasoline Bengali cuisine Mayonnaise Horchata Plastic Energy development Coal Jelly Belly Alternative fuel Veganism Soap Mustard oil Alcohol fuel Brewery Buffer overflow Cochineal Stollen Recipe Cuisine of India Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Soy milk Chicha Gumbo Glycerin Tocopherol Sugarcane Pizza Rice pudding Natural gas Biofuel Alice B.
