homemade professional cake vs cake bought at a bakery my future sister in law is a trained pastry chef she does not work right now b c she just had a baby so she's sahm my fi's birthday is coming up and i want to get a cake for the celebration i'm planning i've had my fsil's cakes before and they taste great just like at a fancy bakery i'm trying to save money so i'm wondering if having my sil make the cake will save me money i would pay for all the ingredients she would need but i know that would be costly she makes her cakes from scratch batter frosting filling everything is completely homemade would the ingredients end up costing me more then if i went to a fancy comparable bakery she had a baby a few months ago the baby is not a newborn anymore in addition i don't want to talk to her about it and then not have her do it i don't want her to feel insulted this really has more to do with cost then anything else she loves to bake and will do it regardless since she's currently not working she like to keep up on her craft at home your best bet would probably be to talk to her you know the quality of work you will get from her and that her work is excellent also will she want to do it if she just had a baby i think if she is willing having her do it is a good idea much more personal Bread Cake Chocolate Cuisine of Denmark Mooncake Doughnut RuneScape quests Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?
