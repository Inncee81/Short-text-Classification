grilling question anyone ever tryed to make baked beans on the grill what kind of pan would you use cast iron dutch oven works the best primarily cause it makes it easier to do and harder to burn or dry out you beans but if cast iron not an option i would go with the cheaper way using aluminum half or full pans you would want to place these on the grill but not over direct heat if using gas grill the turn on only half side and place pans on other if using charcoal or wood then pile majority of coals to one side and you pan on the other to make sure you don't burn the bottom layer of beans you can place a empty pan on grill first and pour in a thin layer of water in is then insert the pan with beans inside the water pan then cover with foil this will act like a double boiler using the steam from the water pan to evenly heat the beans without scorching them but you will still nee to stir frequently hope this helps and good luck Cookware and bakeware Barbecue Wok Bread Hot dog Japanese cuisine Casting Stove Coal Coffee Plastic Thermal power station Forge Bacon Kitchen Cooking on a campfire Steel Steam engine Brewery Printed circuit board Idli Pizza Internal ballistics Renewable energy Welding Fire fighting Campfire Pancake Bong Baking Sento Solar power Tofu Hydrogen economy Hamburger Boiler Carbon dioxide Wood fuel Transformer Grilling Mattress Sand casting Natural gas Furnace Pottery Iron Soldering Jewish cuisine Diving suit Seismic retrofit German cuisine Chicago-style pizza Cuisine of Brazil Incandescent light bulb Ironing Dutch oven Grill Cooking Apollo Command/Service Module William Murdoch Boat building Opportunity rover Paint Dundas Square Vacuum tube Dim sum Espresso Cast iron Cuisine of Laos Power station Sauna Fossil fuel power plant Drill bit Air pollution Fire extinguisher Samovar Solar cell Canoe Common bean Coke (fuel) Cookie Gas tungsten arc welding Heat Gas metal arc welding Alcohol fuel Hangi Amateur telescope making Cocoa Cuisine of Singapore Rocket fuel Door Tea Aluminium foil Tobacco Yerba mate
