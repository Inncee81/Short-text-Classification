when making lasagna do the noodles have to be cooked or can you put them in the pan with everything else i've never had a problem before with regular noodles but every recipe i look at says to boil noodles al dente or use oven ready no you can put them in the pan uncooked just make sure you have plenty of sauce and that you cover the pan with foil and bake about min to hour then uncover and brown the top cheese the edges of the noodles around the edge of the pan won't be as cooked as the center but it works it's so much easier than cooking the noodles then trying to put it together with the noodles tearing up while layering them also much cheaper than the oven ready noodles hope this helps Pasta Pancake Japanese cuisine Pizza Hot dog Barbecue Cookware and bakeware Bacon Cuisine of the Philippines Cuisine of Singapore Bread Jewish cuisine Idli Lasagna Tofu Microwave oven Cuisine of Denmark Ramen Soba Chicago-style pizza Hamburger Sushi Kraft Dinner Spaghetti Beef noodle soup Chicken soup French fries Soup Bagel Bengali cuisine Cajun cuisine German cuisine Kugel MRE Pot Noodle Cuisine of Brazil Risotto Cha chaan teng Rice pudding Meatball Dumpling Breakfast Ricotta cheese Flour Russian cuisine Shanghai cuisine Cuisine of Thailand British cuisine Cuisine of Malaysia Cooking Salad Baking Chinese cuisine D__ner kebab Cuisine of Austria Ketchup Recipe Iron Chef Sandwich Coffee Domesticated turkey Cheesecake Dim sum French cuisine Muffin Fish and chips Cuisine of Laos American Chinese cuisine Souffl__ Canadian Chinese cuisine Haggis Okonomiyaki Cookie Stove Korean cuisine Yoghurt Peking Duck Cincinnati chili Gorillaz Nabemono Sauce Polish cuisine Stock (food) Mung bean Kosher foods B__chamel sauce Cuisine of Vietnam Wonton Udon Potato Rice Naan Food Slow cooker Sichuan Pepper Gnocchi Chinatown Soul food
