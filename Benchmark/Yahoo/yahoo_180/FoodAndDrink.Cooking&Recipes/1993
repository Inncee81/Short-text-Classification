what exactly does a recipe mean when it asks soda does it mean baking soda or a type of pop if pop then which kind is there a kind of pop thats simply called soda another q thats bin bugging me whats w the baking soda and baking powder whats the diff between them besides baking soda being refridgerated how are they diff i notice they hardly look diff but feel quite diff the texture that is wow cary iether youve got sum really fat a 's in science or youve bin george brown or sum other college interesting ugly cake lol sry that just sounded funny when a recipe asks for soda it means baking soda baking soda and baking powder are both chemical leaveners used to make baked goods such as cakes and muffins baking soda has some other culinary uses too in recipes calling for baking powder baking soda can be used along with some cornstarch and cream of tartar baking powder cannot however be used to replace baking soda the chemical in baking soda is bicarbonate of soda nahco when combined with an acidic ingredient such as vinegar or the lactic acid in buttermilk baking soda releases carbon dioxide which forms into bubbles in the food when heated these bubbles then expand and help to rise or lighten the final product baking powder is a mixture of baking soda and an acid in powdered form that combine in liquid to create the same reaction there are three general types of baking powder fast acting slow acting and double acting the most commonly available being double acting double acting baking powder uses two different acids one of which reacts at room temperature and the other only during the baking at higher temperatures the first reaction helps to form the initial bubbles that are trapped in the batter as the food cooks the material around these bubbles starts to set carbon dioxide from the second reaction is better trapped within the bubbles and gives a better lift fast acting baking powder uses only an acid that reacts immediately while slow acting contains only the acid that reacts under heat all three forms will also contain some cornstarch to help keep the mixture dry before use recipes that call for both baking powder and baking soda usually also contain an acid ingredient that will react with the baking soda the ingredient might be vinegar or buttermilk mentioned earlier or molasses lemon juice sour cream honey or chocolate to name a few in this case the amount of baking soda is however much will react with the acidic ingredient additional leavening is provided by the baking powder baking soda combined with an equal measure of cornstarch and twice as much cream of tartar can be used to replace baking powder use about one quarter the amount of baking soda as the recipe calls for baking powder and then scale the cornstarch and cream of tartar accordingly for example if the recipe calls for teaspoon of baking powder it can be replaced by teaspoon of baking soda teaspoon of cornstarch and teaspoon of cream of tartar generally speaking baking powder can not be substituted for baking soda since this will leave excess acidic compounds in the food which may affect flavor texture and color if yu might be interested the chemicals commonly used in baking powder along with the bicarbonate of soda are cream of tartar khc h o tartaric acid h c h o or monocalcium phosphate monohydrate ca h po h o for the fast acting acid for the delayed reaction the chemical may be sodium aluminum sulfate na so al so or anhydrous monocalcium phosphate ca h po Acid Tofu Fire extinguisher Breakfast Sodium Cake Alum Cheese Jewish cuisine Plastic Tooth Aspartame Food Dairy Soft drink Hydrochloric acid Sulfur Haloalkane Cocoa Biscuit Cuisine of Denmark Water (molecule) Coffee Hydrogen Hydrogen chloride Soy protein Barbecue French fries Chemical reaction Alcohol Cheesecake Japanese cuisine Curry Nitrogen Carbonated water Soil pH Food additive Sodium sulfate Titanium Ceramics Glass Water purification Iron Muffin Fermentation Weathering Laundry detergent Fish and chips Sugar substitute Phosphorus Toffee Nuclear reactor Carbon Rum Sherbet Black powder Honey Milk Hot dog Biochemistry Baking Mouth ulcer Food preservation Casting Cooking Sugar beet Sake Airbag
