how in the world to you get the gamey taste out of any cuts of venison and make them tender and juicy i have already tried the ice water and milk methods no go unless i possibly did something wrong and no matter how i cook them they turn out tough and dry they kinda taste like liver jerky my wild duck is not much better i am a pretty good cook just haven't been able to master wild game what is the true secret the care of wild game meat begins in the field what winds up on your plate reflects how much care was taken of the carcas how it was aged how long it was 'allowed' to age and how carefully it was butchered a skinned deer hung for or days and butchered tasts different than a deer hung or days when butchering the meat of a skinned deer it improves the flavor dramaticaly if the 'rine' on the cuts of meat is trimmed off pryor to wrapping and freezing trimming the membrains and fatty areas from wild game pryor to processing decreases the 'gamie' tast also a kill left un gutted for hours always tasts strong and gamie there are sent glands on all large animals if the skin is left on the carcas they permeate the meat male animals during rutt's are going to be strong tasting no matter what is done of all these steps to reduce to gamie tast trimming the rine is most effective in reduction of wild tast from the meat marinateing wild game only adds another flavor to what is already there remove the sorce of the gamie tast and your kills will serve up much more palitable wild meats are 'lean' they cook up a bit dry because of that even in crock pots the 'water' you see in your skillit is the meats moisture cooked from the meat if you want 'that' tast gone cook on a grate that helps lean meats of all kinds cook quicker than fatty meat adjust accordingly but remember that the meats moistures contain flavors you might enjoy Game (food) Tofu Domesticated turkey Cantonese cuisine Bacon Kosher foods Chili con carne Comanche Barbecue Coffee Jewish cuisine Cuisine of the Philippines Cheese Food preservation Slow cooker Cuisine of Malaysia Cookware and bakeware Ice cream Foie gras Bengali cuisine Livestock Escherichia coli O157:H7 Glycerin Dumpling Fecal incontinence Meat Poker jargon Tea Rice Rum Japanese cuisine Taboo food and drink Insulin Psoriasis Milk Brewery Theory of conduct French cuisine Acne Beef Steak German cuisine Jerky (food) In-N-Out Burger Gumbo Fishing D__ner kebab Pottery Sausage Hamburger Peruvian cuisine Chocolate Sushi Cuisine of Denmark Cuisine of the Southern United States Breastfeeding Family farm hog pen Ham Banana Agriculture Domestic goat American Bison Ramen Quang Ninh Province Roman eating and drinking Tamale Garlic Cajun cuisine Haggis Unreal Food storage Domestic rabbit Kitchen Pizza Terminal ballistics Japanese tea ceremony Hot dog Omega-3 fatty acid Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Textile manufacturing Hemp Vitamin C Stock (food) Tobacco Protein-energy malnutrition Cat Sauerkraut Apple Slaughterhouse Soap Cuisine of Africa Puberty
