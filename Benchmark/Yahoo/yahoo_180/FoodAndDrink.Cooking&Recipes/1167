is it ok to freeze an iced cake will it get soggy as it defrosts i'm making half circle golf ball cakes for my son's mini golf birthday party and want to freeze a tray with the balls iced cakes and grass just blades of green frosting there is no fruit or cream etc involved just cake and icing do you think it will defrost ok thanks that depends entirely on what kind of frosting you use on the cake if you are using a standard decorator's buttercream that is uncooked with a relatively high fat content then that freezes beautifully just take the cakes out several hours before you want to serve them if you are using icing of the boiled type where you boil a sugar syrup and then beat it into egg white that does not freeze well at all Cake Tofu Ice cream Japanese cuisine Cuisine of Denmark Cuisine of Malaysia Sugar beet Cuisine of the Philippines Pancake Coffee Cuisine of Singapore Ice Maple syrup Breakfast Cookie Food preservation Sugar Cuisine of the Southern United States Baked Alaska Cheesecake Frost Jewish cuisine Tea Water (molecule) Wedding cake Bagel Rice pudding Rum Cider Doughnut Dim sum Dumpling Domesticated turkey Bengali cuisine Gelato Polish cuisine Mochi Mooncake Soup Gatorade Dairy Cha chaan teng Idli Sherbet Pizza Egg (food) Surimi Flour Fanta Oreo Bread McDonald's Korean cuisine Apple Food Sugarcane Codename: Kids Next Door Japanese tea ceremony Spidey Super Stories Cold Stone Creamery Confectionery Bacon Sub-Zero Hot dog Halloween Dairy product Peanut Chocolate Degree Fahrenheit Roman eating and drinking Ice cream cone Broomball Milkshake Golf glossary Carbon dioxide Tea (meal) Birthday French cuisine Cookware and bakeware Ice wine Skiing Brewery Golf Cuisine of Austria Red velvet cake Vanilla Bubble tea Ice hockey Meatball Corn syrup Russian cuisine Refrigerator car King cake Tlingit Ramen Miniature golf Polyols Genericized trademark
