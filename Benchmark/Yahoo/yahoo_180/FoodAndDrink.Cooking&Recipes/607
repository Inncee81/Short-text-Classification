cheese on a stick does anyone know how to ake the batter for the cheese on a stick like they make at hot dog on a stick i love that stuff you can use pancake batter just mix it up like you would for pancakes not use a skewer and insert into a chunk of cheese dip the cheese into the batter you may have to adjust the batter by either adding more water or mix to the batter fry the cheese in degree hot oil until golden make sure the oil is hot before beginning or the cheese will melt and run out of the batter before the batter turns golden the process is similar to a corn dog recipe and those can be found on the internet if you have any major questions do not leave hot oil unattended it is a fire hazard Pancake Hot dog Fondue Breakfast Jewish cuisine French fries Japanese cuisine Cheese Cuisine of Denmark Bread Tofu Sandwich Ice cream Potato pancakes Cuisine of Greece Case-based reasoning Cuisine of Brazil Idli Dosa Soul food Blintz Cuisine of Singapore D__ner kebab Baseball Doughnut Pizza In-N-Out Burger Softball Street food German cuisine Casting Chili con carne Cheesesteak Pottery Paint Vegetarian cuisine Kraft Dinner Cider French cuisine Satay Plastic Barbecue McDonald's Potato chips American Chinese cuisine Cuisine of the Southern United States Peruvian cuisine Domesticated turkey Potato Cantonese cuisine Cuisine of the Midwest Bengali cuisine Butter Soy protein Origins of baseball Ramen Hamster Pizza Hut Halva MRE Fish and chips Cuisine of Austria Gorgonzola cheese Cajun cuisine Mayonnaise Korean cuisine Risotto Sulfuric acid Buffalo wings Grilled cheese sandwich Genetically modified food Roux French toast Fried chicken Rum Campfire Alcohol fuel Hamburger Maple syrup Cuisine of Canada Swedish cuisine Croquet (food) Coffee Gasoline Sea ice Chocolate Transformer Tortilla Wok Thermal depolymerization Food preservation Moonshine Internal combustion engine Slow cooker Soap Cuisine of the United States Yoghurt
