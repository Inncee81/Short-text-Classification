what is the point in pre heating preheating the oven what is it with all these recipes that specify preheat the oven to as far as i can tell preheating is just a big waste of electricity or gas or whatever it is that powers your oven i believe that recipe writers throw it into their recipes for two reasons first they want to sound professional second they want to impose uniformity upon the mass of humanity because ovens will likely have an uneven warm up rate it is impossible for them to calculate how long a dish will have to stay in an oven if it is not preheated they do not have enough confidence in the individual i have even less confidence in the average cookbook writer as their time for baking never coincides with reality it is nearly always short you will note that i do have confidence in you nowhere will you find a notation insisting on preheat rather i will specify a time for baking and hope you will check on the dish then if it is not done check it periodically thereafter alternatively you may use the following formula to calculate the time it takes for a dish to bake to finish a b c where 'a' is temperature required 'b' is the time specified and 'c' is the square of the hypotenuse Solar power Bread Slow cooker Microwave oven Barbecue Pizza Recipe Souffl__ Spacecraft propulsion Welding Trigonometric function Wok Fluorescent lamp Future energy development Bacon Coal Cookware and bakeware Triangle Renewable energy Cremation Portable stove Kitchen XML Thermal power station Cuisine of Denmark Cooking on a campfire Energy development Casting Alcohol fuel Baking Fossil fuel power plant Fire extinguisher Baking powder Vacuum tube Jet engine Jewish cuisine Thermocouple Incandescent light bulb Rice pudding Fusion power Tank Explosive material Toaster Lighting Chocolate Water (molecule) Dutch oven Cooking Stove Rice cooker Roast beef Pottery Ocean thermal energy conversion Stirling engine SETI Dundas Square Combustion Terraforming Nuclear fusion Autonomous building Tire Pie Solar cell Nuclear reactor Carbon dioxide Circuit design Trombone Hamburger Ceramics Lancashire Hotpot Pavlova Meatloaf Pasta Collision detection E85 Baked Alaska Idli Printed circuit board Kashrut Coffee Tofu Helium Haggis Turbocharger Entropy Egg (food) Japanese cuisine Radio Sandwich CPU cache Scientific opinion on climate change Fuel injection Furnace Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
