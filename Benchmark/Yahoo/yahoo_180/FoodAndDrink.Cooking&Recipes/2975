how can i make beers discreet some of my friends want to drink at a party we have coming up but one of the people attending is a heavy church goer do they make zippered jackets to put beer bottles in to at least hide the beer logo any suggestions i think what you propose is completely out of this world disguising beer bottles what benefit could that possibly have and after a while knowing americans i presume you are as no one else has such a prudish attitude to alcohol it will become extremely clear that what people are drinking out of their knitted bottle cosies is not dr pepper any form of attempted concelament is foolhardy easily the best way forward is to tell the church going guest that this will not be a 'dry' party and let them decide whether or not that means they want to come after all if the churchgoer is so uptight as to not tolerate alohol being drunk around them and they r come along and after hours discovers that the other guests have all been drinking that evil beer stuff and they will find out do you think they'll thank you for the deception Sauna Wine Alcoholic beverage Soft drink Alcoholism Breastfeeding Alcoholics Anonymous Peruvian cuisine Bong Shaggy dog story Bottle Word of Wisdom Homer Simpson Metrication Sake Nicomachean Ethics Prohibition Beer Canadian slang Black Books Brewery Social rule Miller Brewing Drink Moe Szyslak Root beer One Tree Hill (TV series) Beer Hall Putsch Dr Pepper Guinness Polyethylene terephthalate Moonshine Water Plastic Kim Possible Wheat beer Red Hot Chili Peppers Cider Infantilism Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Champagne (beverage) Australian words Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Smoking Room Ron and Fez Ulic Qel-Droma Systembolaget Days of our Lives Escape of Charles II Drinking game Sluggy Freelance Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II Pitaten Gin Evil Friends Bacardi Maison Ikkoku Drinking culture Alcohol advertising Magic (illusion) Bar (establishment) Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Stone Cold Steve Austin Canada Dry Oliver Reed Pisco Bender Bending Rodriguez Characters in the Smurfs Tooheys Mountain Dew Dr Pepper/Seven Up, Inc.
