what is the best oil to use in a deep fryer for calamari clams or clam cakes soy oil is also something to consider it has a nice taste to impart but does not interfere especially for scallops i have had deep fried scallops done in soy oil and i must say they are addictive that way so i think with other seafood soy would be nice to try each oil has its own special qualities it is nice to experiment and find out which ones you like for which foods and their smoking points are also important with regards to your cooking skills that is important since oil is expensive and you do not want to ruin a new batch of oil by allowing food to burn or for loose particles to fall to the bottom of the fryer and ruin the taste with skills that are always improving you become more and more experimental with different ingredients and your expertise as a cook improves and your reputation so be sure your clam cakes hold together nicely before you place them into the fryer basket that they not let little pieces of the mixture fall down into the oil and burn xxx lakshmi Japanese cuisine Cantonese cuisine Fish and chips Pizza Korean cuisine Cuisine of the Philippines In-N-Out Burger Barbecue Cuisine of the Southern United States Cuisine of New England Soy sauce Cuisine of Denmark Plastic Soy milk Tempura Sushi Taiwanese cuisine Hot pot Breakfast Chocolate Roman eating and drinking Food RuneScape skills Surimi Coffee Brewery Bacon Stir frying Fried chicken Cuisine of Malaysia Moonshine Cajun cuisine Oyster Vegetarian cuisine Cookie French fries Omega-3 fatty acid Kosher foods Flour Doughnut Gumbo Natt__ Sewage treatment Ice cream German cuisine French cuisine Tea Cheese Bread Veganism Olive oil Jiaozi Bengali cuisine Wok Domesticated turkey Ramen Soy protein Fire extinguisher Welding Cocaine Cuisine of Laos Dry cleaning Soul food Shanghai cuisine Soba Clam Curry Cookware and bakeware Pancake Cuisine of Brazil Hemp Steel British cuisine Fish ball Miso Black pepper Pasta Peanut butter Cooking Fire fighting Roux Potato Seafood Tlingit Sake Biodiesel Hamburger Billiards Dim sum Risotto Ginger Kitchen
