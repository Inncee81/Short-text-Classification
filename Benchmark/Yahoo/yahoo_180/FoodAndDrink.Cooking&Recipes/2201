can i freeze pizza dough without partially cooking it i make pizza dough in my breadmaker and i was wondering if i could freeze half each time so i only have to make dough every second time i make pizza do i need to cook the pizza base before i can freeze it or can i just freeze the dough thanks in advance you can freeze it either way to freeze uncooked dough wrap tightly in freezer paper and store it in a freezer bag you can also spread the dough out in the shape you like it bake it just until it's done let it cool completely and then wrap tightly and freeze this way when you want pizza next time all you have to do is thaw the crust top it and bake just a few minutes Bagel Pizza Bread Puff pastry Chicago-style pizza Ice cream Dumpling Pizza Hut D__ner kebab Breadmaker Carbon dioxide Refrigerator Cookie Pancake Doughnut Freezing Maple syrup Freezer In-N-Out Burger Baklava Fried dough foods Dim sum Pillsbury Tamale Fish and chips Papa John's Pizza Tofu Bento Food preservation Pita Cuisine of Denmark Mooncake Idli Poi (food) Japanese cuisine Domino's Pizza Hot dog German cuisine French fries Brewery Cold Stone Creamery Food Croissant Domesticated turkey Bong Potato chips Pie Flour Mashgiach Oregano Common bean Quesadilla Hamburger Confectionery Street food Breakfast Jiaozi Pasta Souffl__ Buffalo, New York Baking Tortilla Barbecue Glacier Recipe Jewish cuisine Sushi Lava Wok Cooking Cheesecake Avalanche Life in the Freezer Alton Brown French cuisine Bone marrow transplant Spinach Sourdough Pretzel Potato Cryonics SB-129 Baked Alaska Shakey's Pizza RuneScape skills Naan Wine making Yeast (baking) Spatula Tlingit Brioche Shanghai cuisine Harvard Square STS-62 Challah Empanada Pizza delivery Cinnabon Genericized trademark Waffle
