cake help i found a cake that i want to make for my husband's deployment homecoming party i just have question how do i get the fondant that deep of a blue and red i havent ever seen it that vibrant http i photobucket com albums aa armywife e cake jpg if it's just for the decorations i would go to the local crafts store michaels hobby lobby or walmart and get the wilton fondant it comes in the primary colors that you are looking for also you can get satinice from http www ateco com or from http www sugarcraft com they sell the satinice in those love colors they also have the powdered colorings that the other poster was describing also you could also use gel colors to paint those but it wouldn't be near as neat looking as using pre colored fondant if you are hell bent for leather on tinting your own i would use royal blue gel color not that liquid wimpy stuff they sell at the grocer and for the red first color it with hot pink and then add your red to the right shade you would want to have a little extra corn starch corn flour to knead in because with the extra moisture it will become a bit sticky and the corn starch will help alleviate that problem Cake Bread Pizza Tea Plastic Brewery Blue Red RGB color model Color Pasta Leather Coffee Starch Cheese Glass Diamond Japanese cuisine Food coloring Sugar Bulk vending Rice Honey Staining (biology) Tortilla Sulfur Pottery Potato The Legend of Zelda series enemies Pudding Textile manufacturing terminology Mochi Cajun cuisine Rum Alcohol fuel Wheat Cereal Red velvet cake Beer Cocoa Garnet Biodiesel Dodge Neon Baking Titanium Sauce Explosive material Chili con carne E number Light-emitting diode Billiards Polymer clay Dim sum Gluten Miniature (illuminated manuscript) Pink Roux German cuisine Food preservation Lighting XML Red Hot Chili Peppers Pixel Vehicle registration plate Pancake Cuisine of the Southern United States Maize Chinese New Year Acorn Food additive Cat Common bean Fluorescent lamp Chocolate Homestar Runner Gamut Brewing World Wide Web Rose Paint Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Hair coloring Sake Hot dog Cuisine of Singapore Rainbow flag Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Cosmetics The Marshall Mathers LP Shroud of Turin Scotch whisky RuneScape skills Ice cream M&M's RuneScape quests Christmas tree
