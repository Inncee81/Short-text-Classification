why do i always end up with dry meatballs i am usually a pretty good cook but something has me stumped and i'm not sure what i am doing wrong when i make meatballs or hamburger patties although they have excellent flavor they are always dry my recipe calls for an egg spices a little evaporated milk onion and that's it i don't use bread crumbs or any other filler can someone please tell me what i can do to make them more juicy if you are using extra lean ground beef then perhaps you are getting too little fat in the mixture itself which means it will cook drier i'd suggest mixing your lean ground beef with ground turkey for a more robust flavor and texture in your meatballs add eggs diced onion cup italian bread crumbs soaked in milk as well as your spices and some worcestershire sauce i prefer to use liptons herb and garlic dry soup mix myself you can also add some unsweetened applesauce to the mix and they will turn out soft and juicy with a hint of sweetness good luck Tofu Japanese cuisine Cantonese cuisine Hamburger Cuisine of Denmark Meatball Bengali cuisine German cuisine Chili con carne Cuisine of Brazil Soup Jewish cuisine Peruvian cuisine Pizza Barbecue Russian cuisine Cuisine of Laos Meatloaf Curry Hot dog Cajun cuisine Breakfast Cuisine of the Philippines Dumpling Cuisine of Singapore MRE Tea Cuisine of Africa Chicken soup Cuisine of Malaysia Ramen Dim sum Domesticated turkey Polish cuisine Mayonnaise French fries Bread Risotto Idli Bacon Cuisine of Turkey Korean cuisine Soul food Potato chips Cheese Ice cream Steak Fish sauce Food Cincinnati chili Cuisine of Greece In-N-Out Burger Coffee Sauce Kebab Soy milk Cuisine of the Southern United States McDonald's Yoghurt Gumbo Sausage Ketchup French toast Cuisine of Canada Rum Porridge Kosher foods Soy protein Dairy Nabemono Pancake Cuisine of Cambodia Sandwich Italian beef Swedish cuisine Cuisine of Vietnam Rice pudding Food preservation French cuisine Fish and chips Cuisine of Thailand Vegetarianism Hot pot Haggis Chowder Garlic Sushi Ph___ Beer Burger Tamale Beef noodle soup Milkshake Shawarma Stock (food) Ham
