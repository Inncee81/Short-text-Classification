how to get rid of lamb curry bad smell ok so here's the deal i love lamb gosht or goat tikka etc but everytime i cook it the peculiar sometimes nasty smell of goat lamb heek still comes and that makes me feel like not eating the meat anymore even with the lamb goat curry its same problem so my question is how to get rid of the smell also if theres a special type of meat we need to buy or something else i am a former chef and worked in jamaica and we made both types of currys if you wash the meat and sprinkle salt on it rinse it and then part blanch the meat then drain it that will take some of the blood protein out also when you cook your currys do it slow so the aromas are not spread so fast i use a crockpot i get cubed lamb and goat from the store and use it the same way i defrost it wash it in salt water blanch the meat then saute it with the base another thing that keeps the smell down is ginger i use a base of fine chopped onions a good tablespoons of fresh ginger and at least cloves of garlic with the meat tomatos potatos sometimes chickpeas instead of potatos and fresh okra these ingredients make a good hearty curry and i find the aroma of the meat is subdued Curry Chili con carne Bengali cuisine Cuisine of Africa French fries Jewish cuisine Japanese cuisine Cuisine of Denmark Hamburger Cantonese cuisine Gumbo Cuisine of the Southern United States Barbecue Cuisine of the Philippines French cuisine German cuisine Garlic Pizza Peruvian cuisine Vegetarian cuisine Breakfast Soul food Vegetarianism Sausage Coffee Cuisine of Malaysia Ketchup McDonald's Cuisine of Cambodia Cuisine of Greece Russian cuisine Fish and chips Food Cuisine of Ethiopia Cuisine of Singapore Haggis Chicken soup Hot dog Udon Hot pot Satay D__ner kebab Potato Dumpling Korean cuisine In-N-Out Burger Soup Vinegar Ramen Irish cuisine Spanish cuisine Rice pudding Kosher foods Salad Sauerkraut British cuisine Cajun cuisine Idli Pickling Korban Chaaru Kebab Pasta Cholent Dim sum Food preservation Irish stew Sauce Bagel Cuisine of Thailand Kitchen Ham Onion Meatball Polish cuisine Ginger Cuisine of Turkey Stock (food) Fugu Rum Culture of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Potato chips Egg (food) Flour Foodborne illness Halitosis Seitan Gazpacho
