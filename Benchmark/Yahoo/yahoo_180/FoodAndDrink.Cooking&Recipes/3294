how do you keep cake from crumbling nor hardening hiii i'm starting to get into make fondant cakes and the book says using spongecake is easier because it'll be easy to cut and it won't crumble however i was just watching a video and lady used chocolate cake and it worked completely fine my question is how can i use something besides spongecake that won't crumble or harden on the inside if i leave it too cool so i can put the icing on any other kind of cake besides spongecake that can work just as well get an oven thermometer most home ovens run as much as degrees high or low if the temperature is too high the cake may overbake and get dry learn how to check for doneness doneness indicators vary by recipe a cheescake shows different signs than a devil's food cake but for most butter based cakes a toothpick inserted in the middle should come out clean the cake should pull away from the edges and the top should spring back when you touch it lightly grease the pan if the recipe calls for it either cooking spray or shortening are fine butter tastes better but it can scorch pay attention to the recipe's cooling time if you try to remove a cake too soon it can stick and crumble if you let the cake cool too long and it's sticking put it back in a degree oven for to minutes pans do make a difference metal cake pans are the best aluminum conducts heat evenly dark colored metal can retain more heat so you may need to lower the temperature by degrees to cut very fresh bread and cake without crumbling use a thin bladed knife heated in hot water and then dried Bread Cookware and bakeware Tofu Knife Chocolate Coffee Bacon Casting Jewish cuisine Cake Brewery Fire fighting Pottery Japanese cuisine Pizza Barbecue Butter Cookie Recipe Cuisine of Denmark Plastic Welding Heat Cuisine of Brazil Pancake Microwave oven Bong Baking Halva Pasta Internal ballistics Cuisine of the Philippines Stove Vacuum tube Dairy Hamburger Drill bit Motor oil Temperature Rum Flour Katana Paint Violin Glass Breakfast Opportunity rover Printed circuit board Sushi Dry cleaning Idli Fire extinguisher Hot dog Gas metal arc welding Textile manufacturing Ramen Aluminium Disc brake Cocoa Chopsticks Solar power Thermal power station Thermoregulation Steel Cajun cuisine Refrigerator Dialysis Brazing Air conditioning Soldering Spark plug Dundas Square Tortilla Maple syrup D__ner kebab Peanut butter Slow cooker Blade Domesticated turkey Fossil fuel power plant Titanium Amateur telescope making Metallurgy Cider Apple Doughnut Mattress M16 (rifle) Diseases of the honeybee Roman eating and drinking Tobacco Woodworking Polish cuisine
