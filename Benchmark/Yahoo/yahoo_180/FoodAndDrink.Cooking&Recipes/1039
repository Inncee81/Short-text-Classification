mystery recipe my mother used to make these delicious coconut brownie things i remember she used to take a chocolate cake mix and not add so much water add another egg or so mix sweetened condensed milk with coconuts and chocolate kiss drop things for the icing i guess you'd call it and then bake i don't know what the exact recipe is but i do remember that they were delicious lol i can't find the recipe anywhere anyone ever heard of this if so do you know the name and maybe the recipe the first person gave you one that sounds close here is another variation but it doesn't start with a cake mix maybe a combination will get you on the right track http allrecipes com recipe coconut macaroon brownies detail aspx Cake Cookie Chocolate Cuisine of the Philippines Pancake Rice pudding Ice cream Breakfast Cheesecake Alice B.
