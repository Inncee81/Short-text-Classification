uk food why do people always say 'english food ' what reasons do people have for thinking it's not good we do in fact have a huge array of native dishes which can be beautifully cooked and presented using natural ingredients it seems to me more that people have a poor impression of uk food based on a few dishes for example pastries pies pasties they're available pretty much mostly as fast food i e greggs so i see no difference there to other fast food it's all junk another example full 'english' breakfast this is only served up for uk people in foreign countries because they think it's what we want truth is after eating that for or days you're begging for something else it's otherwise only served up in uk bed breakfasts small hotels because stupid foreign tourists think it's so quaint and they have to try it the fact of the matter is people in the uk rarely eat that anyway the other reason seems to be based on the high number of plastic tv dinners consumed in the uk now something for which the us owned stores like asda are to be blamed for i wish it was labelled as british as it appears that only the english do any thing in the uk good or bad i am sure us celt can do as well or worse Breakfast French cuisine Pie Meal Cuisine of the Southern United States Irish breakfast Cuisine of Denmark Apple pie Food Cuisine of Africa Cuisine of the Philippines Kitchen Organic food Foodborne illness Soul food Japanese cuisine Chinese cuisine Full English breakfast Irish cuisine Pizza German cuisine Korean cuisine Sausage Hamburger Fast food McDonald's Pecan pie Pancake Cuisine of Brazil Dieting Peruvian cuisine Cornish pasty Cuisine of Malaysia Recipe Tofu Dumpling Street food Persian cuisine Domesticated turkey Curry Chili con carne Garfield Shit Tea (meal) Roman eating and drinking Jewish cuisine Japanese tea ceremony Fast-food restaurant Fish and chips Sauerkraut Cuisine of Singapore Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Potato Genericized trademark Ice cream Culture of France Rice pudding Kosher foods Ramen Saimin Swedish cuisine Trans fat Theory of conduct Delicatessen Laserdisc Restaurant Fugu Cajun cuisine Timon and Pumbaa Cantonese cuisine Cha chaan teng Dairy Eid ul-Fitr Veganism Conveyor belt sushi Chocolate Cuisine of Vietnam D__ner kebab Pork Cuisine of Norway Hamster Genetically modified food Omega-3 fatty acid Chopsticks Vegetarian cuisine Passover Cuisine of India Biscuit Pasta Taboo food and drink Soup American Chinese cuisine Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Brunch Australian English Cuisine of Greece Milk Plastic English grammar
