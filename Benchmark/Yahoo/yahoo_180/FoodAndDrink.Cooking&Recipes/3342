when baking cookies can you replace using butter with canola oil and also can you use salted butter instead of unsweetened butter and last question if you only have salted butter but need unsweetened butter can you just melt the salted butter and let all of the salt fall out and then carefully separate the butter from the salt therefor giving you not that much salty butter thanks to anyone who helps me out you can use salted butter when making cookies just make sure that you don't add any salt to your dry mixture most cookie recipes call for tsp or so so just subtract that when you prepare the recipe butter cannot be replaced by canola oil in a cookie recipe they're both fats but butter has things like milk solids that make it solid at room temperature if you use oil in a cookie recipe you're going to have an oily greasy puddle of dough also there's no way to remove the salt from salted butter the salt is well dissolved into the butter so it will not sink to the bottom when you melt butter what you see at the bottom are the milk solids not salt Chocolate Cookie Bread Butter Peanut butter Bacon Dairy Tofu Ice cream Jewish cuisine Margarine Cake Curry Tea Chili con carne Pancake Cheese Soap Soul food Halva Pottery Trans fat French fries Water (molecule) Soy protein Chocolate Salty Balls French cuisine Breakfast Rice Plastic Roux Coffee Bagel Cuisine of Brazil Idli Paint Pizza Omega-3 fatty acid Sodium Risotto Potato chips Yoghurt Casting Sulfuric acid Anointing Girl Scout cookies Kraft Dinner Biscuit Dairy product Potassium Sulfur Cocoa Gumbo Alice B.
