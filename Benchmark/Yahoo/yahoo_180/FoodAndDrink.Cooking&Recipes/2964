quick and easy recipes i have a few the first is to marinate chicken breast in zesty italian dressing with this you could just throw it on the grill and it's good i like to dress it up i generally bake this for about minutes it won't be done but it's going to go back in then i top with a few sliced tomatoes that i have seasoned with salt and pepper then with cheese i prefer something strong like gorgozola but i have made it with mozz cheese as well let this bake for another minutes until the cheese is brwon and bubbly you can serve this on a toasted bun with mayo or pesto or both the way i like it or on a plate with a side of pasta that is dressed lightly with a simple tomato sauce pesto or garlic and olive oil another really good easy recipe is my fake lasagna it's so good and a piece of cake you can dress this up any way you like as well the basic recipe calls for box of cooked ziti with lines make sure you undercook it for lb of sweet bulk sausage large jar of your favorite tomato sauce you will need about cups or about cups of homemade sauce large container of ricotta cheese and large bag of mozz cheese cook your sausage until it's all the way done then just mix the rest of the ingredients except for about cup of the mozz cheese and put it in a baking dish top with the rest of the mozz and bake at for about minutes covered with tin foil then take off the top and cook until the cheese is brown yum depending on the crowd i might add some marinated artichokes olives peppers onions etc just a little special bang finally another really good recipe is roasted chicken it's a piece of cake just wash the inside of the chicken out and season liberally with salt and pepper inside and out to the inside of the chicken and a head of garlic you have halved width wise a few carrots celery onion and some type of citrus fruit whatever you have on hand will work under the skin rub butter i like to season mine with thyme but it's up to you bake at for minutes less than your required to then let it sit for about a half hour it will still be nice and warm moist and delish serve with mashed potatoes and veggies one key thing with mashed potatoes that makes a difference is to warm your milk or cream in the mic before you begin to mix also make sure you salt your water well Peruvian cuisine Vegetarian cuisine In-N-Out Burger Dumpling Italian cuisine Bengali cuisine Potato Roman eating and drinking Cuisine of Argentina Dim sum Cuisine of Singapore Fish and chips Domesticated turkey Cuisine of Greece Haggis Ramen Potato chips Curry Korean cuisine Russian cuisine Cuisine of Laos McDonald's Gumbo Sauce Cuisine of Malaysia Mayonnaise Risotto Kraft Dinner Cuisine of Turkey Pie Tea B__chamel sauce Recipe Rice pudding Ice cream Soup Dairy Cookware and bakeware Chicago-style pizza Nabemono Stock (food) Cuisine of Austria Meatloaf Ricotta cheese Cuisine of Cambodia Idli Yoghurt Satay Cheese Catalan cuisine Lasagna Tamale Cake Oregano Vegetarianism Cincinnati chili Kosher foods Full English breakfast Food preservation Ketchup Kebab Irish cuisine Sushi
