your biggest kitchen disaster ok so tonight i decided to try a new recipe for chili it consisted of beef beans tomato soup two cans of tomatoes and corn i burned it stuck to the bottom of the pot burned it tried to salvage some of it but that smokehouse flavor just didn't work for me what a disaster so now it's tater tots and gravy just curious what's your biggest cooking disaster i'm a good cook but you wouldn't tell it from these disasters i've actually had plenty and am sometimes afraid to cook i made popcorn in the microwave at work once and the popcorn started on fire with black smoke gushing out of the back of the microwave i had a grease fire in my house from broiling a steak had the phone in one hand to call fire and with the other hand took the pan out and threw it outside into the winter snow on fire and all there was soot everywhere but maybe not so disasterous because i went out and got the pan with the steak and ate it med rare a little crusty on the outside but it was a pricy steak and wasn't going to waste it i have put a can of corn in a pan to heat up on the stove then forgot about it it burned to the pan i mean most of it there were a few kernels on the top that were movable but most of it was black and stuck in the pan it took quite a while to chisel corn out of the bottom and two more weeks of soaking and scrubbing to get it all off the bottom of the pan i was determined i guess oh my worst i just remembered microwaved some spaghetti at work and the microwave was a little high i went to take the spaghetti out and ended up being too hot to handle so i was going to leave it a little while longer to cool instead of going back onto the microwave plate it hit the side and the spaghetti and cheese slid down my sleeve ouch i ended up with rd degree burns and still have scars always let food sit a few minutes in the microwave another time i made a beautiful pan of lasagna took it out of the oven and put it on the top of the oven to cool then went to move it to the cupboard when it was ready to cut and being the graceful person i am the pan slid out of my hands and dumped upside down on the floor it sure smelled good though my mom always reminds me of this to this day one of my first cooking experiences was making bread pudding i called my mom from school a couple times wondering how long it was supposed to bake it was still runny the second time i called her she asked how long i had baked it so far hours maybe more Cuisine of Denmark Cookware and bakeware Bread Pizza Chili con carne MRE Kitchen Cajun cuisine Jewish cuisine Hamburger Soul food Cuisine of the Philippines Wok Pasta Stove Microwave oven French cuisine Cuisine of the Southern United States Bacon Cuisine of Brazil German cuisine Idli Breakfast Pancake Common bean Tofu Coffee Internal ballistics Soup McDonald's Poker jargon Futurama (TV series - season 4) French fries British cuisine Fire fighting Sandwich Cooking Food Haggis Ramen Happy Tree Friends Portable stove Kraft Dinner Cuisine of Laos Piccolo Junior Saga Comanche Pea soup Fish and chips Meatball Peruvian cuisine Japanese tea ceremony Cantonese cuisine Steak Risotto Rice pudding Cha chaan teng Cuisine of Argentina Slow cooker Dairy Kosher foods Escherichia coli O157:H7 Brewery Domesticated turkey Food preservation Popcorn Maize Flour Satchel Paige Plastic Roast beef Muffin Bong Cuisine of Malaysia Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an In-N-Out Burger Cheese Kebab Bagel Sauce Fire Fried chicken Potato AFI 100 Years series Chowder Cooking on a campfire Dumpling Hansel und Gretel
