can you help me make my pasta last longer while serving for some reason when i serve pasta i end up with such a small window of time where its right if i serve it too soon it usually isnt cooked all the way through and it dries real quickly if i cook it too long the pasta is soggy and it breaks apart really easily and again it dries up really quickly part a how can i tell when my pasta is cooked properly part b how can i serve it so that it doesnt dry out so quickly this is a problem there are several schools of thought regarding pasta cooking and serving to be sure pasta is cooked al dente bite a noodle it should be soft but slightly firm not hard or crunchy in the center people have their own tastes so cook it to the texture you like just never cook it too long i also read a funny way to test your pasta and i tried it is to throw a noodle against a wall if it sticks it's done haha my boyfriend was shocked when i did that then one chef insists that you shouldn't rinse your pasta just drain and then toss with sauce but if you want to keep your pasta you need to rinse it lightly if you will keep your pasta for a while you should toss with a light coating of olive oil to keep from sticking some chefs say if you coat with olive oil the sauce won't stick as well but you need to do this to prevent the noodles from sticking together i also haven't found this to be a problem with saucing later after refrigerating pasta i have rinsed the noodles in hot water until they come apart then they are just fine again good luck Pasta Tofu Japanese cuisine Cantonese cuisine Spaghetti Cookware and bakeware MRE Flour Ramen Cha chaan teng Wok Soup Korean cuisine German cuisine Barbecue French fries Couscous Salad French cuisine Cuisine of Denmark Stir frying Knife Mayonnaise Pot Noodle Cuisine of Brazil Cajun cuisine Breakfast Cuisine of Malaysia Kraft Dinner Sichuan Pepper Cuisine of the Philippines Chicken soup Sento Casting Rice Sauce Roux Drill bit Chili con carne Soba Russian cuisine Volleyball Sushi Mattress Bengali cuisine Wonton Taiwanese cuisine Beef noodle soup Customs and etiquette of Japan Fast-food restaurant Iron Chef Domesticated turkey American Chinese cuisine Pizza Starch Menstrual cup Pottery Canadian Chinese cuisine Hot dog Tlingit Shanghai cuisine Chopsticks Hamburger Jewish cuisine Kitchen Soy sauce Manicure British cuisine Craps Macaroni Idli Martini cocktail Cuisine of Singapore Cuisine of Thailand Steak Seitan Hell's Kitchen (television) Tea Dry cleaning Ice cream Fecal incontinence Thermal power station Pizza Hut Pancake Udon Cheese Soy protein Vermicelli Basil Campfire Soy milk Fishing Sauerkraut Coin flipping Halitosis Cooking oil Dishwasher Fire extinguisher
