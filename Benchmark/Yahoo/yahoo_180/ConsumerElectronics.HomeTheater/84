blu ray worth the price is blu ray dvd really worth the extra price i saw at best buy they played an actual dvd on it an older movie that was supposedly up scaled on a blu ray dvd and it was horrible and blotchy but whenever i see it normally it looks great its like a whole new picture is it worth the extra or is it just better to wait until they actual make the movies more worthwile for the blu ray well first off i wouldn't put much faith in best buy's displays most of them aren't configured properly besides which upscaled dvd is not nearly the same as a true blu ray disc next if you don't have a large screen hdtv don't even worry about either blu ray or hd dvd at this time but even if you do have a large screen hdtv it's still too early to get involved with either hd video format at this time too many people remember the last major video format war between vhs and betamax were still new on the market eventually vhs won out but not before a lot of people had purchased betamax players furthermore the picture difference between a good upscaled dvd player and blu ray hd dvd just isn't as great compared to vhs vs normal dvd even then dvd didn't require a new tv even your old tv would show a dramatic improvement with dvd between the expensive requirement of needing a hdtv the relative high price of players and the small and still very expensive library of movies neither hd format is really worth it at this time High-definition television Laserdisc DVD VHS 8 mm video format Warez Videocassette recorder Camcorder Television Betamax Blu-ray Disc DVD recorder Poker jargon Video Videotape Widescreen Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting S-VHS Video CD Inflation Macrovision Movie projector Digital rights management Blu Cantrell Floppy disk Betacam Home cinema Gramophone record Video 2000 Pump It Up Nintendo GameCube Atari 8-bit family Pornography Format war Atari ST Computer and video games Who Framed Roger Rabbit PlayStation 2 MPEG-2 Microeconomics IBM PC compatible $ale of the Century Dolby Laboratories First-sale doctrine Color Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Xbox Radeon Compact disc Digital photography CPU design Amstrad CPC NTSC Wheel of Fortune The Cure Motion picture rating system S__CAM PowerBook Gross domestic product Betting (poker) Craps Beatmania IIDX Enterprise content management Anamorphic widescreen Audiophile Sony The Criterion Collection Late Night with Conan O'Brien Pornography in Japan Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Oscilloscope Scale model Sega Saturn DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Stereoscopy Letterbox Digital cinematography Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles System/36 Deflation (economics) H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Sega Dreamcast Screenshot Movie theater Marilyn Monroe Delta Goodrem JVC Ra (board game) Best Buy Baseball Stars Beavis and Butt-head Regional lockout Paintball
