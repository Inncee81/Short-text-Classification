burn in prevention on plasma i know burn in prevention is not a thing but i have heard of something called an orbiter which adjusts the pixels gradually to try and prevent it i have ordered a pioneer plasma pdp hearing and reading it hads the same kind of prevention methods but i cant find it in the manual is it something i need to turn on or does it work on its own all the time any help would be appreciated the orbiter is an automatic pixel shift this moves the image around a few pixels every minute or so while the set is in use slowly enough that you don't notice but enough to decrease the probability of well defined burn in it is usually on by default and the exact settings can be adjusted in the setup menu Spacecraft propulsion Mercury Atlas 6 Autostereogram Apple typography Eye Pixel Planetary orbit Mouse (computing) Welding Dither Plasma display Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Simulated annealing Original Amiga chipset Carburetor Windows XP PlayStation Portable Cassini-Huygens Cheating in Counter-Strike STS-62 STS-61 RGB color model Pixel art Year Mars Exploration Rover PNG Galileo spacecraft Computed tomography Space Shuttle Columbia disaster Mandelbrot set Computer display standard Orbital period Danger Hiptop Screenshot Fischer Random Chess ITunes Nuclear fusion Video Electrophysiology Vostok 1 Tesla coil Carpal tunnel syndrome Atomic orbital Quake III Arena Lighting MESSENGER Digital photography Solar system Liquid crystal display Equation of time Hypoglycemia Atari 8-bit family Microeconomics Halo 2 Universal Century Technology Probability Enterprise content management Ra (board game) Rendering (computer graphics) Windows Vista Gemini 8 AppleScript Daylight saving time Palm OS Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Television Clementine mission 2D computer graphics Vacuum Motion compensation Gradius Multifunctional display (Orbiter sim) Nuclear magnetic resonance Stereoscopy Texas Instruments TMS9918 Gas tungsten arc welding Light pollution Turbocharger Black hole Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 Apollo 8 Hard disk High-definition television Inflation JPEG PaX Genetic algorithm Killian documents Saturn V Computer printer Motility WindowBlinds Lathe Connectionism RuneScape cheats Julia set Color Graphics Adapter Alien vs. Predator (film) Timeline of the Universe
