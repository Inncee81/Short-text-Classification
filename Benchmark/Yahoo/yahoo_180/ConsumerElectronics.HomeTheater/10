how does the denon ci compare to the onkyo tx sr i know the onkyo has the hqv while the denon doesn't but i've heard nothing but bad things about the onkyos and heard nothing but good things about the denon i don't know who to listen to and i'm looking to upgrade so what do i do which is the superior a v receiver hi aaron the denon avr ci and the onkyo tx sr both have similar specifications however the denon has independent power transformers and independent power supplies the greatest compromise in a receiver is the use of a single power supply for the preamp power amp and tuner which degrades the sound the denon seems to have corrected that shortcumming as far as i know the onkyo has just one power supply this feature alone gives the denon an advantage over the onkyo but there is still the question of the subjective sound quality they both have their individual sound characteristics which you should listen to before choosing one Kenwood Electronics MP3 DualDisc Audiophile Noise music Password Information warfare Compact disc Valve amplifier Loudspeaker XML Electronic amplifier High-end audio Bass guitar Cassette deck Impedance matching High fidelity Social rule Goodness and value theory Vorbis Shit 8 mm video format Capacitor plague Music Coercion Action potential Operational amplifier Cellular network DVD Electric guitar Goldberg Variations Singlish Audio data compression Redundant array of independent disks Gross domestic product Journey (band) Cable television Domestic AC power plugs and sockets I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Hearing aid Atari 8-bit family Gramophone record Economics Second language acquisition Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Comparison of 21st century fighter aircraft Laserdisc Laptop Time Out of Mind The Amazing Race PaX ITunes Video game music Sampling (music) Sonar Roxette Utilitarianism McCoy Tyner Switched-mode power supply Trusted computing Parliament of the United Kingdom Non-native pronunciations of English Justification (theology) John Myung Digital photography Law of value Circuit design The Beatles bootlegs Microeconomics Antenna (radio) Hearing impairment Hungarian language Scientology beliefs and practices Theory of conduct ATI Technologies Hiberno-English Summa Theologiae Mixtape John Cage Phantom power The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex English grammar Telecommunication Binaural recording The Marshall Mathers LP Decibel Storytelling House of Lords Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Charles Mingus Education in Portugal Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Nine Inch Nails Atari ST Hey Jude Chinese language Bicycle lighting Priesthood (Mormonism)
