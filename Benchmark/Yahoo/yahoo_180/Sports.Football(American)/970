wtf is asante samuel still with the patriots is he still with the pats wats happening with him explain plz yes he is still a member of the patriots currently he is a hold out looking for a big payday the patriots however are not known to 'renegotiate' contracts especially when said player has only had one good season thus far at the moment samuel has been placed as a franchise player which gives him an increase in pay this year and for any year there after should the pats continue to franchise him much like they did with vinateri however samuel feels he is worth more then the tag 'franchise player' gives him and has decided to hold out the last report i heard on the news was he was going to hold out for the first games this year although samuel tied all pro corner champ bailey with interceptions last year i personally think samuel is being a fool and should play this year and hopefully get a ring then see what he gets next year one good year doesn't make you an elite player however i do agree that his is underpaid but the amount he wants is ridiculous to compare him to a champ bailey would be wrong bailey has had a number of good seasons as a corner and samuel had hands made of stone until last season so yes he is a pat but is holding out for more expect to see him in week or perhaps traded should there be any key injuries New England Patriots Cincinnati Bengals International League National Football League New York Giants St. Louis Rams Poker jargon Pittsburgh Steelers Super Bowl XXXVI Jeopardy!
