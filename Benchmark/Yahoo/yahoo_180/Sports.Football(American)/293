let me ask one thing if grossman is by far and away the best qb in the league how come he ranked in the top half of the league in overall play he threw more td's than int's and has now experience that only a few qb's ever get the super bowl we went to was not all defense because as i recall the offense was awesome getting there in the first two playoff games and now the bears offense is even better and should rank very highly grossman does not suck he is by far the best qb the bears have had in over a decade maybe so stop complaining he had more good games than bad games was the player of the month for september and that wasnt dumb luck dumb luck is one or two games not by the end os his career with the players he has been gifted to play with he could be the best qb in franchise history your thoughts and yes i mean far and away worse qb at the top i was thinkin about how highly i think of him haha and yes that last answer made me remember when i looked up first year stats for great qb's today he did better than peyton manning's first year bratt favre's tom brady's of course he ended up winnning instead of losing the super bowl drew brees by far jake plummer and plenty of others now he has more experience and has better players around him for him to take that next step up to stardom i agree if you look at the stats grossman had a better first entirely played season than peyton manning had in his first season give grossman a couple years and he will be compared to the qbs like drew brees and tom brady NFL playoffs, 2004-05 New England Patriots New York Giants Super Bowl XXVII Pittsburgh Steelers Peyton Manning Super Bowl XIII Super Bowl X Buffalo Bills Super Bowl XXXVI San Francisco 49ers Super Bowl XXXI Carolina Panthers National Football League Lore NFL playoffs, 2003-04 Super Bowl XXXVIII St. Louis Rams Indianapolis Colts Donovan McNabb Cleveland Browns Super Bowl XXI Tom Brady Minnesota Vikings New York Jets Super Bowl XXV Super Bowl IX Miami Dolphins Super Bowl XXXIV Brett Favre Super Bowl XXIV Super Bowl XXVI Super Bowl XIX Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl XIV September 2005 in sports Dan Marino Super Bowl VI Dallas Cowboys Baltimore Ravens Super Bowl V San Diego Chargers National Football League 1957 World Series Super Bowl XXVIII Super Bowl XI Steve Young (athlete) Norway national football team Super Bowl XX Super Bowl XVIII Tennessee Titans NFL playoffs, 2001-02 American Football League Super Bowl XII International League Super Bowl I Super Bowl XVII Atlanta Braves New York Knicks Yao Ming Super Bowl XXII Super Bowl XVI Super Bowl VII One Tree Hill (TV series) Jake Plummer January 2005 in sports Troms__ I.L.
