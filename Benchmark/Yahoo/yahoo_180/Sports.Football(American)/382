what did terrel owens do why do some people hate him so much i think the biggest reason is because of what happened in phily he demanded a new contract and phily said 'no way ' phily never renegotiates contracts and never will the whole reason to wanted out of sf was to get more money he produced great stats his first year at phily and wanted to be paid for what he did so there was tension to instead of holding out did the opposite he showed up he promised that he'd be trouble for them all year if they didn't give him a new contract if he would have held out he would have lost money i think he stayed out of camp for a little while doing situps for the press or that might have been after phily suspended him anyways all year he was a distraction and picked on mcnabb and reid and kind of did his own thing eventually phily had enough and suspended him and then eventually traded him i must admit that i'm suprised that it was the cowboys who picked him up and that cowboy fans love him i guess they easily forget the spiking of the star years ago Terrell Owens New England Patriots EastEnders Philadelphia Eagles San Francisco 49ers Dallas Cowboys The Emancipation of Mimi Cowboy Bebop Oakland Athletics Super Bowl XXXIX Donovan McNabb Satchel Paige Montreal Screwjob Wheel of Fortune New York Knicks Los Angeles Kings Marilyn Monroe Drew Rosenhaus Big Brother (USA TV series) TLC Rush Limbaugh Los Angeles Clippers The Supremes Game show Poker jargon Blazers/Cowboys (WHA) Contract Marcus Licinius Crassus Major League Baseball television contracts Denis Law StarCraft Episode VI Marvin Gaye Pitaten Characters of Lost Fox Broadcasting Company World Championship Wrestling The Contender (television series) Money Andy Reid Toronto Raptors Wyatt Earp Houston Rockets Eddie Guerrero Waylon Jennings Deflation (economics) Leon White Pittsburgh Steelers Babe Ruth Fancy Crane Reserve clause Tris Speaker Inflation Minnesota Timberwolves Rugrats Humphrey Bogart Negima History of baseball in the United States American individualist anarchism Howard Stern Leeds United F.C.
