how impressive did the steelers look in their first preseason game people will say it's only the preseason but it was bigger than that it was the first game with coach tomlin it was the kind of dominating performance that could really get those skeptical veterans to get behind their new coach saints' coach sean payton was so disgusted with his team that he made them practice in full pads tuesday because they were physically bullied burnt some of the veterans didn't want tomlin to be their coach therefore i think tomlin made a statement in that game and may have won over the lockerroom team chemistry is really important to be successful in the nfl the saints did play horrible and their secondary is disgusting but i don't think it takes away from tomlin's message he's here to win it probably helps that they've practiced more than anyone i just hope they don't get tired at the end of the season thing is most starters only played the first position its hard to really say it was impressive based on that no team is locked in yet theres still lots of kinks to work out but it was a good sign that tomlin can get it done and im sure the locker room felt better about their situation Cleveland Browns National Football League Pittsburgh Steelers New York Giants Cincinnati Bengals Dallas Cowboys New York Jets New England Patriots Minnesota Vikings St. Louis Rams Jacksonville Jaguars Carolina Panthers Super Bowl IX Super Bowl XXVII San Antonio Spurs National Football League Lore Miami Dolphins Super Bowl XIII New Orleans Saints Kurt Warner Super Bowl X Toronto Raptors Super Bowl XXVI Ty Cobb Ice hockey Buffalo Bills Steve Nash Baseball San Francisco 49ers National Basketball Association Super Bowl XIV Yao Ming Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium Kobe Bryant New York Knicks American Football League Poker jargon Tennessee Titans Super Bowl XXIII Georgia Institute of Technology 1957 World Series Washington Redskins Bowl Championship Series The Kinks 2004 NBA Finals Super Bowl XXXIV 2005 NFL season Baltimore Ravens Jake Delhomme Ben Roethlisberger Super Bowl XXIV Orlando Magic USC Trojans Football Los Angeles Clippers Columbine High School massacre Sandy Koufax Cris Carter Chicago Bears Indianapolis Colts XFL Randy Moss Oakland Raiders American football strategy Norway national football team Philadelphia Eagles Japan national rugby union team Lily Tomlin Toronto Blue Jays Super Bowl III Ryan Leaf Super Bowl V Super Bowl XI Super Bowl Don Shula Leeds United F.C.
