what is the greatest come back in college football history one that comes to mind to me is in when wvu came from behind to beat louisville thats when pat white and steve slaton became starters burnt sienna is right about the michigan st game being the biggest comeback and about it not being the best although i'm a mountaineer fan was born there so my blood runs old gold and blue and i truly appreciate the amazing comeback in the th quarter against a very good louisville squad i have to give the nod to maryland against miami they came back from down with left in the rd quarter to win against an incredibly talented hurricane team that was the defending national champions frank reich orchestrated the comeback and is also known for doing the very same thing while in the pros with the buffalo bills in a playoff game against the houston oilers he led them from down in the rd quarter to a victory in overtime it is the largest comeback in nfl history Buffalo Bills National Football League Lore Pittsburgh Steelers Cleveland Browns New York Giants Super Bowl XXVII San Francisco 49ers Miami Dolphins New England Patriots Cincinnati Bengals St. Louis Rams New York Jets Los Angeles Kings The Comeback (American football) American Football League Kansas City Chiefs October 2005 in sports Carolina Panthers National Football League Doug Flutie Minnesota Vikings Super Bowl XXXVI NBA Finals Indianapolis Colts Super Bowl XIII Super Bowl XIV Dan Marino Super Bowl XIX Super Bowl XXI Frank Reich Super Bowl International League Super Bowl XXV January 2005 in sports Super Bowl XXXIV 1957 World Series Super Bowl XXIV Donovan McNabb Super Bowl IX Super Bowl XVIII Super Bowl VI Super Bowl XXII Jacksonville Jaguars San Diego Chargers Boston Bruins Toronto Maple Leafs Super Bowl XXVIII Super Bowl XVI College football September 2005 in sports Super Bowl II Super Bowl XXXIII New York Knicks Tranmere Rovers F.C.
