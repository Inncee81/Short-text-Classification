i need a drill to correct this problem for my flag football team i am coaching a flag football team and we scrimmaged and we were looking really good pretty much unstoppable we have a big line and pretty good speed then we scrimmaged again and we didnt do as good as before i'm not sure if it was just a bad day or something the other team had a really fast kid that kept taking it outside and gettign away does anyone know any drills which i could do with the line or defensive backs to solve this solution thanks i would try to teach the kids depending on their age angles of pursuit teach them not to aim to run at him but aim to run in front of the kid once he makes it to the sideline set up your drill with your db or lb or whoever about yards or so diagonally behind your ballcarrier have them start at the same time and they will learn to aim in front of the ball carrier of they are going to catch him especially if he is faster good luck Glossary of American football American football American football strategy Canadian football Wide receiver Super Bowl XXV Quarterback Volleyball Fast bowling Comparison of Canadian and American football Defensive team Super Bowl XXI Marching band National Football League Lore Super Bowl XXVI San Francisco 49ers Lineman (football) Down (football) Offensive team Super Bowl III Super Bowl XVIII Punt (football) New York Giants Cincinnati Bengals National Football League Arena football World Football League Rugby union Cleveland Browns Running back Pittsburgh Steelers 2000 Australian Grand Prix Super Bowl XXII Paintball Football (soccer) Super Bowl XXXVI Super Bowl XII Dog agility Play from scrimmage Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl XXVII Super Bowl XIX Super Bowl XXIV Carolina Panthers Tom Landry Drill bit Field hockey Rugby union positions Rugby football Super Bowl XIII NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 Super Bowl XXXIV Norway national football team Cricket Batting (cricket) Super Bowl IX Iron Bowl 1932 NFL Playoff Game Super Bowl XIV Super Bowl V Team Fortress Classic Baseball Softball Super Bowl XXXI Parade (military) Scientology beliefs and practices Water polo Super Bowl XXXIII 1974 NFL season Super Bowl XXIII Scrum (rugby) Hurling Australian rules football Option offense Super Bowl VI Super Bowl XI New England Patriots Super Bowl VII Rugby league Tony Dungy Super Bowl VIII Super Bowl I Toronto Raptors Drill instructor Extreme Programming Horse gait Memorial Stadium, Clemson Table tennis Super Bowl X Super Bowl XV Touch football (rugby league) Harrow Football Michael Vick Halting problem New York Jets Dodgeball
