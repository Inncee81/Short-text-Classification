anyone have any ideas a bengal is a tiger and a fast plane is a jet a cowboy comes from texas and a raider's tough i'll bet a viking's from the frigid north seahawks live near the sea all are names of football teams just like they ought to be but there's one name that makes no sense it causes me to frown can anyone enlighten me just what's a cleveland brown i don't know if it is true but i think i've heard a theory that cleveland named its team after the color of lake erie brown does not describe a big and strong athletic man it's what's inside the diaper of a baby steelers fan the guy who named this football team must be the cleveland clown who else would think to call a football warrior a brown if i'd been born in cleveland and there my life was spent i'd find another team to cheer from pure embarrassment but why is this name an adjective when it should be a noun can anybody tell me what the hell's a cleveland brown i found that poem on facebook i just had to share it and get some feedback what is a cleveland brown the aafc years the cleveland browns were founded in under owner arthur 'mickey' mcbride a fan contest was conducted to determine the name of the team with the most popular choice being panthers however coach paul brown objected to the name as there was a semipro team using it already a second contest was held and the name browns was selected the coach was uncomfortable with the idea of having the team named after him but stated publicly that the new team was named after boxing champion joe louis who was known as the brown bomber i generally dont' care to use the wiki as a reference but i'll do it this once as it says the same thing as other sites in a shorter version Pittsburgh Steelers New York Giants Cincinnati Bengals American Football League New England Patriots Super Bowl Buffalo Bills Professional American football championship games San Francisco 49ers National Football League Lore Miami Dolphins Minnesota Vikings Indianapolis Colts Dallas Cowboys January 2005 in sports AFL-NFL Merger Carolina Panthers November 2004 in sports December 2004 in sports Paul Brown Running back Baltimore Ravens October 2005 in sports September 2005 in sports Ty Cobb Seattle Seahawks Kansas City Chiefs National Football League Nickname Fight song Kappa Alpha Psi St. Louis Cardinals World Series Tennessee Titans Super Bowl IX Arkansas Razorbacks Oakland Raiders New York Yankees Philadelphia Eagles All-America Football Conference Syracuse University Orange Negro league baseball Professional wrestling match types San Diego Chargers National Football League championships Arizona Cardinals Oakland Athletics Detroit Lions Donovan McNabb Glossary of American football November 2 in baseball University of Miami Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim October 4 in baseball Marty Schottenheimer Texas Longhorn Athletics Bernie Kosar Joe Paterno New York Knicks Survivor Series Detroit Tigers College football Satchel Paige Art Modell American football Cleveland Indians Tris Speaker Washington Redskins Jacksonville Jaguars Poker jargon Los Angeles Clippers Clemson University Super Bowl XXXIX Bud Adams Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1946 Super Bowl IV Super Bowl XXIV Super Bowl III Don Shula Football (soccer) Canadian Football Hall of Fame NFL playoffs Tampa Bay Buccaneers Joe Namath ESPN25 NFL playoffs, 2004-05 Chicago White Sox Florida Marlins NFL Most Valuable Player Award Green Bay Packers
