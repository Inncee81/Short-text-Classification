would you draft larry johnson as the number back in a fantasy draft this year i'm a chiefs fan and i'd say no i think larry is going to have a down year this year i don't think the chiefs line is going to be very good and the fact that he's no where near agreeing to a deal and showing up to camp is going to hurt him too plus i seen a deal where when backs carry the ball more than times in a season the next year they have a down year well i believe larry carried to ball over times last year Pittsburgh Steelers Larry Bird Indiana Pacers New York Jets Buffalo Bills Los Angeles Clippers New York Knicks Cincinnati Bengals New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Miami Dolphins New England Patriots Los Angeles Kings Super Bowl XXVII San Francisco 49ers Running back Detroit Red Wings Family Guy American football Cleveland Browns Pittsburgh Penguins National Football League Lore Steve Nash Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl IX Toronto Raptors M*A*S*H (TV series) New York Giants Good Times National Basketball Association Boston Red Sox Dallas Cowboys Chicago Bulls V8 Supercar Satchel Paige Michael Jordan NBA Finals Michael Vick Super Bowl XXVIII Football Football (soccer) Tris Speaker Super Bowl XIV 1957 World Series Super Bowl VII National Football League Super Bowl XXI Oakland Athletics Larry Johnson (football) Boston Celtics Terrell Owens MLB on NBC NBA Draft Carolina Panthers Barry Bonds 1986 NBA Draft Phoenix Suns Plame affair San Antonio Spurs New Mexico Lobo Basketball Larry Csonka Pedro Mart__nez Houston Rockets Major League Baseball television contracts Halo (video game series) Hank Aaron Super Bowl XXVI The Star Wars Holiday Special Babe Ruth Don Mattingly Green Bay Packers Canadian football San Diego Padres Rasheed Wallace Larry Johnson (basketball) Randy Johnson Philadelphia 76ers Major League Baseball Super Bowl Nick Johnson NFL on television History of baseball in the United States World Football League November 4 in baseball Larry Linville Portland Trail Blazers Tim Duncan Laws of cricket Super Bowl III Jerry Coleman Walter Payton 1986 World Series Hendrick Motorsports Super Bowl XIX Inspector Gadget International League Seinfeld Montreal Canadiens Lawrence Whistler Super Bowl XIII Theory of conduct
