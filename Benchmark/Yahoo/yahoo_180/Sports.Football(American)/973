will any college football team go undefeated this year i just have the feeling this year that there is really no dominate team that will run the table and go undefeated there are a lot of question marks for the contenders like usc booty really hasn't impressed me much we will find out if he's for real when he has unestablished wr's to work with and really no running game and a brutal final game schedule to end the year lsu a lot of uncertainty on the offensive side of the ball and they play in the sec although most of their tough conf games will be at home michigan defense is really going to struggle and i don't see the offense being able to carry the team throughout the year wisconsin solid players on both sides of the ball but really no superstar players who can give them the spark they need in crucial situations texas mccoy will struggle a but and i'm not so sure he will be able to take the team to where they wanna go and whoever else u wanna put up there all have some holes to fill usc was much better last season and didn't dominate half as much as u r saying they will this year i'm not saying they're a bad team i'm just saying that they are coming into this season with really an unestablished running and passing game it's decent but it's not blow away good like u r all making it out to be and last games go nd oregon oregon st cal arizona st ucla someone honestly can't see at least loss in any of the final i'm not sure any team in college football would run the table through that schedule it is much like florida's schedule last year and we all saw that even the eventual national champions couldn't make it through such a brutal schedule hawaii won't run the table either they have no defense whatsoever and i like boise st and nevada maybe even sj st to beat them first of all how can anyone say that usc's defense is better then have of the nfl you've got to be kidding me any nfl team would have there way with usc the nfl takes all the best college kids and usc's entire defense isn't nfl caliber so that right there is just a ridiculous comment but anyway i think michigan has a great chance to go undefeated this year they play of there games at home yes some of there defense is a bit shaky but they have a ton of talent every year just because they are young they wont be good that doesnt make much sense shawn crable is a great linebacker for uofm and they also have soph brandon graham who was the number one linebacker coming out of highschool last year they will also be returning jamar adams the starting strong saftey last year and terrance taylor who was also a full time starter last year the only spot they are semi weak is corner and they have some really talented young guys to fill in for the likes of leon hall morgan trent is a returning starter for them at corner and besides ron english is a good defensive cord who will do a good job for them again and you guys already know about the offense so i dont need to go into detail about them Cincinnati Bengals Pittsburgh Steelers NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 National Football League Super Bowl XXVII St. Louis Rams Miami Dolphins New York Jets Buffalo Bills American football Baltimore Ravens San Francisco 49ers National Football League Lore Super Bowl XXV Super Bowl XXXIV Super Bowl XXVI Glossary of American football Super Bowl XXXVI Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl XIII USC Trojans Football Super Bowl XVIII Super Bowl I American Football League Iron Bowl Super Bowl XVII Super Bowl XXI Super Bowl VII Super Bowl V International League Toronto Raptors Super Bowl XIV Super Bowl XII Norway national football team October 2005 in sports Mack Brown Indianapolis Colts Sam Barry Super Bowl III World Series College football 1957 World Series 2005 World Series American football strategy Super Bowl XIX Super Bowl XXIV Super Bowl XI Jacksonville Jaguars Dallas Cowboys Playoff Canadian football Defensive team Baseball Super Bowl XV Super Bowl XXXVIII Super Bowl VI Houston Nutt Toronto Blue Jays January 2005 in sports Donovan McNabb Poker jargon Super Bowl XXXV Leeds United F.C.
