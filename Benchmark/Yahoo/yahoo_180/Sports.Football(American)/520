if micheal vick is convicted of the charges against him should he be allowed to play in the nfl again why for the record i'm not saying that i want to see the guy go to jail or be banned i just want to know what your thoughts were ok i'm sick of this folks talking about him doing whatever to dogs look here's some history and fact he's accused and hasn't had his day in court leonard little ring a bell he not only plays in the nfl he has a super bowl ring and guess what he was convicted of vehicular manslaughter because he killed a woman while driving drunk now if convicted he should have to serve some kindof penalty by the nfl after that he should play c'mon what he is accused of has no bearing on the game of football itself example pete rose banned for life from baseball he bet against his own team and then intentionally threw games that affects the game itself so if some dog's well being is more important than the mother of some kid getting killed or ruining the game then go away your not a fan of the sport and you're a crappy human being Murder Match fixing National Football League Lore American football Pete Rose Super Bowl XXV American Football League Super Bowl XIV Super Bowl XXXI Sports timeline New York Giants Super Bowl XXXVIII Super Bowl St. Louis Rams Super Bowl XIX Super Bowl XXXIV Michael Vick Pittsburgh Steelers Super Bowl XXVI Super Bowl XXVII Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl XXXVI Cleveland Browns Super Bowl XXIII Super Bowl XXI Philadelphia Eagles NFL playoffs 2005 NFL season Super Bowl XIII Madden NFL Donovan McNabb Super Bowl IX Minnesota Vikings Super Bowl IV Super Bowl III Dallas Cowboys Miami Dolphins Super Bowl I ESPN25 Sports betting Super Bowl XXII Super Bowl XV Super Bowl XXXIX Super Bowl XVII Super Bowl XXXIII New England Patriots Baltimore Ravens NFL playoffs, 2002-03 Playoff Super Bowl VI Super Bowl XII Brett Favre Indianapolis Colts Super Bowl XXXV New York Jets Super Bowl XXIX Super Bowl XVI Randy Moss Buffalo Bills Carolina Panthers Super Bowl VII San Diego Chargers Baseball Super Bowl XX Deion Sanders Major League Baseball television contracts College football Super Bowl XXXII San Francisco 49ers Canadian Football League World Football League Sudden death Joe Namath Professional American football championship games Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum December 2004 in sports NFL on television Pete Rozelle Super Bowl XXX Salary cap Robert F.
