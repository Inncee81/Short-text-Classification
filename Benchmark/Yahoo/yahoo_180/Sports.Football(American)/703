cleveland browns i would like to hear some opinions on this team they have some sound weapons on offense in braylon edwards and winslow i think jamal lewis has had it and quinn wont be ready to run the offense though i am a lifelong browns fan i dont see them winning more then or games this year is brady quinn finally the qb of the future for this team injuries are starting to hurt them again this year amidst some more bad luck what are your thoughts you sir are a fair minded realistic browns fan and that seems to be fairly rare judging from what other people write about the browns on here i agree with your assessments of lewis edwards and winslow i also agree with your prediction for their record this season i think it's too early to judge about quinn so i'm not even going to try the browns gave up a lot to get him seeing as that pick they gave to the cowboys is going to be a top pick so i hope for their sake that he pans out the browns have the misfortune of playing in the toughest division in the league right now i think they are at least seasons away from putting together a team that has a shot at a playoff spot they have some good young talent on offense that could turn them into an offensive power soon once they pick up some talent on defense and some more talent at rb they could be looking at a good playoff run but i don't think this will happen for at least years also i think they'll have to lose crennel as coach because he just doesn't seem to have the smarts to put together a decent gameplan whenever i see the browns on tv they always look like they are getting outcoached this year i think they'll be battling with the falcons for the honor of having the worst record in the nfl New York Giants Cincinnati Bengals Cleveland Browns New England Patriots Miami Dolphins San Francisco 49ers Buffalo Bills New York Knicks Baltimore Ravens Dallas Cowboys New York Jets Carolina Panthers Super Bowl XXVII Kansas City Chiefs National Football League Minnesota Vikings St. Louis Rams 1957 World Series Los Angeles Clippers American Football League Toronto Raptors Chicago Bulls Super Bowl XIV Atlanta Falcons Utah Jazz Los Angeles Kings Super Bowl IX Donovan McNabb Indiana Pacers Playoff Philadelphia Eagles Cris Carter Super Bowl V Orlando Magic Indianapolis Colts San Diego Chargers San Antonio Spurs Super Bowl XIX New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Detroit Red Wings Toronto Blue Jays Boston Bruins Super Bowl I Seattle Mariners Oakland Raiders Baltimore Orioles Super Bowl XXIV NFL playoffs Cleveland Indians Houston Rockets Joe Gibbs International League Washington Redskins NFL playoffs, 2003-04 Super Bowl X Super Bowl III Super Bowl XXXV Super Bowl XXXI September 2005 in sports Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Jacksonville Jaguars Brett Favre NFL playoffs, 2004-05 Super Bowl XXXVI Mario Lemieux New Orleans Saints San Francisco Giants Florida Marlins Super Bowl XXII Super Bowl XXV Yao Ming World Series St. Louis Cardinals National Basketball Association Pittsburgh Penguins Chicago White Sox Super Bowl VII Chicago Cubs Detroit Tigers Super Bowl XXI National Football League championships NFL playoffs, 1982-83 Norway national football team Tennessee Titans Boston Red Sox Celtic F.C.
