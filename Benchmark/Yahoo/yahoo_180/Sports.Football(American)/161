what college coaching jobs will be vacant by the end of the season i can think of or in the sec alone in the pac in big east and a maybe in the acc sec i think that ed orgeron is toast houston nutt will be out too and the third one i'm pretty sure on les miles lsu fans expect a chance at national title and i see them losing or games before november and he's had solid teams since he got there and keeps losing games he should win pete carroll will probably go pro after this season i think michigan has the talent to get to the title game and if they lose to osu this year then i agree on lloyd carr you can only lose to a rival so much actually alot of people who pay attention think lsu will lose games before nov some folks are picking miss st to shock them which i could see but virginia tech and auburn definately have the game to put an l on lsu and ask mike shula what happens when you lose to miss st despite the fact that there are more of me i'm going to stick up for lloyd carr i think he's an awesome coach and runs a hell of a program he's also going to have a winning record against ohio state after this year currently and hopefully a second national championship to hang on his belt i think he may want to stick around to coach mallett and mcguffie and the sickest receiver recruits i've ever seen the offense is going to be disgusting the next few years the sec is so stacked with good coaches right now that i hope they don't get any more new ones at the lower tiered sec teams i'm really hoping harbaugh gets fired at stanford for running his mouth too much but it probably won't happen right away i am curious to see who you're thinking takes off pete carroll i hope fatty mcweis leaves because he keeps taking good recruits and making empty promises to them when they could be living it up in ann arbor Houston Nutt Cincinnati Bengals Southeastern Conference Mack Brown Pittsburgh Steelers Cleveland Browns Miami Dolphins New York Jets Arkansas Razorbacks Iron Bowl Houston Rockets Nick Saban New England Patriots Atlantic Coast Conference St. Louis Rams 2004 College World Series New York Giants Utah Jazz National Football League USC Trojans Football Louisiana State University Buffalo Bills San Francisco 49ers Pete Rose New York Knicks Super Bowl XXVII Carolina Panthers Boston College Athletics Toronto Blue Jays Big East Conference Minnesota Vikings BCS title game 2005 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament Auburn University Norway national football team Boston Bruins Texas Longhorn Athletics National Football League Lore Kansas City Chiefs Chicago Bulls Tennessee Titans American Football League Indianapolis Colts Montreal Canadiens Super Bowl XXVI NBA Finals Los Angeles Clippers Dallas Cowboys Oklahoma State University - Stillwater Los Angeles Kings Florida Marlins St. Louis Cardinals Toronto Raptors Andre Agassi Jim Tressel Joe Paterno Alex Ferguson Super Bowl XXV Syracuse University Orange October 2005 in sports College basketball New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Washington Redskins West Bromwich Albion F.C. 1986 NBA Draft Georgia Institute of Technology Indiana Pacers Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University Super Bowl III Super Bowl Orlando Magic Nottingham Forest F.C.
