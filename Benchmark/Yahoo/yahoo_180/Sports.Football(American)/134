do you think this will be john gruden's last season with the tampa bay bucs sure i like him sure he won a superbowl but a lot of people feel that tony had more to do with that win than john gruden million spent on adams and he's already bringing serious doubts to the field makes you wonder where the brains were when they let rice go what do you think well don't fault gruden for trying to keep his job but i honestly think last year should have been his last if tampa gets a winning record then gruden keeps his job if he gets anything else he's fired plain and simple my honest opinion is that anybody could have a won a superbowl with that ' team and the fact that it wasn't tony still makes me mad the decision to release rice was gruden using a failed physical as excuse to get ride of an aging defensive player lynch and quarles are also examples of this lynch has gone to the pro bowl times since tampa released him and tampa's safties squad was one of the worst last season so ya that worked in the past cough Tampa Bay Buccaneers Super Bowl XXXVII Super Bowl Cincinnati Bengals New York Jets Jon Gruden St. Louis Rams Rich Gannon Donovan McNabb San Francisco 49ers Carnell Williams Super Bowl I Carolina Panthers Jacksonville Jaguars New England Patriots Tampa Bay Lightning Pro Bowl Cleveland Browns Pittsburgh Steelers Tampa Bay Storm Dallas Cowboys Super Bowl XXV Super Bowl XXVII Tim Brown Baltimore Ravens Super Bowl XXXIV Leeds United F.C.
