if vick is found innocent will he play for the falcons again will the endorsements come back i think he is guilty as hell and should be ban from the nfl but there is a possibility he could be proven innocent i don't believe the falcons will have him back and most of all i don't believe he will be found innocent barring an oj jury there are going to be many witnesses in this case one of his team mates ray buchanan was interviewed by chris landry of fox sports and he said that michael has been into this dog fighting for so long that he not only knew about he is behind all of it he's paying for all of it apparently he's into it big time landry also said that vick was actively recruiting teammates to become involved in the sport see the link below for source if ray buchanan knew about this dog fighting operation i am sure other team mates did as well if they are called to testify whether they want to or not they must tell what they know i really don't think his endorsement companies would take him back either what would be the point very few would buy products he endorsed and peta would come down on their head so it would be a lose lose situation if they did Atlanta Falcons Michael Vick New York Giants Plame affair Carolina Panthers Madden NFL Super Bowl XXVII 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Schapelle Corby Ross Perot NFL playoffs, 2002-03 National Football League 1919 World Series Super Bowl XXXIII Pro Football Hall of Fame San Francisco 49ers January 2005 in sports December 2004 in sports American football Pete Rose Chris Chandler The Apprentice 2 Dallas Cowboys Glen Jacobs Mumia Abu-Jamal Monday Night Football NFL playoffs, 2004-05 Ayrton Senna Super Bowl Karl Rove Professional wrestling match types One Piece minor characters National Football League Lore Martha Stewart Donovan McNabb Enron Corporation Criminal procedure St. Louis Rams Tom Landry Kansas City Chiefs New York Jets Cincinnati Bengals Michael Schumacher Ben Johnson (athlete) James Hanratty Fox Broadcasting Company People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Gwen Araujo Oakland Raiders Minnesota Vikings Salary cap Beltway sniper attacks Ethel and Julius Rosenberg Troy Aikman Pittsburgh Steelers Major League Baseball television contracts Leo Frank Pat Buchanan Total Nonstop Action Wrestling Scott Peterson (convicted murderer) Knots Landing Match fixing Professional wrestling attacks RuneScape quests Hearsay Joe Paterno Super Bowl VI Shoeless Joe Jackson Home Box Office Azaria Chamberlain disappearance Investigations since the Fiji coup of 2000 Jim Thorpe Shawn Michaels Battle of Endor Vince Lombardi Super Bowl I Super Bowl XXVI Quarterback Evidence (law) Sport U.S. presidential election, 1988 Military unrest since the Fiji coup of 2000 Tommy Nobis LeBron James Washington Redskins September 2005 in sports Ronnie Earle Jayne Mansfield O.
