what are the raiders doing why haven't they signed russel yet i'm a big fan but it seems like the front office is always making dumb mistakes in my opinion frustrating yeah i'm a raiders fan who feel frustrated too but it's not the team fault russell agent want more of the million dollars in an option bonus but not just regular bonus an option bonus which mean if russell don't want to play or show up or some kind of dispute with the team the team cannot recovered the money back even if it is the player fault normally a regular bonus money can be recovered back if the players is at fault so that what holding up the contract nothing more plus the raiders is not in the hurry to bring russell in because they know he's not gonna play this year with the addition of dante culpepper also is in the equation but i hope we win alot of games and make the playoff New York Giants American Football League Oakland Athletics New England Patriots NBA Finals Salary cap Cleveland Browns Oakland Raiders National Football League Pittsburgh Steelers Cincinnati Bengals National Football League Lore Super Bowl XVIII Kansas City Chiefs Satchel Paige New York Knicks Miami Dolphins Pyramid (game show) Buffalo Bills St. Louis Rams Wheel of Fortune World Hockey Association Super Bowl III Monday Night Football Password (game) Super Bowl XI Los Angeles Clippers Super Bowl XXXVI Super Bowl XXVII New York Jets Major League Baseball television contracts Super Bowl XXVI Super Bowl X Detroit Red Wings 2004-05 NHL lockout Match Game Newcastle United F.C.
