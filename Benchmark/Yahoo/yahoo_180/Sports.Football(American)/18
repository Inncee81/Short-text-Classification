how can i become a better hitter tackler i want to stand out tomorrow because it is our first day of practice with pads any tips theres no perfect way to tackle some one and dish out a huge hit everytime since i am a linebacker i can probably tell you a few tips st eye the ball carrier its kind of a lock down you see whos got the ball then you kind of lock in on him be aware of blockers but make sure you stay on him you can not lose him nd shed all blockers before pursuiting the ball carrier you have be aware of blockers in front of you too concentrated on the ball carrier can lead to a pancake some guy knocking you straight down onto the ground if you are on defense you will have to use a swim or juke or wtv to get through to the carrier you shouldnt take more than seconds to shed a block any time longer means the ball carrier is up and away rd pursue the carrier by that i mean catch up to him and find the best angle on him for example if a running back is running along the sidelines make sure you close in on him but make sure you have the correct angle to him or he can just do a cut and you will be burned if the rb is in the back field try to get in front of him as possible so you can make the best out of the tackle if you are chasing a rb make sure you have his legs in diving range if you cant get his legs chances are you cant get him th tackle him if there isnt a lot of space between the ball carrier and you you should always hit him in the midsection lower your shoulders and just push your shoulders into him do not vision a huge hit before the tackle most of the time you will miss if you try too hard just lower your shoulder and drive it in the only exception is when you are trying to force a fumble in which case you will usually lower your helmet and kind of head butt the space where theres the ball if a carrier has the ball in his arms you will try to hit him in the arm the hardest you can if you are trying to force a fumble for the qb go for his hands as he will likely be trying to throw if his hands are throwing forward you will try to hit the hand backwards so the ball will come loose inevitablely you will have to make a what we call a shoe string tackle which means a tackle where you are just usually diving and grabbing a piece of the carrier the important thing when diving is to dive at the right time as you know when running the legs goes up and down when looked from behind so when diving for a guys legs you have to make sure you make contact when the legs are up its easier to hold on than if the legs are swing down therefore you have to time it correctly sometimes you will have caught just a smal part of the carrier the important thing is to hold on obviously he will try to break free so its important that you get a firm hold and wait for help if theres one thing about tackling its not every tackle is perfect but as long as the guys down the jobs done hope that helps and good luck Aerial (dance move) American football strategy Professional wrestling holds Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Fast bowling Professional wrestling attacks Professional wrestling aerial techniques National Football League Lore Diving Suplex New York Giants Rugby union positions Cincinnati Bengals Baseball Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Field hockey Softball Rugby union Super Bowl XXV Tag Cleveland Browns Lineman (football) Swingout Equine conformation Batting (cricket) Water polo Super Bowl IX Super Bowl V Knife Super Bowl XXVI Super Bowl XXXIV Backstroke Boxing DDT (professional wrestling) Super Bowl XXVII Rugby league positions Australian rules football Carolina Panthers Cricket New England Patriots Billiards Super Bowl XIII Powerbomb Super Bowl XII Fielding (cricket) English cricket team Pittsburgh Steelers Poker jargon Defensive team Piledriver (professional wrestling) Glossary of climbing terms 1957 World Series Swimming Parade (military) Super Bowl XXI Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Baseball Stars Tank Offensive team Super Bowl XXXVI Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Piccolo Junior Saga Mixed martial arts San Francisco 49ers Super Bowl XXIII Shaggy dog story Armored Core Butterfly stroke Archery Peter Shilton Combine (Half-Life 2) Terminal ballistics Side pass (dance move) Blitzball Super Bowl XVII Rugby league Neckbreaker Sandy Koufax
