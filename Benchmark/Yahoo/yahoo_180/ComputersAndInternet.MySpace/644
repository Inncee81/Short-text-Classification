how do i change the mb of a video i have this video of my cat and i wanted to upload it onto myspace so my friends can see him myspace won't let me upload it because the limit is mb but my video is mb is there some way to make it smaller it's only like a minute and seconds long so i don't know why it takes up so much space can i make it work you'll need to find some type of video compression software just do a search for 'video compression software' or 'video converter' you'll find tons of links to sites where you can download the only problem is that sometimes the free version will put their logo on your video or overlay an audio advertisement you can also try opening it in windows movie maker if you use an xp machine and then adjusting it to save out as a smaller file size this doesn't always work your best bet is to learn how to adjust the settings on your video camera camera so it saves the video as a slightly lower quality movie that way you can just shoot and upload i always keep some sort of video compression software around and it never hurts to pay for something if you feel it's worth the expense Macromedia Flash Warez IPod BitTorrent Digital photography PlayStation Portable MP3 Vorbis EMule Nine Inch Nails Windows XP ITunes Web page Laserdisc Web hosting Xbox File sharing MAME Atari 8-bit family PNG Screenshot Slot machine Machinima Commodore 64 MySpace DVD Microsoft Perl Uploading and downloading QuickTime GIF Opera (web browser) High-definition television Data compression Bluetooth Floppy disk Movie projector Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Kazaa CPAN Apple Computer MiniDisc Camcorder Computer virus Videocassette recorder Streaming media Video Mac OS X Mozilla Firefox ZX Spectrum Image file formats NTFS Theora Enterprise content management X Window System Lossless data compression Minesweeper (computer game) Game programmer 8 mm video format FireWire Cable television ITunes Music Store Domain Name System Strap-on dildo Blackjack America Online Modem IBM PC compatible History of Microsoft Windows MSN Messenger JPEG Audio data compression Skype The Internet Movie Database Mandriva Linux DivX Peer-to-peer Raw image format Turbocharger Halo: Combat Evolved Portable Document Format Internet pornography ROM image Ebook USB flash drive Digital image editing View camera Digital cinematography Mattress OpenBSD Video game music Video game crash of 1983 GBA Movie Player
