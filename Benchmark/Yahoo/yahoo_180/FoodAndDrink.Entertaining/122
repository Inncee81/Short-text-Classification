th b day partyyyyyyyyyyyyy what should i do for my th birthday party give me ideas please a 's party can be so much fun for all ages but planning is the key to a swingin' good time for the party my mom made me a light pink felt poodle skirt with a white poodle i wore a plain white long sleeve shirt i tied a light pink sash around my neck and around my ponytail my dad wore jeans a white short sleeve shirt and his leather jacket he also gelled his hair and kept a comb in his back pocket my mom dressed as a car hop apron name tag and everything it was really neat invitations i got black constrution paper and a few metallic markers i folded the paper in half and cut it in a circle leaving a few inches at the top uncut so they could open it like a card in silver on the front i filled in a circle in the middle so that it would look like a record then i wrote you're invited to caitlin's th birthday party inside i wrote the date time etc but instead of saying place my house i put place caitlin's fun time diner i also asked them to be dressed for a 's themed good ol' time inside the record invites i wrote on a note card information about being dressed in theme if they didn't have a poodle skirt i told them to wear their long flowing skirts that i knew they had and i would make felt poodle cutouts to pin to their skirt i was surprised at how mcuh fun they had getting all dressed up for my party for decorations i hung streamers in my p party colors that i picked out black white light pink nad a little bit of aqua i also had balloons in the same colors all over the place for the tables my mom and i put the colored streamers running down the tables for centerpieces i got one for each table trash cans in white then i stuffed them with old newspapers on the top i covered all the newspaper with light pink constrution paper then i took white stuffing the kind for stuffing pillows and such when sewing and placed some in the middle but not completely covering the pink i purchased two small styrafome balls and painted them red and stuck then right on top of the stuffing then with paper towel rolls that i painted white with red stripes i stuck it in the side wall la an ice cream float centerpiece i had some balons next to these too all my friends loved the floats it was worth the time and energy also the floats can be easily put together with hot glue i also used a large box laying around at my house and painted it to look like a juke box once again woth the time and energy i used a picture from the computer to paint my juke box i placed in my basement where most of the party was taking place where there was a spot behind it to place my cd player slelf table etc which was playing 's music the enitre time also my mom and i cut out black paper records and music notes and placed them all the place i also had a mini gum ball machine that i put out and filled with gum my friends really liked it small plastic gum ball machines can be purchased usually for a cheap price i also had a poster board that looked like a menu and listed all the foods we were going to have food and the cake for the main foods we had pizza nad fries both simple foods that almost all people will enjoy i also had bowls with chips and candy out around the party area when i was searching the internet for a real neat cake idea we came across this one my mom made a rectangular chocolate cake with chocholate icing my faveorite then we got a piece of cardboard adn glued a picture of a grease scene that my dad found on the internet we stuck this in one end of the cake then we cleaned some of my brother's old matchbox cars and placed all around facing the screen it looked just like a drive in it was a real hit activities my parents and i made a schedule of what we were going to do at what times from the start of the party for about a half hour or until everyone arrived we danced to 's music it was lots of fun we have lots of pictures from this then we played a few games we played the classics such as limbo hula hoop contests and pin the ponytail on sandy we also had a bag of papers with 's themed things to act out in our game of charades these were made before the party then we ate our meal and our sundeas then we did the cake we were prepared with cling wrap so the guests could take their cake home because they were full by then then i opened my presents and we played a few more games then we all settled down and watched grease until they had to go home we made basic goodie bags but feel free to get really creative with them the guests will love them we had older types of candy like bazooka gum pop rocks etc we also had pencils with music notes this was one of my best birthday arties ever and my friends really
