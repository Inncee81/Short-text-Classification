i just watched rocky for the first time and i noticed that he kept gettting hit constantly in the face and here i am thinking why doesnt he keep his hands up am i alone in thinking this great question well part of the appeal of rocky was that he was a 'club fighter' that went the distance with the world champ of course realistically a club fighter would hopefully keep their hands up but i think that they really wanted rocky to appear 'rough around the edges' and not a polished fighter a guy that goes the distance based soley on his tenacious will to survive there is a great line in another rocky movie either or where apollo says to rocky in training you fight great but i'm a great fighter i'm a big fan of the series with the exception of because rather than just create a 'larger than life hero' they really humanize rocky you can really belive that he is the guy next door that just happens to box down at the local gym it is kind of an ongoing theme throughout the series that rocky grows and develops not only as a boxer but also as a person Rocky II Boxing Rocky Rocky Marciano The Contender (television series) Mixed martial arts Rocky III Hulk Hogan Sugar Ray Robinson Tenshinhan Solar system Fighting Spirit Muhammad Ali Roy Jones Jr. K' Wilfredo G__mez The Rock (entertainer) Street Fighter II Battlestar Galactica Alexis Arg__ello Andr__s Galarraga Joe Louis Antonio Tarver Mike Tyson The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Boxing training Jeet Kune Do Floyd Patterson Cody Travers Punisher Rocky Mountains Boss (video games) Charley Goldman EastEnders The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show Chuck Wepner Mr. T Wilfred Benitez Final Fight Care Bears Willie Pep Akuma (Street Fighter) Mortal Kombat Kylie Minogue Michael Watson Lou Duva Laura Ingalls Wilder Gundam Daredevil Muay Thai Lennox Lewis Joe Frazier Humphrey Bogart Street Fighter Alpha Leon Spinks Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Notable lines in the Star Wars series King of Fighters Cus D'Amato Fight Club Evander Holyfield Martial art Meat Loaf Jack Johnson (boxer) Computer and video game genres Fighter aircraft Street Fighter (film) U.S. invasion of Afghanistan Vegeta Jack Dempsey YuYu Hakusho George Foreman Bon Jovi Chris Eubank W.
