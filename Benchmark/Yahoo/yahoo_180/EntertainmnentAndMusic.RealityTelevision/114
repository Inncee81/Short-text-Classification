omg it was so sad when emon was crying yesterday in indian idol did you guys think that deepali should have got voted out of indian idol why or why not please don't be mean i think wht was done with deepali was not right as a singer but right as for her attitude cuz in her interview she said that she was best singer from all other and she thought that ankita or puja were going to be out she also told ankita that she doesn't sing good or in simple words that she sings besura because of her performance and u have seen that episode that means she think that she is good and can say anything to anyone the second reason is that i think she told ankita that she doen't sing good cuz of her performance was cuz she was jealous of ankita performing so good but as a goood singer she souldn't hv been out Jon Secada A Hard Day's Night (song) American Idol Late Night with Conan O'Brien The Ashlee Simpson Show Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult Fantasia Barrino Journey (band) Johnny Cash Friends Time Out of Mind Popstars Live Kurt Cobain Ganesha Guy Sebastian Music of Bangladesh Janet Jackson The Yeomen of the Guard Elvis Presley Bhajan Durga Cindy Sheehan Vanilla Ninja The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Pop Idol Buddy Guy The Marshall Mathers LP The Jazz Singer Knots Landing Shadow of the Colossus Liam Gallagher Brian Griffin A-ha Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an I Want to Hold Your Hand Pop music Clay Aiken The Young Ones (TV series) Enrique Iglesias Madonna (entertainer) Sinfest Yoko Ono Indian Idol Otello Britney Spears Cantopop Cliff Richard The Smoking Room Teen Girl Squad Lata Mangeshkar Recurring South Park characters The Girl Can't Help It Good Morning, Vietnam Alla Pugacheva Teen idol Filmi Phoebe Buffay's songs Shaggy dog story Hangul Andy Kaufman Cover version Kodocha Australian Idol Tom Jones (singer) Singlish Music of Iran Puja Karaoke The Miracles Ultra Maniac Hey Jude John Lennon Michael Jackson Slow Train Coming Free Me Paul Anka Carpenters Jealous Guy Infidels Eric Cartman Bollywood Meat Loaf Bihar Western (genre) Japanese idol Boyz II Men Kyle Broflovski Karaoke Revolution Paul McCartney Hilary Duff Daria Another Side of Bob Dylan The Strangerhood Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story!
