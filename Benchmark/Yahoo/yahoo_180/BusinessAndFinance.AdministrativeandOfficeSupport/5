will i eventually take over or is this just another bull job i accepted a job at a local dealership as an accountant the pay is to start i have to work monday thru friday every other saturday when i interviewed with the current controller her boss they explained that i would eventually take over the current controller's position however i have been there two weeks i have ascertained that the current controller is a total control freak she has wanted me to do deposits book deals etc basically the stuff the clerk does she refuses to show me anything she does on a daily basis now i realize i have been there only two weeks but i have worked for a dealership before doing the same thing she also set up the accounting system it must be followed exactly as she has it she lets me know daily mistakes i have made i really do not think this lady will leave if she does is she going to give me autonomy or micro manage me i think the job gives her purpose also did i mention she is the gf of the owner advice you should definitely stick it out a little longer if you do things exactly the way that she is training you to do them she may feel more comfortable with allowing you to take over two weeks is not enough time to decide whether she has plans of leaving or not you should at least give it three months Gregorian calendar Nintendo EastEnders The Drew Carey Show Wheel of Fortune United Kingdom corporation tax The Apprentice 2 Big Brother (Australian TV series) New York Giants Sin City Ocean's Twelve Sydney Riot of 1879 MTV2 One Tree Hill (TV series) Tris Speaker ITV National Football League Saturday Night Live Operation Market Garden Education in the People's Republic of China Knots Landing Alex Ferguson Extreme Programming Stone Cold Steve Austin Michael Garibaldi Social rule Cyprus dispute Computer Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus The Colbert Report Spice Girls Sabbath Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina George Costanza Rosa Parks Eric Bischoff Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March IPod Fasting Red Hot Chili Peppers The Daily Show Laura Schlessinger Hebrew calendar Canadian Senate Workplace democracy Friends Evel Knievel Mutual fund Information Technology Infrastructure Library Mad Money The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Reggie Jackson The Critic A Course In Miracles The Daily Telegraph Badly Drawn Kitties Gospel Hurricane Katrina timeline Charmed Hey Jude The Ashlee Simpson Show Air America Radio 2005 United States Grand Prix Dilbert 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Labor theory of value Wal-Mart The Catcher in the Rye Pyramid (game show) History of Doctor Who Paul Wight She Loves You Garfield 2000 Australian Grand Prix The Inside 24 (television) UK Singles Chart Blood on the Tracks Neighbours Oasis (band) Firefly (television series) Alcoholics Anonymous Evan Mecham Edward R.
