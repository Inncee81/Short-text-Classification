what is the best accredited homeschooling program for k not just high school it depends on your definition of best when i think in terms of accredited programs best means the accreditation is a valid and useful one the southern association of colleges and schools means something acme accrediting agency does not and the program meets the needs of my family for example abeka academy as opposed to just using abeka curriculum is an excellent program and their accreditation is accepted just about everywhere but if you are not christian it is not the best program for your family in order to hold an accreditation a program has to be a part of an actual place example abeka only holds an accreditation if you are enrolled in abeka academy you can still use their materials and get the same education without being enrolled in their school but you will not have the accredited transcript or diploma these items are not necessary to have a successful homeschool education but if that is what you want that is how you go about getting them in order to find the best for your family start looking around but remember if a website says their curriculum is accredited and they don't have the option to enroll in an umbrella school meaning your child would be considered an offsite student then it isn't a valid accreditation Homeschooling Education in the United States School accreditation GED Juris Doctor Education in Australia University of Central Florida Law school Patrick Henry College Education in Hong Kong Software engineering Community college High school Florida Institute of Technology California Baptist University Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University Athabasca University University of Houston Paralegal St. John's College, U.
