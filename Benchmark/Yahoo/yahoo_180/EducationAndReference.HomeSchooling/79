school homeschooling how long can a parent home school a child do you feel that this is as satisfactory as what a teacher school would do until they're finished which is to say that until they've reached their educational goals or until they reach a point beyond which they're unable or unwilling to continue for whatever reason since all parent child homeschool relationships are unique and all teacher school situations are different whether one mode would be more or less satisfactory than another would require a case by case analysis having said that a home education approach can offer opportunities that the traditional school cannot match one on one attention and very individualized instruction non didactic approaches to subjects normally taught via lecture and textbook flexibility in scheduling and so forth a parent that chooses to home educate has a greater investment in the individual child's success than the public school teacher does while the school teacher supposedly has been trained specifically to the role of teaching often the homeschool can provide the student child with 'real world' interactions that cannot be achieved in a classroom for example a homeschooled child might be able to attend governmental functions such as legislative sessions city council meetings or even courtroom trials and observe the workings of government first hand where the traditional school's ability to provide such field trips would be significantly less and in some cases non existant research on academic outcomes is inconclusive and suffers from self selection and other biases but typically indicates that for the majority of homeschooled children for which data is available better outcomes for homeschoolers a frequently raised objection to home education is that the child student misses out on important socialization or what might be termed social training or indoctrination that occurs within the traditional school this idea is based on two assumptions that the traditional school provides this type of training in some designed form and that the home education environment does not both of these assumptions are questionable and assuming that they are true begs the question of whether this type of social indoctrination is truly desirable and who decides what the curriculum will be the people who work in the public education establishment tend to overwhelmingly lean toward the political left and will tend to teach those things that are high on their values list the system itself is based on socialist ideals while this is not wrong it doesn't provide a balanced view of the political and social spectrum to the student a home education approach can provide either a more balanced view or it can provide a view tilted to the right wing it will provide the student with the parents' view in most cases this can be either a plus or a minus depending on the extremity of the parents' views and their committment to them Education in the United States Education in the People's Republic of China Waldorf Education Economics Teach the Controversy Infantilism Microeconomics Social psychology Ethics Drama Intelligent design movement Education Education in Portugal GED Law of value Graduate school A Course In Miracles Grade (education) Second language acquisition Separation of church and state Political economy Education in Romania Causality No Child Left Behind Act Coercion Intelligence quotient Education in Germany Strategic management Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Rudolf Steiner Asperger syndrome Danish Folkeskole Education Goodness and value theory Charter school Professor Creation-evolution controversy Academia Education in Taiwan Multilingual Franz Boas Autism Tripartite System Capitalism Education in Hong Kong Education in Austria Single Transferable Vote Model (economics) Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Theodicy Object-oriented programming Gender role Experiential education Transsexuality Culture of the United States Requirements analysis Feminism Anti-intellectualism Objectivist philosophy Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Philosophical skepticism School choice A.
