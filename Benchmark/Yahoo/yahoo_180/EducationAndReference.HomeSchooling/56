what do you look for in a homeschool program what kinds of things make a homeschool program valuable to you do certain things like cooperative classes or playdates determine how interested you are in something what kinds of things will totally turn you off to a program program meaning club group co op event what do you look for in a homeschooling group do you look more for things like classes playdates etc one of the biggest thing i consider when looking for a group is how well it fits our personalities we are not religious and are unschoolers so finding a group where we feel comfortable and free to be ourselves could be challenging we got very lucky when we found our teaching co op it is really great it has a family atmosphere and is fun and relaxed it meets once a week in a church because of the size and the facilities available there but is not a religious co op it also has an impressive array of classes offered each year and the people there are absolutely wonderful i like the fact that if my daughter doesn't want to wear her shoes in class or all day which happens a lot no one minds i like that there are a lot of families there that believe in natural learning i also find that the moms who teach in our co op are very patient and willing to find creative ways to make their classes fun and engaging the kids are all great too we haven't found any even newbies who have had trouble or caused trouble with anyone else there are other co ops local to us but they don't seem to offer what we're looking for one is religious and although that wouldn't keep me from joining in and of itself it's much smaller and doesn't offer much variety the other is a very structured program which might work well for a family that is less relaxed than us they have their prescribed courses for each grade level and that's all there is there is no choice as far as which classes to take so i guess flexibility atmosphere and good personality fit are the biggest factors influencing our interest in a homeschooling group or any group for that matter Homeschooling Education in the United States Theory of conduct Social rule Waldorf Education Alcoholics Anonymous Goodness and value theory Culture of Lithuania Time Out of Mind Bipolar disorder Social psychology A Course In Miracles Reiki Theodicy IBM PC compatible Tai Chi Chuan Prostate cancer Education in Portugal Determinism Religion Ludwig Wittgenstein Predestination Supernatural Graduate school Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Strap-on dildo Summa Theologiae Urinary incontinence Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Pitaten Rudolf Steiner Causality Experiential education Human nature Church of Christ, Scientist Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Ethics Current teachings of Prem Rawat Contract Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution Object-oriented programming Strategic management The nature of God in Western theology Lindy Hop Extreme Programming Futurama (TV series - season 2) Theology King City, Ontario Anderson Cooper Master's degree Meditation W.
