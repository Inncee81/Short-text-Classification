home schooling parents are you finding teaching at home to be pretty much what you had expected before you started or is it fairly different from your expectations in what ways well since i expected homeschooling to be public school at home i have been very pleasantly surprised it takes us just a few hours each day to complete all our lessons not am pm we do much of our work on the couch not at a table we can skip days whenever we need a break not follow a rigid schedule we can have school outside on nice days instead of being cooped up in a classroom we can take vacations while the other kids are in school not with the crowds we can have field trips every month not just twice a year Homeschooling Education in the United States Hey Arnold!
