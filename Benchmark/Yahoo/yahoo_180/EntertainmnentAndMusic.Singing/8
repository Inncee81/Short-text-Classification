i dont know if i have a good voice or not i want to sing and become an actress everyone i ask though doesnt take me seriously i dont know what to do they say oh you'll get over the want in a couple years but thats not true i want to do this what can i do i have the same dreams i can tell you this i just recently started singing but if u have problems with range hum at a really high note because u will be making ur vocal chords stronger it should be high enough so that al you mite hear is air or a squeaky weird noise try this for a couple of mins everyday until u tart to hear a stronger noise or any noise at all this really works iwent two notes higher and lower but do not strees or strain your vocal chords by doin them for too long also get a voice coach and as for acting go to sum acting classes and look in front of the mirror everyday and choose a scene to act out with this u will get better and its true practice makes perfect i agree with the answer b that you should have something to fall back on just in case lol im shure ull do just fine gud luck A Day in the Life Microphone Tonality Inversion (music) 10cc Power chord Singer Operational amplifier Music Headphones Sampling (music) Vowel Explosive material Chord (music) Avenue Q Actor Musical terminology Interval (music) Voice actor Human voice Goldberg Variations Hip hop culture English grammar Time Out of Mind The Ashlee Simpson Show Figured bass Violin Counterpoint Jon Secada Consonance and dissonance Louis Armstrong Vocal range Equine conformation Musical mode Atomic Kitten Divorce Lostprophets Radar Transformer Whale song Loudspeaker Stuttering Saxophone Oral sex Swept wing Whose Line Is It Anyway?
