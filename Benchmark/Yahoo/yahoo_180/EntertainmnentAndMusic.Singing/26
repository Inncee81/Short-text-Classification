how can i improve my vocal range i am years old and cant go very high while singing and sound good when i sing lower notes like middle c i sound amazing but just a few notes above and i cant reach it with a good voice i sound kind like hannah montana at the lower notes and i love it but i sing all of her songs right anyone have any ideas those who diss hannah montana i will ignore cuz she is my fave singer in the whole world o and im also kinda shy so i dont really let a bunch of people hear my voice but it will probably get better the shy thing through high school soo vocal teachers are out at the time you have to really practice and it's all about heart you can sing like an angel but if you are'nt enjoying it or are nervous it can make a huge difference i set aside time where i go in my room shut the door and find a song i like and i'll learn it and then sing it about times but don't be discouraged you can improve your voice it just takes time Jon Secada The Emancipation of Mimi Time Out of Mind Shaggy dog story Slow Train Coming The Isley Brothers Blood on the Tracks Singer The Ashlee Simpson Show Roxette Empire Burlesque The Doors Blonde on Blonde Infidels Harry Nilsson Bonnie Tyler Rod Stewart Patti LaBelle The Four Tops The Jazz Singer Minnie Riperton Sacred Harp Highway 61 Revisited Human voice Rich Mullins Songwriter Charly Garc__a Shot of Love A-ha Singing Ray Charles Dolly Parton Stuttering C__line Dion Bohemian Rhapsody Christina Aguilera Bee Gees The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Louis Armstrong 10cc Nashville Skyline Karaoke Roy Orbison Anne Murray Street-Legal Journey (band) Emotions (album) Autobiography (Ashlee Simpson album) Usher (entertainer) A Hard Day's Night (song) The Marshall Mathers LP Phil Collins Country music Music of Ireland Avenue Q Caedmon's Call The McGuire Sisters Mariah Carey Past teachings of Prem Rawat Authentic performance Love and Theft Paul McCartney Luther Vandross Cyndi Lauper Vocal range Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Great Teacher Onizuka Johnny Cash The Band Social rule The Wall Please Please Me Daryl Hall I Want to Hold Your Hand Boyz II Men Faye Wong Hey Jude Bing Crosby I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Vocal weight Gothic metal Aerosmith Brandy (entertainer) Blackfoot music Ja Rule Carmen The Pet Sounds Sessions Olivia Newton-John Hall & Oates Christian Death Laura Branigan Desire (album) Pet Shop Boys Video game music Donovan Loudspeaker Music Jewish music Garth Brooks
