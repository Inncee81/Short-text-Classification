what are the best tools to learn about the stock market for a year old well i been into the stock market since th grade and watch csbn almost everyday and read about the business world a lot but i still don't get the stock market for example how are do they get those figures on the graphs i know it's a representation for the company but not the company itself so how are these numbers made is it somebody's job to make the graphs of a company go up and down or what i don't want to follow somebody i want to know why they make thoses investments and actually understand what's going on not follow pepole around in the dark for example how are do they get those figures on the graphs if i get you right you want to know why stock price goes up and down right the stock price movement is depend on the demand and supply of that particular stock if more demand investors want to buy that stock than supply investors that are willing to dispose their stocks the stock price will increase and vice versa for illustration demand but supply stock price will go up demand but supply stock price will go down demand and supply stock price remain the same so what make up demand and supply it depends on the investors themselves if they 'feel' the stock is going to be having more profits they are willing to pay a bit more premium to own it but if they 'feel' the stock is going to go down they want to dispose their holding asap i know it's a representation for the company but not the company itself so how are these numbers made again if i get you right you want to know that the stock price movement has nothing to do with the stocks day to day operational results right and yes you are right as my statement before investors' demand and supply that chart the graphs not the company itself it is not like you buy a pair of levis today and the stock increase in the same day but again depend on investors' day to day 'perception' on that particular stock i hope that i answer your concern clearly but if not i am very sorry happy investing have a nice day Supply and demand Mutual fund PE ratio Microeconomics Bond Gold as an investment Warren Buffett Technical analysis Stock market Dot-com Day trading Investment bank Economics Oil price increases of 2004 and 2005 Philatelic investment Capital accumulation Financial markets Temasek Holdings Privatization Surplus value Sears Holdings Corporation Modern portfolio theory Say's law Airline Corporate governance Short selling Mergers and acquisitions United Kingdom corporation tax Keynesian economics Foreign exchange market Finance Hedge fund Deflation (economics) Free trade Citigroup Margin (finance) Monetary policy Income trust Annuity Corporate finance Arbitrage Dividend Hedge (finance) J Sainsbury Closed-end fund Externality Enron Corporation Inflation Labour economics Security (finance) Wall Street Crash of 1929 Economy of Chile Mad Money Asian financial crisis Tariff Gross domestic product American International Group Great Depression Supply-side economics Hyperinflation Economic relations of Japan Tesco Mikhail Khodorkovsky Monopoly Insurance Lloyd's of London Exchange-traded fund Air New Zealand 1973 oil crisis Natural monopoly Derivative (finance) Debt Wal-Mart Insider trading Lehman Brothers Behavioral finance Berkshire Hathaway Just In Time Fixed income Free market American individualist anarchism Conglomerate (company) Ford Motor Company Microsoft Stock market index Economy of India Dow Jones Industrial Average Capital asset pricing model Arbitrage pricing theory Law of value Economy of Russia Eircom
