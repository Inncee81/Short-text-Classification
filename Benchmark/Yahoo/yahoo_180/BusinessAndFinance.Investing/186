little help figuring out stock prices i understand the basics on stock prices however what i dont understand is how a stock can close one day at say but the second the market reopens you will see the stock at how you would think it would have to move up to that price not just open at that price also i was looking at after hours quote for lend and the price is however the ask price is does that the stock will move up on monday morning durning the market stock prices can open much higher or lower than the prevous close because of an imbalance of supply and demand if some news occurs ater the prerious day's close for instance news comes out that a company that had a closing price of per share is the object of a takeover bid at a share then there will be huge demand for that stock at the open and it will rapidly run up or the news could be bad for example after the market close news comes out that federal authorities are investigating the company for making false reports the stock could easily open at lower than it closed technically the higher opening is called a gap up and the lower opening is called a gap down also you should ignore bid ask spreads after the close they mean nothing Arbitrage Day trading Deflation (economics) Foreign exchange market Technical analysis Mutual fund Monetary policy Natural monopoly PE ratio Stock market Economy of Russia Enron Corporation Supply and demand Citigroup Bretton Woods system Tesco Capital accumulation Wall Street Crash of 1929 Gold standard Short selling Microeconomics Economics Asian financial crisis Efficient market hypothesis Supply-side economics Sears Holdings Corporation Yield curve Money supply Wal-Mart Money Takeover Equity investment Airline Keynesian economics Bond Microsoft September 11, 2001 attacks timeline for September New York Stock Exchange NASDAQ Law of value Inflation Stock market index Labour economics Insider trading Exchange value Mikhail Khodorkovsky Closed-end fund Eircom Gold as an investment Solar cell Initial public offering Hurricane Rita Monopoly (game) Central bank Dow Theory United Kingdom corporation tax Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Financial markets Bank of America Malcolm Glazer takeover of Manchester United Hyperinflation Rupert Murdoch New Deal Mergers and acquisitions Surplus value Corporation Oil price increases of 2004 and 2005 Education in the People's Republic of China MMORPG Stock exchange Privatization Auction Shrimp farm Temasek Holdings Tariff Federal Reserve MG Rover Group Insurance Hard disk Action potential 1973 oil crisis Wells Fargo CNBC Labor theory of value Progressive tax Market capitalization Price discrimination Monopoly Video game crash of 1983 Photography Economy of Nigeria Dot-com __lectricit__ de France Balassa-Samuelson effect Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Neoclassical economics Commodity Economy of India
