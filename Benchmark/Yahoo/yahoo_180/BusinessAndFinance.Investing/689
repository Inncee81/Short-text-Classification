is it illegal to try to manipulate a certain stock here is my example a guy who is in charge of the news lets say fox gathers people who have totalled up how much money they have spent at starbucks over an entire year he decides to short the stock before the news goes out and has they people showing spent on starbucks or then someone comes up and shows them a machine that could have of the costs this is just an example that is public information lets say i spend a year on starbucks these guys on camera catch me saying that and the guys behind the cmera short before it displays most importantly your example is using public information and the information is not from the company itself or any major suppliers or buyers i have no idea why someone would short a stock based on the individual information you provided but in that specific case it is not illegal if the information were material and non public it would be very illegal Enron Corporation Insider trading Stock market Mutual fund Labour economics Microeconomics Stock Computer Starbucks Fox Broadcasting Company Tax Financial markets Google Internet fraud Economics Coffeehouse Corporation Day trading Financial services Supply and demand Oil-for-Food Programme Capitalism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Illegal drug trade Automatic number plate recognition Mad Money Television in the United States Dot-com Information Services Procurement Library Privacy Windows XP Consensual crime Family Guy Monopoly Publicly funded medicine Corporate finance Coffee Wall Street (movie) Software patent debate Spyware Short selling Ernst Z__ndel Arbitrage Insurance Asian financial crisis Octopus card Consensus decision-making Pornography Natural monopoly Apple Macintosh Baseball Linux East Germany Option Trade Mergers and acquisitions Real estate broker X Window System Digital rights management Road-rule enforcement camera 2003 California recall Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels No Child Left Behind Act Ocean's Twelve Advertising Bank Berkshire Hathaway Copyright Science Bank fraud SCO-Linux controversies Live 8 Plame affair Stock market index Al Jazeera Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission Security (finance) Closed-circuit television Microsoft Atari ST Teletext Motion picture rating system Inventory Big Brother (USA TV series) Barry Bonds Economic calculation problem Corporate governance Atari 8-bit family Rupert Murdoch Labor theory of value Auto racing FairTax Bond Capital (economics) National Weather Service Social Security debate (United States) Credit card Graphical user interface Unlawful combatant
