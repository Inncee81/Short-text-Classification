why is fxi constantly going down what is the problem with this chinese etf i've heard there are concerns about china but what are they about somebody tell me what's wrong with this etf and whether i should just sell it now i bought it at i made a mistake i bought it at you had to know when you bought it that you were buying a very risky investment right let's see this etf is a single country emerging markets fund it's exposed to the dangers of a specific market it's going to suffer every downturn and china is an emerging market and communist to boot and is subject to far more severe economic political sector and company risks than most developed markets you had to consider that before you bought this fund right please say yes also this etf holds far fewer names and focuses on fewer sectors than its peers do that means more issue specific and sector risk this fund also favors the stocks that shorter term china investors rush out of when things go bad as well as the first ones such investors jump into when times are good was that you i could go on but bottom line this is a really volitile stock expect big highs and lows if you have done your due diligence you will only be holding a small bit of this stock in your overall asset allocation so hold on to it and even if it completely tanks you should have plenty of other stuff to balance out the loss until it climbs back up hopefully this is a good example of why i don't buy stocks i saw too many people get wiped out by trying to chase big tech returns a few years ago now it looks like china may be next Mutual fund Hedge fund Exchange-traded fund Gold as an investment Capital accumulation Finance Capitalism Mergers and acquisitions Capital asset pricing model Investment bank Debt Temasek Holdings Stock market Bank Institutional fund management Arbitrage Eugene Fama Closed-end fund Venture capital Modern portfolio theory Economy of Russia Monetary policy Short selling Free trade Political economy PE ratio Deflation (economics) Stock market index Corporation Stock Social Security debate (United States) Financial services Economics Keynesian economics Privatization Income trust Microeconomics Technical analysis Annuity Day trading Corporate finance Financial markets Health insurance Enron Corporation Economy of Nigeria Behavioral finance Gross domestic product Insurance Oil price increases of 2004 and 2005 Passive management Wal-Mart Bretton Woods system Hyperinflation Derivative (finance) Long-Term Capital Management Mortgage Security (finance) Citigroup Economy of Africa History of the People's Republic of China (4/4) Intellectual property Economy of Europe Surplus value Microcredit Bank of China (Hong Kong) Asset Economy of India Free market Economy of the Czech Republic Supply-side economics Lloyd's of London Wall Street Crash of 1929 Risk Socialist economics Dot-com Collateralized debt obligation Economy of Chile Philatelic investment Bank fraud Mad Money Law of value Money supply Common Agricultural Policy Economy of the United States Berkshire Hathaway Life insurance Nuclear power Strategic management Warren Buffett Trademark
