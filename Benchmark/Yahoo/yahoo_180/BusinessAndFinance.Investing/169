regarding the world financial group my friend said if i put my money in insurance they will invest it in mutual funds even losing money they will still pay me percent of interest my original money is this possible that means i wont losing money even the price of mutual fund i invest in is falling or is this a lie wikipedia says wfg requires an initial deposit of only to gain access to their actively managed funds what does that mean isn't just paying the dollar back ground check to start out or initiallly havng to put in the account sincerely do heavy research on this subject my family has purchased wfg's insurance product services which they call vul the only reason they're promoting this product is because those agents get paid high commission for it my family is being tied down by vul which is the insurance product they're trying to sell you those agents will tell you that you should expect a return of percent or higher a year but the fact is the return is more like percent a year which is worse than having your money in a bank account you can't withdraw your money and they require you to borrow your money from your account for percent interest rate it's your money and you have to borrow it my mom has been paying for vul for the past years she puts in there a month right now there's in her account how you like that for an investment Mutual fund Bank Variable universal life insurance Bond Citigroup Life insurance Annuity Inflation Finance Mortgage Bretton Woods system Social Security (United States) Stock American International Group Financial services Hyperinflation Financial markets Economy of Russia Capital accumulation Monetary policy Savings and loan association Asian financial crisis Hedge fund Goldman Sachs Short selling Money supply Economy of Pakistan Warren Buffett Credit card Microcredit Gold standard Money creation FairTax Security (finance) Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Gross domestic product 401(k) PE ratio Certificate of deposit Yield curve Euro Primerica Financial Services Islamic banking Federal Reserve United Kingdom corporation tax Money Capitalism Lloyd's of London Temasek Holdings Economy of India Individual Savings Account Gold as an investment Contract Privatization Derivative (finance) Reaganomics Economy of the United States Government debt Economic relations of Japan Tax Keynesian economics Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Divorce Debt Advance fee fraud Say's law Mergers and acquisitions Stock broker Wells Fargo Publicly funded medicine Credit union Institutional fund management Anarchism and capitalism Economy of Japan New Deal Universal life insurance Income trust Economic history of Japan Predatory lending Personal finance Toronto-Dominion Bank Economic history of communist Czechoslovakia Corporate finance Margin (finance) Economy of Chile Unemployment Collateralized debt obligation
