question about bonds i have owned bonds before and always held them to maturity there is one part about bonds though where i always struggle with say for instance when a bond is issued yielding and interest rates go to does the bond price go higher or lower i know this is a silly question but somehow my brain does not get this bond prices move in the opposite direction of yield rate this is only something you need to worry about if you plan to sell the bond before it matures first there are two types of bonds government bonds are purchased at a par price a double e bond sells for and at maturity it is worth if you redeem it in between you get somewhere between and corporate bonds are generally bought at face value and the owner receives payments until maturity and it is then redeemed for face value these are the ones you buy sell or trade let's say the going yield today is and company xyz issues bonds at face value and you buy one for a year you collect interest payments of a month x then you want to sell if the current interest rate is up to a bond buyer can either buy your bond paying a month and will only pay for years or a new bond that pays a month for years obviously you would need to offer the buyer a discount for your bond if interest rates go down the opposite is true just remember opposite direction interest to price it does get much more complicated when you figure in bond rating and other factors Treasury security Mutual fund Rational pricing Life insurance Security (finance) Futures contract Arbitrage Yield curve Municipal bond Mortgage Stock Monetary policy Tax Zero coupon bond Dividend Microeconomics Insurance U.S. public debt Capitalism Debt Gold standard Fixed income Interest Government National Mortgage Association Price discrimination Finance Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) FairTax Annuity Collateralized mortgage obligation Gross domestic product Supply and demand Bretton Woods system Auction Corporation Economy of Russia PE ratio Credit derivative Islamic banking Government debt High-yield debt Closed-end fund Housing cooperative Mergers and acquisitions Federal Reserve Collateralized debt obligation Social Security (United States) Fractional-reserve banking Deflation (economics) Hyperinflation Anarchism and capitalism Privatization Temasek Holdings Michael Milken Health insurance Ford Motor Company Surplus value Credit default swap Option Inflation Financial markets Publicly funded medicine Interest rate Stock market Airline Wal-Mart Investment bank Citigroup The South Sea Company Taxation in the United States Federal National Mortgage Association American Broadcasting Company Call option Mortgage-backed security Gilts Enron Corporation Bond duration Euro Free trade Subsidy Income trust Put option Measures of national income and output Economics Labor theory of value Liberty Dollar CBS Amway Social Security debate (United States)
