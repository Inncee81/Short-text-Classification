does anyone know about primerica i am not interested in working for them i was approached by a representative they explained that if i turn my mortgage over to them i could save lots of money and invest my savings is this a scam are there hidden clauses that they are not telling me about is this too good to be true their mortgages tend to have a very high interest rate and very high points which they will graciously wrap in to the mortgage for you they will tell you that interest rates do not matter because with their mortgage you make a smaller payment every weeks for years instead of one payment per month for years unfortunately they are wrong interest rates do matter you can pay off your mortgage even faster if you just pay extra principle on your current mortgage lastly their mortgages tend to have a very high early payment fee so when you finally find out that the mortgage wasn't the best deal it is very expensive to refinance out of it Primerica Financial Services Government National Mortgage Association Mortgage Insurance Bond Life insurance FairTax Savings and loan association Personal finance Islamic banking Taxation in the United States Student loan Annual percentage rate Flat tax Bank Mortgage-backed security Collateralized mortgage obligation Treasury security Security (finance) Annuity Deflation (economics) Economy of the United States 401(k) Citigroup Intellectual property Keynesian economics United Kingdom corporation tax Ponzi scheme Supply-side economics Mutual fund Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Advance fee fraud Interest Charles Ponzi Confidence trick Money Credit card The Man Who Wasn't There Derivative (finance) Federal National Mortgage Association Refinancing Internet fraud Donald Trump Predatory lending Financial markets Social Security (United States) Saving (economics) Real estate bubble Microeconomics Inflation Federal Reserve Municipal bond Anarchism and capitalism Interest rate Social Security debate (United States) Capitalism PE ratio Schabir Shaik Trial Subsidy Corporate finance Economy of Russia Bretton Woods system Free trade CPU cache History of the United States (1918-1945) Government debt Allodial title Great Depression Publicly funded medicine Debt consolidation National Australia Bank Mergers and acquisitions Yield curve Los Angeles Clippers String theory Reaganomics Theory of conduct Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Public domain Bank fraud Joseph Smith, Jr. Thomas de Littleton Measures of national income and output Tuition Hyperinflation Pound sterling Unemployment Oakland Athletics Islamic economics Housing cooperative Fixed income Tax Surplus value Unemployment benefit Labor theory of value Grand Theft Auto (game) Monetary policy Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002)
