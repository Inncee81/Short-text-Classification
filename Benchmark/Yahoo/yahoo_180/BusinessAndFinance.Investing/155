what do you think about rolling over b the before or after tax status determines whether or not the money is eligible to be rolled over to a particular account most of the before tax accounts can be rolled into each other for example if you had a b previously and now have a k you can legally roll the money over to your new job's plan and vise versa and of course b money can be rolled into another b however this does not mean your new employer is required to accept the rollover many times it is the rules of your employer's plan that create problems for rollovers not rules set by the irs some employer plans will not accept rollover money or create such a hassle that you regret doing so ah but fear not there is a type of account called a rollover ira which is considered the universal recipient for any before tax money actually a rollover ira is a type of traditional ira we just give it this fancy name to denote what most people use it for the drawback is that you cannot contribute new money to a rollover ira however you can consolidate all your before tax accounts from previous employers into one rollover ira with almost any investment firm you now have free reign over how you retirement money is invested you are no longer bound by the limitations of your former employer's plan and if you become dissatisfied with your rollover ira guess what you can roll that to another rollover ira with another investment firm just keep rolling and you pay no taxes your former employer's plan may have restrictions about which accounts you can roll the money into for example it may not allow a direct rollover to another b even if the irs permits it however the law requires that all employer sponsored retirement accounts allow former employees the option to directly rollover their money to a rollover ira of the employee's choosing your past employer may suggest certain firms to roll over into but you can choose whatever firm you want you might need to do all the paperwork yourself but at least you can choose there are two ways to perform a rollover the first is called an indirect rollover with this you receive the check in your name and then send this money to your rollover ira provider you have days to do this or it counts as a distribution and you pay the taxes and penalties the old account provider must withhold of your money for tax purposes should you fail to complete the rollover you have to pony up that missing out of your own pocket and put it towards the rollover or that will count as a distribution the much better option is to use a direct rollover with direct rollovers the provider of your old account sends the check directly to the provider of your new account the check is made out to the trustee for the new provider with direct rollovers you never see the check and are not subject to the day rule or the mandatory withholding if something goes wrong with the transfer the money remains with the old account and you can try again yes it's frustrating if this happens but at least you don't run the risk of incurring a taxable distribution keep in mind that direct rollovers are not always smooth mine took months you may need to moderate the process by making calls to both providers some providers hassle you because they don't want to give up your money despite any hassles a direct rollover is far better than taking all your money as a taxable distribution i highly recommend rolling your money from past employer accounts into a rollover ira or your current employer's plan do not let that money sit with your old employer in order to release that money you will need approval from human resources this could be tricky if you left years ago human resources at your old job may look at your paper work and say who is this to avoid hassles down the road please rollover money soon after you sever employment just think once you get money into a rollover ira you no longer need human resource's permission for the love of all that is holy do not take a lump sum distribution from your old employer's retirement account no matter how old or drunk you are this counts as income which is taxable if the sum is large enough it could actually throw you into the tax bracket plus if you are under age you get an additional tax penalty you could wind up paying almost of your distribution to the tax man never to be seen again the ideal process is to never take a lump sum distribution even while in retirement withdraw only what you need so that you only pay taxes on that don't take lump sum distributions when you leave you job roll over that money instead preferably with a direct rollover Taxation in the United States Life insurance Tax Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 Mutual fund Constitution of the
