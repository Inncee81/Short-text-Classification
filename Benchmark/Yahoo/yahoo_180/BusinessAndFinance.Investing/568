does your success at the stock market depend on how well the business you invest in does i heard one person explain that the worse your company does the more money you make is this true or is it the other way around it depends what decisions you make if you buy the stock then obviously you'll make money if the company does well if you sell short then you'll make money while the company falls apart yes this is possible you can make money both ways you just have to know which way the stock is going to go first you have to decide whether the company will be successful or failure if you think it will be a success then buy it if you think it will be a failure then sell short or buy put options selling short and trading options is riskier than just buying the stock but if you understand what you're doing the rewards can be quicker and greater someone asked earlier what is short selling and how does it work you may want to read my answer http answers yahoo com question index ylt arowo ghbwp e uw vcll bty ix qid aaf plh show profile info aa some people buy the stock and buy insurance the insurance is a put option the put option is like a bet or a lottery ticket it can become extremely valuable if the stock goes down but it expires worthless if the stock goes up so if your stock goes up you paid for the insurance and you didn't need it but if your stock goes down and you lose money then your ticket is a winner and you win a lot of money if you did everything right then the amount of money you win is more than the amount you lost in the stock so it doesn't matter which way the stock goes if it goes up you make money if it goes down you make money now if you don't buy the stock but you buy the put option then what happens if the stock goes up the option is worthless if the stock goes down within a certain time then you can sell the put option and make a lot of money you make money only if the stock goes down if the stock goes up you lose the amount of money you paid for the insurance so the worse the company does the more money you make note buying put options insurance and selling short are two totally different things Option Derivative (finance) Annuity Bond Insurance Microeconomics Blackjack Poker jargon PE ratio Mutual fund Stock Gambling Stock market Security (finance) Dot-com Warren Buffett Citigroup Capitalism Contract Arbitrage Finance Lottery Corporation Day trading Internet fraud Wheel of Fortune Capital accumulation Fixed income Mad Money Economics Put option Financial markets Taxation in the United States Option style Short selling Labor theory of value The Amazing Race Theory of conduct Hyperinflation Enron Corporation Privatization Investment bank Betting (poker) Surplus value Hedge fund Corporate finance Employee stock option Gold as an investment Call option American International Group Monopoly (game) Confidence trick Incentive Labour economics Margin (finance) $ale of the Century 401(k) Income trust Health insurance Auto insurance Say's law Money Philatelic investment Donald Trump Sears Holdings Corporation Wal-Mart Deflation (economics) Make money fast Animal Crossing Institutional fund management Harken Energy Scandal Microsoft Dow Jones Industrial Average Craps Ra (board game) Monetary policy Halliburton Rational pricing Asian financial crisis Bank fraud Black-Scholes Publicly funded medicine Great Depression Baccarat Risk management Prediction market Air New Zealand Political economy Wall Street Crash of 1929 Mergers and acquisitions
