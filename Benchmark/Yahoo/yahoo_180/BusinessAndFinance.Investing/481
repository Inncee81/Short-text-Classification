when trading stocks what's the benefit of a stop limit order over a limit order if a stop order trades at a trigger price and a limit order trades at a trigger price what's the benifit of a stop limit order let me explain in layman's terms both limit order and stop limit order are the same stop order and stop limit order are different i'll assume you mean the latter stop order is a market order meaning that the stock will be bought or sold at the current market price this order will be executed when the price is reached stop limit buy limit sell limit are triggered at the price you want the key difference is that limit orders are limit price or better for instance if you set a buy limit at the order will trigger at and a trade at or below would execute the order limit orders have the potential of not being filled because the price could jump around so much i e triggered at but then jumps to above and stays there your order would not be filled because the or better has not been reached hope this helps ron chfc Short selling Stock market Arbitrage Supply and demand Gross domestic product Investment bank Bond Stock Technical analysis Margin (finance) Economics Insurance Day trading Mutual fund Monetary policy The South Sea Company Euro Option Hedge fund Wal-Mart Free trade Warren Buffett Microeconomics Black-Scholes Economic calculation problem Enron Corporation Monopoly (game) Sears Holdings Corporation New York Stock Exchange Labor theory of value Economic growth Foreign exchange market Dot-com Trade Political economy PE ratio Asian financial crisis Commodity Oil price increases of 2004 and 2005 Deflation (economics) Life insurance Closed-end fund Rational pricing Marketing Capitalism Stock broker Long-Term Capital Management Mergers and acquisitions Insider trading Free market Annuity Corporation Bretton Woods system Financial markets Capital accumulation Anarchism and capitalism Common Agricultural Policy Beretta 92F/FS Monopoly Ra (board game) Commodity markets United Kingdom corporation tax Wall Street Crash of 1929 Citigroup First-sale doctrine Gold standard Eircom Surplus value Employee stock option Emergence Auction Video game crash of 1983 Computer virus Tesco Publicly funded medicine Exchange value Joseph P.
