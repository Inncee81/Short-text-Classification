does investment advisor in authorized banks really helpful for investment i noticed that there are some investment adviser in banks like wells fargo bank of america etc they manage your money and take commission more than you pay i also see that they really showed some good profit what do you think for mid term can he play our investment above capital i suggest you be very careful before committing any funds to such people the investment advisors are nothing more than bank employees trying to sell you a bank mutual fund they are no much better than an ordinary teller they are just salespeople of course they will show good profit from their marketing literature do you really expect them to produce brochures showing a loss or poor returns go to a website like morningstar com to check up on their real performance then if you still like them check up on their management fees b fees etc only after you have done your homework on your own should you consider investing with them Mutual fund Stock Warren Buffett PE ratio Dividend Short selling Bond Investment bank Mergers and acquisitions Corporate finance Finance Corporation Insurance Derivative (finance) Annuity Stock market Financial markets Temasek Holdings Financial services Dot-com Margin (finance) Sears Holdings Corporation Capital accumulation Citigroup Security (finance) Arbitrage Hedge fund Donald Trump Berkshire Hathaway Cost of capital Income trust Rational pricing Stock exchange American International Group Venture capital Foreign exchange market Financial analyst Ford Motor Company Anarchism and capitalism Enron Corporation Day trading Deflation (economics) Mad Money Gold as an investment Technical analysis Income statement Islamic banking Personal finance Exchange-traded fund Microeconomics Eugene Fama Life insurance Lloyd's of London Microsoft Mortgage Individual Savings Account Equity investment Conglomerate (company) Privatization Asian financial crisis United Kingdom corporation tax Social Security debate (United States) Economic rent Profit Lehman Brothers Mikhail Khodorkovsky NASDAQ Fixed income Joseph P.
