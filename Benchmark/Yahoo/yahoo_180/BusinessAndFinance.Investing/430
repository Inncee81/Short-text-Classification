what do you think about the stock market plunge today when the market plunges it is scary fear takes over and eveyone starts selling and it just feeds on itself usually there is too much fear and people over react when you invest you have to understand there will be days like this and sometimes it takes months or years to get back to normal understanding this doesn't make it much less scary you should split your investments between a variety of stocks bonds and money market funds and not have money you will need within or years in the market if you do this it will still be scary but it won't affect your day to day living or short term plans finally if you are investing for the long term you want to buy when the market is low and sell high so a plunge like today is really a buying opportunity it would probably make sense to think about investing a little bit more than usual at this time that is the hardest thing to do we all feel confident when the market has been going up and then freeze or panic when it goes down actually we should be taking some profits when the market goes up and buy when it goes down because the shares are on sale this is all logic i know what to do and how to look at it but it is still very unsettling i try not to look at my investments at times like these since it might make me do something stupid Mutual fund Short selling Gross domestic product Asian financial crisis Bond Stock market Gold as an investment PE ratio Economy of Russia Finance Arbitrage Security (finance) Hedge fund Wall Street Crash of 1929 Mergers and acquisitions Stock Life insurance Warren Buffett Annuity Monetary policy Deflation (economics) Keynesian economics Temasek Holdings Financial markets Institutional fund management Citigroup Dot-com Capital accumulation Day trading Asset Hyperinflation Debt Enron Corporation Microeconomics Capitalism Federal Reserve Financial services Economics MMORPG Privatization Yield curve Long-Term Capital Management Insurance Poker jargon James J.
