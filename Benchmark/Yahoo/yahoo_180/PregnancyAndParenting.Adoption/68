do i call you mommy quick update i will be getting my cousin a little sooner instead of the th she will be here monday this is because school starts the next monday and we don't want her to start already behind anyway when i talked to her last night and told her the good news she was super excited and started asking all kinds of questions like will i have my own room and what time do i have to go to bed which are all simple enough but there was one that got me she asked do i call you mommy and i was not sure what to say i told her she can if she wants but she does not have to question for those of you who have adopted older kids do they call you mommy how about those of you raising family members do they call you the actual relation you are or mommy if she does decide to call me mommy will i need to explain to her teachers and such why my daughter is only years younger than me how do i do this with out constantly refering to her as adopted she does know i am her cousin through her father and my mother being brother and sister she also knows her bio mom and dad she was when she went in foster care her bio mom left when she was but she has a picture and small memories she is and i am i think that she can call you mommy if that is what is comfortable for her but another suggestion is to call you by your given name or find another special name for you like a pet name or nickname a lot of it depends on the information and access you plan to give her about and to her biological parents as she gets older and as far as explaining the relationship to teachers etc it's not their concern i am sure you will have to give some kind of documentation to the school proving guardianship but that will be in her file and should be sufficient if someone says something to you about it politely tell them thank you for their concern or interest but what does this have to do with her education or flat out tell them i am her provider her guardian or her mom if thats what she decices to call you that should be enough said and if they say something about the age gap tell them you just look remarkable for your age best of luck to you and she and congratulations About a Boy The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy EastEnders Family Terri Schiavo Adoption Plame affair Kodocha Garfield Neighbours The Adventures of Pete & Pete The Fairly OddParents W.I.T.C.H.
