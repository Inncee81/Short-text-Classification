how to deal with your sister giving a child up for adoption i am so happy that my sister gave her baby up for adoption the problem is is that my family is still attached to the child and still call the baby theirs meanwhile their only grandson my son is put on the back burner for this baby that isn't even theirs anymore i am frustrated and doen right pissed off because my son is put second even my grandmother will not see my son but made a huge deal about seeing the other baby i was not near the family when all of this went down i have meet the child and do not feel any conection with him because i feel that he has been given to a great wonderful family and that he is now not a part of our family my husband is also adopted and i would never consider his birth mother to be an actually part of the family don't get me wrong we are very grateful to her but thats as far as it goes how can i convey this to my family in a tactful manner it's an open adoption and it has been months and nothing has gotten better the adopting family have had to cut contact with my mom and sister who is because they want to go see him all the time they have seen him about times i am actually my grandmas favorite grandchild because in her eyes i do everything right i will let her think that lol but i think that she won' t see him because she doesn't want to lose another great grandchild actually i didn t adopt and if i did i would tell them of the great and loving sacrifice that their birth mother did for them spoochy you are really mature my husband is the one that has the harder time eith all of this and he is the one that is adopted i don 't think that i would get upset but i see how it is affecting my son and when he asks me why his grandparents always talk about this other child and not him that tends to hit a nerve as you say you weren't there when all of this went down your family members have experienced a real loss and are grieving if your son is around and they actually do something that is hurtful to him talk to them about it but in the meantime try to be supportive especially to your sister this has truly been a traumatic time for her and while you do not feel any connection to this baby your sister and other family members feel a strong one it is not that your son is less important to them it's just that they know they will be able to see him you might say something gentle like i know you are hurting and missing but i wish you could enjoy the grandchild you have right here he misses his time with you Pitaten Kodocha EastEnders Knots Landing Shaggy dog story Family Baby Blues Humphrey Bogart Theory of conduct The Shining (film) Adoption Cindy Sheehan W.I.T.C.H.
