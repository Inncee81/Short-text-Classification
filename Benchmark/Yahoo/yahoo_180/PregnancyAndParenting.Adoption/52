is this normal adoption question about birth mom i am in the process of adopting my step children their bio mom has now moved back and lives in the same very small town we do she threw a fit when she found out we were going to terminate her rights but now she totally ignores the kids it is infuriating to me that she will walk right past them in wal mart and not even acknowledge them is that normal why did she start to fight the adoption she consented when she found out it would do away with her paying support i don't understand and it hurts me to see my kids hurt this way i really don't want her to talk to them but i would never say that to her we even did an open adoption but she has to pass drug tests to see the kids she has never wanted to yesterday she was in the same room with my son for minutes and ignored him totally he has not seen her in over three years and due to drugs she looks quite different but he asked me later if it was her i was so tempted to lie anyone else experience this there is no protective order she would not be violating anything not saying hi how are you my duaghter doesn't know her she has not seen her since she was months old bio mom's choice not ours but my son was almost when she left it does hurt him i wish we could move it would be so much easier but we own our own business that can't really be moved and bought a house weeks before her return i haven't experienced the same thing but i was adopted by my mothers second husband and never looked back i did meet the other side of the family after my real father passed away tho and felt like i missed out on so much of my heritage i would suggest moving away from that town for the sake of the children they don't deserve to go through seeing her kudos to you for being a good mother and loving unconditionally good luck Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Knots Landing Cindy Sheehan Abortion debate Kodocha Ben Johnson (athlete) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) One Tree Hill (TV series) Piccolo Junior Saga Alcoholics Anonymous Miss Saigon Sharon Tate Jiddu Krishnamurti Simone Weil Adoption The Catcher in the Rye Social rule EastEnders Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Rich Mullins About a Boy The Shining (film) Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Kurt Cobain Sin City Ayyavazhi mythology Friends Trinity Milton H.
