anyone have any confusion with the forms to get the adoption process started dh and i were giving a whole folder of information and forms to fill out to get everything rolling but i am confused about the questionair about wanting to be adoptive parents of races different from your own i can't make any since of it it is basicly the same question worded many different ways and it is bit confusing my dh and i really want a human baby no matter what color his her skin or race is has anyone else run into this problem we also are having some confusion about the space where you need to have refrences of thoes who have wittnessed us with children for our ability to parent and it can only be non family members and friends well we have not have any contact with children of any age at our home and we have only been around family when were around a small child and that has been on holidays and speratic family social get togethers what can we do about this dh and i are going through an adoption agency in our area and these questions just came up after we came home from a information meeting with them and started looking through the paper work giving to us by the way being illiterate means you can't read just because i have some typos does not mean i can't spell it is just my typing skills need a little work thats all so don't be so rude ass whole have you been with any friends and their children if so see if those people would give you a reference how about kids at church about the skin color just let them know that you have absolutely no preference about the skin color of the child dh i are as white as you can be we have two bio sons who are also white foster daughter who is white and two adopted daughters who have a beautiful olive complexion it made no difference to us what color their skin was sometimes the girls bring it up but we just try to instill a sense of pride in how they look and where they are originally from people notice that the girls are different we get questions while we're out about we asked the girls they're school age how they wanted us to handle it we could answer they could answer or we could sidestep the question with why do you ask they usually choose to let us answer are proud of being adopted let the agency know that you understand that society may have issues or questions about a difference in skin color and the child may have issues or questions but you'll do all in your power to protect the child from any discrimination and you'll work hard to instill a sense of pride and self worth in the child about who he she is i think the questions are designed to get you thinking about how you might handle it whether or not you can handle it and how healthy your attitude is about it we also get the girls around folks who look like them as often as possible we know several people who are from their birth country some others from the same region plus we belong to a multi cultural adoptive family group Adoption Theory of conduct Infantilism Education Transsexuality Literacy White (people) CPU cache Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Abortion debate Scientology beliefs and practices Japanese name Consensus decision-making Art Black (people) Same-sex marriage The Tale of Genji Goodness and value theory Sexual orientation Religion Family Economic inequality Infant baptism Psychology The nature of God in Western theology Affirmative action Human skin color Extreme Programming Wolfrider Property (ownership right) House of M Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Evil Kender Human Singapore gay equality movement Cultural relativism Asperger syndrome Ethics Race Franz Boas EastEnders Bernard Williams Science Social rule Korean adoptee Skinhead Expert system Physical attractiveness Quizbowl Breastfeeding Atheism Justification (theology) Objectivist philosophy Epistemology Community Negima Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Transactional analysis Leadership Bosniaks Second language acquisition Windows 2000 African American Dyslexia Karen Horney Puberty Childlove movement John Wycliffe Blacks and Mormonism Theodicy Family name Religious Society of Friends Rudolf Hermann Lotze Racism Gender role Socrates Sant Thakar Singh Jean Grey Kodocha Who is a Jew?
