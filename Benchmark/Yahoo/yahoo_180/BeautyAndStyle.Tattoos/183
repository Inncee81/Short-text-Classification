diy tattoos ok seriously dont answer this saying dont give yourself a tattoo wait till your older and pay ect ect my question is when you give yourself a tat what do you do i know about how to make the instrument but i dont know about the ink does that matter and do i just poke a bunch of holes to all the mean comments really thats uncalled for i did it and it came out really great except for a letter but i can go back and fill it in a bit better tonight and to the person saying im gonna f ck up my skin i dont care i used to be a hardcore cutter and i have scars all over so i dont think im gonna mind anything else thanx to the ppl who arent a h les and i didnt do it cuz its hot and cool i did it as a form of expression i have a diy tat on my toe and it looks good i have also givin several friends of mine tats it turns out alright if you take your time i used indian ink that you can get at art supply stores it comes in several colors and last for long time i used a needle that was sterilized and wrapped a piece of string around the end when you put the tip of the needle in the ink the string soaks it up and helps to put it in your skin yes you have to poke one hole at a time and do it that way you might even have to go back and fill in the spots you missed at another time nothing can compare to the work of a skilled tatoo artist but you can do it yourself and make it look good whatever you do make sure you poke the skin and not scratch the needle along the skin Tattoo Scarification Textile manufacturing Jon Secada Jennifer Lopez Body piercing Irezumi Comanche Upholstery Nail (anatomy) Bong Earring Fountain pen Traditional animation Atomic Kitten Piccolo Junior Saga Bassoon The Isley Brothers Drill bit Late Night with Conan O'Brien Suture Violin Tattoo gun Gramophone record RuneScape quests Sinfest The Inside Christmas tree Knitting Zhao Yun Internal ballistics Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME RuneScape Mini-Games I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Manicure Drawing Singlish Hepatitis C A Day in the Life Acupuncture CPU cache The Ashlee Simpson Show Therion (band) Remix Textile manufacturing terminology Tina Turner Jackass: The Movie Intravenous therapy Clothing House of Leaves Jumpstart 3rd Grade Sydney Riot of 1879 Campfire Wolfrider Opportunity rover Gottfried Leibniz Lace-making Billiards Aquemini Aerial (dance move) Vanilla Ninja Music genre Password Tofu Menstrual cup Questionable Content Sterilization (microbiology) Ink M.C.
