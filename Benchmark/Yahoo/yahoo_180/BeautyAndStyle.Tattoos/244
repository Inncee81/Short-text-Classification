have young women getting frequently tattooed ruined the art and culture of tattooing i m all for women s equal right to get tattooed this question has nothing to do with whether or not one thinks it is proper or classy trashy to be tattooed in fact i find tattooing on women to be attractive though that s only one aspect of tattooing and i highly respect women like somebody on here who are very smart about and dedicated to tattooing my question is serious not sexist tattooing in western society has had a culture of it s own and we all know that culture is about meaning what does it mean to be tattooed why do people get tattooed my opinion on the right reasons to get tattooed includes the images being tattooed inspire you the images fuel your imagination a more recent thing in the west love of art and taking that art beyond banal canvases of museums along with this there is something deep about the permanence of it and the fact that it is on skin w blood etc to mark affiliation with a group affiliation with a group makes people feel like they are a part of something larger than themselves a memorial along with these comes a sense of permanence permanence reinforces commitment finally i think tattooing has also been resorted to by marginalized disenfranchised people as a type of property if nothing else in this world at least they have their tattoos which will go with them to their death think for example of sailors who were among the first to popularize getting tattooed during long shipping voyages in crap conditions they could use all the inspiration they got and these people really had no property even the clothes on their backs were often in pawn if they went overboard the one thing they would have is their tattoos also what they look at and dream about during long days away from home now why are trendy people getting tattooed nowadays dangerous factor people thinks it makes them wild or dangerous in some way but guess what it used to be much harder to get tattooed you had to travel or interact with certain dangerous people to do so these people were not polite not there to be nice to you or stand for any of your bullcrap it sickens me how encouraging people are on this site towards people asking should i get this tattoo no tattooing is not meant to be as easy to get even if cheaper than starbucks in the current atmosphere of have a nice day convenience tattooing any associations of danger are actually removed to symbolize something this is such a load of b s yes tattoos do symbolize they indeed mean something but there are many different ways of representing or symbolizing the type of signing that trendy people usually do is not the type of signing common to tattoo culture it would take a long and complicated discussion to explain this you either get it or you don t to memorialize this was the one past traditional tattoo culture motivation for tattooing that the trendy people have harped in on and blown all out of proportion i don t know if it s because they see stuff like miami ink where everyone as instructed to them by the show s producers walks in with some story about how blah blah happened and they need this tattoo of blah blah to represent that trendy people seem to feel the need just to make any mark on their bodies to mark that something happened this shooting star is because my grandma died huh anxiousness to be experienced as teens most of us felt anxious about losing our virginity once you had sex you joined the ranks of the non virgin population the experienced population a similar process seems to be at work with tattooing people are anxious to get marked in any way to join this club but here is the thing joining the club isn t meant to be easy there is inconvenience pain stigma permanence inconvenience pain stigma permanence these are the things that the trendy tattoo people are bent on getting around everything questions on yahoo answers for instance are driven towards avoiding these obstacles but they are the very obstacles that give meaning to being tattooed to being in the club in the absense of this meaning tattoos have become meaningless fashion the trendy people try to add meaning symbolism in real tattoo culture someone is inspired by something so much that they want it permanently put on their body in trendy tattooing people decide first that they need to get tattooed to become part of the cool experiened club to attract people sexually to work out their psychological issues of things like isolation and poor self image and then they try to think up a tattoo usually some banal shape or image inspired by commercial logo ing branding and add to it some stated meaning do i need to go any further in explaining how utterly bankrupt this trendy tattoo culture is trendy men and women are equally guilty of lowering the standards of tattoo culture and turning it into cheap branding but women especially seem significant in this process because of the nature of popular women s culture along with women s historical relationship to the art of tattooing they especially have sought to remove the inconvenience can i pay with my credit card what brand of lotion should i buy how many times a day should i rub it in let me just get a little star here on the spot today let me go online and ask pain where does it hurt least what creams can i use to reduce to numb it stigma stop calling it a tramp stamp i got my tattoos for me they are mine why get it in a place where you can t show it off permanence how much does tattoo removal cost and does it really work notice that the vast majority of people asking tattoo questions on this site are women what do you think this means thanks i wish i could change the title of this question a bit it is hard to articulate succintly i don't really like the sound of women ruining it makes it sound like women of course i only mean certain ones as the agents i think a better way to say it is that tattooing has changed towards accomodating this class of trendy people both sexes but especially to accomodate some of the desires of women who are a relatively new clientele for tattooing i read all of what you have written and i agree with most of your major points i do think tattoos have sort of become a trend and i know exactly what you mean by can i pay with a credit card tattoos are a whole lot easier to get now than they were when sailors were getting them i do think it's rediculous that people get tattoos in an effort to show that it symbolizes something when really they just got it to be cool as far as women sort of changing the idea and culture of tattooing i think this is one of your least valid points yes maybe some things have changed since but isn't that what all cultures do maybe it sucks every little meaning behind tattoo culture maybe it's just changing and you don't want to be put into that group of trendy men and women you keep talking about so in order not to be in it because obviously your reasons for getting inked are so much better you criticize it all i have to say is that my entire family has gotten inked except me grandparents included now they got tattoos when they were hard to get i think tattoos are body art i think the history is awesome i think some tattoos are effing rediculous a playboy bunny what the but overall tattooing is available it is growing in popularity more people want them more women want them women generally take better care of themselves why are you freaking out about the fact that someone asked what kind of lotion to use yes i think you have valid points not every one should get a tattoo but your whole deal about women and trendy tattoos sort of taking away from the culture i think your just whining because you don't want the original hardcore tattoo peeps to be thinking that you got your tattoos to be cool and fit in with the growing popularity of it all hell if you want to be original don't get
