do tattoos hurt how long is the healing time can i still play sports wk after please any advise would be great i'm debating on the decision i am thinking of getting it around my hip area or now my shoulder so any advise you can give would be fantastic thanks the pain varies with location and tolerance both tattoos on my shoulders had a dull sting and hurt more as the guy worked towards the backs of my arms lower back and feet are painful from what i'm told wherever the skin is thin or bones are involved it will hurt more of course tolerance is a factor too my friend at college has a half sleeve from his elbow to shoulder and he says it didn't hurt at all not sure if i believe that but that's not important now as far as healing time it's subjective location may affect that both of mine took a week or two to heal as long as you keep on using vaseline or lotion on it it should heal up in no time as far as sports it should be ok again location may affect performance but i don't think you'll have a problem hope this helps and have fun Diving Professional wrestling holds Equine conformation Aerial (dance move) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Professional wrestling attacks Swimming Decompression sickness Pain Hip fracture Stomach cancer Tattoo Boxing Prostate cancer Massage Swingout Carpal tunnel syndrome Scoliosis Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Archery Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Tai Chi Chuan Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Iliotibial band syndrome Orthopedic surgery Breastfeeding The Shining (film) Blue Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Backstroke Professional wrestling aerial techniques Earring Stress fracture Guinea pig Osteoarthritis Kodocha Childbirth Fibromyalgia Repetitive strain injury Chester Bennington Alexander Technique Softball Shoulder Puberty Weight training Hip hop rivalries Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Leon White Replacement joint Psoriasis Sesshomaru Swimsuit Recumbent bicycle Doom enemies Sauna Sandy Koufax Punch (strike) Rod Stewart Minor Harry Potter Beasts Local anesthesia Reflexology Casualty lifting Chiropractic Diving suit Ninja Scroll Professional wrestling throws Chair Motorcycle Trish Stratus Blood on the Tracks Arm Osteopathy Humerus Meat Loaf Fancy rat Volleyball Nine Inch Nails The Death Gate Cycle Radiation therapy Straitjacket Alcoholics Anonymous George Michael Human anatomy Dyspareunia Herpes simplex virus Kurt Cobain Brassiere Suplex Side Characters (Xenosaga) Internal ballistics Shaggy dog story Angelina Jolie Dualism (philosophy of mind) Healing Factor The Invisibles Characters of Naruto Eczema The Venture Bros.
