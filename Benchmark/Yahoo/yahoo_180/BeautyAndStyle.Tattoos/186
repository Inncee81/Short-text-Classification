i recently got a tattoo on my lower leg and i believe it may be infected please help i got my tattoo done last tuesday july it is a compass star on my right calf above my ankle i have followed all of the aftercare instructions that i was given i wash it twice a day morning and night have used johnson's baby lotion on it because i broke out using a differnet lotion on my last tattoo everything was fine for the first few days but i started noticing what looked like cracks in some places i assumed this was just scabs then tonight after i washed it i noticed one spot where it looked like there was no ink and it looked like there was some pus as i was patting it dry i looked at the paper towel and noticed a little bit of blood too it has since been a few hours and there are spots that seem to be raised almost like bubbles and they are weeping a clear fluid it also hurts pretty bad at times needless to say i am totally freaking out any idea about what could be going on here i hope this is a good enough description thanks when you first got your tattoo did you use any a d ointment heres what my aftercare instructions were keep bandage on for at least one hour no longer than two hours do not re bandage always wash hands before touching fresh tattoo after removing bandage wash tattoo gently with anti bacterial soap and cool water for the first three days lightly apply vitamin a d ointment do not use a lot apply three to four times daily as needed when tattoo begins to feel dry after three to four days switch to an unscented hand lotion with a low alcohol content apply the same way you applied the a d ointment continue to use the hand lotion for the next two to three weeks until tattoo has healed your tattoo will go through a flaking stage much like a sunburn and may itch do not pick or scratch during this stage as it will damage your tattoo other things to avoid suntanning fake sunbed tanning and soaking baths swimming hot tubs my suggestion if it is as bad as you say it is is to go to your local hospital and talk to them merely putting an antibacterical healing aid like neosporin on in probably wont help but if you dont feel it necessary to go to the emergency room then i would just try the neosporin to see if it helps at all best of luck Psoriasis Eczema Manicure Wound Body piercing Sauna Dialysis First aid Menstrual cup Sento Customs and etiquette of Japan First aid kit Sunscreen Textile manufacturing Sunburn Scabies Breastfeeding Fecal incontinence Aloe Common cold Hyperthermia Shaving Conjunctivitis Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Casting Social rule EastEnders Knife Snakebite (bite) Earring Fire fighting Medical prescription 2000 Australian Grand Prix Tocopherol Stomach cancer Massage Acne Ron and Fez Certified Nursing Assistant Towel Bleeding Milton H.
