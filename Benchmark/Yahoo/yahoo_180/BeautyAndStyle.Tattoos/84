tattoo in stomach hip im planning on getting a black and white palm sized tattoo in my hip stomach i know there will be pain involved but i just want to know what to expect is it going to be like getting my tongue pierced except over and over again or is it going to be like a needle scratching the skin or i want to know what it feels like before i get it done lol there is a element of pain in every tattoo ask your artist to run a clean gun over the area a few times if your main concern is about the pain maybe tattoos are not for you having a positive attitude is the best thing you can do to counter some of the pain try and distract yourself your artist will help you bring a friend to talk with ask your artist in advance what you can do to prepare it's more like a constant irritation than a tooth ache it will be one of your fondest memories don't worry so much you will do fine Tattoo Hip hop culture Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Hip hop rivalries Acupuncture Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Naruto jutsu Scarification Nine Inch Nails Breastfeeding Pneumonia Clothing Characters of Naruto Mattress Prostate cancer Stomach cancer Irezumi Hepatitis C Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Methamphetamine YuYu Hakusho Professional wrestling attacks Professional wrestling holds Hip hop music Comanche Pain Memento (film) Body modification Psoriasis Esophageal cancer Tattoo You Paracetamol Shen Gong Wu Self-harm Kurt Cobain Diving Tattoo gun Keloid Female genital cutting Namie Amuro Battle of Jutland Homunculi of Fullmetal Alchemist Aerial (dance move) Anxiety Intravenous therapy Traumatic brain injury Seppuku Rapping Hydrogen peroxide Osteoarthritis Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Cindy Sheehan The Death Gate Cycle Weight training Goodness and value theory Earring Vanilla Ninja Avril Lavigne Tongue piercing Graffiti Investigations since the Fiji coup of 2000 Professional wrestling throws The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Dental caries Happiness Music genre Chess strategy and tactics Ty Cobb Penis Britney Spears Jackass: The Movie Sideshow Bob African American music Abdominal pain The Wildhearts Social rule American Psycho Knots Landing Taxi Driver Figure skating Sampling (music) Mark Calaway Oral sex Tara Lipinski Hip hop fashion Doom enemies Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Music Tai Chi Chuan Rhythm and blues Fibromyalgia Siege Childbirth Till Lindemann Boxing Otitis externa Gaia Online Alternative hip hop Hand grenade
