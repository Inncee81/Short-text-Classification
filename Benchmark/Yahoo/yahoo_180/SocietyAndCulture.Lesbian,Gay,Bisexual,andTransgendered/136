listening from the closet not speaking what are some hurtful things others have said to you regarding homosexuals thinking that you were sympathetic a couple of years ago my mother and i were at the mall and as a gay couple passed she said there should be a law that if you see them in public you can shoot them oh my goodness i can only imagine how horrifying that was to hear that come out of your mother's mouth i am truly sorry as i was growing up i remember being around and my step dad asked me if i knew what gay was i told him no even though i did and he told me it means two boys or two girls kissing each other and that's yucky and shouldn't happen as i was growing up if we visited a restaurant and we had a gay waiter he would always laugh and make fun of their physical features and call them choosers of an alternative lifestyle i am open to my friends and most of my girlfriend's family but my family and coworkers do not know and a lady i work with last week said well you can't even tell she's gay she's really nice and nice looking so i was quick to rebutt so you can't be gay and nice or good looking sheesh really sucks for them sarcastically of course it really p ssed me off that she said that and i saw this person in question today in the office and she was smoking hot ahhhhhhhhh i wanted to faint even though she was years old she looked realllly good for an old lady oh and my girlfriend has probably the best body i've ever seen and she is just one of those drop dead gorgeous girls that everyone fantasizes about and i'm not just saying this because she's my girlfriend that's just the way it is and i get so mad because her coworkers always tell her just give me one chance i'll turn you straight you haven't had a good enough d ck etc i understand your situation being from southeast texas it's ridiculous down here b Little Britain Friends Social rule Avenue Q Shaggy dog story EastEnders The Shining (film) Theory of conduct Recurring South Park characters Sharon Tate One Tree Hill (TV series) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The Marshall Mathers LP Jam (TV series) Kyle Broflovski Dead Like Me Milton H.
