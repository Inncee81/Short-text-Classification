what does it mean ok so i've been in love with the girl i'm seeing for about yrs now we met at a bar and ended up having a great time so we started seeing each other yrs ago we dated for about months and then it ended but not in a bad way kind of mutually i moved and lost touch with her shortly after about months ago we got back in touch and we've been seeing each other since at the end of june we went to the lansing pride together and when she was drunk she expressed to me that she was in love with me and i know im in love with her i always have been but i didnt say anything back because she was drunk so i didnt know if she really meant it she hasnt said anything since then about weather or not she loves me but she did express that she knows i love her when we got on the topic of me loving her i asked her if she felt the same way she said i dont know my question is what the hell i dont know how to read into this at all it may not be that she doesn't love you some people are afraid of giving in to love because of the power they feel that someone else may have over them i'm sure she meant what she said but if you do both truly love each other you must surrender to it and each other i hope this helped good luck kay Pitaten Phoebe Halliwell Atomic Kitten The Ashlee Simpson Show Incarnations of Immortality YuYu Hakusho Singlish Sharon Tate One Tree Hill (TV series) Kodocha Avenue Q Social rule Good Morning, Vietnam Past teachings of Prem Rawat Humphrey Bogart Nicomachean Ethics Scenes from a Memory Jennifer Lopez Piccolo Junior Saga Boom Crash Opera 2000 Australian Grand Prix Shaggy dog story The Chemical Brothers Hall & Oates My Sassy Girl Charmed Battle of the Bulge Kid Buu Saga Alena Child sexuality St. Elmo's Fire (film) Sydney Riot of 1879 Jean Grey Cliff Richard Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) African American Vernacular English Wonderland (McFly album) The Human Stain Maison Ikkoku Kikyo Friends Sin City Ranma __ characters Pride and Prejudice Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Pok__mon Live!
