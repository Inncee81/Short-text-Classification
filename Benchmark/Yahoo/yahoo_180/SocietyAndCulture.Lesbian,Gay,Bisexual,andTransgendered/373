helpp how do i let this gay guy know i'm really not interested okay well i was working and this guy came in who is friends with this girl i work with he and i started having a conversation he seemed cool and i didn't really think anything of it right afterwards the girl i work with pulls me to the side and tells me to stop flirting with him hell i didn't even realize he was gay but i guess he thought i was interested because within a day he finds me on facebook and requests to be my friend i say yes just because i don't want to seem like an asshole and he comes in often and within minutes of excepting hes commented on of my photos ranging from awwww cute to saying that fag is a mean word friend who commented before him jokingly called me a fag cause i looked like quite tool in the picture i really don't want to come off homophobic or rude but i also don't want my friends thinking i'm gay or something what should i do i would recommend the direct approach people really need to learn the difference between flirtation and friendly conversation in the most gentle way that you can you just have to tell him the truth if he's mature he should be able to accept it if he's not mature then you can't be held responsible for any fit that he throws you seem like a decent person who actually cares enough to come here and find a way to let him off easy he is lucky that he wasn't interested in a guy who would have beat him up he couldn't have asked for a better way for a rejection to turn out if he gets too upset remind him of that Social rule Humphrey Bogart Kyle Broflovski Friends Theory of conduct Milton H.
