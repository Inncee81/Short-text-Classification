why the people say it's normal to be confused when you are a teen about your sexuality your preferences after that time you know you are gay or straight i mean for example in my case all my life i always knew i was gay since i was a child but some guys i have seen in this forum the realized that they were gay until they were past the teen age for example someone who is years old says he is gay then he is confused or he is pretty sure of his sexuality or he needs to grow up more and to know the truth it is normal for the teenage years to be somewhat confusing it is usually about that time when teens discover that most adults have double standards and have no real clue about how the world operates many adults tell teens that they are confused about an issue when they really believe that they are wrong or the teen does not agree with the adults i knew from the time i was old enough to discover the difference between boys and girls that i was gay it wasn't all that confusing for me about who i was i found myself more confused about why people wouldn't just let me be who i was without judging me one of the reasons that some people are confused is that they are force fed that little boys act like this and little girls act this then when you don't feel or act like the way they say you do you do become confused with me it wasn't how come i don't feel like that it was how come they think all boys feel that way after all i didn't Pedophilia Infantilism Transsexuality One Tree Hill (TV series) Human sexual behavior Child sexuality Gay Adolescence Age of consent Jon Secada Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Milton H.
