why feel this way so i'm depressed why because of this girl i don't even know she's the most beautifully stunning girl i've ever seen in my life and i just wish i could be with her the only problem is i've only known her for about a week maybe two now and i hardly know her in the process of finding out anything about her i've gotten as far as what kind of girls she likes where she works because i saw her and that she thinks i look pretty cute in this certain picture other than that i know nothing about her so why am i wanting her so badly i want to tell her that i like her but i'm afraid it's way too soon but it's driving me insane not knowing whether or not i have a chance i met her at a hard time in her life she's going through some stuff and she's pretty depressed about it so i don't know what to do should i tell her how i feel or not or better question why in the world am i feeling this way about her yes people i'm lesbian and so is she i know that she went through a break up not too long ago i have asked if she wanted to hang out sometime well actually a friend asked if she wanted to hang with us sometime but she said she had to get her life in order first i just want to tell her how i feel but i don't know how or what to say you probably are feeling the way you are feeling because you feel a connection of some sort with her you both are going through some shit in your lives and you both want and need someone to listen and understand if i were you i would tell her how i felt sice you havent known her all that long its better you can get it out there in the open fast and if she dont feel the same way then say thats cool and just be friends just be confident dont be really insecure because you are a chick you know we dont like that shit lol just do what you feel in your heart oh and by the way when i met my man i felt the same way i knew that he was the one ya know that sounds so corny but it really is true and we have been togather since i was like it will be nine years in sep so tell her how you feel follow your heart be confident and let me know what happens damnit hehehe Time Out of Mind Social rule Jon Secada Shaggy dog story The Ashlee Simpson Show One Tree Hill (TV series) Humphrey Bogart Shit Knots Landing Year of the Spider Megan Griffin The Emancipation of Mimi Sharon Tate Theory of conduct Sex and the City EastEnders Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Episodes of Lost (Season 1) About a Boy Transsexuality Scenes from a Memory Pitaten YuYu Hakusho Blood on the Tracks The Catcher in the Rye Cardcaptor Sakura Current teachings of Prem Rawat Mina Mongoose Jean Grey K' Atomic Kitten Sin City She Loves You Marilyn Monroe Infidels George Costanza Anderson Cooper The Marshall Mathers LP Edward Gibbon Wakefield Socrates W.I.T.C.H.
