why should people of good conscience celebrate perversity http www worldnetdaily com news article asp article id there's nothing inherently wrong with being gay or bisexual but some of the lewdness that goes on at gay pride parades is absolutely shameful most gay people have the good sense to act like mature adults but of course at these shameful parades there is nothing but lewdness intended to offend people nothing is more detrimental to the gay rights movement than these sick parades it is nothing but bad publicity futher reinforcing the general public's distaste for openly gay behavior right or wrong why can't they express themselves in public in a manner suitable for the general public or in a manner suitable for children i am absolutely certian that if i held a straight pride parade comprised of pimps crack whores flashers and obscene behavior in public it would be rightly called shameful too scared to offend the gay community the mainstream press ignored this event this is what people are referring to when they say that perversion is being forced down their throats you can call be a gay basher and hide behind such empty slander all you want but i have never had a problem with normal gay behavior this nonsense at the parades is what i am referring to i would not be surprised if i recieved several comments from gays and lesbians themselves disowning such behavior and rightly so obscenity and lewdness is wrong no matter what the sexual orientation directed at those of you who claim thoughtlessly well just don't go then if you don't like it did you bother to read the article some of your gay activist friends forced respectable members of the community to attend this shameful event under threat they had no choice in the matter not only did they have to go they had to participate will you read the freakin details next time knee jerk defenders of perversion as for mardi gras the same thing goes nothing but disgusting debauchery never said i supported it but at least no one is forced to go to mardi gras against their will by lewd fascists klyth thank you for your courage and integrity now watch as people accuse you of being a traitor to your cause simply because you won't behave as an extremist i get the same nonsense from so called conservatives who label me a traitor for not being extremely anti gay as stated before it's not gay that is the problem it's lewd and obscene behavior in public and otherwise decent people being forced to participate but watch as they turn my reasonable protest into homophobism when it is nothing of the sort sweetpea your answer is so beyond ignorant that it pains me to imagine what your world view is like your defense that straight people are disgusting freaks too is unmistakably weak i suppose that makes it all ok did you even bother reading the article any person of good conscience cannot condone this sort of perversion i'm not even sorry it ruffles your pink feathers that i speak out against it welcome to the world people don't like sick freaks like your obscene friends in the leather club half of the gay responders in here don't support this nonsense keep parading around and wiping filth in the faces of decent people and see how far that gets you in the hearts and minds of the general public this is what people hate not the choice not the lifestyle not the average gay person but the obscene immature freak ruining things for the rest of you i will not be bullied into tolerance by fascist amoral pigs who cram lewdness down my throat i am completely supportive of the gay community but i do not agree with some of the things you see at some of these events i have also been witness some lewd gestures and acts of a sexual nature which i don't think is appropriate in a public place especially where there may be children present but i feel the same way about some of the things you see at events that are not gay related take mardi gras for example i saw the breasts of the women next to me more often than i see my own however most of the gay pride related events i have been to have been perfectly suitable for the public i think in any gathering like this gay or
