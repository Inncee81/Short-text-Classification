do gay people choose their sexual orientation before any of you go on a huge rant hear mine first no you can't choose quite frankly i fail to understand how someone can claim you can ever heard of the term i chose to be gay the same day you chose to be straight and please explain how over animal species have also been found to have homosexual activity and why would someone want to be gay when they are heavily discriminated against by both society and their family please notice how all those who say that homosexuality is not a choice are profetionals who are qualified in their field of study and who are most likely to know what their talking about those who claim that it is a choice only have the bible to back up their argument and they have no psychiatric or scientific knowledge to prove it and yes there is no gay gene but they've found that there are several alleles that determine sexuality along with other features and don't use religion to say it is a choice it makes you look really stupid i see there are a lot of intelligent people here i would re post this in the religious section but i've heard what they have to say so many times now and its always the same thing it also anoys me because they fail to see how stupid their argument is even though its based on faith not fact obviously this does not apply to all religious people the clever ones realise that there are far more important things to focus on other than who some one fancies jesus taught about love and charity where does discriminate against all gays for no reason come in to this nowhere and yes i'd like to see a straight person try to be gay for a year or even a week and then they'd see how its not a choice good points no a person doesn't choose to be gay any more than they choose the color of their skin Sexual orientation Religion and sexual orientation Homosexuality and Christianity Same-sex marriage Gay Homophobia Reparative therapy Religion Ex-gay Human sexual behavior Human Homosexuality Predestination Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Biology and sexual orientation Evil Homosexuality and transgender Ethics Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Gender role Ten Commandments Gay rights Church of Christ Separation of church and state Criticisms of Christianity Intelligent design Bisexuality Zoophilia Theory of conduct Anglican views of homosexuality Laura Schlessinger Coming out Economics Choice and sexual orientation Christian right Free will Existence of God Aesthetic Realism Theodicy Pedophilia Atheism Homosexuality and medical science Roman Catholic Church Religious conversion Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Rick Santorum Societal attitudes towards homosexuality Hate speech Lawrence v.
