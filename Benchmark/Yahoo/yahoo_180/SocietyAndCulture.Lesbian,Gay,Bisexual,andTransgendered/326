if your gay could you be christian could you find yourself attractive lol what an interesting question in fact i asked this of myself trivially when i was first coming to terms with this and that yes i am a gay catholic guy and loving it i do agree with the churches teachings and they make perfect sense to me lately i have been stuggling as to how i will follow these teachings but without doubt i feel that they are logical yes although most ppl should strive to have a healthy self esteem some are conceited but what i think you're asking is if a gay person could be attracted to his or herself believe it or not i have seen heard of beefy muscleheads who are actually no exaggeration turned on by their own manly features while working out some ppl become aroused but other than these strange cases i wouldn't really know too much i also would have no idea about the lesbian side of this issue interesting question though Homosexuality and Christianity Roman Catholic Church Gay Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Social rule Friends Anglican views of homosexuality Same-sex marriage Pedophilia John Wycliffe New Testament Love Homophobia Goodness and value theory Trinity Religion Theodicy A Course In Miracles Logic Religion and sexual orientation Avenue Q Biology and sexual orientation Rick Santorum Homosexuality and transgender Transsexuality Same-sex marriage in Canada Mary, the mother of Jesus Criticism of Mormonism Merit Socrates Philipp Melanchthon Objectivist philosophy Abortion debate Human sexual behavior Family First Party Lesbian Summa Theologiae Philosophical skepticism Gender role Nontrinitarianism Transgender Sabbath Christianity and anti-Semitism Contrition Sydney Riot of 1879 G__del's incompleteness theorem Friedrich Schleiermacher Epistemology Charles Grandison Finney Sant Thakar Singh Birth control Church of Christ, Scientist Karen Horney Mennonite Christian eschatology Homosexuality and Judaism George Cardinal Pell Anal sex Theory of conduct B3ta Friedrich Nietzsche Christian philosophy Apostolic Fathers Ontological argument The nature of God in Western theology Fundamentalism Great Apostasy Culture of Lithuania Reality Evangelicalism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Little Britain Bertrand Russell Apocrypha Existence of God Italian literature Eastern Orthodox Church God Emperor of Dune Predestination Lawrence v.
