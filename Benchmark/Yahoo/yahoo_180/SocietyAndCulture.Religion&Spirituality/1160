with all the revisions why do people insist on continuing support for the theory of gravity isaac newton first came up with this theory almost years ago that was before we had any of the modern understanding of the world we have today yet people still insist on calling this a law well if this is a law how come there are so many revisions like general relativity special relativity and quantum theory which is it science seems like everytime they find something that doesn't fit science just comes up with some new explanation when will people see the theory or gravity is just that a theory intelligent falling is the real deal every sane person knows that Physics Fundamental interaction Luminiferous aether General relativity Special relativity History of physics Faster-than-light Science Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica Physical law Theory Classical mechanics Philosophy of space and time Force Celestial mechanics Equivalence principle Supernatural Philosophy of science Quantum gravity Black hole Theory of everything Physical science Loop quantum gravity Big Bang Quantum mechanics Cosmology Albert Einstein Inertia Richard Feynman Theoretical physics Newton's laws of motion Planetary orbit Anti-gravity Max Planck Scientific revolution Particle physics Action at a distance (physics) Quantum mind Scientific method Quantum field theory Creationism Physical cosmology History of science World Year of Physics 2005 Dark energy Creationist cosmologies Physical paradox Atomism Falsifiability Maxwell's equations Timeline of gravitational physics and relativity Process physics Graviton Meaning of life Modified Newtonian dynamics Calculus Planck units Speed of light Mathematics of general relativity Kepler's laws of planetary motion Multiverse Astrophysics Philosophy of mathematics Occam's Razor Theories and sociology of the history of science String theory Evolution Supersymmetry Speed of gravity The writing of Principia Mathematica Relative density Spacetime Dark matter Modern geocentrism Time travel Burkhard Heim Religion M-theory (simplified) Karl Popper Tide Many-worlds interpretation Causality Entropy Kaluza-Klein theory Asperger syndrome Intelligent design Bogdanov Affair Solar system Dynamical system Theory of conduct Gravitational radiation Wormhole Origin belief Law of value Pseudoscience Time in physics
