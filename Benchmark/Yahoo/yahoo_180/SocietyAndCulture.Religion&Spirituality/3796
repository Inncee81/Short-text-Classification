dear christians a question about women's right in christianity hello can you just explain the rights of women within christianity and provide sources from the bible i found this qoute a woman's asking for equality in the church would be comparable to a black person's demanding equality in the ku klux klan the church and the second sex new autobiographical preface mary daly i just wanted to ask because this topic wasn't really elaborated upon during my christianity course so just wanted to ask and i hope you can prove this lady wrong and since i know the issue of womens rights in islam will be touched even though it's not part of this question please follow this link http www islamreligion com articles p s i am not in any way trying to be offensive just want to learn peace love hello women's rights in christianity has been something that i have been studying for a little while i was always really confused when i read that passage where paul said that women should not speak out in the church and my intrigue didn't stop there the reason he said this was because during church at the church he was addressing in the letter the men sat on one side and the women on the other when the women didn't understand something or just had a question for their husbands they would yell it across the room they did this becuase women at the pagen temples were regarded as things that would bring blessing and they were used to doing whatever they pleased in israel in the old testement women were subjected to whatever treatment they got from their husbands their parents would pick their spouses and they sometimes had no choice in the situation but god's veiws are different when god created women from man the bible says that god took one of the man's ribs but the real meaning of that word was lost in translation they chose the word rib because the hebrew word was cage cell and they thoght that it meant rib cage but it really is beleived to have been the word cell like a human cell therefore eve would be a clone of the man having been made from the x chromozone that would explain why man has x and y chromozones and woman has x and x chromozone that would make man and women equal in the new testement after christ came and gave his life for the world and after the church was began there were many women in high roles in the church pheobe was a prophetess in a high place in the church priscilla and aquilla were a married couple paul greeted in one of his letters paul addressed priscilla first because at the time you addressed the person with a higher position first paul only speaks of these people in reference at the end of his letters but if you study them in history you see their influence at the time if you study history you see that jesus' mother mary went and started a church in britain when persecution got unbearable in jerusalem if you would like to know more with all of the references i would check out pastor wayne cochran he speaks about that in depth http www voiceforjesus org Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Prophet Eastern Orthodox Church Mary, the mother of Jesus Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Homosexuality and Christianity Paul of Tarsus Same-sex marriage New Testament Christian views of women Sabbath Criticisms of Christianity Roman Catholic Church God and gender Trinity Religious Society of Friends Opus Dei Genesis Original sin Christianity Christian eschatology Clergy John Howard Yoder Sin Book of Mormon Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Baptist Theology Holy Spirit End times Ordination of women Religious conversion Religion and sexuality Pope John Paul II Abrahamic religion Christian view of marriage Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Justification (theology) Tetragrammaton Apocrypha Polygamy Predestination Old Testament Satan Biblical canon Priesthood (Mormonism) Angel Christianity and anti-Semitism Pope Benedict XVI Historicity of Jesus Bible Book of Revelation Sexual orientation Jew Mortification of the flesh God Great Apostasy Eucharist History of the English Bible Christian views of Jesus Resurrection of Jesus Religion and abortion Unification Church Dispensationalism Salvation Book of Isaiah Fundamentalism Messiah Catechism Marriage Gospel of Mark Religious pluralism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Adam-God theory Talmud Yeshu Christian-Jewish reconciliation Grimke Sisters Separation of church and state Authorship of the Pauline epistles Church of Christ Meaning of life Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Summa Theologiae John Wycliffe Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology A Course In Miracles Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod Names of God in Judaism
