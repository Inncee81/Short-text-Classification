fred phelps is a christian he follows christ since when did god start hating the sinner more than the sin hey can we vote fred off the island i mean seriously folks this kind of fruitcake theology is what makes people turn away from god in droves that is not what jesus asked us to do i think the good rev phelps missed his era he would have much better served his master in nazi germany no fred phelps is not a christian whether he'll get into heaven is between him and god but he preaches a corrupted evil perversion of the gospel his theology divides god into two contradictory personalities one that loves people and makes them good and the other that hates people and makes them evil all according to his whim the two sides of his god's personality never go after the same person so they aren't in conflict as they would be with true dualism but nevertheless some characteristics of dualism are apparent it is a blasphemous and false nonchristian theology edit while phelps claims to be preaching calvinism no true calvinist i've ever known has made the leap from double predestination to actually describing god as having two radically different personalities depending on whom he's dealing with this matter of dual personalities and dual attitudes toward his creation divides humanity into the superior and the inferior and makes it okay to actually persecute whole classes of persons caveman you're missing the point mr phelps doesn't merely preach hell he preaches a semi dualistic view of god Theodicy Sin Westboro Baptist Church (Topeka) Predestination Calvinism Salvation Fred Phelps God Reprobation Divine grace Hell Justification (theology) Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Ten Commandments Religion Martin Luther Religious pluralism Church of Christ Heaven Religion and sexual orientation Soul John Wesley Christianity Perseverance of the saints Nation of Islam Predestination (Calvinism) Original sin Chosen people Jehovah's Witnesses Summa Theologiae Liberal Christianity Roman Catholic Church Theology Kabbalah Evil John Wycliffe Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Dualism (philosophy of mind) Apocalyptic literature Antinomianism Devil Resurrection of Jesus Human nature Satan Free will Binitarianism Merit Great Apostasy Lutheranism Philipp Melanchthon A Course In Miracles Paradise Lost History of Christianity Friedrich Schleiermacher Legalism (theology) Trinity Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Eastern Orthodox Church Christian eschatology Repentance Paul of Tarsus Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Christian anarchism Sabbath Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Infant baptism Christian views of Jesus Catechism Arminianism Monotheism Jesus Anti-Semitism Alan Campbell (pastor) Origen Michael Servetus Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Baptism Justin Martyr Sola fide Church of Christ, Scientist Opus Dei Nazism Zoroastrianism Gnosticism Christianity and anti-Semitism Joseph Smith, Jr. Supernatural Christian Reconstructionism
