atheists even if you don't believe is there anything in jesus' teachings that you think are noteworthy everyone can answer the reason i am asking atheists is because i know they have read and researched the bible more than most people and can give an educated answer is that so i am atheist well anyway i found a lost chapter or something that he supposedly wrote to his apostles that i found to be quite intriguing i can't remember the exact text it was in hebrew or something and i don't remember the exact translation but it was kind of sounding like a bit of a riddle but they disregarded it's existence because it goes against them anyway it basically said that church is not needed god is everywhere and you can worship him anywhere in any clothes and no building will he not be able to find you i thought it was quite interesting that churches disregard such information just because it goes against everything they have built also he said he preys for all of us or something before he died i found that quite interesting as well he believed and was willing to die for it that's more than i can say for most worshipers of god or gods i find him interesting and possibilities are endless but i do not believe nor will i and also i probably still wouldn't even if i met him personally i would probably think it was a magician or an idiot so maybe when i die i will truly know but its really to late then isn't it by the way i don't remember the exact words and everything but you get the idea and believe it or not most everything i know isn't from the bible directly i have never read but maybe touched on a few pages here and their most i have learned from movies books i have seen some stuff about certain passages in the bible and also i get my main source of information from preachers church people themselves also i have read many things off the net about certain particular parts of the bible but never actually sat down and read the bible from front to cover what i do know is it still sounds to me like a fascinating story but sounds more like a beautiful piece of fiction New Testament Book of Mormon Bible Biblical canon Sabbath Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Gospel of John A Course In Miracles Fundamentalism Linguistics and the Book of Mormon God King James Version of the Bible Trinity Biblical inerrancy Atheism Church of Christ, Scientist Religion Historicity of Jesus Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Gospel of Mark Apocrypha Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Judaism Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Soul Origen Psalms Alan Campbell (pastor) Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Christianity Abrahamic religion Saint Peter Infant baptism Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Resurrection of Jesus Ten Commandments Church of Christ Angel Apostle Expository preaching Paul of Tarsus Christian eschatology History of Christianity Socrates God and gender Jesus Historical Jesus Book of Isaiah Moses Book of Daniel Prophet Sin Creationism Old Testament John Wycliffe Evolutionary creationism Urantia Philo The nature of God in Western theology Religious conversion Martin Luther Theory of conduct History of the English Bible Creation according to Genesis Gnosticism Bible and reincarnation Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Guide for the Perplexed Eastern Orthodox Church Christian anarchism Anglo-Saxon literature Religious Society of Friends Gospel Tithe Holy Spirit Talmud Theodicy Jewish principles of faith Messianic Judaism Homosexuality and Christianity Baptism Book of Revelation Antichrist Christianity and anti-Semitism Binitarianism Secret Gospel of Mark Spiritism Idolatry John Wesley Bertrand Russell Charismatic
