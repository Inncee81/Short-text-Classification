question for buddhists i am a christian who has been assigned some time with a girl who is a buddhist in my religion class i am really trying to connect what buddhist follow and believe by what this girl says and does this is what i have observed unforgiveness can you believe she hasn't spoken to her nieces and nephews in over a year because they wouldn't go someplace with her she constantly talks about her family and what they should be doing and not even seeing that she's doing the same thing lastly she told me that her beliefs are about fulfilling herself and anyone who gets in the way of her needs at the moment she doesn't deal with them anymore do all buddhists follow these guidelines or did i get put with someone who's out there what can i say to her from a buddhist standpoint that would cause her to reflect she already knows my christian views while practising buddhism you're on your own in christianity you have an army of supporters her development is hers alone and all buddhists are practising the best they can buddhism is a psychological practise and to clean up the mess in the mind takes time so every practising buddhist have errors it is the effort to clean up the errors that count more than the level of progress you have made also as a buddhist you are not supposed to point fingers at others some that are not very practised do but that is something they still have to learn at some point to learn about buddhism you should get inspiration from several sources and not only a young girl whom possebly doesn't have much clue about what practising buddhism is about i can recommend you to read this work written by a monk called ajahn sumedho which explains the basics very nicely http www buddhanet net noble htm please pass on the link to her as well as it sounds like she could use the guidance Soul Taoism Theravada Religion Monasticism Prayer Ajahn Chah Buddhist philosophy Meditation A Course In Miracles Theory of conduct Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Four Noble Truths Philosophical skepticism Sant Mat Fundamentalism Gautama Buddha Chinese in Singapore Clergy Advaita Vedanta Dharma Theology Confucianism Reincarnation Rebirth (Buddhism) Idolatry Yoga Kukai Vipassana Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Biblical inerrancy Mantra God Christianity Intelligent design Atheism Yin Shun Vegetarianism Tibetan Buddhism Korean Buddhism Vajrayana Religious pluralism Karma Infant baptism Immortality New Age Consciousness Education in Japan Noam Chomsky Neuro-linguistic programming Religion in Japan Magic (paranormal) Religious conversion Ten Commandments Extreme Programming Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Spiritism The nature of God in Western theology Alan Watts Guru Suma Ching Hai Ordination of women Buddhism in the United States Zen Falun Gong Brahmanism Buddhism in Thailand Nichiren Predestination Volleyball Dualism (philosophy of mind) Timeline of Buddhism Apologetics Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama Buddhism in Bangladesh Jiddu Krishnamurti Education Scenes from a Memory Sacrifice P__li Hinduism Maurice Merleau-Ponty Buddhist art Church of Christ, Scientist Separation of church and state Anatta Soka Gakkai International Mahayana Simone Weil Coercion Edicts of Ashoka Blood on the Tracks Alcoholics Anonymous Sexual orientation
