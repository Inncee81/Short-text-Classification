dear non muslims have any of you ever studied islam in dept just curious because people who take the time to study it eventually realize that a lot of things are misunderstood and often times stereotyped as is the same with almost every religion have any of you taken a course in islam in college etc i took christianity and hinduism in college and was relieved of a lot of the misunderstandings i had have you ever tried to study islam to get a better perspective of it peace love yes i am catholic but before i become catholic i studied a few religions the two i studied most were islam and catholicism christian protestantism to a lesser extent i knew one of them had to be the truth i have read the quran too many times to recall i also read a number of books by muslim authors explaining the best they could why islam was the true religion you have to understand this self imposed study i undertook basically went on for at least hrs a day over the course of months you may ask well why then did you become catholic if you read so much on islam very good question i will admit that during those months there were a few times were i was absolutely convinced that islam was the truth it made sense and i could comprehend it unlike obscure doctrines in christianity such as god became man and the trinity i will not go in to why i thoroughly do not believe islam is the truth because that really isn't the question i will say though that i do really feel satisfied that i studied it because it helps me see through all the negative propaganda that islam gets dealt by the western media they say islam terrorist but after studying it though i do know it to be essentially a religion of peace and that there are extremists in every religion and also that many of the islamic terrorists who strap themselves with c aren't really even islamic in that they are actually just bored kids looking to stand for an ideal whatever that may be many of those guys that blow themselves up are indeifferent to the religion aspect of it and are really just wanting to be considered heroic if there was ample opportunity for them do the same another religion they probably would sorry getting off track yes i have read in depth about islam as a matter of fact my father was raised muslim he's from libya the fact that most people only believe what they hear about through gossip or opinion about islam only really shows that many people blindly believe what they are told unfortunately Religion God Religious pluralism Christianity Islam Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Nation of Islam Trinity Sin Supernatural Merit Ethics in religion Religious perspectives on Jesus Atheism Ten Commandments Evolutionary creationism Hinduism Theology Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Chosen people Apologetics Friedrich Schleiermacher Urantia Criticism of Islam Predestination Prophet Islamic philosophy Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Idolatry Abraham Simone Weil John Wycliffe Holy Spirit Meaning of life Sufism Persecution of Christians Soul Jizya Abrahamic religion Existence of God Biblical inerrancy Yusuf al-Qaradawi Marriage Heresy Qur'an Spiritism Apostasy Scientology beliefs and practices Mahatma Gandhi New Testament Philosophical skepticism Religion and sexuality Propaganda Roman Catholic Church Salvation The nature of God in Western theology Apostasy in Islam Max Weber Virgin Mary in Islam Hadith Bah__'__ Faith Confucianism Religious studies Cult Nationalism Christian apologetics Pacifism Sant Mat Reincarnation Monotheism Protestantism Saint Plame affair Past teachings of Prem Rawat Justification (theology) Gautama Buddha Mormonism and Christianity Nontrinitarianism Sharia Philipp Melanchthon Islam as a political movement Great Apostasy Separation of church and state Neofascism and religion Five Pillars of Islam Women in Islam Theodicy
