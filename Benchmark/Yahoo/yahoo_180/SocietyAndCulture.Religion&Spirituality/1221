was god testing abraham or vice versa thinking about the story of how abraham was asked to sacrifice his son issac if old abe was a real man and not a complete wuss then i suspect he was testing god not the other way around as is commonly supposed any deity who would demand the slaughter of children is not worth honoring i'd rather die trying to protect my child than live in service of such a being issac was spared true but there are plenty of other biblical passages where god vents his wrath on children kings and he went up from thence unto bethel and as he was going up by the way there came forth little children out of the city and mocked him and said unto him go up thou bald head go up thou bald head and he turned back and looked on them and cursed them in the name of the lord and there came forth two she bears out of the wood and tare forty and two children of them http www pitts emory edu woodcuts bibla jpg here is a suggestion from a scholar on the akedah binding of isaac take out verses from the story and see what the story looks like then why wouldn't abraham question god for this when he questioned god when he wanted to level sodom and gomorrah he always questioned what god did when it came to terrible things when they reached the place god had told him about abraham built an altar there and arranged the wood on it he bound his son isaac and laid him on the altar on top of the wood abraham looked up and there in a thicket he saw a ram a caught by its horns he went over and took the ram and sacrificed it as a burnt offering instead of his son so abraham called that place the lord will provide and to this day it is said on the mountain of the lord it will be provided maybe just maybe verses were added later on it could make sense that abraham just defied god because we never see god and abraham speak again after the akedah anyways it seems to make sense its just something i learned about in college i am sure i am going to get alot of thumbs down's for this suggestion Binding of Isaac Abraham Korban Ten Commandments Noah Jacob Genesis Angel Abrahamic religion Human sacrifice Sola fide El (god) Book of Isaiah Sodom and Gomorrah Satan Altar Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Balaam God Sabbath Death (personification) Religion Bible Baal Judaism Original sin 613 mitzvot Michael (archangel) Hell Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Trinity Justification (theology) Priesthood (Mormonism) Prophets of Islam Azazel Moloch Conversion of Dale-Gudbrand El (Canaanite god) Samaritan Antichrist Names of God in Judaism Reincarnation Odysseus Ark of the Covenant Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Joseph (Hebrew Bible) Origin belief Saint Peter Idolatry in Christianity Dispensationalism Ayyavazhi mythology God Emperor of Dune Jerusalem Resurrection of Jesus Sarah Isa Qiyamah Demon Idolatry Alaga__sia Christian eschatology Leviathan Jewish views of religious pluralism Biblical inerrancy Sin Tefillin Macbeth Paul of Tarsus Middle-earth Mary, the mother of Jesus Odyssey Temple in Jerusalem RuneScape gods Homosexuality and Christianity Moses Noah's Ark Iliad Sukkot Jewish principles of faith Gospel of Barnabas Didache John Howard Yoder Mantra Book of Joshua Documentary hypothesis Land of Israel Meaning of life Joseph of Arimathea Cultural and historical background of Jesus Tower of Babel Gospel of Mark Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Jesus The Dunciad
