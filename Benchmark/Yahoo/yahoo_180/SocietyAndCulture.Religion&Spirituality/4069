a question for wiccans or other magick people when using magick do you feel that it is important to have really strong faith that the spell will work or do you think it is more important to have a really strong desire for the spell to work or both or neither is there something else you think is important that would make a spell be more likely to work and for the fundies that will want to spam this question saying how evil magick is waste all the time typing that you want no one is going to even bother to read the mindless drivel you produce your prayers are spells whether you want to believe it or not and i already know that you believe faith is most important actually phoenix wright i didn't actually say that i believed spells work i'm asking what other people believe about them i find it beneficial after the casting to forget that it was done when you fixate on what you did and wonder over and over if it will yield results you're actually drawing energy away from what you did after the casting is completed the time for thought is done and the time for action has come Magic (paranormal) Witchcraft RuneScape Magick Wicca RuneScape weapons RuneScape skills Satanism Phoebe Halliwell Gerina Dunwich David Hume Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) A Course In Miracles Neopaganism Dianic Wicca Magic circle (Wicca) Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem Evil Charmed Sex magic Tide Milton H.
