it has somebody here that still it doubts jesus because jesus is love live peace salvation and glory peace faith and life no i don't doubt jesus when i say jesus i'm referring to the one and only jesus christ of the bible jesus is god manifested in the flesh to save us from our sins here are a few verses to illustrate his deity as you know god said i am and jesus said i tell you the truth jesus answered before abraham was born i am john the word became flesh and made his dwelling among us we have seen his glory the glory of the one and only who came from the father full of grace and truth john i and the father are one john jesus never sinned therefore he was the only one good enough to cleanse us from all our sins he committed no sin and no deceit was found in his mouth peter we all are sinners even just one sin separates us from god for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god romans as it is written there is no one righteous not even one romans bible believing christians believe that we can not earn our way to heaven by doing any good deeds where all other religions believe you can do something to earn your way to heaven jesus answered i am the way and the truth and the life no one comes to the father except through me john for it is with your heart that you believe and are justified and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved as the scripture says anyone who trusts in him will never be put to shame romans for everyone who calls on the name of the lord will be saved romans god does tell us to make sure what we hear and believe is from him dear friends do not believe every spirit but test the spirits to see whether they are from god because many false prophets have gone out into the world this is how you can recognize the spirit of god every spirit that acknowledges that jesus christ has come in the flesh is from god but every spirit that does not acknowledge jesus is not from god this is the spirit of the antichrist which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world john Christianity Abrahamic religion Original sin Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Resurrection of Jesus God Jesus Epistle to the Romans Roman Catholic Church John Howard Yoder Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Paul of Tarsus Religious perspectives on Jesus Soul Heaven Christian eschatology Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Repentance Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Book of Mormon Mormonism Eastern Orthodox Church Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Alan Campbell (pastor) Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Religion Sabbath Devil Articles of Religion (Methodist) Prophet Binitarianism New Testament Hell Antichrist Athanasian Creed Saint Sanctification Christian views of Jesus Angel Merit Mary, the mother of Jesus Priesthood (Mormonism) Church of Christ Protestantism Religious pluralism Charles Grandison Finney Christian apologetics Great Apostasy Eucharist Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Calvinism Indulgence Nontrinitarianism Mormonism and Christianity Creationism Chosen people John Wycliffe True Jesus Church Isa Mortification of the flesh Philipp Melanchthon Antinomianism Evangelical Presbyterian Church Prevenient grace Catechism Noah Predestination Jehovah's Witnesses Biblical inerrancy Qiyamah Revelation John Wesley Christian anarchism Messiah Pope Evil Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Anabaptist
