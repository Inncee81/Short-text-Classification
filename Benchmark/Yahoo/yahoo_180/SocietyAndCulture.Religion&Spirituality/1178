wiccans care to help me out i am a wiccan myself have been for under a year yes but that doesn't make me any less though i am still learning and will be for the rest of my life anyways my boyfriend who i do believe i will be with for quite some time is agnostic and is extremely confused about the whole thing in short can anyone give me something to help him to respect the religion not believe in it mind you i can't make him do that but just to respect it thank you as further explanation he was the one to ask me to find something to help him to understand the religion therefore i think it would make more sense to try to do this rather than tell him to 'accept it or hit the road' it's my relationship with the divine as i understand it i don't ask or expect anyone else to follow my path but it's the right one for me if he can't respect that then i don't know that explaining it further would help edited gotcha it's not really a question of helping him respect the religion but understand it depending on how much he wants to know cunningham has a couple of books about helping non wiccans understand the religion there are also the for dummies books about wicca that will give a basic understanding without getting too woo woo about it alternately go out into a forest preserve or something with him and just be maybe that will help him understand it better than any book Wicca Witchcraft The nature of God in Western theology Fundamentalism Religion Past teachings of Prem Rawat Theory of conduct Magic (paranormal) Theology Supernatural A Course In Miracles Social psychology Jiddu Krishnamurti Neopaganism Richard Feynman Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Evolutionary creationism Agnosticism Sant Mat Scientology beliefs and practices Confucianism Atheism Discordianism Causality Joseph Campbell Ten Commandments Current teachings of Prem Rawat Alcoholics Anonymous Wiccan Rede Trinity David Hume Existence of God Intelligent design God Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Hinduism Mary, the mother of Jesus Sexual orientation Urantia Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Theodicy Meaning of life Prayer Immortality Nicomachean Ethics Animism Paul of Tarsus Philosophy of language Ethics Creation science Chosen people Dianic Wicca Rudolf Hermann Lotze Origin belief Creationism The Book of Five Rings Gautama Buddha God Emperor of Dune Science Smartism Metaphysics Magical thinking Human Homosexuality and Neopaganism Afterlife Philosophy of religion Stregheria Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind New Age Lady Frieda Harris Nation of Islam Charles Fort George Lakoff Infantilism Love Warlock Evolutionism Socrates Simone Weil Soul Book of Mormon Religious pluralism Jacob Neusner Biblical inerrancy Social rule Francis Crick Saint Guru Charles Darwin's views on religion New Testament Scientific method Euphemism Fight Club Idolatry Moral Politics Church of Christ, Scientist
