reading the bible i know this may seem like a dumb question but how do you read the bible i've been trying to read the bible from beginning but seem to lose its meaning and not retain as much also would you suggest reading some parts of the bible before others any advice would be greatly appreciated this is my second time reading the bible and i'm trying to finish this time haha i can imagine how hard it must be for you you're obviously somewhat new to the bible so i deffinitely wouldn't recommend starting in genesis i think you should start at the beginning of the new testament because it's much more straightforward and it gives a much clearer representation of modern christian beliefs than the bizarre stories of the old testament i'd also recommend if you don't already start going to church unless the priest at your parish is a million years old and going crazy i think a priest's homilies can really help you understand how we're supposed to interpret the bible jesus was the first to give us our modern image of god although abraham is recognized as one of the founders of both christianity and islam he was actually a pagan although abraham was polytheistic he is credited as being the first to come up with the idea of one god being the greatest of all other gods that's something to think about the next time you read about abraham keep in mind that everything abraham is doing is strongly influenced by pagan beliefs not necessarily christian beliefs it's not until moses receives the ten commandments when we first recognize god as being the only true god another important issue you should be aware of is the accountability of the creation stories god's creation of the earth the fall of adam and eve cain and abel and noah's ark fundamentalists will use these stories to dismiss many well thought out and logical scientific theories like the big bang and evolution however if we take a closer look at these stories we'll find that these weren't written as historical data from that time would've been written but rather they were written like myths historians have already traced the roots of these stories to the yahwist and priestly writers during the babylonian exile of the israelites these stories were written like inspirational letters to fellow exiles to keep the faith strong during those harsh times btw noah's ark was used specifically to encourage the exiles and it would show them how their god always triumphs over his enemies and saves the ones who are true to him but there's also fundamental christian scientists who are trying to connect the old testament with science http www khouse org articles we have to keep in mind the purpose of the writtings of the old testament when we read them in order to fully understand what they're saying the new testament too was it written to encourage believers was it written to portray man's thoughts god's thoughts or both was it influenced by paganism or judaism was it written for jews or gentiles was it written to provide historical data or religious truths good luck Angel Creation science Satan Abraham Cultural and historical background of Jesus Evolutionary creationism Infant baptism Old Testament Pharisees Christian Identity Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Jewish principles of faith Religious pluralism Jewish views of religious pluralism Eastern Orthodox Church Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Mormonism and Judaism Charles Darwin's views on religion Paul of Tarsus Nontrinitarianism Noah Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Kabbalah A Course In Miracles God and gender Monotheism Soul Jews as a chosen people Islam History of creationism Original sin Tithe Book of Mormon Book of Revelation Divine grace Supernatural Neopaganism Creation-evolution controversy Noahide Laws Church of Christ, Scientist Curse and mark of Cain Names of God in Judaism Deuteronomy Christian eschatology Predestination Council of Jerusalem Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Christianity and anti-Semitism Intelligent design Prayer Messianic Judaism Demon Tetragrammaton Great Apostasy Satanism Gospel of Thomas Biblical canon Liberal Christianity Adam and Eve Meaning of life Apocalyptic literature Apocrypha
