how do creationists view the discovery of these latest fossils the pilbara stromatilites are not only the oldest known fossils but are the oldest known ecosystem as there are at least different types showing that speciation and diversification had already occured at this early stage the oldest are billion years old and have been shown to produce oxygen as a byproduct much the same as modern stromatolites do and the oxygenated atmosphere and oceans eventually oxidised the iron rich early oceans which became sedimentary layers on the sea floor and what is now the iron rich pilbara region clearly life has not only been influenced by this planet but life has also had a huge influence on its development as well this speaks nothing of religion or a god but will creationists attack it anyway or will they ask if life evolved from microbes then why are there still microbes that's fine sean but is very ignorant thanks lucid what we have here is the oldest most accurately dated fossils stromatolites are cyanobacteria but feel free to make yourself look clever if you wish deary brian you've nearly got it right look it up and marvel at these facts seethelight you offer nothing of any intellectual value and you answer nothing well actually the bible talks about dinosaurs not sure if a pilbara stromatilite is a dinosaur or not if they produce oxygen as a bybroduct wouldn't that make them plants like algea also those arguments are stupid and i often tell them they're dumb as far as the if people evolved from monkeys why are there still monkeys arguments Evolution Origin of life Fossil Flood geology Panspermia Creation science Stromatolite Creationism Ecology Creation-evolution controversy Trace fossil Noah's Ark Triassic Geology of the Grand Canyon area Dinosaur Photosynthesis Permian-Triassic extinction event Young Earth creationism Intelligent design Answers in Genesis Paleoclimatology Marine biology Cyanobacteria Pilbara region of Western Australia Origin belief Gaia theory (science) Created kind Evidence of evolution Earth God Biodiversity Plant Banded iron formation History of creationism Renewable energy Supernatural Sedimentary rock Religion Mars Evolutionary creationism Ozone depletion Fermi paradox Energy development Age of the Earth Abiogenic petroleum origin Petroleum Plate tectonics History of evolutionary thought Biology Carbon Algae Coal Macroevolution Richard Owen Old Earth creationism Paleontology Charles Darwin Permian Geology of the British Isles Ammonite Cradle of Humanity Eutrophication Star Trek planet classifications Chert Planetary nebula Iron Oxygen Evolutionism Solar system Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction event Brewery Snowball Earth Kardashev scale Impact event Tetrapod Feathered dinosaurs Carbon cycle Wealth Methane Precambrian Structure of the Earth Capitalism Paleocene 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake Nontrinitarianism Extinction The Origin of Species Scopes Trial Carbon dioxide Bird Devonian Sant Thakar Singh Astrobiology Charles Darwin's views on religion
