does testimony have credibility anymore and if not why doesn't it i have a theory true testimony has no power because of all the lies i find this sad i have no problem with someone being a scientist or having theories but nobody has witnessed anything that proves we evolved from apes nobody took a picture of jesus so you are right about that one too however science is not always credible to christians because every time we turn around they change their minds or have conflicts in their theories and the same thing has happened to christians our testimony is not believed because of those who are not credible doesn't that leave each of us accountable to search diligently for truth on our own and if there is a god which i believe there is will he take excuses like well so and so told me you aren't there so i believed them i don't think so rev matt every knee shall bow and every tongue confess that jesus christ is lord why do they question christians but under no circumstance question the ever changing science theory Resurrection of Jesus Church of Christ, Scientist Book of Mormon Ten Commandments Intelligent design Supernatural Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Baptism Meaning of life Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Criticism of Mormonism Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Soul Existence of God Holy Spirit Christianity Apostasy Historicity of Jesus God John the Baptist Cult A Course In Miracles Protestantism End times Jesus Apostle Religion Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Mary, the mother of Jesus Creationism Emanuel Swedenborg Sola fide Biblical inerrancy Gospel of Thomas Plame affair 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Eucharist Book of Isaiah Hearsay Theodicy Heaven Epistemology Trinity Gospel of Mark Christianity and anti-Semitism Rapture Free will Roman Catholic Church New Testament Opus Dei Miracle Truth The Da Vinci Code Evolutionary creationism Urantia Mark 16 Numerology David Hume Falsifiability Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Origin belief The Pilgrim's Progress Causality Young Earth creationism Charles Darwin's views on religion History of the Latter Day Saint movement Nihilism Church of Christ Nontrinitarianism Repentance Summa Theologiae Charles Grandison Finney Joseph Smith, Jr. Joseph of Arimathea Complexity classes P and NP Paul of Tarsus Alan Campbell (pastor) United Church of Christ Theory of conduct Saint Peter Idolatry in Christianity Sabbath Eastern Orthodox Church Judas Iscariot Religious conversion Great Apostasy
