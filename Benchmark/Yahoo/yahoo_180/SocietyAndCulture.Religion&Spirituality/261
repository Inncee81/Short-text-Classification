religion what is your view how do you feel about religion looking for answers that deal with personal view on religion as a whole discussing how their religion works and if they have no religion what is their beliefs etc i don't appreciate religious bashing so please refrain from making inappropriate answers whoa it's good to see all these answers pouring in so fast thanks everyone for sharing your views i'll keep this question up for another hour or so i consider myself to be a very spiritual person i didn't get that way overnight it took a lifetime of searching taking in knowledge of all different kinds of religious and philosophical points of view however the faith i have now is unshakable the way that i found it was my own individual journey i took in knowledge of other religions and formulated my own beliefs when i was a child i was baptized a protestant lutheran i followed what people told me to follow i think you call that blind faith but it didn't work out so well as i got older i started to question things i didn't understand and the answers i got back really didn't feel right they didn't resolve the issues i had with my religion so i began to explore other religions and different obstacles and questions and doubts sprang up along the way with each and every religion i studied finally i let go of organized religions i decided to find my own path i am happy to say i do have faith and a set of beliefs that work well for me i have no doubts as to my beliefs i belong to no organized religion but i am a child of god by god i mean my creator i believe that organized religion tends to confuse people misleads people in many ways it divides people it is full of hypocrisy i believe that true spiritual evolution comes from learning that humanity should follow the concept of love and unity so what divides us in my opinion leads us away from the light not towards it these are just my own humble opinions i respect the fact that others may not agree Religion Predestination Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Meaning of life Christianity God Religious Society of Friends Roman Catholic Church Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Jewish principles of faith Soul Sexual orientation Infant baptism Goodness and value theory Origin belief Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Atheism Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Theology Creation-evolution controversy Intelligent design Baptism The nature of God in Western theology Religious pluralism Separation of church and state Justification (theology) Socrates Islamic philosophy Existence of God Guru Salvation Prayer Eastern Orthodox Church Jewish philosophy Jewish views of religious pluralism Friedrich Schleiermacher Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Religious conversion Charles Grandison Finney Theodicy Christian denomination Epistemology Animism Catholicism Ten Commandments Human John Wycliffe Past teachings of Prem Rawat Maimonides Free will New Age Heaven Apologetics Simone Weil Idolatry Philipp Melanchthon Judaism Christianity and anti-Semitism Intelligent design movement Philosophy Hinduism Summa Theologiae Confucianism Satanism Christian apologetics Current teachings of Prem Rawat Al-Ghazali Biblical inerrancy Christian-Jewish reconciliation Who is a Jew?
