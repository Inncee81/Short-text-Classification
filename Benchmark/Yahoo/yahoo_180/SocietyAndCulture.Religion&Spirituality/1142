people who doubt theories maybe the theory gravity isn't correct and inclusive but exactly how do we get spacecraft to take pictures of planets that are millions of miles away without recognizing that the theory is more or less correct do you know the calculations needed to get a spacecraft to a planet they're incredibly complex and sensitive and guess what theory they use gravity who cares if more science comes along to say it wasn't totally correct it still works and don't say nasa is making up the pictures because i have huge telescope and i can see the planets all by myself it is a similar thing with the evolution theory and recent find sorry i didn't ask a question my question is what do you think of that geez you people are relentless i never said anything about knowing where gravity comes from in fact i don't know it just is what i can unknown you call god big deal i am not one of the people that thinks evolution is a replacement for creationism evolution doesn't explain where life came from i don't know where life came from i am just defending science and it's ways so you are saying the 'intelligent falling' is a false religious doctrine and are opposed to kansas teaching it as science you have the idea when i read the article i was left wondering because i was taught that evolution was a tree i remember them even referring to it as the tree of life and as the evolutionary tree i do remember the timeline charts too though they were just meant as timelines and lacked details the idea of evolution being a ladder with man on the top rung seems to be an idea peculiar to the religious mind set i truly love reading the answers where they are unable to understand the difference between facts laws hypothesies and theories it makes me feel almost intelligent Intelligent design Evolutionary creationism Creation-evolution controversy Intelligent design movement Gravity Creationism Teach the Controversy William A.
