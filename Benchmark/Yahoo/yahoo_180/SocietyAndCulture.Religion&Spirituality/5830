christians what is the difference between an evangelical a born again christian a charasmatic this question is specifically for christians what is the difference between charasmatic born again fundamentalist and evangelical are they the same related overlapping or completely different do you have to fall into one or more of these categories to be a christian have these movements helped or hindered the christian faith this question is for christians what are some stereotypes and misimpressions that people have about your religion do you feel that members of your religion contribute to these negative stereotypes in any way sincere answers only no christian bashing i am trying to get past my own negative stereotypes and prejudices and i will be asking a series of questions like this some of them may sound silly these are sincere questions not intended to offend but to help me get past my own stumbling blocks i'm not looking to convert just to understand a born again christian is somebody who believes that a person must come to salvation with a certain amount of awareness that a they're a sinner b jesus is lord and he died for their sins and c they need to confess with their mouth that a and b are true and be baptized by choice they tend to be sola scriptura bible is the only source of truth believers in theory although most if not all of them accept truth from their preachers their denominations etc there are many born again denominations a fundamentalist is a born again christian who claims to stick to the fundamentals of the faith as described in the bible if the bible doesn't say it's okay they won't do it if the bible condemns it it can never be okay in any circumstance there is quite a bit of range among the fundamentalists as to how strict they are some take the verse about women not dressing as a man to mean that women can never wear pants while others think it's okay for women to wear pants made for women just not pants made for men that's kind of a silly example but it's just to show you the range of interpretation all fundamentalists are born again most born again christians are fundamentalists but not all evangelicals are often but not always born again christians who are fundamentalists and take the lord's command to go and make disciples all nations very seriously they consider it their obligation to witness to as many people as possible to win as many people to jesus as possible often evangelical churches will have classes on how to evangelize and there is typically a certain amount of peer pressure to bring new people to church some mainline denominations have evangelical off shoots such as the evangelical lutherans they aren't considered born again because they baptize babies i e don't make a choice to be baptized but they have a mission of evangelization charismatics are born again fundamentalist christians who believe in the gifts of the spirit they are often also evangelical but not always this is a rather small segment of the born again fundamentalist population they typically believe that you aren't really saved unless you have the fullness of the spirit which is supposedly manifest in the speaking of tongues there is so much pressure to speak in tongues some people fake it and others fall into subconsciously mimicking others because they want to have the fullness of the spirit so badly the bible actually lists a whole bunch of different gifts of the spirit but there is undue emphasis on tongues among the charismatics with a little nod toward prophesy and the other gifts treated almost as though they hardly count at all i hope that explains how these terms are related and overlapping but a little bit different you do not have to fall into one or more of these categories to be a christian though people in any of these movements will tell you otherwise a christian is a person who believes jesus christ is lord and commits their lives to that and that's a broader definition than what is offered within these movements all of which tend to be a bit exclusionary in that they'll say a catholic or lutheran person isn't really a christian even though catholics and lutherans worship christ i think all these movements have simultaneously helped and hindered christianity just like pretty much any other movement within the history of the faith this is because people are not perfect and sometimes the best intentions lead to abject failure as a catholic christian people have a lot of sterotypes and misinformation about my faith you can see it right here on y a people claiming i worship mary wrong and the pope wrong or that i don't read or follow the bible wrong or that catholics changed the bible wrong or whatever i think there are some people in my faith tradition who have contributed to this of course catholics who don't take their faith seriously might never read the bible and claim they don't have to and then a protestant might think all catholics believe that and there are some catholics who go way overboard on mary leading outsiders to believe we worship her when that would be clearly against catholic teaching i used to be a born again fundamentalist evangelical charismatic protestant so i can see things from both sides it really makes me sad how so many of this kind of protestant repeat lies about catholicism without bothering to find out what the truth is but they think they know what's true Sexual orientation Puritan Criticism of Mormonism Alan Campbell (pastor) History of the English Bible Idolatry in Christianity
