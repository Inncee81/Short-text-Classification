have you followed another gospel false gospel that cannot save you from god's judgment galatians states but though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be accursed some examples of false gospels include that water baptism is required for salvation that one can accept jesus to be one's saviour that speaking in tongues is a proof of salvation that the sabbath is on saturday th day sabbath that christians can divorce their spouse if their spouse is an unbeliever that prayer to saints encourages god to answer our prayer that women can teach or preach when men are present in the assembly christopher i didn't mean to upset you but you have the scripture in front of you the word accursed in galatians means damned that is to be condemned to hell please take a look at corinthians also i have observed people in this forum promoting another gospel and preaching another jesus lakey there is only one true gospel all the others are false gospels may i suggest that you do a word study on gospel or faith i hope this will help you biblegraces thank you for your answer yes there are many false gospels gnostic i plainly stated that there is only true gospel that is why god warns us to beware of another gospel i have to disagree with your statement that god loves everyone that is not true please check psalms and in the new testament see romans craig the bible is the word of god nbm i do not understand the basis for your answer i have never thought that i was god i know i am just a sinner desiring to serve the lord thank you for praying for me though single eye the basic characteristic of a false gospel is a works gospel this is a person must do something in order to become saved the bible tells us that christ and only christ could complete the awesome work in order to save anyone christ had to endure the equivalent of spending eternity in hell and he did it in the hours between the garden of gethsemanae and when he said it is finished on the cross that meant that christ endured the equivalent of spending eternity in hell condensed into the hours between the garden and when he said it is finished our little minds cannot conceive of the enormous payment that christ paid only god could make this payment as for false doctrines the true believer loves the lord and wants to be obedient to his word psalm in john we read jesus answered and said unto him if a man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our abode with him check john and then in john we read and hereby we do know that we know him if we keep his commandments he that saith i know him and keepeth not his commandments is a liar and the truth is not in him as for the authority to say these things the bible says in mark and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature i just want to be faithful to the lord does this offend you passerby i am sorry to upset you you have made many statements here which are not true i do not know where you get your information from let us take the sabbath day in exodus we read speak thou also unto the children of israel saying verily my sabbaths ye shall keep for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations that ye may know that i am the lord that doth sanctify you notice what god says here the sabbath was a sign you may say a sign of what that god does all the work to save us remember the man that picked up a few sticks on the sabbath numbers what happened god commanded that man to be stoned to death you see if we attempt to do any work to earn salvation we are like this man that picked a few sticks on the sabbath the lord is the only one who can save us and he does all the work did you know that faith is a work check out thess and thess so how do we understand ephesians we read in galatians knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by the faith of jesus christ even we have believed in jesus christ that we might be justified by the faith of christ and not by the works of the law for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified in galatains we read i am crucified with christ neverthless i live yet not i but christ liveth in me and the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me and in philippians the bible states and be found in him not having mine own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the faith of christ the righteousness which is of god by faith so you can see that it is christ's faith not our faith because faith is a work when god opens our eyes to this truth then romans becomes so clear so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god faith is a synonym for jesus christ he is the only one who is faithful and true revelatian we then see so then christ cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god the bible is the key if christ has elected us to salvation we will be saved at some time in our life but the event will only occur under the hearing of god's word the bible god also determines when he will save a person god saved john the baptist in his mother's womb the lord saved the thief on the cross shortly before the thief died the lord is sovereign he is god and passerby if you take a look at colossians we find let no man therefore judge you in meat or in drink or in respect of an holyday or of the new moon or of the sabbath days which are a shadow of things to come but the body is of christ you see a shadow has no substance the sabbath was a sign to us that god jesus does all the work to save us if we attempt to do anything to earn salvation we are like the man who picked up some sticks on the sabbath and came under the wrath of god passerby jesus was crucified on the day before the th day sabbath this is why the women came early sunday morning to the tomb with spices because they had no time to prepare the body because of the th day sabbath luke jesus was in the tomb from friday afternoon until early sunday morning beause christ arose from the dead on sunday christians hold sunday as the sabbath day today in isaiah we read if thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath from doing thy pleasure on my holy day and call the sabbath a delight the holy of the lord honourable and shalt honour him not doing thine own ways nor finding thine own pleasure nor speaking thine own words then shalt thou delight thyself in the lord and i will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth and feed thee with the heritage of jacob thy father for the mouth of the lord hath spoken it do you see the difference between the th day sabbath and the sunday sabbath the people were commanded to fast and afflict themselves on the th day sabbath not so on the sunday sabbath christians are to praise and thank god they are to proclaim the glorious gospel to the world recall when god created the world on the first day sunday god created light this was a picture showing us that on sunday we are to send the gospel light into the world in matthew we read in the end of the sabbath as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week came mary magdalene and the other mary to see the sepulchre if we go back to the greek the verse shuld read in the end of the sabbaths as it began to dawn on the first of the sabbaths in matthew the translators made an error with the word sabbath it is a plural word in both instances the translators made an error in making sabbath singular therefore we have one era of sabbaths ending the th day sabbaths and a new era or sabbaths beginning the sunday sabbaths the translators did and exceelent job in the king james bible but sometimes they did not do their homework correctly did you forget the one about denying jesus came in the flesh hence the roman catholic belief that mary was sinless and if so jesus could not be born in the flesh i think you did and no i'm not deceived
