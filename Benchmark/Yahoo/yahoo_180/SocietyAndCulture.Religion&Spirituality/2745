so what you are saying is that by making movies about real life murders we are not setting the belief of evil most people live their entire lives without becoming famous or being recognized in any way shape or form yet i believe that some out there will see the potential to be famous just by killing people hell if they do a really nasty rampage they'll even get a movie made about them if they are arrested alive then they stand a chance of someone writing their autobiography and making money off of the proceeds but your only answers are its the parents fault and not the systems america the land of the free has got to be the home of the anti christ a country born in blood of its natives in the name of god this country's citizens needs to wake up and take responsibilities for their own actions and quit trying to pass the buck we as parents can only do so much especially when our own system is taking so much authority away from the parents but leaving us with the responsibility of our kids actions sweetheart oy what's to keep anyone from going on a killing rampage just because it might get them a bit of time in the spotlight let's see perhaps their conscience knowing right from wrong and a respect for life anyone who turns into a cold blooded murderer or serial killer has a lack of one or all of those ofttimes they're just plain out of their mind movies don't make murderers neither do video or computer games books or music it isn't necessarily the parent s ' fault either things just happen to the brain sometimes the reason that so many killers have extreme accounts of abuse physical sexual or psychological in their past is because those things can break and warp a person's mind especially a child who doesn't have any kind of defence against it Theory of conduct Video game controversy Evil Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Ten Commandments EastEnders Serial killer Capital punishment Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Soul Simone Weil Alignment (role-playing games) Divorce Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Humphrey Bogart Immortality Domestic violence Infantilism Bob and George Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Summa Theologiae Sin City Free will Original sin Sant Thakar Singh Social rule Knots Landing Philosophy of language Pitaten Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Jack Thompson American Psycho Blood (computer game) Alcoholics Anonymous Conscience Polyamory Johnny the Homicidal Maniac A Course In Miracles Dennis Rader Shadow the Hedgehog Justification (theology) Separation of church and state Dualism (philosophy of mind) Kill Bill Legacy of Kain Intelligent design The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Laura Schlessinger The nature of God in Western theology Scientology beliefs and practices Murder Milton H.
