what is different between christian and jews a christian believes that christ was born of the virgin mary and is god in carnate they also believe that w o christ you can not get to heaven this is all in the bible that is why christians believe this however the jews do not believe the bible they drew up the koran sp this is the old testament of the bible with added guidelines to ensure the old law is not broken in their eyes jesus is not the savior just a prophet the irony is that of all people the jews should know and believe about christ because it has been taught to them and their ancestors actually spoke with jesus and saw his miracles etc they just hardened their hearts to him not all of course but the majority the ones that actually thought they were protecting the old testament therefore they themselves miss the salvation that is right in front of them Abrahamic religion Christianity Jesus New Testament view on Jesus' life Resurrection of Jesus Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Ten Commandments Holy Spirit Prophet Sin Christ Trinity Salvation Messiah Paul of Tarsus Mary, the mother of Jesus Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Christian eschatology Dispensationalism Fundamentalism Cultural and historical background of Jesus Sabbath Old Testament Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Eastern Orthodox Church New Testament Mary Magdalene Gospel of John Historical Jesus Apocrypha Divine grace Book of Mormon Historicity of Jesus Religious conversion Bible Messianic Judaism Antinomianism Baptism Christianity and anti-Semitism Angel Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Icon History of Christianity A Course In Miracles Biblical canon Miracle Gospel of Barnabas Chosen people Names and titles of Jesus Martin Luther Church of Christ, Scientist Religion Isa Great Apostasy Rapture Evangelicalism Resurrection Church of Christ Mormonism and Christianity Roman Catholic Church Gospel of Thomas Christian and Missionary Alliance Christian Jewish Messiah Book of Revelation Book of Daniel Liberal Christianity Revelation Saint James the Just Kingdom of Heaven Perpetual virginity of Mary Independent Christian Churches/Churches of Christ John the Baptist Christian denomination Heresy Nation of Islam Moses Soul Mormonism and Judaism Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Epistle to the Romans Idolatry in Christianity Gospel of Matthew Christian views of women Qur'an Prophets of Islam Justification (theology) Christian apologetics God the Father Original sin
