preachers of evolution why is it that when you are faced with a set of questions you can not answer you in your enlighten way resort to name calling or attacking the questioner on a personal level look at some of your answers do you enjoy making yourselves look stupid or something ah my ignorant and yet seemingly self important friend when you put your inflated ego aside and actually begin to learn to think you might find it desirable to read some simple and basic science text books i love it when you conquer your self created straw men of evolution your little face looks so happy does this really show your keen intellect or do you just believe in your religion because its primary purpose is to tear down all others therefor you are completely incapable of logical debate and anyone who disagrees with your viewpoint is wrong for no other reason than you say so alleninthehills i agree that some of the remarks you quote are rather harsh i think that the evolutionists who said this were probably just frustrated that perhaps you were not trying to see their side as much as they want you to when people on two sides of a debate have completely opposite views and it seems that one side is not listening to the other it's easy for people to get personal and unnecessarily demeaning to each other plenty of us evolutionists are capable of logical debate i am someone who believes in evolution although i think this terminology is misleading because evolution does not require belief and i also try to be respectful towards everyone and their opinions if you have points you'd like to make and feel that perhaps others are not addressing your points i'm happy to discuss these things with you without getting personal you've simply brought up a touchy subject and it's easy for people to get riled up Atheism Goodness and value theory Sexual orientation Meaning of life A Course In Miracles Intelligent design movement Economics Creationism Theory of conduct Objectivist philosophy Religion Religious Society of Friends Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Deconstruction Philosophy of language Intelligent design Jewish principles of faith Creation-evolution controversy Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Altruism Nicomachean Ethics Current teachings of Prem Rawat Past teachings of Prem Rawat Friedrich Schleiermacher Socrates Philosophy Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Utilitarianism Originalism Summa Theologiae Epistemology Theodicy Evolutionary creationism Talmud Biblical inerrancy Free will Sociocultural evolution Charles Darwin's views on religion David Hume The Skeptical Environmentalist Phillip E.
