if public schools believe in diversity why do they make christian childeren feel like freaks if public schools enjoy diversity why do they push their it's okay to be gay agenda on me and their evolution agenda on me i am sick of feeling like a freak because i don't waver in my beliefs they tell me i am brainwashed i tell them i was baptized in the name of jesus and i have not been brainwashed i have been blood washed i am now home schooled and plan on graduating that way just because i think the act of being gay is a sin doesnt mean i hate gay people true christians dont judge or bash anybody cuz one sin is as bad as all anyway if they are supposed to be so diverse why are christian beliefs not allowed in most schools i would have got detention for praying over my meal at lunch they promote bullying because they are bullying me for my beliefs this is not diversity they make everyone feel like freaks first of all no one likes high school except for the people that are going to go on to fail because they had it easy in high school that said though you are absolutely right in that they should spend less time telling people what to believe and more time actually you know teaching things public school tries to take up as much of your life as it can if you ever end up needing a job before you graduate or have any obligations at home or outside of school wave bye bye to your diploma with everything they're teaching us about what we're supposed to think about everyone who isn't a straight white christian male i'm the first two myself and i think you should be free to be a christian if you want without anyone making you miserable for it they've forgotten how to give people a decent education and just tell kids sure you're smart gifted and talented you doesn't need to waste time on books they don't think we're making people give up their own time which they might need to watch a stupid play parroting the same crap we've thrown at them the last three thousand times no they think what a wonderful three hour equal opportunity program of course we'll send everyone to it i disagree with your feeling singled out diversity is the schools way of singling almost everyone out and making them feel miserable and we'd be better off when the school cares less about controlling our free time and personalities and just started teaching us the skills we're going to need as adults when you raise one person above everyone else you've made your entire school except for one person miserable and the person who you raised is going to expect to have it that easy their whole life diversity is just a kind way of saying setting kids up to fail Theory of conduct Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Roman Catholic Church Salvation Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Homeschooling Baptism Jehovah's Witnesses Jon Secada The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Ten Commandments Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Social rule Eastern Orthodox Church Soul God Education in the United States Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Original sin Homosexuality and Christianity Religious conversion Pitaten Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Education in the People's Republic of China Christianity Poker jargon Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Religious Society of Friends Resurrection of Jesus Church of Christ Divine grace Justification (theology) Paul of Tarsus Rich Mullins The nature of God in Western theology Craps Leviathan (book) Aesthetic Realism Holy Spirit Catechism The Amber Spyglass A Course In Miracles Futurama (TV series - season 2) Merit Church of Christ, Scientist William A.
