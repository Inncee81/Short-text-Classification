can god autoreplicate i e can he make another independant god or rather can he create perfection at all afterall the implication from christians is that only god is perfect and i'll agree that this world has nothing resembling perfection in it so why the freg doesn't it either god didn't want to make a perfect world which begs the question of what such a choice was meant to achieve or couldn't but anyhow think of the implications if the christian god could and did make a perfect replica of himself i mean all us folks on the athiestic end of the spectrum wouldn't even notice any difference but the religious folks would go totally nuts nubian are you asking why of god's actions the inevitable answer to that question is it is part of his plan followed by waggling of the fingers to make it seem all mysterious and stuff nobody knows why god does stuff he just does assume that he just would autoreplicate for some unknown reason jamesmom tell that to the blind spot in my eyes my coxxyx or my cross bite perfection implies flawlessness and i know for a fact that i'm full of flaws by anyone's definition as is everything else around me dude this is an awesome question if he really is all powerful he should be able to correct but then if there are two gods could they fight would the original be superior this is my favorite question ever and i commend you furthermore any god that makes you bow to him is not a good god at all but a pretentious egomaniacal powerfiend a real god i think would be tired of submission and would prefer the companionship a peer would provide good one chief Theodicy Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Predestination Rich Mullins Ontological argument Violin The nature of God in Western theology Creationism A Course In Miracles Summa Theologiae Original sin Fundamentalism Transcendental argument for the existence of God Existence of God Evil Biblical inerrancy Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Coercion Supernatural Free will Theory of conduct Intelligent design God Simone Weil Religion Sola fide Sin Presuppositional apologetics Microeconomics Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Soul Infant baptism Trinity Atheism Kyle Broflovski G__del's incompleteness theorem Islamic philosophy Democracy Friedrich Schleiermacher Alcoholics Anonymous Philosophy of mathematics Justification (theology) Nation of Islam Jewish principles of faith Resurrection of Jesus Ascetical theology Omnipotence Autism Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Philo Goodness and value theory Patriotism Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Infantilism Problem of Hell Salvation Urantia Baptism Deconstruction Theology Appeal Leviathan (book) Meaning of life Rei Ayanami English verbs Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Philosophy of religion God Emperor of Dune Causality Piccolo Junior Saga Themes in Blade Runner Gesture Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Merit Bhagavad Gita Transsexuality Jacob Neusner Scientology beliefs and practices Vacuous truth Maimonides Vegeta G-Man (Half-Life) Eastern Orthodox Church The Da Vinci Code English grammar Eric Cartman Originalism Satanism Ten Commandments Intelligent design movement Pascal's Wager Philosophy Young Earth creationism Objectivist philosophy Agnosticism Species
