what is it that you do not agree with concerning jehovahs witnesses please be honest and give me some real reasons dont just tell me you think they are dummies if you claim to be a christian but believe jws are not christians tell me why yes music abc i am but i dont get offended easily so speak your mind to be considered a cult you have to have one leader that leads the group or congragation like a pastor or priest jws have a body of elders that take the lead so actuall y most christian denomination would fill that requirement as being a cult jehovahs witness do believe they found the true religion jesus spoke of that is why most of them were actaully converts from other religions so yes they believe they are a privilaged people jesus only said their is one truth but then again everyone has the same choice to accept it so why get upset yes joshua i will look into that thank you kayla the america thing you are talking about is concerning mormons you have you preaching religions confused lol my parents raised me in a jehovah's witness household since i was born i went to meetings times a week and went out in service occasionally until i was now that i am an adult i don't attend the meetings anymore or associate with any jehovah's witnesses except for my sister who is baptized i don't have any bad feelings towards jehovah's witnesses at all i think they are kind and honest people if i had to put my life in the hands of a stranger i'd make sure it was a jehovah's witness i don't understand people's opinions of jehovah's witnesses when they are bad or angry i don't know what would inspire that i have always experienced good things with them not to mention that some of the nicest people i know my grandma sister are jehovah's witnesses jehovah's witnesses are christians and anyone who actually knew anything about the religion would know that most of the opinions on this page are unfounded most people don't know much about jehovah's witnesses and that becomes very apparent in reading most of these comments it isn't an insult just encouragement to learn more about what you think you can comment on the reason jehovah's witnesses go out in service is to share knowledge with you it's like this if you knew something and you truly believed it and you knew it would save lives you'd want to tell as many people as you could to save their lives jehovah's witnesses spend a lot of time studying the bible and learning more and more and they are trying to share their knowledge so that it can help others that's why they go door to door they believe in god but in reading the bible have come to the conclusion that jesus is not god but god's son taken from the bible there is no other way to look at it jehovah's witnesses haven't written their own bible either some of these comments on here are very ignorant if you look at the bible and all that it says you will see that jehovah's witnesses are the rare religion that actually follows the bible when the bible speaks against fornication and homosexuality most other religions ignore it read the bible and compare what god asks of us to what each religion asks of it's followers you'd be surprised Church of Christ Organizational structure of Jehovah's Witnesses Christianity Prophet Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Book of Mormon Ten Commandments Abrahamic religion Persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses Restorationism Homosexuality and Christianity A Course In Miracles Mormonism and Christianity Fundamentalism Holy Spirit Church of Christ, Scientist God Religion Resurrection of Jesus Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Trinity Sabbath Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Religious perspectives on Jesus Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Biblical canon Eucharist Excommunication New Testament Theory of conduct Charles Taze Russell Jesus Baptist History of the Latter Day Saint movement Opus Dei History of the English Bible Bible and reincarnation New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures Paul of Tarsus Judaism Infant baptism John the Baptist Jehovah Plame affair Blacks and Mormonism Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Historical Jesus Alan Campbell (pastor) Great Apostasy Soul Religious pluralism Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Iglesia ni Cristo Biblical inerrancy Tetragrammaton Christian eschatology Creationism Cult Mary, the mother of Jesus Divine grace Idolatry Mormon Priesthood (Mormonism) Eastern Orthodox Church Chosen people Satan Missionary Criticism of Mormonism Urantia Anti-Mormonism John Howard Yoder Christian denomination Persecution of Christians Supernatural Herbert W.
