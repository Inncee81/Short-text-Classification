a question for muslims and the holy bible my question is since the abrahamic religions judaism christianity and islam all monotheistic faiths believe in the story of creation in the book of genesis why don't you quote scripture from the tanach rather than the q'uran do you believe that the oral law was given to moses do you believe in the exodus and do you believe god had choses the jews to be a light to the gentile world regarding god and the saviour jesus christ and didn't the arabs follow judiasm before islam came to be thanks bismillahi rahmani rahim in the name of allah the beneficent the merciful hello it is true that the three religions judaism christianity and islam all spring from the same source that is revelation from allah he revealed the torah to moses the injeel gospel to jesus and the qur'an to muhammad may allah's peace and blessings be upon them all we muslims believe that though the previous books were true we no longer have the original torah or injeel and what we have now is a mixture of what may be original and much more that was corrupted by the hand of man this is why we don't refer at all to the previous scriptures of the torah and injeel we say if it agrees with what the qur'an says it is true if it disagrees with what the qur'an says it is corrupted and if it neither agrees or disagrees we say it may be true or it may be false and we leave it at that it is not necessary for a muslim to be conversant with the previous scriptures in order to lead a fully religious life we have the qur'an still in its original form as when it was revealed and that is enough for us you will find a lot of muslims who do know the bible because the were originally jews or christians and converted to islam we do believe that there was some oral law given to moses like the sunnah of the prophet muhammad that expands and expounds on lessons and laws in the qur'an we don't have that information anymore what exists today as the talmud is the creation of rabbis throughout the ages we do believe in the exodus it is described in detail in the qur'an we believe that allah chose individuals from among the bani israel as prophets and messengers but that his covenant was only with those who worshipped him and since there were good pious jews and bad jews that the covenant was not for the whole jewish people for all time indeed the covenant was completely ended when jesus the final prophet for bani israel was rejected there was a passage of time until the final prophet arose in arabia and brought the final message islam which actually was exactly the same message brought by moses and jesus there is only one god creator and sustainer of the universe we don't believe in the diety of jesus but we do believe he was a miracle and is a prophet we don't believe in original sin so we have no need for a redeemer or an intercessor every human has equal access to his lord the arabs were mostly pagan before the advent of islam though there were some who were monotheists and there were tribes of jews in arabia as well well that's about all i can manage in this short time and space i do hope you continue to learn about islam and please continue to ask questions i pray that allah guides you to that which is best in this world and the next ameen fi aman allah nancy umm abdel hamid
