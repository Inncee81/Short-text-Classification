catholics how do clergy promotions work i mean i see priests on tv and they're always old but then i see bishops and archbishops and cardinals and all and they're all old like the same age so my questions are what are the ranks of clergy bishop cardinal etc in order how does a member of the catholic clergy rise in the ranks i know someone has to be voted pope by the cardinals when the previous pope dies but how in general do people rise from priest to whatever and bishop to archbishop and through the other ranks deacon greek diakonos from the bible priest greek presbyteros from the bible bishop greek episkopos from the bible this is the hierarchy already described in acts in the bible other titles are honorary for example cardinals are just bishops but they can vote in a conclave the pope is actually a bishop too but since his diocese is rome where peter last ministered he is the successor of peter and therefore pope an arch bishop is just a bishop of a large diocese but it comes back down to the main three above the catholic church today is hierarchical just like the church began in the bible edit to howard t you would be hard pressed to find a more learned or brilliant man than john paul ii or benedict xvi Roman Catholic Church Holy Orders Pope Clergy Papal election Cardinal (Catholicism) College of Cardinals Catholicism Pope John Paul II Society of St. Pius X Sedevacantism Second Vatican Council Roman Catholic Diocese of Honolulu Ordination of women Pope Benedict XVI Cardinal Priest Abbot Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal Opus Dei Papal Inauguration Papal conclave, 2005 Mass (liturgy) Papal Tiara Bernard Cardinal Law Ecclesiastical court Eastern Orthodox Church Funeral of Pope John Paul II Vestment Marcel Lefebvre William Joseph Levada Vatican City Sede vacante George Cardinal Pell Primate (religion) Clerical celibacy Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Dubuque Francis Cardinal George William Wakefield Cardinal Baum Pope Damasus I Filioque clause Francis Cardinal Arinze Angelo Cardinal Sodano Edmund Cardinal Szoka Ecumenical council Minister of religion John Chrysostom Sydney Anglicans Biography of Pope John Paul II Eastern Rite Presbyter Pope Paul VI John Wycliffe Avignon Papacy Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago Angelo Cardinal Scola True Catholic Church Robert Bellarmine Mariavite Church Jaime Cardinal Sin Traditionalist Catholic Cormac Cardinal Murphy-O'Connor Anglicanism John Henry Cardinal Newman Civil Constitution of the Clergy Catholic Church in Great Britain Protestant Reformation Tridentine Mass Syro-Malabar Catholic Church Church of England Papal conclave, 1878 Pope Clement X Stanis__aw Dziwisz Roman Catholicism's links with political authorities Scottish Episcopal Church Bishop of Utrecht First Council of Nicaea Biblical canon Martin Luther Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association Lucian Pulvermacher Pietro Damiani Pope John XXIII Pope Pius XII Homosexuality and Christianity Godfried Cardinal Danneels Timeline of Christianity Saint Peter Hussite Franciszek Cardinal Macharski Jerome Roger Cardinal Mahony
