is the bible a test i am a christian and have read the bible i don't read it every day and don't pretend that i know everything about it it seems to me that the bible is kind of a test though it says we should not judge we should love those without sin can cast the first stone i believe these things however other people that claim to be christians are always judging gay people or people who are living in sin i hear all the time from people that gay people are going to hell they need to change their ways isn't it true that god loves everyone and is willing to forgive all of us for our sins isn't it true that even though the bible tells us it is wrong to be homosexual that maybe that is a guideline and does not mean we have the right to judge those who chose the lifestyle maybe it is a test to see if we will allow things in the bible to create hate in our hearts or if we will see the big picture and love everyone regardless allowing god to be our only judge it's worth thinking about it's a test no one ever passes because we only take the parts we like the best Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Ten Commandments Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sin Homosexuality and Christianity Sabbath God Theory of conduct Theodicy John the Baptist Repentance Book of Isaiah Hell Westboro Baptist Church (Topeka) John Howard Yoder Homosexuality and Judaism Summa Theologiae Devil Criticisms of Christianity EastEnders Salvation Church of Christ Book of Mormon Charles Grandison Finney Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Religion and sexual orientation Prophet Anglican views of homosexuality Christian anarchism Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Infant baptism Idolatry Church of Christ, Scientist Philosophical skepticism Bible Jewish principles of faith Purgatory Merit Christian views of Jesus Eastern Orthodox Church Theology Human sexual behavior Capital punishment Paradise Lost Original sin Avenue Q Leviathan (book) Urantia Christianity Religion Reincarnation Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Divine grace Calvinism Jewish views of religious pluralism Jon Secada Anti-gay slogan Great Apostasy Religious conversion Alan Campbell (pastor) Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Liberal Christianity Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Satan Old Testament Origin belief Angels in America Hades Fred Phelps Humphrey Bogart Justification (theology) Same-sex marriage Presuppositional apologetics Friends Qiyamah Abrahamic religion Soul Rastafari movement Satanism Martin Luther Teach the Controversy Perseverance of the saints Biblical inerrancy The nature of God in Western theology Homosexuality Fundamentalism The Amber Spyglass Angel Apocalypse Nation of Islam Religious Society of Friends Chosen people Meaning of life
