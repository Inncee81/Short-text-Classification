fellow christians some questions on bible versions i've noticed this morning that a lot of christians seem to think that the kjv is the original translation of the bible i think i even saw one person say it's the original version ok yeah i know i'm slow don't know why it took me this long to notice p so my questions are who is teaching this falsehood and why is nobody correcting the error when we see it or am i misreading these answers i am not bashing anyone i'm just curious ok i guess i need to elaborate a little i know that the kjv was first published by royal edict in i know that it was translated by scholars from the original hebrew aramaic and greek what i don't know is why people think this is the original translation when it wasn't even the original english translation sahar ok but who taught you that man of ideas gft what did i miss there faw kif ino thank you for your honest answer btw did i say aribic if i did i meant aremaic if you have learned today blessed be and if i was the agent of that knowledge then i am honored to have been of service istvan c you make an excellent point thank you rhonda f excellent and very informative history thank you very much for taking the time to put all that down i wish i could give you more than one thumb up for that answer you definitely deserve it soul reaper thank you for your input i do wish that in the time it took you to come up with a sarcastic answer and attempt to insult me you could have used your brain for a more researched intelligent and relevant answer i did not give you a thumb for your answer because you did not even attempt to answer any of my questions may you learn the peace of our lord and savior god be with you thank you all for your answers i'm going to leave this question open for a while in case anybody else decides to add or edit peace to you all there is a lot of really good info and history here maybe we should make this question a part of the indoctrination process hehehe j k but seriously for those of you who think the kjv was the first english translation please read some of the links provided in the answers it wasn't i was the first authorized english version meaning it was the first english version authorized for use in the anglican community my thanks to all of you who took the time to research and answer it's going to be really hard to pick a best answer god be with you all some people have fallen into the trap of being kjv only because they have listened to preachers who instead of teaching about jesus get their congregations stirred up by claiming that the devil is out to trick people by giving them perverted versions of the bible the kjv is a fine translation that has fewer errors than many other translations but it's authors never claimed divine inspiration for their work of translation and there are errors in it here's a simple example romans likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered none of those peachers would say that the holy spirit is an it but one of the persons of the trinity here's a more accurate rendering of the greek esv romans likewise the spirit helps us in our weakness for we do not know what to pray for as we ought but the spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words History of the English Bible Holy Spirit King-James-Only Movement Mary, the mother of Jesus A Course In Miracles Biblical inerrancy Mass (liturgy) Bible Trinity Tetragrammaton Sola fide Great Apostasy Biblical canon Apocrypha Catechism Book of Mormon Linguistics and the Book of Mormon Creationism New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints God God and gender Hell Soul Book of Isaiah Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Free will Eastern Orthodox Church Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Bishop Infant baptism Original sin History of Christianity Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Justification (theology) Paul of Tarsus Church of Christ Divine grace Christian views of Jesus Psalms Salvation Sabbath Martin Luther Church of Christ, Scientist Zohar Talmud Ten Commandments Angel Bible translations Religious Society of Friends Aramaic of Jesus Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Names of God in Judaism Religion Revised Standard Version Opus Dei Vulgate Historical Jesus Intelligent design John Howard Yoder Philipp Melanchthon Mormonism and Christianity John Wesley Binitarianism Gospel Mary Magdalene Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Yeshu Eusebius of Caesarea Christian anarchism Nation of Islam Names and titles of Jesus Christianity Predestination Moses Baptism Christ John Wycliffe Hebrew name Nontrinitarianism Saint Philo Sanctification Christian Catholicism Judaism Prayer Religious conversion Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible Dispensationalism
