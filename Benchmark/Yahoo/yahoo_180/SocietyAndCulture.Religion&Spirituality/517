i just saw a book at cvs called the davinci deception it claims that it is the truth behind the fiction of the davinchi code it claims that it proves that dan brown intentionaly blurred the lines between history and fiction but the davinchi code was a fiction novel it was sole in the fiction section not the history section it was advertised as a fiction mystery novel so what exactaly are we trying to expose here that dan brown wrote a fiction novel i figured that out by the advertiseing on the novel itself pangel i agree that he took real events and wrote a fictional story around them to do this you cannot help but blur the lines between reality and fiction but the end result will be fiction i could see a rebuttal of this nature against 'holy blood holy grail the book that brown got much of his information from it actually claims that the jesus had a wife and child theory is true but to the davinchi code was clearly fiction it said so on the cover of the book art historical data can be accurate right up untill the time that religious or fictional storyline is added to make it interresting for ex if he says in the knights templar left france and headed for england that could be a fact when he talks about what they did on the way that is fictional storyline not an actual part of the book just an example the statement is correct dan brown intentionaly blurred the lines between history and fiction and he did it well you can pick it apart and study the fact from fiction there are some in there i would say it is about fiction fact The Da Vinci Code Holy Blood, Holy Grail Holy Grail Priory of Sion Dan Brown Resurrection of Jesus Plame affair The Bible and history Creation science Urantia Book of Daniel Rennes-le-Ch__teau Jesus Apocalypse Theory Biblical inerrancy Scientific method A Course In Miracles Crime fiction Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Supernatural Science fiction Foucault's Pendulum (book) Reality The Historian Causality Historicity of Jesus Digimon Book of Mormon John Lott Messianic Judaism Alan Campbell (pastor) House of Leaves Conspiracy theory Mythology Modal logic Glen Jacobs Church of Christ, Scientist Eucharist John Titor Philosophy of science Natural deduction Slander and libel 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, exit polls Acts of the Apostles David Hume Fiction Homosexuality and Christianity New Testament Mind control Preacher (comics) Canon (fiction) Ordo Templi Orientis Science Hyperion Cantos Kuzari A Series of Unfortunate Events Debugging Fantasy Science fiction film Time travel Esotericism Killian documents Rosslyn Chapel The nature of God in Western theology Religion Imaginary antecedent Inherit the Wind UK Singles Chart Roswell UFO incident Freemasonry Noob Saibot Teach the Controversy Illuminati Mary, the mother of Jesus Real number Peter Pan Resident Evil Creation according to Genesis Shroud of Turin Trinity Antichrist Laura Schlessinger David Journalism ethics and standards Philosophy of language Jews as a chosen people Monty Python Book of Esther Leonardo da Vinci Philosophy of mathematics Magic (illusion) Pierre Plantard Iconoclasm Goldstein's book Originalism
