why are you an atheist if your not an atheist then obviously this question does not apply to you and please spare me all the flying spaghetti monster talk i m an atheist as well i just want to know your reasons first you have to define the term god the problem with most theists is that this term is a moving target in addition because there is no evidence either for or against the existence of god you cannot use deductive logic a b c therefore c b a you can only reach a conclusion by inductive reasoning using the balance of evidence of a is also b c is b so the chances are that c is also a so to begin with i will assert and others may shoot this down that the only relevant definition of god states that god intervenes to circumvent natural laws if god circumvents natural laws then it becomes impossible to understand natural laws all scientific findings would have to include the stipulation it is also possible that these results are an act of god a miracle thereby making our research meaningless however we have been able to expand our knowledge of natural laws evidenced by every appliance in your kitchen therefore because the scientific method leads to applicable discoveries and the likely conclusion is that god at least the intervening kind does not exist additionally if god is defined as all loving all powerful and all knowing then it is impossible to explain suffering either god is not all loving he acts sadistically not all powerful he cannot prevent suffering or not all knowing he created suffering by mistake because he didn't know the consequences of his actions a god who is not all loving all powerful or all knowing is also not sufficient for the definition of god because any god that fails to meet these criteria becomes bound by rules that are greater than god if god is bound by external rules and or does not intervene in our existence then god is either non existent or irrelevant the classic bertrand russell argument is that i cannot prove that a china teapot is orbiting the sun between the earth's orbit and mars but while i cannot prove this is not true the evidence against it is compelling the evidence against god is equally compelling and while it is not possible to prove beyond any doubt it makes enormously more sense to live your life as if there were no god it is more compelling to me that humans have invented god a to help people deal with the pain and fear associated with death and loss and b to reflect the thoughts of the ruling powers in a particular time humans are always searching for explanations when none were found it was the natural inclination to declare that the cause of the unexplained was god or gods as the faith grew miracles coincidences and laws were ascribed to this divinity and an orthodoxy grew up around it now it seems unhelpful to believe in such superstition the only matters that aid in our ongoing well being are work location health sustenance and pure blind luck so that's why i'm an atheist hope this meets your needs Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Agnosticism Logic Falsifiability Scientific method Creationism Problem of evil Evolutionary creationism Causality Bertrand Russell God Philosophy of mathematics Summa Theologiae Science Strong atheism Meaning of life Miracle The nature of God in Western theology Cosmological argument Creation-evolution controversy Sin Simone Weil Transcendental argument for the existence of God Utilitarianism Philosophy of science Existentialism Intelligent design movement Gravity Creation science Evil Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Duties of the Heart Expert system Natural deduction Merit Trinity Justification (theology) Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Atomism Biblical inerrancy Democracy A Course In Miracles Appeal Al-Ghazali Occam's Razor Theory of conduct S__ren Kierkegaard Victor Cousin Flood geology Philosophy Teleological argument Contract Phaedo Species Afterlife Origin belief Karl Popper Johannes Kepler Philosophical skepticism G__del's incompleteness theorem Bah__'__ Faith and Science Intellectual property Abortion debate Christianity Age of Enlightenment Original sin Religious conversion Philosophical Investigations Soul Jewish philosophy Bayesian inference Theistic realism Ontological argument Human Deconstruction Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica Philosophy of language Argument from morality Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Philipp Melanchthon Sexual orientation Phillip E.
