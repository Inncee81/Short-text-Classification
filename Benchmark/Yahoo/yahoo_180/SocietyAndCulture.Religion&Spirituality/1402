for those of you who say pregnancy is not a gift from god do you believe in abortions should abortions be legal the entire pregnancy then i mean do these people believe abortions are a correct way of birth control some places will do abortions up to weeks i know what molar pregnancy is i am wondering what is moral since you asked if i heard of it i never said i believe or not i am simple asking a question to see peoples opinions if your insulted don't answer i am not saying it is right or worng just merly asking i am atheist therefore i do not believe that pregnancy is a gift from god since i do not believe that god exists i am morally against abortion i would personally never have an abortion i believe that it is morally wrong to prevent the life of an unborn child there are plenty of other alternatives but i do not believe that just because i find abortion to be morally wrong that it should be illegal i do not desire to legistlate my beliefs i do think that abortion should be more closely controlled and prevented though i believe abortion should only be allowed in specific cases such as rape incest or fatal harm to the mother and that perhaps the mother of the unborn child should be required to receive counceling before making any decision it is simply not a black and white issue i think each case should be examined individually i do not think that any woman girl should be able to walk into an abortion clinic and be allowed to get an abortion with no previous treatment it is a major decision that should not be taken lightly as far as abortions being legal the entire pregnancy my opinion is absolutely not Abortion Abortion in the United States Roe v.
