why do religious christian types condemn whole groups of people but they are not particularly interested in following the example of jesus christ who they claim to hold in such high regard in my opinion for example taking a life a doctor who performs abortions capital punishment refusing health care to the needy supporting war charity fair taxation in proportion to income helping those in need truth holding religious and political leaders to the highest degree of honesty and integrity lying cheating sexual misconduct against children by the priesthood then covered up or paying off victims not to prosecute where is the judgment there is it more important to point out who is gay and who is not a member of your faith and how they are immoral and destined to go to hell when they die aren't there more important issues that you all ignore while you point fingers where you have no business passing judgment why do some there are a whole lot of rural americans and not surprisingly some staunch republicans posing as religious warriors doing god's work while only pointing out and discriminating those that they disagree with this is not an unfair portrayal this site has many discussions about how evil and dammned atheists agnostics jews hindus gays are and how they're all going to hell listen to the type of abuse that is dished out to all these groups here and in the streets of the poorest least educated states in america i am christian but certainly not your typical christian not by a long shot lol i think many christians especially very conservative zealous ones are ultimately very close minded and often brainwashed by hateful dogma instead of helping the poor they want to abolish all welfare and medical programs instead of wanting peaceful resolutions they crave war obviously i can see where you are coming from it has a lot to do with blind loyalty blind loyalty to a church blind loyalty to a pastor a preacher a priest a rabbi blind loyalty to the bible which did not fall from the sky written by the hand of god so instead of thinking for themselves and considering logic and rationality they choose to have their thoughts dictated to them by corrupt men who run corrupt churches and write corrupted holy works in doing this they adopt the attitudes that are fed to them hatred of gays hatred of other religions and cultures hatred of knowledge hatred of questions and doubts hatred of certain groups for one reason or another in my humble opinion we should try our hardest not to judge others and for goodness sake use our brains if god is a god of love he does not hate gay people if god is all knowing all powerful and can be whatever he wants who are we to decide that he didn't appear differently to different cultures for an example think of it this way santa claus in america he is often depicted as a jolly fat older man in a red suit with a beard in the black community santa often looks black in russia he appears thin with long icy blue robes maybe god appeared differently to different people to some he appeared as a woman the goddess to some he appeared as a sky god odin zeus to some he may look arabic jesus was a middle easterner yet in america he is depicted as caucasian but i digress and i am going off on a tangent my point is this why would god give us the capacity to reason to think to question to doubt to love to understand if he never meant for us to utilize such qualities why would a god of love be depicted as a wrathful hateful being bent on hellfire and vengeance there in lies the problem christians who
