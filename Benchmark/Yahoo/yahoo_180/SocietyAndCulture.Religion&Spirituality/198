how do i begin speaking to others when evangelizing i know that god has called me to make disciples in my school i have no idea how to begin the conversation my idea was talking to different person about god every week i know most will turn away but if i am able to bring at least one person to god let god be blessed so how do i begin talking about god i just got back from a mission trip and i really am committed and want to be a humble and obediant servent of god so even if it maybe embarassing i don't care so you can give me any answer jesus said take care that you do not plan in advance what to say because the holy spirit will instruct you at that time what to say so you see jesus actually exhorts us not to plan how we evangelize we are to trust that the power of the holy spirit will be enough to instruct our tongue at the right moment that is true faith don't worry about planning just pray and have faith that your father will be with you when you speak Holy Spirit Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Sola fide John Howard Yoder Roman Catholic Church Catechism Trinity Pentecostalism Justification (theology) Mary, the mother of Jesus Ten Commandments Eastern Orthodox Church Eucharist Holiness movement Christianity John Wesley Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Opus Dei Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Baptism Mass (liturgy) Saint Book of Isaiah Richard Allen (reverend) Papal Infallibility Christian views of Jesus Salvation Religious Society of Friends Nontrinitarianism Alan Campbell (pastor) Catholicism Priesthood (Mormonism) Christian eschatology Mormonism and Christianity Faustyna Kowalska Charismatic Theosis John Wycliffe Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Religious pluralism Protestantism Evangelical Presbyterian Church Rule of St Benedict Christian and Missionary Alliance Summa Theologiae Second Vatican Council Christian views of women Abrahamic religion Church of Christ, Scientist Messiah Church of Christ Divine grace Martin Luther Infant baptism Evangelicalism Calvinism Aramaic of Jesus God and gender William M.
