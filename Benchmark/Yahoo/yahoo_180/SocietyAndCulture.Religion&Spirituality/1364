i need advice what do you see what would you do i did not have a restful night last night while i was doing laundry i discovered one of my crucifixes that hangs above the garage door missing i have a total of crucifixes in the house one above the front door one above the fireplace one above the garage door and one to wear that my goddaughter gave me that lays on the counter at this moment i asked my husband if he knew where it was if he happened to knock it down or maybe it fell he behaved as though he did not know what happened to it i continued to ask him where it was it is securely placed up above the door so i know for a fact it did not fall he then went into this interrogation mode of me what does that cross mean to you what is it's significance to you he would not answer my questions about where the crucifix was and i asked him why he was answering my questions with questions i did not let up he continued to question me about what it meant to me and it was not longer mine but ours and if it belonged to both of us he should be allowed to take it down i told him that the crucifixes were up before he moved in after we got married he continued to turn the tables i felt the questioning was irrelevant and a diversion i told him he would not understand what it meant to me and then he turned it and said that i was implying he was too dumb to understand i never said such a thing he finally went into the garage where he had placed my crucifix in a basket of his junk yes my husband is supposed to be a christian he serves on the worship team as a musician and music developper he stated that he was feeling crucified in our house how dare he compare anything he is going through in our marriage with christ's crucifixion and if he was feeling crucified perhaps he needed to examine the things he was doing to me that would make him feel that way things are very one sided in our relationship and i have not said a whole lot about things i could speak up about i cried for three hours i finally went to bed at am my eyes are really swollen this morning i had to take a valium so i could sleep i have never been so hurt it was like it was a personal attack on my faith he didn't take the one above the door that he comes in it was the one above the door that i always come in so i feel it was a personal attack on me he didnt take the one off of the fireplace but the one above the door i come in i feel the action was directed at me for me that crufix is a constant visual reminder of god's love for me that he loved me enough to send his only son to save me to give me eternal life for me it is a reminder of my faith in the father the son the holy spirit it is a reminder that i am here to serve him and i need to always examine what i do and correct anything that is not pleasing to my father in heaven as i said he took down the one above the entrance i come in not the one he does and i gather that he took it down after i told him he could not run the streets it still did not give him the right to take it down last week he had been running the streets out every night and i told him that if he wanted to run the streets as a single man he needed to do it as a single man and not as my husband i never said anything else to him but that i am having surgery next week and i am mentally and physically exhausted with all this drama going on i went into another room so i could pray and he kept coming in there to bother me he does not want me to leave when we have serious issues going on but then he does not give me space to do what i need to do i don't really get to express to him fully what i feel when these things happen he walks off cuts me off and treats me like i have nothing to say that is worthy of him listening to i really need advice about this what do you serious responses please if getting rid of crucifixes is the solution then why not get rid of the bibles too i do happen to be saved and on that note no man is ever supposed to be placed before christ for the record he has crucifixes as well that were on the wall of his apartment they are now in his office so sorry if he was feeling that crucified he would have taken down the ones in his office as well why some of us keep crucifixes up we believe the crucifix is in keeping with scripture which states that we preach christ crucified unto the jews a stumbling block and unto the greeks foolishness prayer in front of a crucifix or cross is often part of devotion for christians to christ do we need it know but we do see it as a sign of reverance to christ he sounds crazy and abusive get rid of him if he loved you truely loved you he would know what those crucifix's mean to you and whether he likes them or not he shouldn't disrespect your faith ever he sounds like a controlling psychopath get away from him fast edit this is serious example i have a few boxes they are pretty plain and they get dusty however i put them up all the time my husband hates them but never does he take them down or try convince me to get rid of them after all of respect of my belonging's he found out why i hang them up there my dead grandmother's she got them for me when she was traveling the world right before she died he didn't have to know what they meant to me only that they meant something to me love isn't thinking about yourself its respecting the other person in
