why won't the evolutionist recognized the creation as god handed work the old theory was that the first and oldest species in our family tree homo habilis evolved into homo erectus which then became us homo sapiens but those two earlier species lived side by side about million years ago in parts of kenya for at least half a million years leakey and colleagues report in a paper published in thursday s issue of the journal nature but those two earlier species lived side by side not now we have a problem with reading shame this doesn't disprove evolution at all it only proves that evolution didn't happen exactly the way we thought it did it actually gives more weight to the evolutionists i'm not a scientist so forgive my imprecise language but maybe some strains of h habilus evolved into h erectus and others didn't which would account for their coexistence let's remember that what we know of science is always changing scientists are making discoveries every day some which disprove what they long thought to be true Human evolution Homo erectus Olduwan Cradle of Humanity Human Homo habilis Homo floresiensis Species Origin of language The Origin of Species Neanderthal Intelligent design Homo (genus) Extinction Multiregional hypothesis Single-origin hypothesis Kenya Evolution Mary Leakey Evolutionary creationism Ape Lower Paleolithic Stone Age Creation science Milford H.
