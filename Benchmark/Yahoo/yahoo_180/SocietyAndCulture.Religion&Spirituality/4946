athiests do you celebrate christmas easter and thanksgiving if so why just a side note i mentioned thanksgiving because thanksgiving was given to god by the pilgrims and indians for the bountiful harvest i thought i would clarify i didn't say god gave thanksgiving to anyone the pilgrims gave thanksgiving to god this is true and before god was omitted from the schools you could find it in the text books courtesy of wikipedia the virginia colony a collective prayer of thanksgiving was held in the virginia colony on december near the current site of berkeley plantation where celebrations are still held each year on the first sunday in november try avoiding christmas some time i imagine it's even harder when you've got kids kids go to school with other kids who get presents it's easier to get away with murder than it is to skip christmas easter isn't really a big deal when i'm working hourly it's great because it means i get time and a half times three holiday more than forty hours in a work week more than eight hours in a day thanksgiving is really just christmas the prequel although now that i have in laws that can cook really well it's pretty good the upside is plenty of beer and football Thanksgiving Holiday Easter Liturgical year Christmas Canonical hours Didache Fasting Lent Holidays in Canada Matins Sabbath The Star Wars Holiday Special Christmas Eve Holidays of the United States Sukkot Colonial America Advent Mass (liturgy) National Football League Coptic calendar Jewish holiday Thursday Cliff Richard Gregorian calendar Dean Koontz Pysanka Christianization Amidah Rosh Hashanah Korban The Catcher in the Rye UK Singles Chart Japanese calendar Santa Claus Shavuot Pequot War Easter Island Separation of church and state in the United States Domesticated turkey Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Poker jargon Peanuts Saint Nicholas Julian calendar Diwali Holy Week The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Passover Candlemas Saint Patrick's Day Jamestown, Virginia Computus Tridentine Mass Great Jubilee The Beatles discography USS America (CV-66) Hebrew calendar The Pilgrim's Progress The Adventures of Pete & Pete Kigo Theory of conduct Sluggy Freelance Chronology of Jesus In-N-Out Burger RuneScape economy Carnival Roman Catholic Church Do They Know It's Christmas?
