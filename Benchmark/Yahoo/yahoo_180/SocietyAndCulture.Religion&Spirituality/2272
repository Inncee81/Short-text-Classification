is christianity just a form of witchcraft think about it for a second it has a book of spells that can be performed to summon the spirits of at least three entities that can be used to gain money protection good grades love and cures for diseases it can also be used to curse someone i know people don't usually think of it in this way but without being a part of this particular coven or being familiar with it's beliefs and terminology you really can't distinguished it from any other form of spell casting and spirit possession so tell me if you weren't familiar with the language and customs of chrisitanity and accidentally walked in on the good part a pentacostal service when the participants have worked themselves up into a frenzy and began the running screaming and tongue speaking what would be the first thought to run through your mind oh buk do you feel insulted i'm sorry would you like to summon the spirits to make me stop don't be so offended your statement about atheism doesn't make me automatically think you're a feeble brained zombie summoner what makes you think i'm so arrogant as to believe that nature isn't greater than i am just because i don't believe in gods doesn't mean i'm egocentric as a witch a pagan and a recovered christian i can honestly say no but it is an interesting idea however witches have a whole lot more dignity than to run around screaming like those silly evangelicals do we do our magic in a far mor discreet and private fashion for the most part now pagans can really get into whooping it up but that's not witches per se the fascinating thing i read in some of the answers one in particular was that the christian answerer was mortally offended and thought it was awful to think of the righteous christians as possibly being compared with us terrible witches funny because i had an initial gut reaction of a similar kind in the opposite direction of course which was that i was somewhat insulted to have myself and my fellow witches being compared to those pathetic brain washed stupid fundie christians i realize of course m that not all christians are stupid and pathetic still anyhow very interesting question bright blessings lady morgana Witchcraft Magic (paranormal) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The nature of God in Western theology Shamanism Demon God Witches (Discworld) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Witch trial Trinity Atheism Theodicy Ten Commandments Neopaganism Justification (theology) Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Predestination Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Witch-hunt Phoebe Halliwell Voodoo Pentecostalism Necromancy Alaga__sia Salvation A Course In Miracles Holy Spirit Sola fide Soul Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel Cunning folk Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints John Wycliffe Roman Catholic Church Joke Theory of conduct Scrooge McDuck Angel Supernatural Church of Christ, Scientist Fundamentalism The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Abrahamic religion Ghost Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Objectivist philosophy Sexual orientation Berserk Negima LaVeyan Satanism Prayer Merit Simone Weil God Emperor of Dune Charles Grandison Finney Milton H.
