i believe in a healthy blend of science religion anyone care to disagree or argue their point is there any reason why science and religion can't be blended together beautifully science is based on fact everyday science is making new discoveries and coming up with in depth ideas theories about how everything works where we came from and where we are evolving physically as well as mentally but science can't answer everything at least not yet there's still those pesky questions such as is there an afterlife if so what is it if not well is that it what happens then purpose of life life without purpose almost seems pointless why do something without reason i admit most religions get carried away and try to control people not to mention their incredible stories that they claim to be factual but where would we be without a little guidance and self control so why not let science continue their never ending quest for the unknown and let religion do what it was meant to do make us want to be better people and help each other out bongernet can you imagine the world if we didn't have any mind control cults can you try to imagine it for a moment mankind having zero regret for anything they do because there's zero universal consequence for anything that do you we would be running around like unstoppable barbarians doing whatever we felt like so as much misery you think religion caused throughout history imagine how much misery we'd have without it i agree with you hooray for common sense only i would add that religion also has its quest for the unknown sometimes science's unknowns and religion's unknowns overlap but mostly they're seeking out different things i believe that science and religion could complement each other very well if their adherents would stop bickering like little spoiled kids long enough to listen to what the other is saying Religion Science Meaning of life Scientific method Goodness and value theory God Theory of conduct The nature of God in Western theology Cult Philosophy of language Satanism Spiritism Intelligent design Reality Rudolf Hermann Lotze Autism Existence of God Immanuel Kant Magic (paranormal) Soul Abortion debate Friedrich Schleiermacher Creationism Numerology Evil Consciousness Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Urantia Scientology beliefs and practices Atheism Creation science Sigmund Freud Psychology of religion Objectivist philosophy Modernism Francis Crick Anthroposophy Islamic philosophy The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Philosophy of mathematics Human Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Acts of the Apostles David Hume Mathematics Theodicy Causality Neuro-linguistic programming Flood geology Abrahamic religion Rudolf Steiner Behaviorism Charles Darwin's views on religion Nationalism Falsifiability Metaphysics Epistemology Bertrand Russell History of creationism Telepathy Theology Originalism New Age Teach the Controversy Intelligent design movement State Sexual orientation Emanuel Swedenborg Western philosophy Culture of Lithuania Social constructionism Altruism Property (ownership right) Simone Weil Franz Boas Mythology Sociology Religious studies Advaita Vedanta William A.
