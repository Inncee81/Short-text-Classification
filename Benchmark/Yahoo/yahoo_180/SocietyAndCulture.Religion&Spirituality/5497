so is gullibility a prerequisite a logical result of or unconnected to religious faith care to elucidate how is my thinking faulty unconnected there's been a lot of gullibility on here from all sides even the atheists i'll admit that some of my fellow christians can be quite gullible and that i myself have been a bit gullible every now and then but i've seen plenty of atheists do the same example sixteen dying and rising gods funny that book is discounted by real scholars who have studied mythology for a lifetime in all the mythology i've read there is nothing that comes close to the fallacies in that book yet people believe that one book instead of educating themselves by reading something else like say an encyclopaedia of egyptian mythology or a dissertation on mithraism or anything like that and then there's the people who believe zeitgeist which pretty much stole its idea in the first twenty minutes from the aforementioned book and people tout it as fact and there are the people who believe every word that comes out of michael moore's mouth without even thinking about studying anything moore's opponents have to say and they believe loose change without researching the other side i could go on and on no i think gullibility is a human trait regardless of religion or lack thereof i challenge everyone to do the same thing i've challenged myself to do when you hear something from one side read the other side read both the blind watchmaker by richard dawkins and darwin's black box by michael behe read the god delusion and then read the dawkins delusion both are available on amazon read sixteen dying and rising gods then read other books about the mythological content that's in that book then make up your mind sorry for the long answer but this is how i feel about it education is key to any belief or lack thereof and not one of us has the right to base our conclusions off of one source and then consider ourselves educated doing that is laughable only a fool would read one side and consider themselves educated Intelligent design Richard Dawkins Intelligent design movement Creation-evolution controversy Atheism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism History of creationism Apologetics Religion Teach the Controversy Antony Flew William A.
