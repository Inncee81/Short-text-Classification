i need to apologize for my answers to people who question gods' existence i think everyone has a right his her own beliefs i would defend their right to have and express there unbelief if my god and their belief in theirs or lack thereof my point is that if you choose to not believe in the god jesus and you choose to question me about his existance then i appreciate a discussion on the topic without a debate that usually gets heated and someone getting blocked for their opinion that goes against anothers' i am willing to read your proof that he doesn't exist and ask that in turn you read my proof that he does if we still can't come to an agreement then that is fine and i will still more than enjoy reading and answering your comments on this topic thank you rrettga the question mark after apologize should be an exclamation point i do humbly apologize for any offenses that is awesome that you apologize for your offenses it takes a good person who is willing to humble themself to apologize like this i hope those who were offended forgive you you seem like someone who would be fun to talk to while i will not offer you proof that god does not exist because i too believe in god i love discussions where the two sides can hear what the other thinks can ask questions to gain understanding and to see if the other sees flaws in their thinking and if so how they account for them and where neither side must be converted convinced persuaded and both sides can agree to disagree can you put an exclamation point before or in place of the question mark because it almost seems just seeing the question that you do not think that you do but if one gives it the time and does not get all angry at the title then they can see your contrition Resurrection of Jesus Atheism A Course In Miracles Socrates Roman Catholic Church Presuppositional apologetics Apologetics Theodicy Trinity Internet troll Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Biblical inerrancy Sexual orientation Historicity of Jesus Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Infant baptism Sola fide Justification (theology) Avenue Q Theory of conduct God Emperor of Dune God Existence of God Summa Theologiae Gospel of John Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Jewish principles of faith Historical Jesus Predestination Intelligent design movement Gospel of Thomas Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief The nature of God in Western theology Blood atonement Contrition Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Book of Isaiah Soul Christian apologetics Phaedo Justin Martyr John Howard Yoder Divine grace Purgatory Consensus decision-making Religion Sin Antony Flew Homosexuality and Christianity Pharisees Creationism Martin Heidegger Nontrinitarianism Evil Abortion debate Merit Philosophy of language Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Blue Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Satanism John Wycliffe Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Salvation Parapsychology Apology (Plato) Intelligent design Jacques Derrida Criticism of Mormonism Nation of Islam Penda of Mercia Ten Commandments Eastern Orthodox Church Cult Charles Darwin's views on religion Capital punishment History of Christianity Miracle Deconstruction History of creationism Scopes Trial Liberal Christianity Supply-side economics George Fox Ludwig Wittgenstein Christianity I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue The Origin of Species Meaning of life Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Western philosophy Philipp Melanchthon Bible and reincarnation Duties of the Heart End times
