why believe in god when your life is good already i'm an atheist and i want to know the reasons other people believe in a being who they've never seen or who somehow managed to be resurrected or ascended into the heavens when theres no way something like that can happen how can people say god exists when they dont know what he really looked like how can you ever be sure you're going to heaven and how can you possibly know when and if you ever do no i'm not gothic and i'm not a druggy or a rebel i just need evidence and i use logical thinking and my life is great is religion just a way of keeping the human mind feeling sane and safe is it for internal happiness that you feel safe thinking that someone cares about you out there and has a plan for you and is watching over you how can you ever know he is i've heard this argument before and i'll be glad to shed some light on why people feel god is important regardless of the life you're living essentially people aspire to be greater than they are they look for things to inspire them and to make them better people we set goals and dreams and aspirations b c we want to make ourselves productive in someway even if our goals are something like being able to just stay in bed god is the answer to these wants and desires when we believe that god exist we call into existence something so great and magnificent that we ourselves must not only answer it but also aspire to be it we must make our deeds so grand that we feel approval from an almightly creator that's the logical way of seeing it illogically people have always struggled with that which they do not understand the greeks and ancient romans came up with mythological beings in order to explain things they did not yet understand like weather the sea the sun death etc there are things that we as a society as a whole still do not understand and not unlike the believe of little gremlins that steal socks or cause bad luck people believe that the almighty is the explanation for the unexplainable when you have an infallible being surely there can be nothing unknown for many the unknown is the most frightening thing of all now while i've answered your question i want to pose a couple to you as well as an atheist despite however grand your life may be what do you lose when you choose to believe in a higher power zealotry and prideful people are the ones who ask people to ascribe to a certain walk of faith but you can believe all by yourself that there is something greater than you what do you really lose if you believe in god and do good things in his name what does hope truly destroy God Religion Soul Theodicy Trinity Resurrection of Jesus Origin belief Biblical inerrancy Afterlife Creationism The nature of God in Western theology Goodness and value theory Simone Weil Atheism Philosophy Angel Atomism Ontological argument Existence of God Justification (theology) David Hume Reincarnation Evolutionary creationism Ten Commandments Moral objectivism Eastern Orthodox Church Meaning of life Predestination Theory of conduct Devil Intelligent design movement Christian apologetics Aristotle Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Fundamentalism Apologetics Charles Darwin's views on religion History of creationism Duties of the Heart Scientology beliefs and practices Agnosticism Gospel of Thomas John Howard Yoder S__ren Kierkegaard Rudolf Hermann Lotze Christianity Abortion debate Immanuel Kant Free will Heaven Animism Paul of Tarsus Al-Ghazali Existentialism Philosophical skepticism Urantia Logic Idolatry Pascal's Wager Summa Theologiae Young Earth creationism Jewish principles of faith Sola fide Past teachings of Prem Rawat Book of Isaiah Binitarianism Immortality Sabbath Mythology Jewish philosophy Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Judaism Sant Thakar Singh Salvation Magical thinking Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Satan The Amber Spyglass Alcoholics Anonymous Angel Sanctuary Pharisees Science Jesus Phaedo
