what parts of a cell can be made apart from life why should i believe that life can arise apart from god if you can't point out to me any components that can be made abiotically stupid responses include but are not limited to evolution is science we don't know initial conditions blah blah blah heard it a million times not helpful anything regarding the urey miller experiment they got amino acids from it big deal please explain how they can connect the amino acids without atp or enzymes any attacks upon religion if your house is on fire kindly quite looking for sparks on mine we can make without using preexisting biomolecules membrane vesicles genes amino acids peptides enzymes not based on existing sequences http www ncbi nlm nih gov sites entrez cmd retrieve db pubmed list uids dopt citation by the way the miller urey experiment generated different amino acids found in proteins not Cell (biology) Protein Francis Crick Apoptosis Genetic code Enzyme Biomolecule Miller-Urey experiment Amino acid Entrez Evolution Bioinformatics Chimpanzee Genome Project Mitochondrion DNA Protein kinase Whole proteome analysis Insulin Major histocompatibility complex RNA Serine protease Gene Translation (genetics) Virus Senescence Protein sequencing Prion HIV RNA world hypothesis Glucokinase Protein Data Bank Non-coding RNA Neurotransmitter Human skin color RuBisCO Ubiquitin Protein structure Polymerase chain reaction Transfer RNA Archaea Eukaryote Nutrition Mutation Long-term potentiation Photosynthesis Helicobacter pylori Denaturation (biochemistry) Protein targeting Tay-Sachs disease Molecular structure of Nucleic Acids Ribosome Harold C.
