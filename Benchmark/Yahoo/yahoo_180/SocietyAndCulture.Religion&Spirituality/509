pastor says if you don't tithe don't pray because god doesn't hear you biblical i know i'll get a lot of non christians giving me their opinion but i am really looking for some serious answers here the reason that i ask is because we have been tithing but on a one earner income i'm a sahm and with two little ones we have been struggling a bit we have given up all our luxuries and budget our money pretty well and the only thing i can see that can help us get out of debt is by reducing our tithes for a few months your pastor is wrong the law of ten percent is not valid in our time because we were living in christ's law let me prove it to you and verily they that are of the sons of levi who receive the office of the priesthood have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law that is of their brethren though they come out of the loins of abraham hebrews only sons of levi can receive tithes or ten percent for the priesthood being changed there is made of necessity a change also of the law hebrews king james version the priesthood has been change and also the law is changed and by him all that believe are justified from all things from which ye could not be justified by the law of moses the acts some of the laws of moses is not applicable in this time for example the law of giving ten percent of their earnings as tithes the law had been change since the time of jesus christ the law in the present time is this every man according as he purposeth in his heart so let him give not grudgingly or of necessity for god loveth a cheerful giver ii corinthians god loves a cheerful giver your pastor is like a dog yea they are greedy dogs which can never have enough and they are shepherds that cannot understand they all look to their own way every one for his gain from his quarter isaiah king james version a very greedy dog and through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not and their damnation slumbereth not ii peter they pretend that they are true to make merchandise of you Tithe Sabbath Sola fide Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Priesthood (Mormonism) Melchizedek Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Book of Isaiah Salvation Biblical inerrancy Mormonism and Judaism Roman Catholic Church Apocrypha Moses Baptism 613 mitzvot John the Baptist Biblical canon Old Testament Jehovah's Witnesses Genesis Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Paul of Tarsus Abrahamic religion History of Christianity Linguistics and the Book of Mormon Prophet Soul Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Alan Campbell (pastor) Christianity Pharisees Idolatry Great Apostasy Mormonism and Christianity Church of Christ Bible Noah Baptist Jeremiah John Howard Yoder Trinity Infant baptism Mary, the mother of Jesus Jewish principles of faith Articles of Religion (Methodist) Eastern Orthodox Church Christian eschatology Christianity and anti-Semitism Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Abraham Repentance Apocalyptic literature Divine grace Creationism Clergy Korban God Merit Minister of religion King James Version of the Bible Angel Children of God Messiah Bishop Evil Holy Spirit Apostle Tax Halakha Aramaic of Jesus Noahide Laws Sin Charles Grandison Finney Martin Luther Original sin Theory of conduct Pentecostalism Names of God in Judaism Revelation Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Resurrection of Jesus Religion Opus Dei Jewish Messiah Rastafari movement Eucharist Rabbi Gospel of Thomas Jesus Predestination End times
