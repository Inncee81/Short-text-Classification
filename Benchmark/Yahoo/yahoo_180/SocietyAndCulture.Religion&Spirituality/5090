is it right for a female to be a ordained minister or senior pastor your best answer depends on details where can i do some research on rather it is right for a female to be a ordained minister or senior pastor or not and what denominations do and do not accept it also include some bible reference if you can because overall that is the final word thank you all for your help hello friend what a great question please read this answer with an open bible and an open ear to god may i first say you ask is it right but i hope you mean is it biblical for a female to be an ordained minister etc i love this question because not enough people are asking or answering it and it sometimes causes a lot of strife among god's people needlessly let me begin by saying i neither belong to nor represent any denomination i am simply a child of god having said that let's dig in most who oppose a female and i like that you said female rather than woman being a preacher minister or pastor usually go to tim as their proof text and i suppose that most of them use the kjv as their source which is fine provided that they use an accurate greek dictionary to study the bible without going into extreme detail and making this a thesis i'll cut to the point the key word in vs is usurp in the kjv in other translations the phrase exercise authority is used in it's place those against a female being a preacher use this text saying a woman can't preach because that's a role god gave to man which is partly right here's where their right god did give that role to man and expects him to preach shepherd the flock and minister to them and as long as there is a man in a congregation who is able and knowledgeable to preach he has god's priority to do so and if such a case exists if a female decided to be the preacher over above the man she then would be usurping his god given authority which would be wrong and sinful look quickly at the definitions of usurp to seize and hold the power or rights of another for example by force and without legal authority to take over or occupy without right i believe they fail to see this point if a knowledgeable man is preacher over a congregation and he knows of a female who is biblically sound and who understands her role as god defines it and who is willing to preach she may do so with the permission of the man who is in authority over the flock i believe they fail to allow for god's man to prayerfully share the pulpit if god directs the trouble comes if when a female steps in front of god's man that is usurping his authority and should not be tolerated as far as a female being senior pastor this should not happen in any church where there is a qualified man to lead the flock god created man first but even he knew we would need a helper let a man first be the preacher if there is no man let a female preach until such a man is found to obey god's design a true female child of god will not have a problem with the roles as god defined them i pray this helps Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief New Testament Biblical inerrancy Linguistics and the Book of Mormon Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Christianity King James Version of the Bible John Wesley Ordination of women Holy Orders Charles Taze Russell Homosexuality and Christianity Judaism A Course In Miracles Baptist Martin Luther Clergy Paul of Tarsus Alan Campbell (pastor) Divine grace Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod John Wycliffe Bishop Vestments controversy Christian views of women Book of Mormon Priesthood (Mormonism) Church of Christ, Scientist Infant baptism Jan Hus Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an God Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Evangelicalism Fundamentalism Young Earth creationism Biblical canon Mormonism and Christianity King-James-Only Movement Organizational structure of Jehovah's Witnesses Opus Dei Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses History of the English Bible Second Vatican Council Religious conversion Charles Grandison Finney Richard Allen (reverend) Biblical studies Rabbi Pentecostalism Predestination Lutheranism Charismatic Community of Christ Roman Catholic Church Moses Great Apostasy Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Christian views of Jesus Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Prophet Sabbath Eastern Orthodox Church Christian denomination Deacon Jewish principles of faith Filioque clause Gospel of Thomas Tithe Angel Jews as a chosen people Jesus Genesis Papal Infallibility God and gender Friedrich Schleiermacher Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Anglican views of homosexuality Religion Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod Creationism Bible Justification (theology) Historical Jesus Religious pluralism Religion and sexuality Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine)
