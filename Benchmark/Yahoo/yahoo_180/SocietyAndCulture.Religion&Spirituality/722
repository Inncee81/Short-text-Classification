what do you think about women um many things this is gonna be a long rant sighs ok well one i love women actually i take that back i love one woman and that's my gf they're beautiful mostly i'm a boob man as in i like girls boobs yes i can admit that but they can be real b tches which is not their right i don't care what any woman says also they are a bit too emotional some times and they have the power to control a mans life sex but not for me 'cause i can actually live without it so that takes away my gf's greatest weapon and the whole special time of the month is not fun for us especially also when women are giving birth they go from i hate you when they're pushing to aww i love you after it comes out also when a girl gets pregnant most of the time if the mom and dad of the girl doesn't like it she always says he did it i didn't do anything or something as such or the parents say that which is not true because it takes two to tango so women are great but at the same time they're not just like guys no one's perfect Friends Recurring South Park characters The Fairly OddParents Kodocha Sex and the City Humphrey Bogart EastEnders The Marshall Mathers LP Kyle Broflovski Hey Arnold!
