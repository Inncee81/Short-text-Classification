get a clue you are disproven you stated in a recent question that christian always like to say this and then essentially threw out pascal's wager i am a christian personally i find pascal's wager to be a disgusting cop out for christians it is that quintessential scare tactic of using hell to extort people into christianity which brings people into the religion for the wrong reasons the word gospel literally translates good news and christianity in my opinion should be ministering less about saving people from hell and more about the abundant blessings that await us in heaven i am not the least bit interested in hell because i will not be there and my ministry reflects this belief so as a christian i do not ever use pascal's wager as part of my argument for my beliefs which means that your statement that christians always like to say is wrong rhsaunders i own stenger not that impressed with it the only atheist publication i have ever been thoroughly impressed with was mills' atheist universe mostly because it used more common sense and real life application without the technical babble that often shows itself as more scientists and anthropologists bickering and trying to look smarter than each other sorry brian jumped to a conclusion based on a few of your answers i'm atheist but yes i believe i've told you before religion needs more people like you Pascal's Wager Creationism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Supernatural Existence of God God Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Creation-evolution controversy Heaven Apologetics Blaise Pascal Sin Fundamentalism Answers in Genesis Abrahamic religion Liberal Christianity Christianity Biblical inerrancy Gospel of Thomas Evolutionary creationism Salvation Philosophy of religion Trinity Antony Flew A Course In Miracles History of creationism Messianic Judaism Intelligent design movement Gospel of Barnabas Ontological argument Afterlife Apostasy Simone Weil Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Theory of conduct Nontrinitarianism Divine grace Soul Phillip E.
