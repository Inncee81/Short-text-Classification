can a season affect what religion you follow more been battling a fight of wicca or catholiscm my great grandmother passed away when i was and three months before she died she told me of her long life of practicing wicca but also she was the strongest christian i knew she believed in two different things and now being years old i still fight a war of my conscious of what religion i am to follow i have been raised a strong catholic and love the religion but find emptiness within it and i find myself when i get most depressed or upset turning to wicca and alot of meditation and mental chants and remedies to completetion i am not sure where i belong and it seems every year my confliction gets worse and this year i am over the edge i need guidance help i don't like to admit this but i have been in a place close to where you are i have been pulled between paganism and protestant christianity in the past it seemed like i would be more pagan in the summer months and the christianity feelings would arise in the winter i don't know when your conflicts are going to stop or if they will you are battling against two things what you have been taught and what you find most comforting you need to take a little break from practicing either and examine what you truly believe and why you believe it look at every single thing you believe in and examine it with a microscope you want to see every connection it has every feeling it causes by doing this you should be able to come to a conclusion about what path you want to follow using your grandmother as an example it should be obvious to you that it is possible to live in both worlds there are more than a few christian witches out there but i understand your feelings for catholicism figuring out what has been socially drilled into us as acceptable is the key it is up to you whether you continue to follow that model or if you break free of it examine all your beliefs and find out what works best for you if it ends up being catholicism great go after it with a whole heart if it ends up being wicca great go after it with a whole heart if it ends up being a blend of the two great persue your idea of god or gods with your whole heart persuing any spiritual path with half a heart can only bring pain many blessings to you Witchcraft Religion Wicca Neopaganism Christianity Ten Commandments Magic (paranormal) Church of Christ, Scientist Shamanism Salvation God Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Trinity Reincarnation Church of Christ Religious pluralism Past teachings of Prem Rawat Rastafari movement Prayer Fundamentalism Christian eschatology Abrahamic religion Roman Catholic Church Christian anarchism A Course In Miracles Sabbath Alcoholics Anonymous Paganism Sexual orientation Great Apostasy Messianic Judaism Christmas Stregheria Ancient Greek religion Cult Spiritism New Age Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Divine grace Eucharist Simone Weil Religion in the United Kingdom John Wycliffe Historical persecution by Christians Mormonism and Christianity Meditation Existence of God C.
