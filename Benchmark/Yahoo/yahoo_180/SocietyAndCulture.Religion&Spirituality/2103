why your belief system rather than a different one what makes it true for you please please please no more because god the bible the quran says so or because it's the only true one answers i know it's a leap but i'm showing a little faith here okay some of you can think what is it that makes your faith true for you why did you choose it over all other options i chose atheism after running through the options of other beliefs i was raised a christian and remained so for the first years of my life when i entered university i explored mysticism paganism and theosophy but was rapidly losing my belief in any religious system my efforts to contact divinity brought me to the conlcusion that i was either lacking in some fundamental element necessary for the religious experience or that all religions were inspired by the basic human need for comfort in the face of a difficult life for myself i accepted that this was so and drew comfort from the acceptance of the knowledge that there was no divine no afterlife but a present life that was a startling and precious gift and one that i should appreciate to the fullest of my capacity in my readings of leon blum simone weil even rosa luxemburg i began to understand the value of self awareness i saw that for me the idea of a god who would provide resolution at the end of one's life was a concession an admittance of failure on my part to control my life i will not abdicate the experiece of my life my only life here and present to an unproven mystical being in short i am left with my own resources and limited though they may be i feel adequately prepared to deal with this life a life no more flawed than any other and potentially as beautiful as any despite lack of a theological belief Religion God Fundamentalism Christianity Existence of God Supernatural Atheism Jewish principles of faith Religious Society of Friends Reincarnation Evolutionary creationism Gnosticism Philipp Melanchthon Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Soul Trinity Religious pluralism Theology Eucharist Simone Weil Immortality Satanism Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Abrahamic religion Theodicy Jewish philosophy Kabbalah Afterlife Predestination Urantia The nature of God in Western theology Creationism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Intelligent design Magic (paranormal) Christian eschatology Church of Christ, Scientist Origin belief Summa Theologiae Meaning of life Esotericism Neopaganism Heaven Mysticism A Course In Miracles Prayer Gospel of Thomas Salvation Mormonism and Christianity Religious perspectives on Jesus Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Church of Christ Christian apologetics Ten Commandments Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Friedrich Schleiermacher History of creationism Protestantism God and gender Islam Messianic Judaism Jesus Judaism Catechism S__ren Kierkegaard Creation-evolution controversy Young Earth creationism Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Idolatry Justification (theology) Criticism of Islam Emanuel Swedenborg Pantheism Witchcraft Charles Darwin's views on religion Free will Paul of Tarsus New Age Faith Evangelicalism Philosophy Historicity of Jesus Theosophy Mormonism Cultural and historical background of Jesus Sola fide Homosexuality and Christianity Hell Maimonides Angel Monotheism
