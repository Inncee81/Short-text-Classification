christianity versus the epicurean paradox it goes as follows is god willing to prevent evil but not able then is he impotent is he able but not willing then is he malevolent is he both able and willing whence cometh evil then is he neither able nor willing then why call him god god could stop giving kids cancer and stuff but he doesn't he allows things like the holocaust there is way too much evil and suffering for there to be an omniscient caring creator and if god created the devil and allows him to operate god is complicit in all evil when i came to this conclusion on my own at about age i became an agnostic have you pondered this question god is both willing and able and yet he respects his creation enough to allow it choice he sets up a perfect system that if everyone would follow everything would be perfect however people decide not to follow it and evil comes into the equation because evil is simply not god it is because god loves us so much that he allows us to keep free will and make a choice that evil is in the world one day the time of decision will end and then god will step in and end evil but that is the last day and so we have to deal with the evil of men's choices and the forgiveness of god Theodicy Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Problem of evil God Free will Paradox Agnosticism Devil The nature of God in Western theology Holocaust theology Summa Theologiae Evil Jewish principles of faith Simone Weil Trinity Problem of Hell Original sin John Howard Yoder Omnipotence Prayer Paradise Lost Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Religion Alignment (role-playing games) Atheism Christian eschatology Transcendental argument for the existence of God Rich Mullins School of Salamanca Goodness and value theory Charles Darwin's views on religion Cosmological argument Jewish philosophy Ontological argument Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sola fide Charles Grandison Finney Sabbath The Brothers Karamazov Animism Christian demonology Presuppositional apologetics Eschatology Theology Nation of Islam Demon The Fall of Man Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Intelligent design Alcoholics Anonymous Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Immortality Hell Satan Justification (theology) Creator God Theory of conduct Zoroastrianism John Wesley Athanasian Creed Jiddu Krishnamurti Supernatural Legacy of Kain Negative theology Biblical inerrancy Crime and Punishment Eastern Orthodox Church Meaning of life Reinhold Niebuhr Divorce Adam and Eve Judaism Determinism Hellenic philosophy and Christianity Islamic philosophy End times Open Theism Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Merit Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Maimonides Predestination (Calvinism) Michel Henry Strong atheism Pascal's Wager Calvinism God the Father Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Reincarnation Karma in Hinduism Ten Commandments The Life and Times of Juniper Lee
