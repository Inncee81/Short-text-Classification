here is a question that i hope you understand in my humble opinion ther are really only two types of people those who belive and those who do not let me finish befor you get on your rant ok those fence straddlers those who want proof but really hope deep down inside that there is a god so that when they die their not just worm food they fall in the beliving group cause they hold out hope for a god the beliver loves god etc then the athiest smug assured that there is no sky god yet if you ask them a simple question like where did all this come from and with a stern brow and unwaivering certainty they reply random chance as for the beliver we ll setting aside personal experience is it really so bad that a group of people want to belive in this absoloute being of love who knows so here we are both groups at each others throats desperate to be right hey no one likes to be wrong after all we are only human so my question is this if you were crossing a field and seen a lion would you trust that god would keep the lion from killing you or are you the type of person who needs to stick your head in the lions mouth to prove there is no god ok here is the deal i asked the question with alterior motives me and a friend made a bet simple really not one of you really understood the question i knew for certain the answers would be about grammar punctuation or would be knee jerk defevsive reactions see the real reason people cant get along is because we cant see the forest because of the tree s humanity's nature never fails to depress me to your first question i agree that we are divided into the two groups the believers and the nonbelievers to your second question if i was crossing a field and i saw i lion i would not trust god to keep the lion from killing me i am a christian and admit that i would be praying running and looking for a tree to climb all at the same time god gave me a brain and legs and he expects me to use them to get away from danger no way would i stick my head in the lion's mouth that sounds like those folks who handle poisonous snakes to test their faith in god just because a person has faith in god that does not take away their common sense don't put yourself in danger to test god and see if he will save you Theory of conduct Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism God Emperor of Dune The nature of God in Western theology Presuppositional apologetics Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sola fide Shaggy dog story Religion Salvation The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Origin belief Free will Epistemology Meaning of life Evil Trinity Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Creationism Phaedo Existence of God Supernatural Soul Turing test Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Intelligent design Philipp Melanchthon Poker jargon Religious Society of Friends Christian eschatology Expert system Philosophical skepticism Charles Darwin's views on religion Ontological argument Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Reincarnation Escape from New York Prayer Merit Human Sheikh Abdullah Book of Isaiah Dualism (philosophy of mind) Biblical inerrancy Ganesha Scientific skepticism The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) John Wesley Sant Thakar Singh Infant baptism Baptism The Death Gate Cycle Scientific method Atheism Opus Dei Charles Grandison Finney Boom Town (Doctor Who) Incarnations of Immortality Sydney Riot of 1879 Christianity Muslim ibn Aqeel Evangelicalism Probability Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Australian legislative election, 2004 Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Happy Tree Friends Human nature Resurrection of Jesus Rei Ayanami Little Britain Consensus decision-making Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Professional wrestling aerial techniques Love Mojave people Rich Mullins Plame affair Christian apologetics God and gender Satan John Lennon Characters of Naruto Snake Nicomachean Ethics Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
