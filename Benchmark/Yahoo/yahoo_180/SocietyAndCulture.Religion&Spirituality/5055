jehovah's witnesses blood tranfusions jehovahs witnesses won't accept blood transfusions and would let their kids die rather than let them have one but they don't realise that our bodies renew the blood we don't have the same blood in us all the time so a transfusion may be someone elses blood to begin with but once the body begins renewing it it becomes the body's blood also if we're all made from dust what difference does it make who's blood we have it's all the same anyway we're all made of the same explain this renewal of the blood cells in the body is worth mentioning i don't think even one of the jw answers so far has faced up to this biological fact neither do jws face up to the fact that their reasons for refusing whole blood transfusions is entirely theological and not medical yet they go on and on about medical benefits as if that constituted a good reason they would refuse blood even if there were no good medical reasons for avoiding it because of a strained interpretation of about verses in the bible they took a public stand around and now they cannot get out of it without losing face yet the day is coming fast when so many blood fractions will be 'allowed' that there will be no valid difference between a collection of fractions and whole blood yet jws cannot see this they are utterly blind to the manipulations of their leaders who are more interested in avoiding law suits than in sticking fast to a principle established in sorry this is not a jw explanation i would say in their defence that they love their kids and move heaven and earth to help them but when push comes to shove they have to be seen to be obeying their leaders it's tragic isn't it Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Blood Pascal's Wager Baptism Ten Commandments Blood transfusion Abrahamic religion Resurrection of Jesus Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity End times Soul Homosexuality and Christianity Christianity Creation according to Genesis Christian views of Jesus Dispensationalism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Restorationism Stem cell Charles Grandison Finney Eastern Orthodox Church Creationism Judaism Prophet Tai Chi Chuan Charles Taze Russell Christian eschatology Intelligent design Bible and reincarnation Eucharist HIV test AIDS reappraisal History of creationism Trinity Sabbath Tetragrammaton Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Plame affair Philipp Melanchthon Meaning of life Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Young Earth creationism Messianic Judaism Origin belief Excommunication Theodicy Status of religious freedom in Germany Church of Christ, Scientist Altruism Holy Spirit Organizational structure of Jehovah's Witnesses Cult Criticisms of Christianity Religious conversion Immortality Acts of the Apostles Sola fide Conscription Jewish principles of faith The Amber Spyglass Property (ownership right) Rudolf Hermann Lotze Fundamentalism Church of Christ Religious perspectives on Jesus History of the English Bible Prostate cancer John Wesley Teach the Controversy Christian views of women Status of religious freedom in France Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Naruto jutsu Modern geocentrism Dieting Infant baptism Electrophysiology Mormonism and Christianity Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Center for Science and Culture Judicial review Creation-evolution controversy Halakha Religion and abortion Erythropoietin Pitaten Book of Revelation Shaggy dog story Teleological argument Second Coming Blood donation Ebola Biblical inerrancy
