how did the races become in the bible well i go to church and everything but i always wanted to know if it all began with all races or if it just started out with a certain race and i am not racist i just want to know how it happened in the beginning there were no races people look different because of the different expression of the human genome the closest you will come to a division of people in the bible is recorded in genesis chapter it talks about how all of mankind were one and they even all spoke the same one language but then as it is recorded in genesis and from there the lord dispersed them over the face of all the earth this dispersion of people led to different languages as the language in each area developed and changed over time even as new languages were born in the same way genetic drift and variation led to some similar characteristics of certain groups even as influenced by natural forces it is us as humans that group people together into races but we could easily group people according to hair color eye color or any other manifestation of human genetics yet we are all the same species we can reproduce with each other no matter what the race and redheads can reproduce with blonds just as lighter skin people can reproduce with darker skin people we cannot reproduce with animals which are of a different species this is the main difference between microevolution and macroevolution the races are a result of microevolution but races are absurd and a human invention all people are created in the image of god Macroevolution Human Race Created kind Creation-evolution controversy Species Evolution Hair color Evolutionary creationism The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Biology Black (people) Trinity Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Melanin Creation biology History of creationism The Origin of Species White (people) Human skin color Caucasian race Creationism Gene Reproduction History of evolutionary thought Race of Jesus Afrocentrism Curse and mark of Cain God Red hair Genetics Lamanite Dravidian people Validity of human races Language Color Genesis Noah's Ark Origin belief Scrapped Princess Bible Abrahamic religion Creation according to Genesis Puberty Adam and Eve Minbari Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Modern geocentrism Teleological argument Turkic peoples Physical attractiveness Blacks and Mormonism Prophet Aryan race Chromosome God and gender Xenomorph Horse Fallen angel Young Earth creationism Angel Human variability Origin of language Neon Genesis Evangelion Jews as a chosen people Sabbath Senescence Xindi Anthropology Dragon Booster Sociobiology Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Biodiversity Eye color Genome Extinction Chimpanzee Junk DNA Mission (Christian) Sex Intelligent design Life Hair Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Human genome Rastafari movement Book of Isaiah Sexual dimorphism Original sin Chimpanzee Genome Project German language Nation of Islam Genetic disorder Races of Final Fantasy Day-Age Creationism
