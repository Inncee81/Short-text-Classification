another honest question to people of faith yesterday i ran an errand with my youngest we went to the store to buy candy for his classmates he loves candy not to eat but to share his favorite game is to share out any candy he gets taking one piece and then another to each person in the room if we don't stop him he will give it all away and have none for himself he is the most beautiful person i know one day maybe soon maybe long years away he will be cold and still everything i have i only have for a short while all that i care about will be lost and forgotten it's a simple fact things are what they are it is how i chose to feel about them that gives me sorrow or joy i broke an old piece of family china i was sad but china breaks knowing that mades its loss easy to accept people die knowing that make my death easy to except what does that leave me i have today best that it isn't drowned in sad memories or lost in dreaming hopes for tomorrow i have a chance to live fully in what time i have my question is simple do i need a belief in a supernatural afterlife to be at piece with my eventual death yes cj i'll fit it on a bumpersticker for you thank you all for your time and thoughtful answers no apparently not at this time you seem to be at peace w the eventuality of your own death i just wonder what kind of peace you will have when you discover that there is a hell and you are in it and then you realize it will then be too late to do anything about it this is totally your choice i hope you are making the right one good luck and from my point of view i hope you don't mind my telling you god bless Jon Secada Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Meaning of life Scenes from a Memory Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Phaedo Bhajan Afterlife The Amber Spyglass Predestination Christian eschatology Theodicy Pitaten The Apprentice 2 Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Soul Shaggy dog story Angel Sanctuary Supernatural The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Incarnations of Immortality Summa Theologiae Justification (theology) Free will The nature of God in Western theology Jiddu Krishnamurti Reincarnation Social rule IBM PC compatible Socrates YuYu Hakusho Buddhism Immortality Time Out of Mind Extreme Programming The Death Gate Cycle Muslim ibn Aqeel Hell Salvation A Course In Miracles Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Philosophical skepticism Dead Like Me What Dreams May Come Jean Grey Past teachings of Prem Rawat Knots Landing Kain (Legacy of Kain) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Death (personification) The Lovely Bones Hey Jude Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses One Tree Hill (TV series) Vulcan (Star Trek) Current teachings of Prem Rawat Jewish eschatology Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Sub-Zero K' Resurrection of Jesus Whose Line Is It Anyway?
