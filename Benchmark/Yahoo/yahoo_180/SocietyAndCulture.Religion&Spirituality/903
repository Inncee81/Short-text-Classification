what is jesus' status in judaism and islam do most jewish sects consider him a heretic or a prophet how is he regarded how influential is he in islam please answer using first hand knowledge or with evidence no antireligious comments one issue with answering your question is that not all who call themselves jews would agree on what they think of jesus and not all who call themselves muslims would agree on what they think of jesus however just as one particular christian does not define christianity neither do individual jews define judaism or individual muslims define islam the most pure view in judaism regarding jesus is this the jews await a great prophet from god prophesied throughout their scriptures specifically an anointed one anointed one in hebrew is messiah so the jews are awaiting a messiah from god to usher in a new kingdom that will never fail with the lord god as their leader around the time that jesus came there were many false messiahs many leaders who led rebellions against the oppressive roman empire and several of these leaders were followed by many jews even well meaning jews that hoped that this leader would free the jews from the romans and sort of rule the world just as the lord god freed the jews from the egyptians in the old testament through the prophet moses in their scriptures there are prophesies that a prophet like moses deuteronomy will do this for the people of god and again in the time of jesus when the roman oppression was mounting many jews were very anxiously awaiting the coming of the messiah and there were many false prophets before and after jesus that came and did not fulfill all scriptures by establishing an everlasting kingdom and so they are all rejected by judaism who awaits the true messiah when jesus came many wondered is this the messiah who was to come they asked the same about john the baptist or anybody else who showed some promise of hope for deliverance some believed jesus was the promised messiah spoken about in scripture and followed him these were all jews originally and on a side note the greek word for anointed one is christ just as the hebrew word for this is messiah so jesus christ merely means jesus the anointed one of god or the messiah of god however when jesus claimed to be equal with god some jews particularly the jewish leaders thought this was absolutely blasphemous and grounds for execution of course they couldn't execute jesus themselves because they lived under the ruling of the romans so they delivered jesus over to the romans to be executed now then the romans were unwilling at first to crucify jesus you see the jews wanted him dead because of blasphemy but the romans said he is guilty of nothing but what concerns your religion so you take care of him and of course in the end they convince the romans to crucify jesus so pure judaism has not changed its mind it still awaits a messiah and they just lump jesus in with all the other false messiah's that have supposedly come and went without establishing a new kingdom they see jesus as a heretic a false prophet and a blasphemous person who claimed to be equal with god though they see him as no less of a heathen than all the other gentiles of the world who do not fear their god the lord god god of abraham isaac and jacob i am yahweh etc as for islam the most pure muslim sees jesus much differently than judaism they do not see jesus as a false prophet or as a heretic or as a blasphemous person quite the contrary they see jesus as one of the many prophets of god and honor him as such but they too think it blasphemous for one to claim any prophet equal to or a manifestation of god himself their basic understanding and belief goes something like this mankind leaves the ways of god and then god raises up a prophet to lead the people back to god and a right understanding of god so far this is exactly the same as judaism and christianity however what islam says is that these prophets of god teach well and lead people well but still later the people leave the ways of god they see jesus as one of these prophets who spoke truth they honor jesus as a prophet of god but only as a prophet like abraham isaiah and jonah then what islam says is this the bible is corrupt it has twisted or changed what jesus said or claimed they say that jesus never claimed to be god but that the christians have twisted what jesus said and that the bible cannot be trusted now then when a prophet of god has come but the people have grown corrupt again or the writings like the bible have become corrupt islam says that god raises up yet another prophet to restore things for islam this is muhammed in one sense islam believes that muhammed is no different than all the prophets that came before him in the sense that they say muhammed is not god etc however extremely special honor is given to him and he is elevated far and away above all other prophets including jesus as the chief or final prophet or seal of the prophets of god and they elevated the quaran far and away high above the bible just as muhammed is elevated far and way high above previous prophets like jesus a true muslim will respect the bible but consider its writings tampered with however they believe that the quaran is directly the word of god whom of course they call allah which just means god in arabic and is perfect with no mistakes only in its original language though and that is the language in which it must be recited but again you would have many jews and many muslims disagree with much of what i wrote above just as christians can argue over essential issues and non essential issues alike but the most mature jew sees jesus as a heretic and nothing more and the most mature muslim sees jesus as a prior prophet of god whose teaching has been corrupted in the bible and restored by the seal of the prophets or final prophet muhammed who merely transcribed the quaran as given to him from an angel of god but i cannot just end answering your question without speaking the truth jews that rejected jesus made an error in that they expected the messiah to come and restore an earthly kingdom immediately for israel even the jewish apostles thought jesus would do this originally and they were quite confused and distressed when jesus was crucified only after jesus rose from the dead and opened the eyes of their understanding with the power of the holy spirit did they understand the messiah came as a light for the gentiles in addition to a light for the jews even as it is prophesied in their own scriptures it is too small a thing for you to be my servant to restore the tribes of jacob and bring back those of israel i have kept i will also make you a light for the gentiles that you may bring my salvation to the ends of the earth isaiah and not only this but the messiah was to come not once but twice the first coming in fulfillment of all the prophecies about the messiah being a suffering servant who would die for this sins of israel and the world see isaiah and but again as the mighty lion of judah when the messiah jesus came he opened the door for the gentiles to be a light for the gentiles and he will come again and bring forth the new jerusalem and still yet many in judaism will repent and believe even as it is prophesied by zechariah and i will pour out on the house of david and the inhabitants of jerusalem a spirit of grace and pleas for mercy so that when they look on me on whom they have pierced they shall mourn for him as one mourns for an only child and weep bitterly over him as one weeps over a firstborn and then the coming of the lord as in zechariah hear o israel the lord our god the lord is one muslims make the error of following a false prophet muhammed who was deceived by a fallen angel who was masquerading as an angel of light may god open your eyes to the truth and deliver you from the bonds of fear and deception there now i am done grace and peace in christ be with you
