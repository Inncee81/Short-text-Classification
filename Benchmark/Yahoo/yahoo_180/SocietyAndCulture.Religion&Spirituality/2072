christian's loss versus atheist's loss i have one question at the bottom but first lets look at a brief comparison of an other wise equivilent loss death of a loved one from an atheists p o v and then a christians point of view atheist there is no afterlife and if there is it seems we are going to hell anyway so the very blunt crushing reality for an atheist is we will never ever see that person ever again ever christian in a christian's pov who has lost a loved one that loved one has just moved to a place of eternal happiness plus pressumably this christian believes he she will join his her loved one within a few decades or sooner well a single full life time isn't very much compared to eternity any way atheist will never ever see that person again christian will see this person and experience eternal happiness and peace for the rest of time question does a christian have the right to compare the pain they suffer when someone dies to that of an atheist fruitcake ok i'll give you that but you still have address 'what if they aren't going to hell ' i believe this is one of the main reasons that religion exists in the first place everyone is afraid of death and believing in an afterlife makes the idea of death easier to deal with it is much easier to deal with a loved one dying if you believe that you will see them after you die everyone feels pain when someone they love dies but some people use belief in an afterlife as a coping mechanism for the rest of us we just have to accept that we will soon be where they are decomposing in the ground there's nothing we can do about it Afterlife Religion Heaven Reincarnation Christian eschatology Hell Urantia Problem of Hell Atheism Supernatural Immortality Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity A Course In Miracles Theodicy Pascal's Wager Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Jewish eschatology Meaning of life Phaedo S__ren Kierkegaard Sin Death Christianity Abrahamic religion Jewish principles of faith C.
