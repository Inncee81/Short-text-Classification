how many apostiles did jesus have i tried looking it up in my nkj bible but i just cant understand it thanks and god bless eliza age usa the term is principally applied however to those disciples whom jesus personally selected as a body of appointed representatives the names of the original selected are given at matthew the names of the twelve apostles are these first simon the one called peter and andrew his brother and james the son of zeb e dee and john his brother philip and bar thol o mew thomas and matthew the tax collector james the son of al phae us and thad dae us also known as judas the son of james simon the ca na nae an and judas is car i ot who later betrayed him one of the original judas iscariot proved to be a traitor thereby fulfilling earlier prophecies psalm also the man at peace with me in whom i trusted who was eating my bread has magnified his heel against me psalm let his days prove to be few his office of oversight let someone else take the remaining faithful apostles are again listed at acts so when they had entered they went up into the upper chamber where they were staying peter as well as john and james and andrew philip and thomas bar thol o mew and matthew james the son of al phae us and simon the zealous one and judas the son of james also known as thaddeus see matthew above some of the apostles had been disciples of john the baptizer before becoming jesus disciples john eleven of them were evidently galileans acts judas iscariot being considered the sole judean they were from the working class four were definitely fishermen by trade one had been a tax collector matthew at least two of them appear to have been cousins of jesus james and john the sons of zebedee they were men who were viewed by the religious leaders as unlettered and ordinary indicating that their education was elementary and not from the schools of higher learning a number of them including peter cephas were married men acts corinthians i hope the information above helps reading and understanding the king james version can be a challenge since the language is really from the william shakespeare era that was the sort of english that was spoken during that time certainly you want to read a translation that is more suitable for your learning and understanding it is beneficial to have the new world translation of the holy scriptures see www watchtower org
