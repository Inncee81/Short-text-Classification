what's it like to be catholic i was born agnostic but strangely im attracted to catholics how is it like to be catholic im just curious im not going to convert tor anything im just want to know what being catholic is like i know a committed atheist who would attend eastern orthodox services because he liked the ritual i'm an atheist married to a catholic and my impression of the church is that it is very rules oriented because they believe that god's revelation is ongoing through their magisterium they have no problem adding things to christianity this is not entirely bad they have said that galileo was right despite what the bible said and they have come out in favor of evolution on the other hand they also have come up with purgatory and limbo their mixed up view is best demonstrated by annulments you cannot get a divorce within the catholic church but you can get the church to declare that your marriage never happened even if you've been married long enough to have kids they didn't want to contradict the bible but they didn't want to alienate all those who wanted a divorce so they made up a new set of rules if you are attracted to the ceremony i'd recommend high church episcopalian instead they also have a better english translation of the prayer book Roman Catholic Church Homosexuality and Christianity Eastern Orthodox Church Separation of church and state Christianity New Testament Marriage Atheism Catholicism History of Christianity Christian eschatology Sin Hell Holy Orders Pope John Paul II Afterlife Bible Fundamentalism Book of Daniel Evolutionary creationism Religion Great Apostasy Justification (theology) Eucharist Purgatory Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Mass (liturgy) Ten Commandments God Apocrypha Biblical canon Abrahamic religion Psalms Existence of God Papal Infallibility Mary, the mother of Jesus Biblical inerrancy Religious pluralism Thomas More Martin Luther Religious conversion Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Agnosticism Religion in Canada Jewish principles of faith Clergy Russian Orthodox Church Messianic Judaism Ordination of women Charles Darwin's views on religion Alan Campbell (pastor) Theology Sola scriptura Matthew 5:32 Clerical celibacy Judaism Idolatry Reform Judaism Jewish view of marriage Catholic Supernatural Protestantism Christian-Jewish reconciliation Pharisees Prophet Paul of Tarsus Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Halakha Canonical hours Bishop Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Sharia Bertrand Russell Religious Society of Friends Freemasonry Apostasy Mormonism and Judaism Icon Restorationism Book of Mormon Persecution of Christians John Wycliffe Binitarianism Religion in the United Kingdom Holy Spirit Episcopalian church governance Same-sex marriage Witchcraft Kohen Christian denomination
