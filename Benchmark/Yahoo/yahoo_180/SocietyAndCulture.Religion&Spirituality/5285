why does the trinity issue matter if jesus is god how did god give his son two questions deserving of two answers first why does the trinity issue mater if we believe that god gave us the ten commandments to be a testaments too us to show how to love him and our fellow men and to be our moral set of laws then also must understand that when christ said that if we break one of these commandments we have broken them all then if we have tree god s we have broken the first commandment and since we have broken one we have broken all now add to this that by breaking the commandments of the almighty god we have taken ourselves out of grace which he gave us by his grace and our accepting his son as our saviour we place ourselves under the condemnation of the law of god and we are no longer at peace with the almighty god we are at war with him the second question the understanding that christ is god is very misunderstood today and has been for many centuries here is just one verse that is taken out of context hebrews but unto the son he saith thy throne o god is for ever and ever a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom here we find that god is speaking to his son and calls him god but what is left out is the prior verses hebrews god who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of all things by whom also he made the worlds who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high being made so much better than the angels as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they for unto which of the angels said he at any time thou art my son this day have i begotten thee and again i will be to him a father and he shall be to me a son you can plainly see that the almighty god gave a name that is above all other names to his only begotten son and that name that was given is the name of his father we can call christ god but not in the since that he is the almighty god for he is not he is the son of god now to the answer of your question god gave his only begotten son and jesus gave himself and did the bidding of his father a god did not die but the divine son of god did die for all that will accept him there is more that can be said peace and grace david feel free to contact me if you wish to learn more sampson yahoo com Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Dispensationalism Articles of Religion (Methodist) Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Justification (theology) Virgin Mary in Islam God Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Divine grace Priesthood (Mormonism) Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Book of Mormon Mary, the mother of Jesus Sabbath Idolatry Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Catechism Didache Holy Spirit Repentance Gospel of Barnabas Merit Religious perspectives on Jesus Old Testament Names of God in Judaism Matthew 1 Matthew 4 Names and titles of Jesus Sin Eastern Orthodox Church Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Aramaic of Jesus Christianity Predestination Baptism Mormonism Jesus Requiem 613 mitzvot Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology God and gender Abrahamic religion Rowland Taylor John the Baptist Matthew 5 Soul Jewish principles of faith Binitarianism Son of God Amidah Roman Catholic Church Abraham Isa New Testament Summa Theologiae Contrition Nontrinitarianism Filioque clause Biblical inerrancy Noah Psychopannychism Religion Devil A Course In Miracles Alan Campbell (pastor) Book of Isaiah Godhead (Mormonism) Adam-God theory John Howard Yoder Gloria in Excelsis Apostles' Creed Christian views of Jesus Gospel of Thomas Blacks and Mormonism Free will Hidden Words Apocalyptic literature Messianic Judaism Eternal Father, Strong to Save Creed Joseph Smith, Jr. Apocalypse Mass (liturgy) Charles Grandison Finney Origin belief
