the flesh apart from satan its the next worse enemy to us we have satan without and the flesh within that continuely war against us to keep us from going on and growing in the lord the besetting sins the temper the lust and pride are just some of the daily things we are faced with as believers what sort of means did the lord give us to deal with this matter of the flesh in us we see that the flesh lusts and wars against the spirit within us we are made up of three parts body soul and spirit thess the flesh is the fallen body the self is the fallen soul and our spirit is that part of us where god inhabits and dwells so this war that wages between the flesh and spirit has its middle ground in the soul of man mainly the mind which chooses to be set on the flesh or spirit each day rom how as a believer do you stand with the lord in your spirit to subdue the flesh amen brother bobby love the verses this i say then walk in the spirit and you will not fulfil the lust of the flesh for the flesh lusts against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and these are contrary the one to the other so that you cannot do the things that you would rom for what i would that do i not but what i hate that do i the apostle paul felt the same struggle the only way to subdue the flesh according to scripture is to live in the spirit the only way to live in the spirit is to purpose to set our minds on things of the spirit and to die to the flesh the only way to die to the flesh by god's grace is to come to the place that nothing is acceptable other than total and reckless abandon to self in pursuit of the will of god most of us have repeatedly heard this message or a similar one some of us hear and change a little until the change becomes too intolerable and our innate desire for flesh management once again rules the only shortcut that i know of is to pray for god's grace and the gift of a repentent heart god always hears this prayer and is faithful to comply to seriously pray this prayer also requires the grace of god the grace of god is everything Original sin Repentance Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Justification (theology) Sola fide Divine grace Holy Spirit Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Ten Commandments Baptism Soul Book of Mormon Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Mortification of the flesh Sabbath Eastern Orthodox Church Roman Catholic Church Christian eschatology Fallen angel Abrahamic religion Salvation John the Baptist Binitarianism Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Infant baptism God Angel Apostle Merit Church of Christ Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Christianity Resurrection of Jesus Devil Eucharist Summa Theologiae Mass (liturgy) Angel Sanctuary John Wesley Paradise Lost Vishnu sahasranama Alan Campbell (pastor) Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Urantia Philo Book of Isaiah Religion Hell Apostles' Creed Rastafari movement Rule of St Benedict Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Evil Jehovah's Witnesses Paul of Tarsus Duties of the Heart Adam-God theory Church of Christ, Scientist Exorcism Simone Weil Ayyavazhi mythology Great Apostasy Didache John Howard Yoder Jewish principles of faith Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Jesus Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Trinity Perseverance of the saints Mary, the mother of Jesus Aramaic of Jesus Religious pluralism Priesthood (Mormonism) Catechism Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Philipp Melanchthon Zohar Prophet Epistle to the Romans Christian mysticism Ascetical theology Martin Luther Adam and Eve Halakha Human nature Holy water Christian views of Jesus Total depravity Catholicism Book of Obadiah Purgatory Justin Martyr
