what do you think of the following quote regarding belief in a higher power 'if i take a lamp and shine toward the wall a bright spot will appear on the wall the lamp is our search for truth for understanding too often we assume the light on the wall is god but the light is not the goal of the search it is the result of the search the more intense the search the brighter the light on the wall the brighter the light on the wall the greater the revelation upon seeing it similarly someone who does not search who does not bring a lantern with him sees nothing what we perceive as god is the by product of our search for god it may simply be an appreciation of the light pure and unblemished not understanding that it comes from us sometimes we stand in front of the light and assume we are the center of the universe god looks astonishingly like we do or we turn to look at our shadow and assume all is darkness if we allow ourselves to get in the way we defeat the purpose which is use the light of our search to illuminate the wall in all its beauty and all it flaws and in so doing better understand the world around us ' despite what some people may think i didn't ask this to be inflammatory i don't think this passage is pro religion or pro atheism i'm an atheist and it makes me squirm a little so i was just curious what other people's reactions would be i think it is saying that we are making up god but i disagree i don't think we would feel the need to search if there wasn't anything to be found whatever it may be Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Theodicy Existence of God Atheism Bicycle lighting Lighting Religion Stage lighting Eastern Orthodox Church Jewish principles of faith Simone Weil A Course In Miracles Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Strong atheism Book of Isaiah Supernatural Angel Fundamentalism Street light Monotheism Automotive lighting S__ren Kierkegaard Freemasonry Ten Commandments Gas lighting Fluorescent lamp Color Michel Henry Rainbow Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Judaism Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Time Out of Mind Intelligent design The Subtle Knife John Wycliffe Socrates Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Intelligent design movement History of creationism The nature of God in Western theology Jewish views of religious pluralism Religious Society of Friends Plame affair Philosophical skepticism Guru Historicity of Jesus Gnosticism Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Christian eschatology Mormonism and Christianity Theology David Hume Philosophy Richard Dawkins Originalism Presuppositional apologetics Phillip E.
