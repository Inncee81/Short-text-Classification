why has the pastor of my church never responded to me when i've tried to talk or to letters i've written him when the times have been toughest at my church i've tried to talk to my pastor about it even mailed him some letters to tell him how much i appreciate him as a pastor and explained things i was going through he is such a great pastor and does so many great things for that church i respect him a lot just can't figure out why he talks to others and is so short with me if i invited him out to bob evans sometime or out somewhere to eat to try to speak with him do you think he'd still ignore me like he has before and why do i care so much i have questions about the denomination and such but why do i feel like i can't talk to my pastor of six years about it whats wrong with me how do i mend all fences once and for all is it possible he looks down on me because of the people i hang around i mean i've brought other people to church with me before but i always thought we as believers were supposed to do that i want to continue going to the first church of the nazarene but want it fixed as a christian and also as a former nazarene i can tell you that your pastor likely has his reasons for not responding to you in the manner in which you wish him to respond first are you too clingy if he is very busy and you are a high maintenance parishoner then he could be pulling back to help you learn to not be too clingy pastors are on call hours a day days a week even their personal time is interrupted by church members and church business my ex father in law used to be a minister of a nazarene church i know what i'm talking about here let's say you're not too clingy are you a female perhaps your pastor could be reading the potential for others to accuse him of impropriety if he sits down with you somewhere for a face to face talk is your pastor extremely busy how reliable is your e mail server i know that my husband and i e mail each other throughout the day occasionally but inevitably one or both of us won't receive each other's e mails because our server somehow blocked our e mails even though our settings allowed the person to go through really the only way you are going to know what's up is to talk to him obviously this is a problem because you are unable to get him to connect so that you can talk telling the church secretary when you call that you are feeling frustrated because the pastor is not returning your e mails and phone calls and you really need to talk to him is another approach yu can try she can relay the frustrations to your pastor he may not even be aware that he is giving you the impression that he is blowing you off another thing you can do is to approach a church elder or church board member and explain without bad mouthing the pastor that you are having trouble getting some time to talk with your pastor and that you are in need of pastoral counseling ask them to facilitate you in trying to speak with your pastor because he is not returning your calls and e mails if all else fails you can contact the district superintendent's office of the church of the nazarene for the area that you live in look up the church of the nazarene general headquarters in kansas city and there should be a way to find out the phone number for your local district superintendant's office often times a call from the local d s to the pastor can clear up problems try not to go over the pastor's head if you don't have to though it's best to try to resolve this every other way first so that your pastor will not feel you are attacking him and thereby have hard feelings he may be a minister but he is still a human being and his job is not an easy one hope this all works out for you Social rule Plame affair Religious Society of Friends Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Scientology beliefs and practices Church of Christ Theory of conduct Avenue Q John Wesley United Methodist Church Pentecostalism Minister of religion Baptist E-mail Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Methodism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Church of the Nazarene Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Nuanced voices on the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Milton H.
