how much longer until atheism agnosticism is the majority the number of people who are atheist agnostic is now over billion and has doubled in the last ten years and is growing faster than all of the major religions combined at this rate by there will be more atheist agnostics than christians so my question is how much longer do you think it will be until more than of the world's population is atheist agnostic about years ago the economist magazine published a vatican estimate of the numbers in the major world religions or quasi religions if you want to argue that agnosticism and atheism are not religions they gave million agnostics and million atheists not including buddhists whom some call atheists although this caused buddhist riots when the pope said it a few years ago as some sort of agnostic who finds it misleading a bit offensive and possibly a bit dangerous to get labelled a weak atheist i tend to half sympathise with the poor old buddhists on this one though i think that ultimately they were wrong to try to prevent the pope or anybody else speaking their mind but i digress anyway if we unbelievers had doubled in numbers in the past years there should now be billion of us and if you believe that then i've got some wonderful shares i want to sell you at a bargain basement price so i suggest you just take all such estimates and claims with a large pinch of salt at least one computer expert claims that moore's law the most fundamental law of computer economics should cause the power of the silicon chip to match that of the human brain by and assuming that the power of software keeps pace with that of hardware then a computer or computers should take over by then or shortly thereafter the precise date should of course be taken with a pinch of salt and if we're very lucky or perhaps very unlucky there may be some bottleneck that negates the whole scenario and if we're lucky we may get something like heaven on earth after a kindly disposed quasi super intelligent computer provides us with the secret of eternal youth probably some relatively simple gene therapy to counter the ageing process and inexhaustible economic resources if we're unlucky the computer will decide based on its american christian 'moral education' or its own conclusions as to what is safest for it to do in the light of the apparent perversity of this world or perhaps through being told what to do by its american christian programmers that it should follow the lord's prayer and try to ensure that the father's will is done on earth as it is in heaven in that case we can expect that the secret of eternal youth will be used to create fairly literal hell meaning 'eternal or quasi eternal agony' here on earth for non christians who have always been the majority of humankind even if most are not atheist agnostic and christian sinners alike incidentally in light of your question this may well somewhat trivially and irrelevantly result in a world majority of unbelievers as it becomes difficult for the victims to continue to believe in the existence and or goodness of god slightly less trivially for reasons i will come to shortly at least for the first years or so christians may cling to the hope that this horror is just the predicted year reign of anti christ always assuming that the extreme agony still permits something resembling rational thought and of course they just might be right and who knows maybe the computer will behave this way through being inspired or deceived by the evil one in that case any christian trying to prevent discussion of this issue arguably the most important issue humankind has ever faced discussion aimed at delaying or preventing this disaster would effectively be a servant of the anti christ and thus presumably liable according to scripture to eternal agony in hell in the next world the freedom of expression loving christian yahoo moderators should consider that before trying to suppress this discussion just as they deleted a closely related question of mine last month i'm still waiting for them to tell me which rule that post is supposed to have broken i do hope to resubmit that question eventually possibly backed up by some legal advice concerning possible punitive damages for unreasonable violation of one's right to freedom of expression and perhaps of humankind's right not to be unnecessarily exposed to the risk of hell on earth as outlined above that might well make for some sort of world record punitive damages claim which might incidentally provide welcome free publicity for my ideas though it might also provide some less welcome headaches for yahoo shareholders and stakeholders similar comments presumably also apply to attempts to suppress my current post my ideas on this topic have changed slightly over the past five years and i have not yet written up the changes if anybody wants to read my views of years ago which are mostly still valid you can find them by going to the
