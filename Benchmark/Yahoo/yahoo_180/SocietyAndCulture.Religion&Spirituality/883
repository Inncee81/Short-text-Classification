arabic and islam okay before you all get hotheaded over this just know that i have the right to voice my opinion as well as you or the next person so keep your biased matters to yourself why do most people esp muslims think that just because something is in arabic it is so holy etc okay it is agreed that the holy book the holy al qur'an is in arabic agreed but why do people expect to write something regarding islam or not and expect others to take it so generously just because it is in arabic you know writing something in arabic or whatever else language does not make something holy the qur'an could've been in bengali or urdu as its primary language and we would still accept and follow its messages all the same what is prophet muhammad saw was bengali or pakistani what if he was desi then would it matter whether the qur'an was in bengali or not no it simply doesn't matter as long as we regard the qur'an as holy and comply so to all those out there why do you expect anyone to regard your newspaper writings or anything not related to islam as so great just because it is in arabic oh and don't say because the qur'an is in arabic don't bring any islam into this it has nothing to do with islam okay this is a very interesting question at our masjid i too have noticed that the arab speaking people tend to portray that just because they know arabic that they know islam better in many cases i have seen them doing things that normally desi people like myself would frown upon it seems that the arab speaking people i have seen have found a loophole to justify what they do i am sure that if a pakistani indian bengali or asian muslim did the same thing then they would chase him out of the mosque i know the quran as well as the bible states that we all should not judge i am not in any way offended by your question at all may allah provide knowledge to those who know not of their possible ignorance i know i can possibly write a book on this topic as my friends family and community have discussed this very topic please feel free to email on this subject hope this helps Qur'an Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Nation of Islam Islam Religion Prophets of Islam Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Abraham Muhammad Arabic language Sunni Islam Islamic philosophy God Arabic alphabet Hadith Prophet Succession to Muhammad Qur'an alone Qiyamah Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi Arab Abrahamic religion Urdu Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Isa Adam and Eve Jizya Salah Arabic literature Sufism Mohammad Ali Jinnah Yusuf al-Qaradawi Hijab Angel Ahmadiyya Muslim Community Apostasy in Islam Allah Predestination Holy Spirit Criticism of Islam Status of religious freedom in Saudi Arabia Islam and Judaism Virgin Mary in Islam Mary, the mother of Jesus Bangladesh Liberation War Madrassa Polygamy Caliph Evolutionary creationism Wahhabism Alawite Religious perspectives on Jesus Divisions of Islam Aisha Islam as a political movement Nikah Mut'ah Islamism Shi'a Islam Religious conversion Zia-ul-Haq's Islamization Abu Bakr Pakistan Tafsir Liberal movements within Islam United Submitters International Translation of the Qur'an Sunnah Ali Dhul-Qarnayn Salvation Chosen people Hizb ut-Tahrir Five Pillars of Islam John the Baptist Saint Adnan Oktar Proposals for a Palestinian state Bisexuality New Testament Indian English Magic (paranormal) Jerusalem History of Pakistan Arab-Israeli conflict Mosque Angels in Islam Bid'ah Islamic calligraphy Ramadan
