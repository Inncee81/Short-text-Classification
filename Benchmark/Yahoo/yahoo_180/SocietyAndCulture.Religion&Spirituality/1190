how did your upbringing influence your religious beliefs or non beliefs were there any defining moments here is mine my grandmother was a devout catholic we used to go on walks and do the rosary together my dad her son killed himself when i was when i was my grandmother told me that when my dad died the priest told my grandparents that my dad was in hell and to forget about him they trusted the priest and took his advice leaving my dad's ashes in another state and holding no ceremony for him by then she was extremely ill with parkinsons she asked me to put my dad to rest my husband and i did and took her to his burial you could see the guilt lift from her it was then i knew that i could never be a part of catholicism again those beliefs caused my grandmother deep pain and regret thanks for sharing my father is a catholic and my mother is a black belt atheist to this day i was going to catholic school and my mother got into an argument with the nuns she sat me down and told me that god was like the easter bunny and santa clause i thought i was mentally ill for many years because i was very close to jesus personally after miserable years i found jesus again this time nothing will separate me from his love Eastern Orthodox Church Roman Catholic Church Trinity Religion Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity The Brothers Karamazov Ten Commandments Religious views of suicide Baptism Exorcism Faustyna Kowalska God Knots Landing Atheism The Amber Spyglass Baptist Virginia Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) Marriage Catholicism Funeral The Pilgrim's Progress Family Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Mary, the mother of Jesus A Course In Miracles Sin Origin belief About a Boy Shaggy dog story Mother Teresa C.
