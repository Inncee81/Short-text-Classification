why can we all just get along it has come to my attention that yahoo answers has become a place for people of certain beliefs to talk trash to each other now i find this a bit redundant because both sides happen to try and use the fact that the other side is talking trash all the time about them by the way im speaking of religon both christian or other and the atheists that are against it some of you are really rude and i find it quite un nessacary why is it like this i find it all really immature especially when atheists constantly challenge the faith of others just to let you know im not religous at all its just something i noticed and i wanted to see if anyone else felt the same and again this is just a question don't take this as me being angry lol because im not im just curious i shall answer my own question because someone asked i think no one can get along because we are all too absorbed in our own ideals now notice i still never took a side the only reason i said anything about atheists in general and not religous people is because i haven't seen any questions challenging atheists since ive been on here and you must notice that almost everyone that has answered this question was being defensive i think thats saying a little something follow your own advice its just a question answer it or don't debate discussion and argueing a point are legitimate tools in progressing a discussion however petty trash talkin is designed to stimulate emotions if they inspire genuine discussion then they can be useful otherwise they are misguided comments made by people who have nothing positive or intelligent to contribute and should be dismissed as such as to why we cant all get along well thats never gunna happen the young will allways challenge the old the poor or discarded class will allways challenge the privledged the minority group will allways challenge the validity of the larger mob this is how change happens not by us all agreeing but the dissenting voice Atheism Religion Intelligent design movement Existence of God Creationism Supernatural Christianity Phillip E.
