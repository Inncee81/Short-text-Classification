question for muslims or anyone that would care to comment i read in u s a today that the university of michigan at dearborn is planning to build foot baths for muslim students who wash their feet before prayer will god not acknowledge your prayers if your feet are dirty and if so how do you account when me and my friends lay our hands on the sick in prayer and they are healed i wouldn't want to smell any of my friends feet hey how about answering part two of my question its a gesture of respect toward allah actually muslims frequently wash much more than just their feet before prayer it's very difficult for them to be true to the traditional custom in the western world from the koran surah when you prepare for prayer wash your faces and your hands and arms to the elbows rub your heads with water and wash your feet to the ankles if you are in a state of ceremonial impurity bathe your whole body Ablution Wudu Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Salah Prayer Qur'an Islam Baptism John the Baptist Qiyamah Women in Islam Five Pillars of Islam Nation of Islam Hijab Salute Saint Islam and clothing Fasting Roman Catholic Church Japanese tea ceremony Temple (Mormonism) Mary, the mother of Jesus Tefillin Social rule Sunni Islam Demon Chosen people Yusuf al-Qaradawi Mass (liturgy) Aisha Religious pluralism Ayyavazhi religious practices Apostasy in Islam Shinto Hadith Church of Christ, Scientist Professional wrestling holds Muslim ibn Aqeel Twelvers Magic (paranormal) God Backstroke A Course In Miracles Tattoo Customs and etiquette of Japan Eid ul-Fitr Culture of Thailand Anointing John Wesley Kohen Buddhism Noah Feet washing Sento Joke Temple in Jerusalem Hasidic Judaism Jewish principles of faith Maria al-Qibtiyya Theodicy Joseph of Arimathea Judaism Filioque clause Christianity Allah Endowment (Mormonism) Jizya Mother Teresa Characters of Naruto Bowing (social) Catechism Origin belief Sabbatai Zevi Sauna Pharisees Amidah Holy water Professional wrestling aerial techniques Sharia Intercession of saints Skin Funeral Homosexuality and Christianity Pledge of Allegiance Western Wall Gesture Funeral of Pope John Paul II Muhammad Philipp Melanchthon Mary Magdalene Vlad III Dracula Succession to Muhammad Gospel of Barnabas Al-Razi Jerusalem Night (book) Idolatry Michael (archangel)
