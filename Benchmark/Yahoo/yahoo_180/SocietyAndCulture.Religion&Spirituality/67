why people like to criticize catholic church in part it's because the catholic church has done things that are worthy of criticism the inquisition the crusades their recent handling of the sex abuse cases and so on in part it's because the church teaches that it's necessary to strive for perfection knowing it's impossible and so it's criticized when it cannot meet this standard itself in part it's because people are ignorant of the church's teaching and have been exposed to anti catholic prejudice themselves in part it's because it has a hierarchical structure and many people rebel against authority it's difficult to accept that someone else's judgement should be held preferential to your own and there are other reasons criticism used to challenge and reform is good criticism used for hatred and spite is wrong unchristian unfortunately i feel that criticism of the sort seen here is usually of the latter kind as a catholic it's important to remember that we must be the change we wish to see in the world it is our obligation to be tolerant and respectful even when others aren't Roman Catholic Church Anti-Semitism Christian-Jewish reconciliation Theory of conduct Second Vatican Council Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Religious pluralism Church of Christ Separation of church and state Witch-hunt Religion Mariavite Church Opus Dei Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Birth control Biblical canon Aesthetic Realism Traditionalist Catholic Excommunication Eastern Orthodox Church Sabbath Evil Criticisms of Christianity Heresy Culture of Lithuania Infantilism Christianity Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Merit Criticism of Mormonism Great Apostasy Filioque clause Alignment (role-playing games) Cultural relativism Pope Benedict XVI Transsexuality Fundamentalism Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Clergy Catholicism Society of Jesus Conscience Council of Basel French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools History of Christianity Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Christianity and anti-Semitism Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal Socrates Christian eschatology Original sin Homophobia Homosexuality and Christianity Society of St. Pius X Jewish views of religious pluralism Abortion debate Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Atheism Historical persecution by Christians Evolutionary creationism Eucharist Liberalism Ontological argument Fasting Marriage Cathar Marcel Lefebvre Philosophical skepticism John Wycliffe Spiritism Bogomilism Christian denomination History of the Jews in France Coercion Confucianism Sola scriptura Same-sex marriage in Canada Stoicism Utilitarianism Autism rights movement Baptist Galileo Galilei Waldensians Satanism Mahatma Gandhi Dissociative identity disorder Inquisition Counter-Reformation Summa Theologiae Contract Augsburg Confession Criticism of libertarianism Christian anarchism Social rule Ordination of women Pope Rick Santorum Friedrich Schleiermacher Deconstruction Epistemology
