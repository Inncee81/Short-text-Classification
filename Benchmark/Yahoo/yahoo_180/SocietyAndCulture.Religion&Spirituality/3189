can a married couple that has different religious beliefs really be happy together i am non denominational and my husband is a jehovah's witness in training his parents are jehovah's witnesses and converted when my husband was about or years old he said he stopped going to the kingdom hall when he moved out of his parents house but when we met he had just started to get involved with it again he does not consistently meet with them but it's kind of an off and on thing one minute he's going to the kingdom hall every sunday and attending meetings during the week and the next thing you know he's not going however he believes like they do he does not celebrate holidays believe in blood transfusions etc we talked about it before marriage and decided that we would do whatever it took to make it work it was very hard for me to deal with at first because my family is very close and we celebrate everything but now i am just dealing with it it's not as big of an issue can we ever be truly happy together anybody else going through this read this please ok i'm going through the exact same thing there's a big difference though my wife is in the jw congregations not me jw men expect a lot of their women and tend to be very controling from an outsiders perspective this would make your situation a bit more difficult than mine but everything else is just the same she was disfellowshipped and now is going back to meetings on tues thurs and sun i support her eventhough i'm agnostic which is a weird combo for a relationship haha i simply respect her right not to celebrate holidays and she respects my right to do so we also have a kid i have already told her that he will not be raised jw unless he chooses and not brainwashed into doing so later on she agreed this would be a difficult feat for you to pull off as in the jw religion the man would simply have the say in the matter and you shouldn't be allowed to have a choice now asside from kids that brings us to blood transfusions there is jw approved i'm pretty sure alternative it is called synthetic blood transfusion if you are worried and i was about my wife before her pregnancy then ask your husband to bring up synthetic blood transfusions and have them really find out if it is approved if it is speak with your doctor and tell them that in emergencies if a transfusion is needed then they need to have synthetic available for your husband if it's possible hope that helps my family is real close too and during the holidays because everyone gets days off from work for them we meet mainly for family not for the celebration thing so much which sucks but i deal with it it's the only thing you can do just accept the fact that he won't be going and go yourself do not stay home because he does very important if you respect his decision to not go he should respect yours to go me and my wife have had some problems but none of them were related to religion if you need some advice more specificly send me a private message and i'm sure that i can help you out Jehovah's Witnesses Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Alcoholics Anonymous Church of Christ Polyamory Religious conversion Marriage Laura Schlessinger Baptism Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Religious Society of Friends Pascal's Wager Same-sex marriage Eucharist Ten Commandments EastEnders Restorationism Homosexuality and Christianity Unitarian Universalism Infantilism Theory of conduct Divorce Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Organizational structure of Jehovah's Witnesses Abortion debate Childbirth Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Separation of church and state Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Judaism Scientology beliefs and practices Sexual orientation Church of Christ, Scientist Trinity Religious pluralism Messianic Judaism Same-sex marriage in Canada The nature of God in Western theology Christmas Charles Grandison Finney Abortion in the United States Humphrey Bogart Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Friends Christian eschatology Avenue Q Eastern Orthodox Church Goodness and value theory Abortion Knots Landing Who is a Jew?
