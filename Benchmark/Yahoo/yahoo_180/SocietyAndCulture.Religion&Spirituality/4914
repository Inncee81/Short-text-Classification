honest question for jws on blood transfusions why is a blood transfusion considered to violate the mosaic law's prohibition on eating blood since the blood is entering the body via the circulatory system and not via the digestive system also why are jws required to keep this part of the mosaic law and not others i know there is a passage in the nt that the wt says restates this rule for christians but i forgot where it is please note this is a serious inquiry i really just want to know what this doctrine is based upon not being an a troll or anything like that thanks jws who provided the reference in acts still looks to me like paul's talking about blood eaten in meat though thanks our jewish sister you are right gentile christians were never under jewish law unless jews before converersion paul's entire letter to the galatians is about just that counsel to gentile christians not to listen to the judaizers who were trying to make them come under a law that they were never under in the first place very good point i appreciate your perspective peace blessings thanks to those of you who gave the analogy to alcohol injection now that you mention it i do remember hearing that years ago i personally find the comparison to be rather silly but you are right that it has been used by the wt ray the other mosaic laws i am talking about are all those that we don't keep ie sacrifices festivals cleansing rituals etc actung where is it prior to the mosaic law thanks as always danny ok i did remember that god gave this command to noah when he stepped of the ark and gave people permission from then on to use animals for food but again he speaks of eating blood inside the meat same as paul later commands to not eat meat that has been strangled i honestly don't see the connection as far as intervenious feeding comparisons although the body does get sustainance from that practice it is still not eating in the truest sense it is still not going thru the digestive system if we are going to use the alcohol injection example then why can't i eat a pizza interveinously either case seems equally ridiculous to me it's not that i'm trying to argue it's just that i don't find the wt response to satisfy the questions completely however i will say that thanks to the wt's encouragement of the medical profession to seek alternatives i'm sure other people will be able to benefit from this in the future so that part has been helpful it's a total misinterpretation of jewish law that never applied to non jews in the first place none of the laws in the torah ever applied to non jews except the noahide laws anyway i don't care if christians scream bloody murder that they were once under the law they only believe this because their churches incorrectly tell them so we know they never were it's our laws and it's our book and we know exactly who was under our laws and who wasn't non jews never were jesus didn't free christians from anything in the torah because people cannot be freed from something they were never bound by in the first place it doesn't exist as for the noahide laws jesus didn't free non jews from that either for christians who say he did i'd say well go on out and murder someone then and see how far you get so for these jw's to be following a law they obviously have no understanding of were never under in the first place means that they are basically just blinded by the incorrect information that their church teaches them not an uncommon thing for churches to teach total inaccuracies about the torah and it's meanings it's pretty much the rule rather than the exception source me jewish Dispensationalism Acts of the Apostles Torah Kashrut Legalism (theology) History of Christianity Book of Mormon Judaizers 613 mitzvot Mormonism and Judaism Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Homosexuality and Christianity Jewish views of religious pluralism Scientology beliefs and practices Old Testament Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Biblical canon Divine grace Theory of conduct Korban Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Jewish Christians Cultural and historical background of Jesus Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Noah Predestination Creationism Ebionites Fasting Resurrection of Jesus Saint James the Just Religion Chosen people Book of Isaiah Kosher foods Vegetarianism Heresy Eucharist Maimonides Religious pluralism Capital punishment Infant baptism Messianic Judaism Genesis Unclean animals Free will Prophet Saint Peter Passover Holy Spirit Christianity Angel Moses Trinity Nazarene God Who is a Jew?
