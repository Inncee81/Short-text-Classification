what if you don't believe in religion what if you believe in a god but not a religion i have dabbled in buddhaism toltec beliefs and i was baptised catholic i think buddhaism and the toltec way of life is absolutley beautiful and more realistic and you won't burn in hell for any reason i think i have met people in my lifetime one catholic and one lutheran both female who truly lived by their religion all the time and didn't shove it down your throat and were truly genuinely kind and true all the time so is it enough to be good and believe without following a religion i think to get to that point where you are completley fulfilled that is religion to be able to feel close to god despite anything or anyone else i think that those who dont have a religion but believe in god are usually the most faithful since everything they do is for god and not because someone told them to having a religion or not having a religion it doesnt matter like i said before reaching that point of complete and utter happiness nirvana i believe is what we are all ultimately after i am still trying to get to that point Religion Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Heaven Baptism Divine grace Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Ten Commandments Religious conversion Christianity and anti-Semitism Eucharist Christianity Holy Spirit Religious pluralism Prophet Predestination Lutheranism Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses God Fundamentalism Miracle Faith Sin Mythology Philosophy of religion Spiritism Idolatry The nature of God in Western theology Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Great Apostasy Salvation Reincarnation Jesus Simone Weil Biblical inerrancy Emanuel Swedenborg Meaning of life Catholicism Christian-Jewish reconciliation Atomic Kitten David Hume Church of Christ Immortality Christian apologetics Atheism Justification (theology) Theology Faith in Buddhism Soul Existence of God Christian denomination Abrahamic religion Purgatory Calvinism John the Baptist Pascal's Wager Christian eschatology Evil Sikhism Islam Opus Dei Saint Free will Merit Separation of church and state Maimonides Paul of Tarsus Theodicy Supernatural S__ren Kierkegaard Infant baptism Resurrection of Jesus Biblical canon Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Sola fide Religious Society of Friends Mennonite Mexico Hindu philosophy Eastern Orthodox Church Bible and reincarnation The Amber Spyglass Evolutionary creationism Scientology beliefs and practices Ascetical theology Sabbath Chosen people Mary, the mother of Jesus Sacrifice A Course In Miracles Christian right Rich Mullins Eschatology C.
