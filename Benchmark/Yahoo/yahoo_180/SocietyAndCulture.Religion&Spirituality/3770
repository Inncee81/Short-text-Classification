why is it when a question involves judaism or it's flawed history christians feel the need to come to their rescue with their jesus answers don't they know jews do not believe or have not ever believed in jesus in any way to judaism and jews alike jesus was a blasphemer and against their faith when will christians accept this truth if you are wondering why there is blind support for the state of israel from evangelical and other american christian denominations the answer is simple in a complicated way the fundamentalist jews want to tear down the islamic al aqsa mosque and rebuild the temple of solomon which was supposedly there first the fundie jews believe that if they do this it will bring the messiah the fundie christians want the same thing because they believe if the temple is rebuilt then jesus will come back with the rapture and the fire and brimstone and whatnot the fundie christians therefore blindly support the state of israel and the israelis wisely one could argue take full advantage of the support from the us government what the zionists do not realize is that in the christian prophecy they will be forced to convert to christianity or be killed luckily for them there is no such thing as jesus unfortunately they still believe in rebuilding for the messiah which is all not at all based in reality and then people wonder why the muslims are pissed off among other reasons Temple Mount Religion in Israel Judaism Christian Zionism Michael Dennis Rohan Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Messiah Messianic Judaism End times Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Jew Jesus Religious conversion Zionism Abrahamic religion Historicity of Jesus Christian eschatology Fundamentalism Religion Christianity and anti-Semitism Religious pluralism Ten Lost Tribes Schisms among the Jews Resurrection of Jesus Book of Revelation Book of Mormon Jerusalem History of Christianity Jewish principles of faith Temple in Jerusalem God Ten Commandments Book of Isaiah Jewish views of religious pluralism Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Cultural and historical background of Jesus Religious perspectives on Jesus Jewish eschatology Reform Judaism Supersessionism Bible Second Coming Sanhedrin Chosen people Who is a Jew?
