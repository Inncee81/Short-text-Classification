for all theists and atheists over here what if someone wrote to you and said that maybe not in this lifetime but maybe in the next lifetime when we return as cats we will be able to see eachother he also said it is just philisophical or theoretical not actual have you read something similar to this there is a hot debate in here as to whether cats really exist or not occasionally there is a raid on the cats section of yahoo answers with questions from this section by atheists and theists alike but over there the call themselves afelinists and felinists i find it quite amusing though others do not as for your question there are a lot of people who think people are reincarnated as other animals it stems from hinduism and other eastern religions complete bunko of course and downright absurd but hey everybody is at least entitled to believe whatever the heck they want to believe right i mean look at tom cruise and his goofy religion but making up a religion or believing a religion that some other person made up what use is it really power control an opiate for the pain of life ridiculous i'd rather have the truth no matter what that is as it turns out biblical christianity is the truth and that's what i am by god's grace through faith in his son jesus christ though i use to be an ignorant atheist in any event it appears that this person either likes you and wants to see you or doesn't like you and doesn't want to see you it is hard to say with what you have given us and i am not sure if they were trying to be funny or sarcastic or what if it is bugging you then perhaps you should directly ask the person what they mean and what they are talking about Atheism Religion Theodicy Supernatural Jesus Sin Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Hell Soul Origin belief Charles Darwin's views on religion Evolutionary creationism Resurrection of Jesus Afterlife Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism The nature of God in Western theology Bible and reincarnation Urantia Eastern Orthodox Church Creationism Apologetics Roman Catholic Church Justification (theology) Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Historicity of Jesus Religious pluralism New Testament Religious conversion Trinity Saint Reincarnation Salvation Scientology beliefs and practices Fundamentalism Church of Christ, Scientist Heaven Christianity Apostle Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Strong atheism Infant baptism Creation-evolution controversy Immortality Eastern philosophy Biblical canon Divine grace Idolatry History of Christianity Problem of Hell Biblical inerrancy Meaning of life Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Calvinism Christian philosophy Monotheism Baptism Mary, the mother of Jesus Christian eschatology Predestination Intelligent design Spiritism Free will Judaism Prophet Friedrich Schleiermacher The Pilgrim's Progress Simone Weil History of creationism Pascal's Wager Sola fide Moral objectivism Antony Flew Religious perspectives on Jesus Book of Mormon Persecution of Christians Catholicism C.
