if we all originated from the same first living cell how come there are reptiles and mammals the bigger question here would be why are there humans do you really think that humans have existed since the beginning of time and if so why haven't we found any of these humans remains we are a genus of the species that's why scientist has named us homo sapiens if we hadn't evolved we'd all still be a bunch of bacteria swimming around a gigantic ocean take this for example birds billions and millions of different birds inhabit this planet they live in different climates and in total different circumstances straight down to what they eat if you brought a bird from the amazon and made it live in a place like canada chances are that they won t survive very well because they have adapted to their surroundings even in the very species of humans you can find the same diversity people who originally lived in warmer climates such as near the equator have darker skin to protect their bodies if you send a white norwegian to mexico chances are if they stand in the sun for a while they're going to burn people with darker skin have more melanin to protect them from harsh sun damage it's funny you ask why mammals and reptiles we are mammals so in a way you're asking why we exist well the fact is that the world did not stay a gigantic fish bowel forever the earth started to lose the amount of water that covered its land so the animals in the ocean had to adapt to the new conditions which is where amphibians come from amphibians to this day will start as a fish and mutate to be able to walk on land how much more evidence do you need after witnessing that from the amphibians came the reptiles and so on and so forth this took billions of years i guess the gigantic dinosaur bones that they uncover and display in museums are just fake people are so stuck on this time in our life of course we will never be able to witness first hand how evolution works it takes too long however we see evidence of this occurring all the time take for example the appendix this was thought to help humans digest leaves and dirt but after a while we didn't need to eat leaves and dirt so our stomachs grew and shrunk the appendix the appendix use is still questionable but the fact is that we don't use them anymore people as a result are being born without an appendix at all i think that's evidence of evolution if it weren't for evolution there would be no diversity which ultimately means we'd still be bacteria swimming in a fish bowel there is evidence of fish and of arthropods that lived where there is land today this is proof that at one time the earth was covered in water why don't you actually take the time to research instead of wasting time to dismiss something you know so little about Dinosaur Human Evolution Species Evidence of evolution Extinction Human skin color Tetrapod Mammal Ecology Flood geology Carnivorous plant Melanin Thermoregulation Reptile Tuatara Fauna of Australia Biodiversity Eye Vitamin C Triassic Animal Intelligent design Seabird Aquatic ape hypothesis Earth Largest organism Paleocene Richard Owen Orca Neanderthal Shark Biology Sperm Whale Dolphin Marine biology Paleoclimatology Bacteria Death Valley National Park Stone Age Amphibian Bird Origin of life Plesiosaur Antarctic krill Fermi paradox Nile crocodile Extraterrestrial life Human evolution Tyrannosaurus rex Tooth Permian-Triassic extinction event Brain Cryptozoology February 2005 in science Sexual reproduction Atlantic Ocean Planetary habitability Macroevolution Fugu Evolutionism Tasmanian Devil Life Cancer Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Pterosaur Albatross Albinism Renewable energy Race Ichthyosaur Insect Ecology of Hong Kong Irreducible complexity Sun Elephant E.V.O.: Search for Eden Capercaillie Human extinction Egg (biology) Climate change Snake Bottlenose Dolphin Noah's Ark Circulatory system The End of the World (Doctor Who) Biodiversity of New Zealand Lung Gaia theory (science) Solar system Leatherback Sea Turtle Iceland
