who is the beast of revelation and i saw a beast coming out of the sea he had ten horns and seven heads with ten crowns on his horns and on each head a blasphemous name the beast i saw resembled a leopard but had feet like those of a bear and a mouth like that of a lion the dragon satan gave the beast his power and his throne and great authority i guess this has down history had all sorts of interpretations depending on current politics some people think its just a reference to roman empire back in st century protestants thought it might be roman church in c my school history teacher said that many thought it was nazi germany in his time cold war americans thought it might be ussr and china and communism after cold war some people thought it might be eu after millenium some might think it could be an increasingly violent islamic world what do you think it might be such beasts have their interpretation through other parts of the bible please note similar representatives in daniel daniel i happened to be beholding in my visions during the night and see there the four winds of the heavens were stirring up the vast sea and four huge beasts were coming up out of the sea each one being different from the others the first one was like a lion and it had the wings of an eagle i kept on beholding until its wings were plucked out and it was lifted up from the earth and was made to stand up on two feet just like a man and there was given to it the heart of a man and see there another beast a second one it being like a bear and on one side it was raised up and there were three ribs in its mouth between its teeth and this is what they were saying to it get up eat much flesh after this i kept on beholding and see there another beast one like a leopard but it had four wings of a flying creature on its back and the beast had four heads and there was given to it rulership indeed the following commentary is part of a complete discussion of the beasts and its mark the beast exposed the bible book of daniel sheds much light on the meaning of symbolic beasts chapter contains a vivid tableau of four huge beasts a lion a bear a leopard and a fearsome beast with big teeth of iron daniel daniel tells us that these beasts represent kings or political kingdoms that rule in succession over vast empires daniel regarding the beast of revelation the interpreter's dictionary of the bible points out that it combines in itself the joint characteristics of the four beasts of daniel's vision accordingly this first beast of revelation represents the combined forces of all political rule opposed to god in the world this observation is affirmed by revelation which says of the beast authority was given it over every tribe and people and tongue and nation why does the bible use beasts as symbols of human rulership for at least two reasons first because of the beastly record of bloodshed that governments have accrued over the centuries war is one of the constants of history wrote historians will and ariel durant and has not diminished with civilization or democracy how true that man has dominated man to his injury ecclesiastes the second reason is that the dragon satan gave to the beast its power and its throne and great authority revelation accordingly human rulership is a product of the devil thus reflecting his beastly dragonlike disposition john ephesians this does not mean however that every human ruler is a direct tool of satan indeed in one sense human governments serve as god's minister giving structure to human society without which chaos would rule and some leaders have protected fundamental human rights including the right to engage in true worship something that satan does not want romans ezr acts still because of the devil's influence no human or human institution has ever been able to bring lasting peace and security to the people john more rather than one entity would it not be more feasible for all human governments as a composite
