was jesus christ born as an atheist aren't we all my parents have always tried to force feed me with religion they were successful for a while but in the long run they failed i am a much happier person now i don't know anyone who is born anything let alone an atheist its a denial of a higher power and i think most infants would if you could tap into their brain would have some belief in something larger than themselves since they are so dependent on others i can assure you that the son of god was not born an atheist he had the knowledge of his father's mission early in life thus he teachings to the pharisees when he was young and went to the temple with mary and joseph christ was born without sin and his role as our savior was always in place not something he took up later in life yes my grandparents brought me to their church but i don't see that as forcing religion on me i see that as being a good parent to show me the belief they had in god and which made them better people and happier with their lives Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Jesus Holy Spirit Heaven Baptism Mary, the mother of Jesus Justification (theology) Original sin Salvation Sin Christian eschatology Christianity Religion Trinity Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Baptist Church of Christ, Scientist Apostles' Creed Soul Sola fide Mormonism Divine grace Resurrection Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism God Mormonism and Christianity Atheism Apostasy Pharisees Religious perspectives on Jesus Catholicism Mary Magdalene Priesthood (Mormonism) Cultural and historical background of Jesus Justin Martyr Religious conversion Theosis Creationism Catechism Community of Christ Resurrection of Jesus Christ Temple (Mormonism) New Testament view on Jesus' life Prophet Book of Mormon History of the Latter Day Saint movement Church of Christ Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Roman Catholic Church United Methodist Church Predestination Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Infant baptism A Course In Miracles Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Gospel of Thomas Religious Society of Friends Articles of Religion (Methodist) Theodicy Fundamentalism Heresy Limited atonement Abrahamic religion Sacrifice Great Apostasy God the Father Summa Theologiae Saint James the Just Apostle Thomas Jefferson Endowment (Mormonism) Binitarianism Calvinism Transubstantiation Eastern Orthodox Church Rich Mullins Christian view of marriage Emma Hale Smith Unitarian Universalism Moral objectivism Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Phillip E.
