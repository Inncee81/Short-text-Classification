polytheism vs pantheism or is there even a contradiction heathens and many pagans tend to be believe in separate discrete individual deities pantheons hindus are also polytheists but believe afaik that their many many deities are all expressions forms or incarnations of shiva at least i think that's how it goes pantheists believe everything that is is the divine how contradictory is this really does deity have to be all encompassing to be a god or can gods be more specific and local i as a heathen pretty much know all the different gods are well different anyone can tell odin thor tyr loki and heimdall aren't the same being just as anyone should be able to tell that freya kali hecate and athena aren't the same beings some gods and goddesses have things in common just as some people have things in common thor and zeus are both connected with thunder and lightning yes so zeus doesn't have a big hammer and thor doesn't carry hephaestus brand thunderbolts pantheism bugs me i see no reason to assume all gods or goddesses are simply one god or goddess anymore than i see a reason to believe people i see on the street everyday are the same people george w bush bill clinton george h w bush ronald reagan jimmy carter and gerald ford are all presidents and ex presidents but that doesn't mean they're the same person anyone who has dealt with multiple gods and goddesses can tell that they are quite different God Neopaganism Monotheism Zeus Goddess Pantheism Trimurti Paganism Polytheism Religion Hindu deities Deity Thor Atheism Discworld gods Roman mythology Frigg Prayer Greek mythology Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Odin Henotheism Age of Mythology Hinduism Dionysus Existence of God Thor (Marvel Comics) Mjolnir Ragnarok Philosophy of religion Celtic polytheism Angel Saint Seiya Ronald Reagan __sir Tyr The Mythical Detective Loki Ragnarok Thunderbolt Magic (paranormal) Proto-Indo-European religion Bhakti Brahmanism Mother goddess Celtic mythology Twelve Olympians Human Syncretism Athena Hera Hecate El (god) Gaia (mythology) Loki Mantra Baal Witchcraft Names of God in Judaism Wicca Aphrodite Hell Brahman Origin belief Ancient Greek religion Religious pluralism Strong atheism Kali Vishnu Zeus (comics) Vedas Ishta-deva Germanic Neopaganism Trinity Sacrifice Panentheism Greek sea gods Nerthus George H.
