is there any proof that religion guides morals rather than zeitgeist it seems that each generation is becoming more and more progressive case in point even the most conservative people today would be against slavery even though it was widely accepted several generation ago this is only one issue but it seems that every generation gets more and more progressive while religion slows the moral zeitgeist by clinging on to the values of yesteryear in my personal opinion a large portion of organized religion needs to seriously rethink its attitude towards morality dawkins includes a wonderful analysis of this very phenomenon in his book the god delusion of course religion does not guide morality at least not any of the abrahamic religions the bible is the epitome of immorality lot offering his daughters for gang rape abraham pretending his wife was his sister so the pharaoh would make her his concubine and they'd be rich isaiah trying to burn his own child in offering the numerous rules like stoning disobedient children that are simply ridiculous i certainly hope no one gets their morals from that religion Religion and sexuality Morality Christianity Abraham Genesis Evil Abortion debate Religion Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Jews as a chosen people Religious Society of Friends Free will Religion and sexual orientation Ethics Theory of conduct Criticisms of Christianity Bill Maher Bible Prophet Jewish principles of faith Conservatism Judaism Lot (Biblical) Moral relativism Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Satanism Moral objectivism Dissociative identity disorder Slavery Richard Dawkins Reincarnation Meme Religion and abortion Ten Commandments Book of Isaiah Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Book of Mormon Joseph Smith, Jr. Biblical inerrancy Paul of Tarsus Capital punishment Idolatry Liberal Christianity Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Monotheism Cultural and historical background of Jesus Sabbath Conservative Judaism Joseph (Hebrew Bible) Creation science Emperor of Japan Talmud Nation of Islam Human Christian right Reality Statutory rape Birth control Fundamentalism Homeschooling Moses Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Creationism Philosophy Korban Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Atheism The Bible and history Zoroastrianism Democratic Party (United States) Incest Exodus United States religious history Simone Weil The nature of God in Western theology Altruism Patriotism Abrahamic religion John the Baptist Buddhism Teach the Controversy Laura Schlessinger Abington School District v.
