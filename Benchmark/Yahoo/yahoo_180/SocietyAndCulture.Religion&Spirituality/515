do you think that satan masquerades as god to fool believers into following him in gnostic circles the devil is replaced by the demiurge as the main antagonist lol interesting enough the demiurge or samael which means false god is the god of the old testament ot the torah and he is characterized as insane arrogant personified and ignorance personified however they didn't read the scriptures as historical narratives obviously they knew this to be a law more so a law of karma correction if you notice satan rarely appears in the ot actually he is pretty much only in job in john jesus calls the jews father the devil when they said that their father is god but the reference to jews is more so pointing towards an mindset a condition where one is carnal to the extent of their literalism and traditions rituals form off of such literalism so i'd say even though i see that whole thing as allegorical your question is very plausible to me it is completely unworthy to apply the scriptures in such a literal fashion and think that this character is god its an allegory the ot god in the stories is ruthless and much like a evil dictator at times look up these references some time to see how this ot god is genesis genesis exodus exodus numbers numbers numbers judges nd chronicles samuel exodus and jeremiah many more where that came from just go to these passages to see the genocide ot death god is ruthless Bible Devil Biblical canon Demiurge Satan Angel Philo Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism God Creation according to Genesis Old Testament Dispensationalism Satanism Documentary hypothesis Gnosticism Moses Historicity of Jesus Pharisees Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Biblical inerrancy Judaism Resurrection of Jesus Hell Fundamentalism Abraham Kabbalah Torah Miracle Cultural and historical background of Jesus Abrahamic religion Sin Origen Prophet Idolatry Allegory in the Middle Ages Ten Commandments Creationism Tanakh Genesis God and gender Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Evil Original sin Michael (archangel) Jesus Christian eschatology Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Baptism Midrash Religion Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Jeremiah Christianity and anti-Semitism Nazarene Paradise Lost Death (personification) Exodus Jewish principles of faith Adam and Eve Biblical studies Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Trinity Great Apostasy Legalism (theology) Judas Iscariot Heresy Tribulation Noahide Laws Messianic Judaism Dating the Bible Book of Revelation Talmud Day-Age Creationism Binitarianism Soul Gospel of John Torah study Iconoclasm Historical Jesus Christianity Icon The Pilgrim's Progress Book of Mormon Messiah Arab Church of Christ, Scientist Theology Halakha Mormonism and Christianity Bible and reincarnation Council of Jerusalem Korban The Da Vinci Code
