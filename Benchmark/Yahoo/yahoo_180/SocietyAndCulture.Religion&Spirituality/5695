what do you do in your personal life to show others you have peace in your life it is all to easy to claim religion but it is another thing to live what your religion claims so give me some examples of what you actually do to live your life so that people can see your love and compassion for others please don't give me a sermon i can turn on the television for that thank you for you responces interesting question my personal philosophy is to live simply so that others may simply live to approach all people as worthy and to act as a conduit for understanding i hope that others can see that i am at peace and can somehow take some of that peace with them to cultivate as their own i strive always to be honest but modest and only speak of religion when spoken to but shouldn't the naturally positive life of a person who has reached understanding radiate positivity into the world if i have to try perhaps i am not as peaceful as i believe Altruism Human Past teachings of Prem Rawat Ethics Atheism Epistemology Supernatural Bertrand Russell Religion Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Theology Urantia The nature of God in Western theology Swami Vivekananda Theodicy Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism A Course In Miracles Friedrich Schleiermacher God Novel Alignment (role-playing games) Current teachings of Prem Rawat Prem Rawat Buddhism Moral objectivism Opus Dei Goodness and value theory Socrates Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Force (Star Wars) Ontological argument Sikh religious philosophy Religious studies Leviathan (book) Jiddu Krishnamurti Magic (paranormal) Ethics in religion Existence of God John Howard Yoder Arthur Schopenhauer Philosophy Michel Henry Intelligent design Western philosophy Philosophy of language Unification Church Karl Marx Liberal Christianity Mysticism State Discordianism Anthroposophy Scientology beliefs and practices Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Reality Alcoholics Anonymous Christian anarchism Philosophy of religion Paul of Tarsus Carl Jung Sexual orientation Fundamentalism Max Weber Subud Human rights Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses War Mythology Immanuel Kant David Hume Yoga Creationism Rich Mullins Negative theology Animal rights Polyamory Deconstruction Gautama Buddha Origin belief Cultural and historical background of Jesus Republic Eastern philosophy Pacifism Phaedo S__ren Kierkegaard Stoicism Evil Predestination Happiness Cosmology Sermon on the Mount Problem of Hell Scientific method Jewish principles of faith Falsifiability Rudolf Steiner
