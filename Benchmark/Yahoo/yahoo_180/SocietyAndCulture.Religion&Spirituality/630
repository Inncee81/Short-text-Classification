why do people foolishly believe in psychic phenomenon when my mom died of cancer last year my best friends dad who thinks he is psychic had the nerve to tell me that my dead mother was trying to contact me because she was upset with me earlier i had joked about there being a ghost cat in my house because there was a wierd noise that sounded like purring coming from the wall the day he told mw my dead mother was upset with me he also told me that not only did i have a ghost cat but i had of them turns out it was a tv wire rubbing on a tree that was making that noise his awefulness made me feel really bad and is one of the reasons i am no longer friends with his daughter she went along with it how can people be so callous since this bonehead apparently gave you this information without attaching a bill for his services i'm inclined to suspect he's just angling for attention he needs to be ignored please accept my condolences on the loss of your mother my own mother died last winter it's a difficult time Recurring South Park characters Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story Ghost Social rule The Amber Spyglass Dead Like Me Hearing impairment Charles Darwin's illness Jam (TV series) Dream Friends Cindy Sheehan Mojave people Knots Landing The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Grandview, U.S.A.
