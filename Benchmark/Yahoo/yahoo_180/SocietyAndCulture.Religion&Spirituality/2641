does it not say somewhere in the bible judge not or you will be judged does that include disrespecting others beliefs and ideals isnt it gods job to decide i hope this answers your question very good question by the way i'm sure you will get a lot of responses it seems that whenever one person confronts another person over an issue the statement do not judge comes up christians are often accused of judging in contradiction to what the bible says whenever they speak out against a sinful activity however that is not the meaning of the scripture verses which state do not judge when jesus told us not to judge matthew he was telling us not to judge hypocritically matthew declares for in the same way you judge others you will be judged and with the measure you use it will be measured to you why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye how can you say to your brother let me take the speck out of your eye when all the time there is a plank in your own eye you hypocrite first take the plank out of your own eye and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye in matthew jesus warns against judging someone else for their sin when you yourself are sinning even worse that is the kind of judging jesus commanded us not to do if a believer sees another believer sinning it is their christian duty to lovingly and respectfully confront the person with their sin matthew this is not judging but rather pointing out the truth in hope of bringing repentance in the other person james we are to speak the truth in love ephesians we are to proclaim what god's word says about sin timothy instructs us preach the word be prepared in season and out of season correct rebuke and encourage with great patience and careful instruction we are to judge sin but always with the goal of presenting the solution for sin and its consequences the lord jesus christ john to god be the glory may he bless you and turn your eyes and heart to him and shed light on your path in life Sola fide Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints New Testament Sabbath Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sin Ten Commandments Holy Spirit Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Book of Isaiah Trinity Baptism Predestination Christian views of Jesus Divine grace Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Resurrection of Jesus Biblical inerrancy Eastern Orthodox Church Roman Catholic Church Christian eschatology Mary, the mother of Jesus Justification (theology) Prophet Baptist Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief John Howard Yoder A Course In Miracles John the Baptist Sermon on the Mount Jehovah's Witnesses Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Original sin Book of Mormon Soul Angel Martin Luther Gospel of Thomas Paul of Tarsus Perseverance of the saints Biblical canon Abrahamic religion Repentance Jesus Catechism Dispensationalism Articles of Religion (Methodist) Church of Christ Mormonism Merit Religion Hell Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Jewish principles of faith Priesthood (Mormonism) Infant baptism Theodicy God Westboro Baptist Church (Topeka) Saint Peter John Wycliffe Summa Theologiae Antinomianism Origen Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Binitarianism John Wesley Devil Legalism (theology) Bible and reincarnation Opus Dei Christian anarchism Apostle Eucharist Gospel Philipp Melanchthon Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions George Fox Unification Church Alan Campbell (pastor) Noah Creationism Christadelphians Religious pluralism Judas Iscariot Historical Jesus Godspell Religious perspectives on Jesus Council of Jerusalem New Testament view on Jesus' life Evangelicalism Yeshu
