evolution almost too perfect to be true then in my last question http ca answers yahoo com question index ylt ajp hcls oy qkkae bxpvafqx qid aaqvqaj i explained my theory in respect to the how and why things are as they are in the universe relative to gods plan i mentioned how god could only create himself through the process known as evolution and that the bible was simply something to explain the circumstance of the people at a more primitive age who would not be able to understand the concept of evolution so god just said he did it all anyways i also mentioned that the chances are in etc that evolution could have occurred and many people said within infinity it was bound to happen however since that the universe is approx billion years and the earth is approx billion years it's a little less than half the age of the universe it seems like it's just been in gradual progression and that the odds dropped completely and that it was just mean't to be what happened to all the people who answered my last question i am a christian and i'm using evolution in my explanation because it's logical and it explains everything god is truly incredible he created himself from n o t h i n g novangelis i'm ignorant of nothing the liklihood of any other solar system to be exactly like ours is a to odds and then once you do come across another one that is like ours it's another in etc chance that life will start especially this early in the universe's life you see to like probability so given the age of the universe the number of possible planetary systems the number of organic molecules possibly present in the number of favorable environments and the number of reactive surface areas it is unavoidable that replicating molecular systems should arise that eventually lead to life life is the natural unavoidable consequence in certain stellar systems far from unlikely life has to happen you may say i'm just playing a word game and you're right you're playing one too it's impossible to calculate any of the odds of anything happening along the line of our arguments because we don't know how life forms to begin with we only know that we're here now and all living things that we know of have dna in this case working backwards gets you nowhere we have little idea of the initial conditions and critical points to consider until we know a lot more this line of probabilistic reasoning is mere speculation proving nothing at all Intelligent design Origin of life Origin belief Creationism Evolution Probability God Bayesian inference Evolutionary creationism Free will Supernatural Scientific method Fermi paradox Solar system Determinism Religion Young Earth creationism Big Bang Teleological argument Ontological argument Evolutionism Quantum mechanics Meaning of life Causality Species Theodicy Creation-evolution controversy Stellar evolution Philosophy of language Abiogenesis History of evolutionary thought Time travel Specified complexity Atomism Planetary habitability Philosophy of mathematics Falsifiability Macroevolution History of creationism Black hole Science Fine-tuned universe Francis Crick Flood geology Many-worlds interpretation Biology Sociocultural evolution Immortality Microeconomics Extraterrestrial life Physics Cosmological argument Intelligent design movement Heliocentrism Alkane Infinity Existence of God Acts of the Apostles Biblical inerrancy Law of value Scientology beliefs and practices Trinity Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses A Course In Miracles Entropy Theory G__del's incompleteness theorem Ozone depletion Gaia theory (science) Old Earth creationism Bah__'__ Faith and Science Meme Panspermia Life Luminiferous aether Phaedo Pascal's Wager Resurrection of Jesus Atheism Cell (biology) History of science Creationist cosmologies Extreme Programming DNA Soul Astrobiology Human Vacuum Water (molecule) Gravity Ozone hole Natural selection
