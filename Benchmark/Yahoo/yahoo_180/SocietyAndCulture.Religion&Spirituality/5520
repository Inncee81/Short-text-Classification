if you believe jesus is god why don't you obey him jesus once said why do you call me 'lord lord ' and yet don't do what i tell you luke tev much more so can it be asked if you believe jesus is god why don't you obey him jesus said his followers would be no part of the world yet professed christians are very much part of the world politically economically and socially what good does it do to profess jesus as god and then ignore what he says as people who believe in christ we are also human beings who were born with original sin and although we strive to do god's will to be as he wants us to be even though we strive to do his will we are going to make mistakes sin and that is why we continue to need christ in our lives every day god knows that were going to sin but he also knows when we are trying to do what is his will so when we trip and fall sin we know that we must keep trying to be the people that he wants us to be his children so that we must ask for forgiveness so we take it to the lord in prayer and confess our sins and ask for forgiveness and keep trying to do his will we keep trying to do his will he see this in us and he loves us all the more because he knows that we love him and that even though we will slip and fall sin we continue to try to do what he asks of us as long as the lord sees that we keep trying to do his will he loves and forgive us for our sins if we as his children sin and do nothing to try and be better to correct the mistakes sins that we commit then we as people are in the wrong in god's eyes we must confess our sins and ask for forgiveness and we must continue to do god's will correct our selves and do what god asks of us to be right with him only god is able to look into each of our hearts to see what is really there if we love him have faith and believe in him so then only god can judge us as a people to know if we are doing what he wants of us the lord is an awesome loving kind and forgiving god who loves his children only he is able to know what is really within our hearts we must continue to strive to do his will to pick our selves up when we sin and continue to try to do the lord will and not our own i hope that this answers your question god bless you btw in this world god knows that we must all work to stay alive we do not always choose our own path when we walk with god he guides us towards where he wants us to be when i was looking for my job i asked the lord about it that's right i took it to the lord in prayer and he gave me my answer i found work at the federal prison working as a correctional officer and yes it was with the government it was good since as it afforded me an opportunity to speak with the inmates about christ and weather they had faith it gave me the chance to encourage them in their faith to come closer to christ god has a plan for each of us we just need to listen to his will and then we need to do his will he took me where he wanted me to go and i did what he wanted of me in all of the years that i worked there and even before that they never had an open hiring as they did when i applied for the job it had always been that people needed military experiance at that hiring they didn't ask for it i had never been in the military and was able to get hired with only managers experiance god works in mysterious ways we just need to ask and then listen Salvation
