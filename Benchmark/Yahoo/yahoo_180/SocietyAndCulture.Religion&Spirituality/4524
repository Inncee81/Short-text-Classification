muslims y do u say that the bible got changed because it was not protected safely it thats true and how did it happen i mean is that true history has proven itself first the bible was translated to a non semitic language ie latin greek etc and with the translation concepts get changed or entirely lost definitely the precise meaning can never be retained i know this difficulty as for example an arabic word can never be fully translated into english and at the same time evoking the full value of the word the same applies to aramaic spoken by christ which is very close to arabic secondly the compilation of the bible was done after christ's ministry on earth and as we have it today it includes not just the supposed revealed word of god but also christ's own words so its not just christ telling a story but another person telling the story about christ is also in the picture thirdly the nicene council in constantinople at the th ce century has totally thrown out all other 'versions' of the new testament which they term as apocryphal this is in line with the acceptance of pauline trinity christianity and discarding or disbanding arian's monotheistic christianity hence with this destroying of the apocryphal texts it has now become difficult or impossible to compare and contrast the various versions of the bible and make necessary references this is in sharp constrast with the quran that god guarantees he will protect it it was revealed a little at a time according to the demands of the situation making memorising it easy the scribes live nearby muhammad always ready to copy down the revelations hundreds if not thousands of muhammad's companions memorised the quran while muhammad was still alive muhammad recites to revise the whole quran revealed thus far with gabriel every ramadhan the fasting month up to the last year before he died those who memorise the quran also had written copies with them after the passing of muhammad a central standard text was compiled by the caliph umar less than years and all other texts which don't differ by the way were destroyed up to this day even if all the quran texts were burnt the quran is memorised by hundreds of thousands of muslim the world over such that if any one were to make a mistake in recitation all the others can check on him and correct it Islam Bible Arab Holy Spirit Trinity Apocrypha Nicene Creed God Biblical canon Biblical inerrancy Fundamentalism Religious perspectives on Jesus Names of God in Judaism Jesus Religious pluralism Gospel of Thomas New Testament Gospel of Barnabas Binitarianism King James Version of the Bible Criticism of Islam Allah Muhammad Arabic language History of the English Bible Tetragrammaton Vulgate History of Christianity Apocalypse Jerusalem Moses Eastern Orthodox Church Monotheism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Names and titles of Jesus Mass (liturgy) Virgin Mary in Islam Eusebius of Caesarea A Course In Miracles Islamic philosophy Shi'a Islam Gospel of John Coptic Christianity Hadith Filioque clause Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Aramaic language Ramadan Nontrinitarianism Arianism Gospel Messiah Book of Mormon Book of Daniel Battle of Badr Isa Old Testament Devil Christ Mary, the mother of Jesus Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Religious conversion Restorationism Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Nation of Islam Sabbath New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures Book of Revelation Timeline of Christianity Semitic Idolatry Creation according to Genesis Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Bible translations Sunni Islam Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Catholicism Succession to Muhammad God the Father Baptism Ten Commandments Jehovah's Witnesses Apostolic Fathers Hell Arabic literature Noah Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Resurrection of Jesus
