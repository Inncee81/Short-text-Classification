for those who don't believe that god is real exactly how do you think we humans got here first of all let me say that i am non denominational and i can respect everybody's opinion i just get a little confused when i read posts on here where people say there isn't a god there isn't a heaven there isn't a hell me personally i know that god is real in i was hit by a semi truck on the freeway and it totalled my car i was on a bridge when this happened and i can clearly remember the car almost being tossed over the bridge but the guardrail was there i remember seeing my entire life flash before my eyes i could see imagines of me my parents my brother and other family members there were no words but just images of things that had happen in my life up until that point when all of the action finally slowed down i saw that both airbags had came out and the car was demolished i walked out of the car with no broken bones and no cuts and bruises i was a little shooken up and i had some fine glass particles on me but that's it but god isn't real i like your question the bible states that only the fool has said in his heart that there is no god the lord holds all men accountable as he has stated that they are without excuse because creation everywhere evidences the existence of himself i have heard people state that the bible was written by men and therefore could not possible be accurate the bible was written by approximately different men however it had only one author who was the lord himself as we are told that all scripture is given by inspiration of god we note that in the book of job in the old testament in chapter and verse where the bible states that the earth is suspended and hangs from nothing only an all knowing creator would have known that some years ago it was only a few hundred years ago that man discovered the world is round i read your story of survival and have also heard other stories which have ended with the survivor turning to the lord he will use all manner of means to bring a person to himself through jesus as he is nor willing that any should go to hell but that all should be saved i wish you well in your christian walk and may the lord bless you in all you do Creation according to Genesis Biblical inerrancy Ten Commandments Book of Mormon Christian eschatology Bible Trinity Creationism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity New Testament Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Salvation A Course In Miracles Saint Peter Soul God and gender Sabbath Book of Isaiah Sola fide Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Christian views of Jesus Origin belief Genesis John the Baptist Biblical canon Angel Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Holy Spirit Alan Campbell (pastor) Young Earth creationism Church of Christ, Scientist Hell Liberal Christianity Aramaic of Jesus Linguistics and the Book of Mormon Abrahamic religion The Amber Spyglass Church of Christ Religious perspectives on Jesus Rapture Resurrection of Jesus Dispensationalism Reincarnation Moses Gospel of Barnabas Baptism Sin Matthew 5 Religion Priesthood (Mormonism) Prophet Jews as a chosen people Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Infant baptism Names of God in Judaism Urantia Great Apostasy Storytelling Gospel of Mark Book of Joshua Devil Binitarianism A Canticle for Leibowitz Original sin Supernatural Adam and Eve Immortality Bible and reincarnation Merit Jewish Messiah Mary, the mother of Jesus Paradise Lost Jehovah's Witnesses Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Summa Theologiae Rich Mullins Joseph of Arimathea John Wycliffe Satan Flood geology Qur'an Psalms Slow Train Coming Tetragrammaton Christianity Catechism Sodom and Gomorrah King James Version of the Bible Theodicy Gospel of Thomas
