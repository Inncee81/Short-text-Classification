why american believers are so self satisfied the question is simple i can see so many atrocities in usa so many lost men addict and spiritually died i see a rotted society a lost nation all the same you insist on seding yours missionaries to brasil or other places shouldn't you take care yourself first i feel that way i think we need to cut off aid to all nations and spend our money at home i think we need to send our missionaries to places in the usa i am tired of being the police and piggy bank of the world if it were up to me our pockets would be closed to foreign countries seeking aid when we get our own society together we will help others oddly though the same people who seem to scream about how terrible the usa is are often the same countries who come to us with their hands out when something happens i also feel compared to many countries we have our act together although we still have a long way to go you must be from a country that hates america how much money has your country received in aid from the usa lately maybe you should find that out before you ask the answer might amaze you on the other hand it could be that we are so smug because we do find the time to lend money and personnel support to other countries with their own problems that we see the sacrifices we make to do that knowing all the while the many of those same countries have a majority of citizens who think we are rotten lost or dead i tell you what if you hate us so much then try to not think about us don't buy american food take advantage of american money your government probably gets etc boycott all things american and see how far you get i doubt you will be able to get much to eat or drink etc without some sort of american involvment oh and the next time you guys have a military problem govenmental overthrow natural disaster then i think you need to refuse our offer of help and see what happens how long will it take you to deal with the problem on your own we aren't so bad after all are we Theory of conduct Ethical consumerism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Avenue Q Marshall Plan Military unrest since the Fiji coup of 2000 Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Privatization Public policy Religion International response to Hurricane Katrina Mother Teresa Publicly funded medicine Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses The nature of God in Western theology American Red Cross Soviet Union Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) 2004 Haiti rebellion Goodness and value theory History of Modern Greece William Pitt the Younger Bank Poker jargon Mortgage Laisenia Qarase Sin City 613 mitzvot Monetary policy Surveillance Anarchism Elections in the United States Rwandan Genocide Tariff Socrates The Amazing Race Free trade International Criminal Court Health insurance Incarnations of Immortality Vlad III Dracula Hurricane Katrina disaster relief Trade union Capitalism Panay incident 50 Cent The Apprentice 2 Shaggy dog story Economy of the United States Gross domestic product International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement Microeconomics Nation of Islam The Contender (television series) Jacobo Arenas Altruism Non-governmental organization Indian nationality law Famine Theodicy Economy of Africa Law of value Make money fast Bretton Woods system Knots Landing Japan Self-Defense Forces Criticism of libertarianism British House of Commons Keynesian economics Sodom and Gomorrah Aid Human Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Alan Watts Utilitarianism Scenes from a Memory 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Nicomachean Ethics Mahatma Gandhi American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) American individualist anarchism Governments' positions pre-2003 invasion of Iraq Nineteen Eighty-Four U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Patriotism Japan-United States relations Vegetarianism Zambia Meaning of life Kurt Cobain Marilyn Monroe Government debt Ted Kennedy
