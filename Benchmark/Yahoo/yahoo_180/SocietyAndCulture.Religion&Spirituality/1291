honest question for some of the less tolerant of faiths who practice witnessing would you leave y a if you knew your responses to questions were driving people away from your religion this is not directed towards anyone specifically just a what if question i've seen responses in the past to questions stating that some religions aren't supposed to be tolerant to other views but these same religions rely on witnessing to spread their gospel if that intolerance drove away potential members specifically here on y a would you quit posting in order to not drive people away from your particular faith thanks in advance not judging anyone here i just wonder who from the varying faiths that practice witnessing would leave y a if they knew they were doing more harm than good that's all not saying anyone is only asking who would give up y a if it was counterproductive there is a difference between being a jerk and believing jesus when he said i am the way the truth and the life no one comes to the father but by me by deciding to believe that jesus meant what he said here i am then automatically categorized as intolerant and that's fine however i am not stupid and also recognize that jesus commands us to not only tell other people what he has done for us as you call witnessing but he also commands us to do it with love and kindness i agree with you that people who are supposedly witnessing by being jerks are probably driving people away from their particular faith however if by intolerance you mean anyone who believes that there is only one way to god by believing in jesus no matter what their behavior and attitudes are then i will have to disagree with you for many of us christians we have decided that we're in all the way and can't pick and choose what parts of scripture to agree with yes we study recognize the difference between parables old testament laws figures of speech etc but we can't decide to select only parts that are socially popular to believe in then we would be making up our own religion Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Church of Christ Christianity Abrahamic religion Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Roman Catholic Church Ten Commandments Evil Fundamentalism Divine grace Religious pluralism Gospel of Thomas New Testament Resurrection of Jesus Sola fide Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Prophet Christian-Jewish reconciliation Christianity and anti-Semitism Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Acts of the Apostles Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Baptist Islam Trinity Biblical canon Separation of church and state Jehovah's Witnesses God Biblical inerrancy Atheism Religious Society of Friends Salvation Chosen people Priesthood (Mormonism) Holy Spirit Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Religious conversion Mormonism and Christianity Predestination Heresy Soul Mary, the mother of Jesus Historicity of Jesus John Howard Yoder Mormonism Eastern Orthodox Church New Testament view on Jesus' life Baptism Theory of conduct Criticism of Mormonism Book of Mormon Ethics Homosexuality and Christianity Justification (theology) Martin Luther Cult Christian Reconstructionism Jewish views of religious pluralism Liberal Christianity Great Apostasy Freemasonry Religion and sexual orientation Calvinism Pharisees Messianic Judaism Theology End times Creationism Protestantism Same-sex marriage Old Testament Eucharist Infant baptism Homosexuality Anti-Mormonism Christian views of women Paul of Tarsus Evangelicalism Wicca Christian anarchism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an A Course In Miracles Church of Christ, Scientist Papal Infallibility Legalism (theology) Moral objectivism Religion and mythology Judaism Apologetics
