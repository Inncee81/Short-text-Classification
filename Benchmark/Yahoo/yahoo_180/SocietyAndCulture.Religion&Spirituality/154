atheist question for christians why do christians keep pushing religion on me i am perfectly happy yet everyone keeps preaching god to me i understand the theory of god i just don't believe it i don't try to convert you to atheism why do you feel the need to try to convert me to christianity spreading the word of god to someone who is not going to believe it no matter how hard you try is a waste of time so the ultimate question of my little rant will you christians stop trying to preach to me when i have already made my decision and don't care what you think okay not all christians do this just about of the ones i know i am not talking about here and i am not referring to all christians i am referring to the ones who do try to push their religion on people who don't want it i am not christian bashing just bashing the ones that pester me about it i believe in evolution and science i am not sure about the big bang but i would believe that over creationism any day i am not saying i specifically don't want to learn about the religion i think it is interesting seeing other people's views however learning about something having someone telling me to believe it or i will burn in hell is a different story two answers that made me laugh telling me that evolution can't be because man came up with it is ridiculous then i could easily say that the idea of god can't be right because man came up with that idea however evolution has been pretty much proven my science i love how people continue to ignore scientific facts another the site i was referred to www atheisttest com was aslo bull shit because a banana fits in your hand does not mean god came up with that idea ever thought that the banana evolved to that shape oh and once again not trying to convert someone thanks haha yes of course you you know god exists like how many scientists know evolution exists there is much less proof in god than there is in evolution but unlike many people i am not telling you to believe what i believe i am merely making a point that i have reason for what i believe or more for what i don't believe and i am tired of my religious friends telling me to just believe in god because he is right what the hell i am sorry but i am tired of being told i am living a life of sin when i don't care if people think it is a sin that i am atheist i have always wondered this same question and always assuemd that it was because they are insecure i dont see why them need us to believe in their religion maybe they ae trying to enlighten us and save our souls from hell see the guy above me is ironicly answering this question and still preaching he just cant help himself lol Religion God Creationism Meaning of life Intelligent design Evolutionary creationism Jewish principles of faith Intelligent design movement Origin belief Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Soul Supernatural Young Earth creationism Bah__'__ Faith and Science Christianity Charles Darwin's views on religion Creation-evolution controversy Teach the Controversy Theodicy Science Sin Atomism Christian apologetics Agnosticism Human William A.
