i walked by a jewish cemetery today and many of the gravestones had small stones on top is this a tradition just a curious goy stones were traditionally placed on graves as a mark of respect it showed that people had been there it also served an important purpose coming into contact with a dead body or a piece of a body larger than a figure bone renders a person tamei impure and if a kohen from being able to offer sacrifices or perform any other duties of a kohen it would also prevent someone in such state from participating in sacrifices such as sin opfferings the pesach sacrifice thanksgiving offerings going up to the temple to during the shalosh regalim three pilgramage festivals etc thus knowing where graves are is important more so in the past than now where graves were not necessarily in segregated graveyards and had to be clearly marked to make sure they were not mistakenly plowed under making it impossible for a kohen or somebody on their way to perform holy activities to cross the field so the stones left behind by visitors formed a cairn that clearly marked the grave today it is a mark of respect a permanent token that the person is remembered and not forgotten 613 mitzvot Kohen Korban Judaism Burial Passover Temple in Jerusalem Sukkot Jewish holiday Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Priest Jewish bereavement Cairn Jewish services Mormonism and Judaism Japanese funeral Ten Commandments Abrahamic religion Hebrew calendar Roman Catholic Church Christian eschatology Three pilgrim festivals Funeral Sin Sacrifice Headstone Commonwealth War Graves Commission Baptism Solomon's Temple Pharisees Clergy Pilgrimage Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Holy Spirit Rosh Hashanah Eucharist Eucharistic discipline John the Baptist Justification (theology) Moloch Urnfield Shabbat Oakland Cemetery Yom Kippur Jesus Merit Culture of Korea Sikhism primary beliefs and principles Reincarnation A Course In Miracles Mass (liturgy) Blood (computer game) Phaedo Maya civilization Easter Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Saint Mary, the mother of Jesus Amidah Christian cross Cultural and historical background of Jesus Origin belief God Seppuku Gamla Uppsala Chambered cairn Art in Ancient Greece Tattoo Relic Eastern Orthodox Church Kosher foods Book of Joshua Thanksgiving Joseph of Arimathea Status of religious freedom in Iran Temple Mount Book of Isaiah Iconoclasm Idolatry Animism Bl__t Mitzvah Repentance Customs and etiquette of Japan Qiang Judas Iscariot Temple (Mormonism) Christianity Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Resurrection Crucifixion Hecate Tag RuneScape locations Aztec
