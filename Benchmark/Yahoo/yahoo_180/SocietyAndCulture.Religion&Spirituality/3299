why do so many people on here call the kjv the original bible when there were many earlier bibles and the kjv wasn t even a translation of the original text it was written to merge all the contradicting bibles used at the time into one orthodox bible for the english church i m not being derogatory the writing in the kjv is beautiful and a work of art in its own right sorry to disillusion you odds to but i get my information from undisputed and well documented english history the type that is taught in english history lessons at school here the furthest the writers referenced back was the erasmus translation for the catholic church written in latin thank you for asking this it's quite interesting to see the difference in answers between your question and mine i have to admit i've learned quite a lot this morning on such an apparently easy question personally i feel they think this way because someone sometime in their past has told them this and they never had any reason to question the authority of the answer i think it's appropriate that we should correct the error whenever we tactfully can i personally love the kjv i think formal english is one of the most beautiful languages ever developed somehow i think you're correct in calling it a work of art god be with you King James Version of the Bible History of the English Bible Bible King-James-Only Movement Biblical inerrancy Authorship of the Pauline epistles Paul of Tarsus Revised Standard Version A Course In Miracles Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Erasmus Infant baptism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Apocrypha Great Apostasy Linguistics and the Book of Mormon Trinity Biblical canon Tetragrammaton Book of Mormon Christianity Sola scriptura Anglo-Saxon literature Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible Jewish principles of faith Hell Book of Revelation Eastern Orthodox Church Holy Spirit Bishop Charles Darwin's views on religion Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Bible translations Martin Luther God Alan Campbell (pastor) Evolutionary creationism Scientology beliefs and practices Bible and reincarnation Christian-Jewish reconciliation Book of Daniel Apostolic Fathers Acts of the Apostles Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Documentary hypothesis Douai Bible John Wycliffe Catechism Judas Iscariot New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures New King James Version Fundamentalism Homosexuality and Christianity Nontrinitarianism Religion Scholasticism Creationism Christian views of women Vulgate Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Theology Church of Christ Binitarianism Catholicism Literature New English Bible Community of Christ Meaning of life God and gender Book of Esther Protestant Reformation Second Vatican Council Septuagint Idolatry Mary, the mother of Jesus Sin Catholic Talmud Sabbath Psalms Torah Croatian language Protestantism Original sin Predestination Young Earth creationism Old Church Slavonic Socrates Mission (Christian) History of Christianity Roman Catholic Church Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine)
