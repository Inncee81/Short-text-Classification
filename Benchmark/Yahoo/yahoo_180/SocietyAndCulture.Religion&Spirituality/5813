why are so many athiests trying to prove other religions wrong i really don't see the point in trying to prove other religions wrong i'm a christian but i respect all religions even athiests but i see athiests on yahooanswers and in my daily life always trying to prove christianity wrong i find that so stupid let people believe what they want to believe and let people do what they want to do why waste your time trying to prove something wrong when you can do something productive i agree with you daniel i am an athiest but i respect you as a christian and find no need to waste my time trying to disprove your religion you and i are both free to worship or not worship as we please but on the other hand there are plenty of christians here who waste no time in telling the athiests that we are all going to hell that we will be judged and that we are moronic or lacking love in our lives because we don't believe in god i really do wish we could stop picking at eachother and try to learn something from one another Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Saint God Philosophy of religion LaVeyan Satanism Salvation Jewish views of religious pluralism John the Baptist Sabbath Abrahamic religion Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Trinity Pledge of Allegiance Theodicy Ten Commandments Meaning of life Separation of church and state Evil Caedmon's Call Articles of Religion (Methodist) Laura Schlessinger A Course In Miracles InterFaith Religion Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Opus Dei Church of Christ Theory of conduct Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Religious Society of Friends Friedrich Schleiermacher Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Problem of Hell Sikhism primary beliefs and principles Spiritism Nation of Islam Divine grace Emanuel Swedenborg The Apprentice 2 Hades Idolatry Urantia Roman Catholic Church Bible and reincarnation Alcoholics Anonymous The nature of God in Western theology Deity Historical persecution by Christians Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Gospel of Thomas Ayyavazhi Abortion debate Patriotism Hell Christian-Jewish reconciliation Christianity Qiyamah Religious pluralism Cult Sin City Past teachings of Prem Rawat Joke Hinduism Religious conversion Sin European Convention on Human Rights Fallen angel Paradise Lost Existence of God Rich Mullins Angel Shinto Resurrection of Jesus Apostles' Creed The Daleks' Master Plan Freedom of religion Antichrist Sikhism Jerusalem Anglicanism Social rule Athanasian Creed Lutheranism Leviathan (book) Humphrey Bogart Family First Party Restorationism Incarnations of Immortality Ancient Greek religion Thomas Carlyle Jewish Messiah Devil Slavic mythology Rastafari movement Slow Train Coming Christian eschatology
