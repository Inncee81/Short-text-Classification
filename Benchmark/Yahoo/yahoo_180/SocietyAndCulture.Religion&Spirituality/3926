angel experiences i had an angel experience last year i felt two angels around my brother i didn't see them but it was clear there was one male and one female i had an insight into the term th sense does anyone know anything about angel experiences hmm interesting because that very same night he was approached by a woman out of no where telling him the same thing and even giving him a message people who are afraid to open their minds will find a scientific 'excuse' for everything oh and by the way bonger psychosis is seeing or hearing things that don't exist i neither saw nor heard anything maybe u should see a medical doctor to put u on anti depressants u miserable soul ha bonger now why would i try 'meds' they clearly aren't doing anything for you your a silly silly child now stop throwing your toys from the pram p thats interesting kelly and it reminds me also when i was a similar thing happened unbeknown to me my uncle had died and i was in bed i felt his presence over me waving at me i had a angel experience when my grandma died as when she passed away i was at home in bed and she came to me and stood at the foot of my bed and waved and blew me a kiss and she was gone then the phone rang and it was my mom telling me she had passed away then when my daddy died i was at the hospital and he was barely holding on and we saw angels at the head of his bed holding his head and we whispered our goodbyes to him and he sighed and it was over and the angels never left his side they stayed and took his hand so i believe in angels and i believe that they are guarding the saved and the lost souls too Shaggy dog story Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Amber Spyglass Episodes of Lost (Season 1) One Tree Hill (TV series) Social rule Rent (musical) Milton H.
