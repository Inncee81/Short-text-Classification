is forgiving just saying these words i wanna forgive you my parents took something that i loved first and foremost in my life i believe they love me and they had no idea what they did when they ripped it away left like that i hid it inside me and it just burned me i'm angry with them though unintentional because even if they gave it back it'll be too late for me i turned my back on god and was bitter with him for doing nothing to help but recently i realized that forgiving them is the right thing to do even if i don't really want to cause jesus' story of forgiving without condemnation struck me so i tried to do it but couldn't so now i wanna know what forgiving is and what it takes and how god helps this process take place no forgiveness means leaving the pain behind getting over it not always easy but the issue is with you not them you have complete control over how you feel not anyone else everyone makes mistakes carrying on with it just messes you up you can't be close to god and bitter at the same time beware that you aren't enjoying being mad at them grins Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an A Course In Miracles Jon Secada Sin EastEnders Divine grace Salvation God Capital punishment Ranma __ characters Trinity One Tree Hill (TV series) Sermon on the Mount Hell Cliff Richard Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Roman Catholic Church Joker (comics) The Ashlee Simpson Show Sola fide Eastern Orthodox Church Summa Theologiae Laura Schlessinger C.
