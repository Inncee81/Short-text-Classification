why is hell a bad place exactly from my admittedly poor understanding of the stories satan was expelled from heaven because he was jealous of god and wanted to be worshipped by humans himself so where do all the fire and brimstone stories of eternal suffering and torment come into it surely he wouldn't be horrible to us if he wanted our worship because then we wouldn't worship him and if people can live happily without god yes it does happen i am very very happy in my life what difference will it make in hell serious answers only please non of the 'repent and you will be saved ' remarks or calling me a heathen etc x oh and before anyone says 'it will be full of bad people' it will only have people who were once on earth anyway so won't be much different the original description of hell was closer to gehenna which was where the refuse from the village was burnt and disposed of the images of fire and brimstone and creative punishments rose out of the middle ages i think the ot version is closer to the truth jesus warns that people souls who don't believe will be discarded hell is a separation from god in the parable of the rich man and lazarus the rich man is clearly separated from god he sees lazarus up in heaven it doesn't indicate that he is suffering physical torture a la middle ages but is extremely thirsty a torture in itself my best guess is that the punishment of hell is the knowledge of our unworthiness and the physical sufferings left untended Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Soul Satan Jewish eschatology Eastern Orthodox Church Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Original sin Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Heaven Religion Angel Ayyavazhi mythology Abrahamic religion Gehenna Paradise Lost Fire and brimstone Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Divine grace Immortality Harrowing of Hell Angel Sanctuary Theodicy Sin Ten Commandments Gospel of Thomas Salvation Urantia Rich Mullins Dispensationalism Afterlife Sola fide Purgatory Christianity Demon Alan Campbell (pastor) Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Free will Resurrection of Jesus Merit Meaning of life Theory of conduct Fallen angel Origin belief Lazarus and Dives Qiyamah Incarnations of Immortality The Amber Spyglass Summa Theologiae Athanasian Creed Lazarus Jesus Religious pluralism Judas Iscariot Bangsian fantasy Kain (Legacy of Kain) A Course In Miracles Goodness and value theory Binitarianism Jehovah's Witnesses Capital punishment John the Baptist Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Creationism Hades Roman Catholic Church Hinduism Apostasy in Islam Leviathan (book) Charles Grandison Finney Apocalyptic literature Israel ben Eliezer Pitaten Origen Heresy Blood atonement Apostles' Creed Mary, the mother of Jesus The Divine Comedy Mormonism Book of Isaiah Holy Spirit End times Four Quartets Trimurti Pascal's Wager Sodom and Gomorrah Memnoch the Devil
