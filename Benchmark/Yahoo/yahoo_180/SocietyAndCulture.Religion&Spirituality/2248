do you think that the church has betrayed the teachings of jesus over the years unequivocally indubitably clearly definitively absolutely yes the modern from middle ages onward church aside from some recent denominations who do teach love etc has not only betrayed jesus who embodies what christianity is supposed to be but it has been positively hypocritical jesus taught love forgiveness community tolerance acceptance the new testament is written to refute the old testament jesus says over and again that the old testament pharisees is wrong the catholic church in particular encourages the opposite of jesus in regarding the old testament ideals like slavery wealth sexism denouncing and admonishing homosexuals those who do not adhere to their specific and made up rules etc when people who claim to be christians go about talking of how jesus will strike down so and so and jesus will make so and so pay and so and so will go to hell blah blah blah they are so ignorant that they don't even realize they are actually preaching the antithesis of christ's message they should be preaching kindness going to those people and talking with them loving them accepting them instead of criticizing them and hating them who are we to criticize anyway jesus says specifically to reserve judgment for god for those who judge are worse than those whom they judge i will never understand the ignorance of such people who in the name of jesus spread hate intolerance the diseases of this world which are tearing the human race apart people like george w bush authorizes death torture encourages hate among nations refuses to even attempt peace etc who use christianity for their own gain and then act antithetically to jesus's teachings such people are the ones who embody whatever 'anti christ' means and i only feel sorry for these people if one doesn't act by christ's messages of forgiveness peace love etc that is fine but when one defines himself by it uses it to attract others and then leads those others and himself into war hate intolerance that person is the most unfortunate and sick one i can imagine a very few examples pope's recent declaration that all denominations let alone all faiths not concurrent with the catholic church have no base at all and are sinful george w bush claiming to be a man of god uses god in speeches tries to evoke sympathy and attraction from religious americans and then speaks about paying with death authorizes executions speaks about revenge breeds hate and intolerance republicans right wing conservatives who on one hand advertise themselves as 'hard core' and 'won't deal with crap' will support capitalism and wealth with every ounce of their avaricious beings yet simultaneously claim to be religious followers of christ talk about a contradiction do i smell pharisees whom jesus so ardently preached against and warned the people of i think so Church of Christ God Paul of Tarsus Prophet Eastern Orthodox Church Christian anarchism Pharisees Christianity and anti-Semitism Mormonism and Christianity History of Christianity Sola fide Hell Fundamentalism Sabbath Baptism Christian-Jewish reconciliation Biblical canon Anti-Semitism Sin Evangelicalism Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Book of Mormon Martin Luther Jehovah's Witnesses Catholicism Ten Commandments Baptist Apocrypha Religious conversion Pacifism Evil Christian views of Jesus Resurrection of Jesus Criticisms of Christianity Liberal Christianity Religious Society of Friends Historical persecution by Christians Religion and sexual orientation John the Baptist Capital punishment Christian Divine grace Trinity Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Heresy Alan Campbell (pastor) Christian denomination Abrahamic religion Great Apostasy Christian eschatology Persecution of Christians Ordination of women Bible and reincarnation Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Pope John Paul II Religious perspectives on Jesus Justification (theology) Antichrist Calvinism Mary, the mother of Jesus InterFaith Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Mortification of the flesh Soul John Howard Yoder Jewish views of religious pluralism Historical Jesus Original sin Excommunication Nation of Islam United States religious history Summa Theologiae Religion and sexuality Biblical inerrancy Restorationism Mary Magdalene Islam Lutheranism Legalism (theology) Heaven
