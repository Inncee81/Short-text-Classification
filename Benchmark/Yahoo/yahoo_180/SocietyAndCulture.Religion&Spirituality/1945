is going to a strip club cheating ok so i have this dinner invitation and it is at a gentleman's club where in my youth i have blurry images of wine consumption men sitting around telling lies to each other and naked squirming flesh on gravy stained table tops now devoid of cutlery but not wine same thing this time only this time i am married with three and i just know that the young vile temptress is going to want to sit on my lap naked ladies always seem to do that to me i that cheating and how do i politely refuse the unwarranted attention without hurting her feelings i know you asked this in the r s section but people are going a little overboard how about this you ask your wife what she thinks if she thinks it's cheating or wouldn't approve then you probably better not go if she says it's fine then go ahead just let her know either way that you don't plan on spending any cash other than a couple beers or waters your call but back to the definition of cheating if neither of you are trying to please the other one other than visually the person with the 'sex scene in a movie' comparison was dead on then it's not cheating good luck and have fun either at the strip joint or at home with the mrs p s maybe if she lets you go you get her some flowers with a card that says just letting you know you're the most beautiful woman in the world sappy as hell but the timing and sentament will go a long ways just a thought Avenue Q Little Britain Knots Landing Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Amber Spyglass The Shining (film) Humphrey Bogart Mojave people Friends Sin City Cheating in poker The Inside Germaine Greer The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Marilyn Monroe Johnny Cash Jam (TV series) Fred Phelps Skinny Dip Incarnations of Immortality Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Eddie Guerrero The Catcher in the Rye The Time Machine AFI 100 Years series Vlad III Dracula Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story!
