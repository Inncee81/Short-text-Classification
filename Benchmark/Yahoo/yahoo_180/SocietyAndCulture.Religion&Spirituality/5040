the name mary is it considered a jewish hebrew name or a christian name because i know it's biblical but she was a jew so therefore the name mary was around before christianity and was used by the jews firs right yet my friend mary claims her name is christian since she's a catholic and the bible and stuff i guess which is it mary is a jewish name mary was jewish the name mary started within judaism and was probably first used by the jews however in saying that your friend is also correct since catholicism is actually a continuation of judaism being that they are part of the one covenant made to abraham so technically you are both correct if catholicism denied judaism then you would actually be correct in saying mary was a strictly jewish name because then you could actually seperate the two religions but since catholics consider themselves to be carrying on the same revelation of god then technically your friend is correct because then mary a jewish girl became catholic which judaism is intrinsic to it's kind of a catch hope this helps Sabbath Bible Christianity Abrahamic religion Judaism Ten Commandments Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Messianic Judaism Who is a Jew?
