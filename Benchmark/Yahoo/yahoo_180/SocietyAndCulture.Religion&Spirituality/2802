answers to some of the same old questions and statements more people have died in the name of religion than anything else not true hundreds of millions were slaughtered by atheist regimes led by hitler lenin stalin mao and their friends it is the absence of belief rather than its presence that has led to the most suffering but so what if people have been killed in the name of christianity people have killed in the name of love truth country god told us through the bible that his words would be abused and exploited by the wrong people for the wrong reasons indeed it is because humanity is so capable of being barbaric and cruel that we need an absolute sense of morality and right and wrong if god is so loving why does he allow us to go to hell the same reason good parents allow their children to choose their own way they give them guidance love and sacrifice but they have to give them freedom of choice otherwise they are no longer loving hell is eternity without god it is the ultimate act of selfless love for god to allow his creatures to reject him he sent us prophets monarchs and finally his son to die in agony for the world it is rather ironic for us to blame god for our own rejection of him why didn't he make his existence more obvious that would be to eliminate choice and choice is a fundamental of human dignity there is ample proof if we are willing to look for it why does god allow bad things to happen to good people why would he not faith doesn't guarantee a good life but a perfect eternity our or years on earth are nothing compared to the time we will spend afterwards hitler was a catholic not at all he was born a catholic but hated christianity and some of the most devoted nazi theorists wrote that their contempt for judaism was based less on anti semitism than the fact the jews gave the world jesus what about the crusades a geo political response from christian europe to the massive military expansion of islamic armies into the christian heartlands of north africa palestine and syria there were certainly aspects of it that were dreadful but it says nothing about the truth of christianity how do you explain the inquisition actually there is not a lot to explain the number of people killed under its authority was very small and most european towns saw an inquisition delegation once every years there are numerous accounts of people committing blasphemy so as to be tried by the inquisition rather than a secular court in other words it was thought to be more just and fair it is most certainly not the stuff of anti catholic and largely anglo saxon mythology and so on and so on all arguments designed to deny truth of course hypno pope you miss the point people have been killed in the name of love too does that mean all love is a bad thing ahhh yes why discuss the topic maturely when you can just call someone a douchebag what a mature and intelligent response phoenix ablaze i never said people had been killed in the name of atheism but most certainly people had been killed because of it it's not callous and dismissive you just don't get it i'm saying just because people have been killed in the name of christianity but so what that doesn't mean they were killed by true christians people kill for all kinds of reasons it's wrong but it is also wrong to blame christianity for it if someone kills in the name of love do people blame all love no some people are just killers who use excuses like religion love or whatever to try to justify their deeds i agree with the point you are trying to make people kill regardless of what their beliefs are hitler was not following christ when he killed people it's that simple you could make the argument that evolution was hitler's belief since he wanted a superior race and experimented on jews to try and create different species but what good would that do he was an evil control freak the other problem is when a religion also happens to be a governing force and the church was in charge that kind of goes against christianity also i do think the crusades were necessary from a political and religious aspect without the crusades we would all be praying times a day to allah people that want to control others will use any means available to do that including religion god bless Goodness and value theory Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Church of Christ God and gender Immortality Homosexuality and Christianity Nation of Islam Urantia Theology Historical persecution by Christians Summa Theologiae Soul Pope Benedict XVI History of creationism Historicity of Jesus Pacifism Jehovah's Witnesses History of Christianity Maimonides Sacrifice Reincarnation Moral objectivism Patriotism Jewish views of religious pluralism Church of Christ, Scientist John the Baptist Young Earth creationism Criticisms of Christianity Origin belief Gospel of Barnabas History of anti-Semitism Al-Ghazali Jews as a chosen people S__ren Kierkegaard Second Vatican Council Martin Luther Abortion debate
