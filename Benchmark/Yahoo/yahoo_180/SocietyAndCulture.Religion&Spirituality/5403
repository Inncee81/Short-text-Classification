in the creation account vs evolutionist's account is there any conflict in the 'order' that living things came about i mean the bible says first there were plants then fish then birds and creeping things then animals and last humans so that part of the bible squares with evolution yes or no the bible says that all plants were created before all animals this means that all the plants that require animals to fertilize them would have been screwed the fossil record is quite clear though flowering plants evolved after the insects evolved to carry pollen to and fro so there's one also the bible says that humans arrived last but we have witnessed the evolution of the faroe island mouse in the last hundred years does the bible mention dolphins and whales they were land animals first then they evolved to go back into the sea and remember that according to the bible all of the stars are younger than the earth this isn't true either many are older than the earth bu tmany are younger too that's just off the top of my head Old Earth creationism Animal Whale Creationism Insect Young Earth creationism Whaling Europe Evidence of evolution Flowering plant Evolutionary creationism The Origin of Species Human Bird Fauna of Australia Creation-evolution controversy Noah's Ark Bat Mammal Flood geology Creation science Evolution Sexual reproduction Intelligent design Renewable energy Flower Gal__pagos Islands Pollination Creation according to Genesis Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Evolution of cetaceans Aquatic ape hypothesis Created kind Faroe Islands Biodiversity of New Zealand Seabird Dinosaur Biodiversity Tetrapod Narnia God Dolphin Carnivorous plant History of creationism Answers in Genesis Pinophyta Evolutionism Marine biology Plant sexuality Day-Age Creationism Biblical inerrancy Orca Origin of language Leviathan Ten Commandments Environmental concerns with electricity generation Biology Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Ecco the Dolphin Adam and Eve Meaning of life Stone Age Origin belief Bee Ichthyosaur Unclean animals Earth Humpback Whale -ology Cradle of Humanity Gap Creationism Largest organism Livestock History of evolutionary thought Prophet Whale song Vegetarianism and religion Botany Genetically modified organism Lavos Reptile Deluge (mythology) Extinction Cetacean intelligence USS Whale (SS-239) Fern Dead Sea The Bible and history Sakhalin Gaia theory (science) The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Charles Darwin's views on religion Agriculture Cetacea Kosher foods Species Angel Ecology Oceania ecozone
