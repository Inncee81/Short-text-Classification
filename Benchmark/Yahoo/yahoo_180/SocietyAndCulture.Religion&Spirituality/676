fellow non muslims just a question i was pondering in the past few minutes i have seen many posts asking whether islam permits injustice war hatred etc it is sort of asserting the fact that some people would rather settle with posting opinions without the knowledge of the question don't you feel that people anyone should first try and learn about the certain thing they are trying to bash also why are people asking others if they have stopped watching tv since when did the tv become a source of education whatever happened to books and to learning from people also thank you so much to everyone who is helping in keeping peace and tolerance not just here but in our daily lives a lot of my friends are non muslims and they are so nice lets pick up some books and learn about what we dont know shall we peace love r s lol for everyone so conserned about the fellow non muslim thing i was just trying to be respectful not condoning that i am one but it's funny how you avoid the question i agree with you television nowadays is used mainly for propaganda against other people things etc however even though it was worth a shot posting a question like this will only aggrivate you because of these senseless answers people will not change that easily especially if they are speaking in response to you by insulting the quran if television can change them to this extent and they are too stubborn to believe in what is right before their eyes then what you are left with is the idea that a single person cannot change someone else's mind properly and by the way anybody who believes that muslims start wars and are mainly terrorists is seriously confused because i can guarantee that there has been at least people from each type of major religion out there that have done the same if not worse the people of these religions are not true followers so there is no point in blaming the religion itself sometimes you need to look into the past to understand the present and if you all say that you have done your research without actually trying then do it again if you believe that tolerance is the main concept then dont be a hypocrite tolerate other people tolerate more research and tolerate your confused selves Religion Nation of Islam Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Yusuf al-Qaradawi God Alcoholics Anonymous Scientology beliefs and practices Fundamentalism Past teachings of Prem Rawat Arab-Israeli conflict Apostasy in Islam Theory of conduct Simone Weil Separation of church and state Atheism Socrates A Course In Miracles Meaning of life Philosophy of language Discordianism Post-September 11 anti-war movement Predestination Creationism Anti-Defamation League Islam Freedom of speech Jiddu Krishnamurti Christianity Social rule Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Theodicy Sexual orientation Cult Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Women in Islam Jewish principles of faith Propaganda Satanism Milton H.
