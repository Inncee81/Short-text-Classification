is creationism better science than evolution according to basic principles of science a well founded scientific theory ought to make predictions however whenever you ask an evolutionarianist what humans will evolve into next they say i don't know because evolution does not make any predictions creationism makes plenty of predictions creationists take the bible literally and the bible is filled with prophecies those are the predictions made by creationism for example creationism predicts that the world will end when jesus returns that is a testable prediction i know that evolution makes predictions by predicting that if an ecosystem has a limited supply of resources those genes that best adapt organisms to acquire those resources occur more frequently however that prediction is a very long sentence and i don't really understand what it means despite having wrote it since i can understand creationism's predictions and not evolution's creationism is the better scientific theory since i can understand creationism's predictions and not evolution's creationism is the better scientific theory oh so because i can understand or believe in geometry but not algebra shall i then declare that algebra is a useless theory does not work and is used by certain types of mathematicians as a lie to try and corrupt all those who understand believe in geometry excellent thanks d Intelligent design Creationism Evolution Theory Science Mathematics The Origin of Species Biodiversity Supernatural Young Earth creationism Meaning of life Evolutionary creationism Kardashev scale Sociocultural evolution Creation-evolution controversy History of creationism Creation science Soul Human Big Bang Geometry Origin belief Philosophy of science Falsifiability Teleological argument Extinction Gaia philosophy Biology String theory Flood geology Artificial consciousness Free will Economics Intelligent design movement Species Occam's Razor Time travel Scientific method Age of Enlightenment Jewish principles of faith Pseudoscience Henri Poincar__ Teach the Controversy Isaac Newton Sociobiology Irreducible complexity Creation according to Genesis Prediction Hipparchus (astronomer) Probability Sociology William A.
