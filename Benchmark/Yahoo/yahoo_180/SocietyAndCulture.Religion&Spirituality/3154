no offense okay maybe a little but dont we have more important things to worry about atheists christians catholics muslims jews hindus etc claim that their way is the right way either they argue about how to worship god or if there is even one to begin with but dont we need to focus on more important issues like global warming instead of insignificant things that ultimately arent even that serious to begin with think about it global warming will probably get us before the jews get to build their temple or before the anti christ comes so first lets worry about saving the earth now and then about when it will end it just goes to show that people are ignorant and arrogant everyone has to think there way is the right way i'll be the first to say that greek orthodox isn't the best religion out there even though i am greek orthodox but to mostly everyone religion is easier to worry about then globel warming and war but i agree with you totally and i'm not taking offense Religious pluralism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Religious conversion History of Christianity Christianity Religion Sin Ten Commandments Abrahamic religion Atheism Messianic Judaism Creationism Trinity Jesus Prophet Chosen people Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Pharisees Baptism Sabbath Fasting Eastern Orthodox Church Fundamentalism Religion and abortion Book of Revelation Anti-Semitism Heresy Bible and reincarnation Jew Freemasonry Sacrifice Historical persecution by Christians Hindu Church of Christ Hinduism Persecution of Christians Paul of Tarsus Temple in Jerusalem Judaism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Religion in the United Kingdom Religion in Israel Antichrist God and gender Christian eschatology Theology Hell Judas Iscariot Samaritan Christ Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Biblical canon Saint Heaven Christianity and anti-Semitism Predestination Jerusalem Jewish views of religious pluralism Religion in China Russian Orthodox Church Cultural and historical background of Jesus Sexual orientation Soul Gnosticism Eschatology Biblical inerrancy Apologetics Roman Catholic Church InterFaith Neofascism and religion Mormonism and Christianity Icon Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Reincarnation Dispensationalism Monotheism Jewish Messiah Prayer Evolutionary creationism Idolatry in Christianity Christian-Jewish reconciliation Nation of Islam Nontrinitarianism Coptic Christianity Religious perspectives on Jesus Eucharist Jewish principles of faith History of Greek and Roman Egypt Holy Spirit Buddhism Apostasy
