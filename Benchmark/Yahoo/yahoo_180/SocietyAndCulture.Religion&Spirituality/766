is there a difference between the great crowd at revelation v and the other sheep at john v technically speaking is there a difference between the biblical terms other sheep and great crowd watchtower th april question from readers yes though we should not be unduly sensitive about word usage or be upset if someone uses the terms interchangeably most christians are familiar with the passages where we find these terms john is one there jesus said i have other sheep which are not of this fold those also i must bring and they will listen to my voice and they will become one flock one shepherd the other expression great crowd appears at revelation we read after these things i saw and look a great crowd which no man was able to number out of all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues standing before the throne and before the lamb dressed in white robes and there were palm branches in their hands let us consider john first who are the sheep well it would be good to fix in mind that all of jesus loyal followers are referred to as sheep at luke he called those of his disciples who would be going to heaven the little flock a flock of what of sheep the sheep of the little flock will be part of the kingdom in heaven however there are others those with a different hope whom jesus also views as sheep we can see this in john chapter after speaking about sheep such as his apostles whom he would call to life in heaven jesus added in verse i have other sheep which are not of this fold those also i must bring jehovah s witnesses have long recognized that in this verse jesus was speaking of people having the prospect of life on earth many faithful ones in pre christian times such as abraham sarah noah and malachi had such prospects so we can rightly include them as part of the other sheep of john during the millennium such faithful pre christian witnesses will be resurrected and will then learn of and accept christ jesus becoming other sheep of the fine shepherd we also know that since the general call of the heavenly class ended millions have become true christians these too are rightly termed other sheep since they are not part of the little flock rather the other sheep today look forward to living right on into an earthly paradise now what can be said about the identity of the great crowd mentioned at revelation well look at verse and the question who are they and where did they come from we find the answer at revelation these are the ones that come out of the great tribulation so the great crowd is composed of those who come out of or survive the great tribulation as verse says they will be guided to fountains of waters of life on earth understandably though for these to survive the approaching great tribulation they must earlier have washed their robes in the blood of the lamb becoming true worshipers hence though revelation is describing this crowd after the tribulation we may apply the term great crowd to all with earthly hopes who are rendering jehovah sacred service now just before the great tribulation breaks out with the nations attack on false religion in summary we might remember other sheep as the broader term encompassing all of god s servants having the hope of living forever on earth it includes the more limited category of sheeplike ones today who are being gathered as a great crowd with the hope of living right through the impending great tribulation most of those loyal christians alive today are of the other sheep and they are part of the great crowd as well it is worth repeating that fine as it is to be clear on these specifics there is no need for any christian to be overly word conscious what might be called word critical paul warned about some who were puffed up with pride and involved in debates about words timothy if we personally recognize certain distinctions between terms fine yet we need not either outwardly or inwardly be critical of another who may not use biblical terms quite as precisely curly sue my answer was taken directly from the questions from readers that the asker was referring to it is available to anyone who wants to read it this was also discussed at this weeks book study which i assume you attended also in my answer above the words 'on earth' have not been added to the verse by either myself or the governing body they are clearly outwith the quotation marks
