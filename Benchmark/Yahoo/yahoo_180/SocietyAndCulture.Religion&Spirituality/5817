help okay so this is just a simple question that i want answered with no insults cause im not trying to be prejudice or anything cause i am catholic too but im not really into reading the bible everyday sorta thing for some people who do im wondering it says if your gay bi and etc its a sin right then if they say u make a sin you go to hell but if god loves us for who we are why not accept the fact im not gay or bi for any of you wondering i have a bf im just wondering and if scientist say that humans came from evolution and such like from monkeys for examples who made the monkeys so if its evolutionary they mean that somehow the monkey and the whole world was made due to evolution im sorry if you guys think this is a stupid question or so im just wondering im not trying to offend i dont even know if this will offend people but please give explanatory answers not to say being gay or bi is wrong i support it i dont really believe in the bible sometimes too i know this might be a sin but technically i didnt have a choice to be concerned in a religon i whish i could just live without any religons that would be less stressing to me go ahead and cuss see if i care hmm yeah maybe i'll try reading it ok fine chill green alien and like i said im not trying to argue maybe u should get a real picture of urself instead of a green alien yeah maybe then we could actually talk homosexuality has been labeled as an abominaton by god and is against nature not meaning to be offensive or sarcastic as the saying goes god created adam and eve not adam and steve both the old testament and the new testament condemn the practice and rather than follow god's commandments man would rather deny god's existance or call his judgments outdated so they can do as they wish they had better hope that they are right for if they are not they will face god's wrath against their willful disobedience god is indeed a loving god but he is also a god of judgment and justice and people tend to forget that he hates sin but loves the sinner enough that he took his own curse and punishment for sin upon himself in jesus christ so that we might have salvation and enter heaven for eternity but it is also required that we follow his commandments which if you think about them objectively are right and good but our sin nature makes us rebel against him just as satan did and we would rather do our own thing and indulge our pleasures rather than do what is right in his sight remember sodom and gomorrah have been found and archaeological evidence has found that the cities were destroyed by a firestorm which originated from above the cities just as scripture states sodom was meant as a lesson and has remained the symbol of god's wrath against homosexuality for years and as for evolution scientists are finding that living creatures such as coelecanth fish and glass sponges which existed supposedly millions of years ago look exactly like their fossils so if evolution is true why haven't they changed and evolutionists still can't explain where the split between cellulose plants and protoplasm flesh came about if we came from a single celled organism as they claim Ten Commandments A Course In Miracles Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Homosexuality and Christianity Genesis Eastern Orthodox Church Resurrection of Jesus Abrahamic religion Trinity New Testament Theodicy Book of Mormon God Divine grace Summa Theologiae Fallen angel Christianity Church of Christ Noah Origin belief Westboro Baptist Church (Topeka) Satan Christian eschatology Capital punishment Paradise Lost Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Predestination Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Urantia Book of Isaiah Perseverance of the saints Religion and sexual orientation Infant baptism Evolutionary creationism Indulgence John Howard Yoder Free will Sabbath Atheism Evil Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Blood atonement Martin Luther Biblical inerrancy Demon Apocrypha Meaning of life Charles Grandison Finney Homosexuality Adam and Eve Day-Age Creationism Jesus Church of Christ, Scientist Criticisms of Christianity Reinhold Niebuhr Sexual orientation Purgatory Jehovah's Witnesses Soul Mormonism Liberal Christianity Religious pluralism Intelligent design movement Baptist Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Religion and sexuality Immortality Creation-evolution controversy Calvinism Prophet Flood geology Answers in Genesis Ethics Christian apologetics Baptism Devil John the Baptist Qiyamah Sacrifice
