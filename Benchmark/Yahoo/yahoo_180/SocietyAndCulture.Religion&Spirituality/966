why do creationists lump cosmology math paleontology geology and chemistry into evolution i've often seen evolution questions about the big bang cosmology abiogenesis math probability ancient civilizations paleontology physical features of earth geology and radiometric dating chemistry are creationists aware that biology is what deals with evolution actually those are your major sciences shouldn't creationists just direct their accusations toward science in general borrowing from einstein creationist debaters like ken hovind have defined a special theory of evolution microevolution or adaptation and a general theory of evolution in hovind's words when i use the word evolution i am not referring to the minor variations found in all of the various life forms microevolution i am referring to the general theory of evolution which believes these five major events took place without god time space and matter came into existence by themselves planets and stars formed from space dust matter created life by itself early life forms learned to reproduce themselves major changes occurred between these diverse life forms i e fish changed to amphibians amphibians changed to reptiles and reptiles changed to birds or mammals http www talkorigins org faqs hovind html in this way creationists can argue evolution on their own terms by using such confusing talking points they appear better informed than narrowly focused biologists creationists define the debate in order to win a debate truth reason and rationality are beside the point uninformed folks are always impressed by slick a presentation Young Earth creationism Creation science Evolution Intelligent design Flood geology Macroevolution Creationism Biology Evolutionary creationism Evolutionism Human Science History of creationism Physics Bah__'__ Faith and Science Abiogenesis Dinosaur Creationist cosmologies Species Old Earth creationism Timeline of the Universe Cosmology History of evolutionary thought Created kind Origin belief Creation biology Fermi paradox Big Bang Emergence Noah's Ark Evidence of evolution History of science Triassic Specified complexity Origin of life Spiritual evolution Non-standard cosmology General relativity Mathematics Meaning of life Religion Astronomy Multiverse Universe Planet Modern geocentrism Fine-tuned universe Atheism Physical cosmology Black hole Paleontology Teleological argument Teach the Controversy Extraterrestrial life God Anthropic principle Determinism Sociocultural evolution Involution (philosophy) Answers in Genesis Culture Sociobiology Gaia theory (science) Time travel Day-Age Creationism Mathematics of general relativity Ken Wilber Reptile Western philosophy Gravity Supernatural Fred Hoyle Intelligent design movement Solar system Mammal Life Causality Physical science Philosophy of science Apologetics Ecology Free will William A.
