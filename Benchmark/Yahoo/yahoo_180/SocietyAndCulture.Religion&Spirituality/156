do animals have souls a question on here earned me thumbs down on my answer so i will ask you all for your thoughts and or belief years ago one of my cats passed away from leukemia i was traumatically heartbroken as a result i asked a pastor in the catholic church if i will see my cat when i enter heaven he responded no animals do not have souls do they or not http answers yahoo com question index ylt al h ru hgqxdhwf flghnxsy ix qid aak ayy show profile info diqpfvkiaa not understanding what darth was talkin about but anyhow thanks for your answers lol ok gotcha darth and i agree with on that hun and then there was deacon i assume i will get myself reading up on this particular issue on my own thanks to you all i'm catholic there has never been any defined dogma by the catholic church regarding the souls of animals please tell your pastor that thomas aquinas taught that all life was a soul but only humans have an immortal soul the catholic church has never said thomas aquinas was infallible a priest friend once said apparently aquinas never had a dog or pet of any kind apparently your pastor is giving his own opinion or has been influenced by aquinas or he is just saying what sister mary ignatius told him as a little boy most priest and even a few bishops have frankly said i don't know when confronted with the question as to whether animals have souls and will go to heaven i believe i will see my kitties and my little dog in heaven i know how you feel i had a cat that had adenocarcinoma of the uterine stump and had to be put down in she was i might add that the bible doesn't specifically mention the souls of animals however the bible is salvation history it is about man's fall from grace and man's redemption don't believe your little cat's ancestors fell from grace like man did however it seems your little cat had to suffer and die because of man's fall from grace it is only just that he receive the reward of eternal life Roman Catholic Church Catholicism Salvation Eastern Orthodox Church Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Sin Purgatory Papal Infallibility Summa Theologiae Merit Soul Catechism Justification (theology) Holy Orders Blessed Virgin Mary Hell Immaculate Conception Sola fide Filioque clause Religion Alan Campbell (pastor) Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Mary, the mother of Jesus New Testament Church of Christ Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Resurrection of Jesus Bible and reincarnation Christian eschatology Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Baptism Eucharist Abrahamic religion Traditionalist Catholic Pope Anglicanism Ordination of women John Wesley Heaven Original sin Predestination Tridentine Mass Protestantism Fundamentalism Infant baptism Augustine of Hippo Second Vatican Council Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Trinity Thomism Christianity Maimonides Baptist Intelligent design Jewish philosophy Great Apostasy Liberal Christianity Angel Afterlife Bishop Mortification of the flesh Reincarnation Indulgence Clerical celibacy Discordianism Meaning of life Martin Luther Clergy Christian apologetics Jewish principles of faith Immortality George Fox Zohar Christianity and anti-Semitism Protestant Reformation Catechism of the Catholic Church Biblical inerrancy Didache Catholic sacraments The Amber Spyglass John Henry Cardinal Newman Simone Weil Contrition Free will Evolutionary creationism Church of Christ, Scientist Calvinism Sign of contradiction Judaism Gospel of Thomas Philipp Melanchthon Judas Iscariot Devil Pharisees Apocrypha
