why do people discredit josephus he is widely acknowledged by academicians as one of the few outside objective confirmations of jesus on earth as well as his ministry yet many scholars of today discredit him and say his historical accounts of the time of jesus were either not accurate marred by later false additions to the documents what do you know of the opinions of a one josephus writer of antiquities hey johnny a thanks for looking out for me i would email and say hello but you don't allow it god bless you well it is because we have proof that the parts of josephus that talk about jesus were added in centuries latter the christian author origen wrote around the year his writings predate both the earliest known manuscripts of the testimonium and the earliest quotations of the testimonium by other writers in his surviving works origen fails to mention the testimonium flavianum even though he was clearly familiar with the antiquities of the jews since he mentions the less significant reference by josephus to jesus as brother of james which occurs later in antiquities of the jews xx and also other passages from antiquities such as the passage about john the baptist furthermore origen states that josephus was not believing in jesus as the christ he did not accept jesus as christ but the testimonium declares jesus to be christ because of these arguments some scholars believe that the version of antiquities available to origen did not mention jesus at this point at all we have early copies of josephus they do not contain the passage in addtion any educated reading of the passage can show that this is a poor and glaring additon http en wikipedia org wiki josephus on jesus arguments against authenticity Biblical canon Jesus Apocrypha Resurrection of Jesus Josephus John the Baptist Gospel of Mark Chronology of Jesus Acts of the Apostles Gospel of John Biblical inerrancy Historical Jesus Saint Peter Pontius Pilate Book of Mormon Paul of Tarsus Barabbas Authorship of the Pauline epistles Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Yeshu Book of Daniel New Testament Book of Revelation Septuagint Dispensationalism Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Christian views of Jesus Thomas (Apostle) Gospel of Matthew Origen Sabbath Bible and reincarnation Tetragrammaton New Testament apocrypha Gospel of Barnabas Gospel The Bible and history Young Earth creationism Nontrinitarianism Charismatic Roman Catholic Church Manetho New Testament view on Jesus' life Ten Commandments Pharisees Timeline of Christianity Mary Magdalene Baptism Linguistics and the Book of Mormon Mary, the mother of Jesus Prophet Ebionites Secret Gospel of Mark History of Christianity Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Nazarene Mark 16 Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Christianity and anti-Semitism Curse and mark of Cain Book of Isaiah Berossus Cultural and historical background of Jesus Council of Jerusalem King James Version of the Bible History of the Latter Day Saint movement Names and titles of Jesus Priesthood (Mormonism) Didache Messianic Judaism Aramaic of Jesus Demon Gospel of the Hebrews Church of Christ Community of Christ Apostle Harrowing of Hell Christian-Jewish reconciliation Religious perspectives on Jesus Church of Christ, Scientist Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity History of the English Bible Massacre of the Innocents Gospel of Peter Qur'an Alan Campbell (pastor)
