do you believe ghosts are real not sure i think sometimes we see or feel things that our rational minds can't explain i think people have the wrong conception of ghosts because they believe that they live in a singular world where anything outside of it is automatically paranormal the fact is that we live in a couple of worlds the world of the tangible and the world thoughts both worlds are very real you see the tangible world is only the way it is after it is processed through the world of thought we need to pay credence to the fact that we really are spirits moving through a medium of material we might just discover that we are ghosts too example i had a friend named shane that was viciously murdered while trying to help a friend who was also murdered one night i had an especially vivid dream that i was at a party shane was there acting as if nothing had ever happened i finally caught up to him and informed him that he was dead and he shouldn't be there much to my surprise he turned to me and said that i was the one who shouldn't be there because in that world he was very much alive now before you say it was just a dream think about it it was every bit as real to me as it is for you to be sitting there in front of your computer monitor reading this can you prove beyond a doubt that you are sitting there right now reading this and not just dreaming what if life itself is a dream kind of far out there but really think about it maybe not a great example but to me it was just as profound and plain as anything we call real yes i do and i almost agree with you to the fact that we might be ghosts just passing through the material since i do believe that we are spirits just passing through in this lifetime to learn something there are a few lessons to be learned so you will need to go through a few lifetimes and since you don t just pop in from one to another you will be lingering around until your next life lesson so this will be ghosts also people that are so attached to earthly possessions that they refuse to let go when they die it takes them a while to finally learn it is better to let go this is also ghosts then you get some people that has unfinished business but this is in the minority else like people will ask then every single person that was murdered will remain a ghost until justice is done but i say this to those thinking in this manner the reason for the multiple learning spiritual journeys is to evolve enlighten be at peace so only the lesser spiritual beings will fall in that class love thy enemy love all of creation and thee shall find peace i don t know if this phrase actually exists somewhere but it one day just popped into my head and makes sense then you get mediums that are on a higher spiritual level than the average person who can actually contact and communicate with these ghosts at will and i mean real mediums not the fake wanna be stage actors most people has this encounter at least once in their lives mostly without them even realizing it because it seemed so real hence your is this a dream then you also get the other entities like daemons and elementals and ferries and such you say there is another realm when in fact there are at least others dimensions if you will and since we are in a dimensional world and dimensional beings that is all most people will ever be able to see and believe exist pity them for the are truly blind astral projection and meditation are methods of being able to view some of the other wolrds dimensions peace be with you dragon Ghost Supernatural Soul Reincarnation Animism Out-of-body experience Anthroposophy New Age Sri Aurobindo Meaning of life Yoga Sutras of Patanjali God Spiritism Scientology beliefs and practices Theodicy Immortality Theory of conduct Idolatry Edgar Cayce Force (Star Wars) Religion Friedrich Schleiermacher Ten Commandments Spiritual evolution Philosophical skepticism Emanuel Swedenborg Trinity Demon Bhagavad Gita Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Simone Weil Charmed Philo The nature of God in Western theology Reality Altruism Avenue Q Jon Secada Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Human Appeal Michel Henry Kain (Legacy of Kain) Sant Thakar Singh Deconstruction Cyberspace Alcoholics Anonymous Abortion debate Kabbalah Royal Assent Umbra (World of Darkness) Epistemology The Invisibles Arthur Schopenhauer Meme YuYu Hakusho Socrates W.I.T.C.H.
