the true friend of mankind perhaps it is not god consider this day in day out if someone gave you just bread and water you wouldnt know any different so you would think yea this is ok im happy given enough bread and water is avaliable then on special occasions you got woah slightly salty bread or even sparkling water which to you cos you dont know would be like soo exciting and amazing and just the best then one day you wake up someone introduces to you that the world has millions of foods and drinks and what there you are unloading in your pants over some bread and water yes from that day onward you no longer would be impressed with what you have because there is so much to have and yes the bliss of ignorance would be gone forever however is not the truth preferable to a lie does not the bible teach us in both testiments lies is one of the worst things to do god in the eden was happy to treat us as the above example so is then not satan who gave us realization and enlightenment our real friend think about it satan would like you to think so remember that's how he tricked eve by telling her the fruit was great and give her knowledge to be like god well that's what he does still his tactics haven't changed it's all very well saying that god limits us but if you give your children freedom to do what they like they will get into a lot of trouble the difference with us that god does give us the choice to go our own way of course even christians have the choice to sample all that life has to offer but a lot of that is harmful to us god loves us enough to offer protection and he never 'lays down the law' he cannot force anyone to do anything adam and eve enjoyed an incredible friendship and closeness with god in the garden of eden they were pretty much sorted they traded the truth for a lie and lived out the consequences Original sin Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Adam and Eve Paradise Lost The Fall of Man Satan Theory of conduct Eucharist A Course In Miracles Eastern Orthodox Church Divine grace Sin God Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Ishmael (novel) Christian eschatology Criticism of Mormonism Sant Thakar Singh Endowment (Mormonism) Urantia Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Satanism Heaven Merit Religious pluralism Meaning of life Entheogen Garden of Eden Theodicy Church of Christ Grimke Sisters Ten Commandments Genesis Jehovah's Witnesses Adi Da Justification (theology) Summa Theologiae Sabbath Philo Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Edgar Cayce Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Avenue Q Sola fide Happiness Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Advaita Vedanta Adam-God theory Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Michael (archangel) Vegetarianism and religion Israel ben Eliezer Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Demon LaVeyan Satanism John Wesley Theosis Tree of Life Opus Dei Book of Isaiah Experiment Social rule Tree of Knowledge The Truman Show Philosophical skepticism Transubstantiation Human Recurring South Park characters End times Perseverance of the saints Abrahamic religion Al-Ghazali Leviathan Buddhism Evil Epicureanism Baptism Bhagavad Gita Origin belief EastEnders Gnosticism Baptist Great Apostasy Days of our Lives John the Baptist John Wycliffe Determinism Predestination Bible
