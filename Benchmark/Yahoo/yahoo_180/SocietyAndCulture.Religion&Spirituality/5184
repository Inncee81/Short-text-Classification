how is god's existence illogical i've come across a few answers today in the good ol' r s claiming they are atheists because of logic and that god can't logically exist can some atheists elaborate on the actual logic of their beliefs like logical arguments in sentence form and all that for example here's a logical argument for god's existence everything that had a beginning had a cause the universe had a beginning therefore the universe had a cause god is the cause in the argument so i'm waitin' for answers uhohspaghettiohoh then what caused the big bang wakefield why does everything that has a beginning not need a cause things in this universe aren't self existent herodotus http en wikipedia org wiki causality the notion that things have causes is the foundation of science science is the process of looking for what caused something to happen why does the apple fall to the ground and so forth to all as the law of causality as it is called applies to natural things that is within this universe god would not need a cause because he is super natural beyond the natural realm i still don't have any arguments to specifically why god's existence is illogical my original question you were fairly logical in lines to logic says the following if the first lines are true then the rd one is true so if everything that had a beginning had a cause is true and also if the universe had a beginning is true it is logically true that the rd statement is true unfortunately there is no logic in the leap to your th line which you seem to have forgotten to number which says what the cause was there is no use of logic in jumping from the logically proven statement that the universe had a cause to your contention that god is that cause maybe a little course on logic will help you understand the concept a little better Logic Causality Atheism Cosmological argument Goodness and value theory Intelligent design G__del's incompleteness theorem Falsifiability Western philosophy Religion Transcendental argument for the existence of God Meaning of life David Hume Existence Supernatural Creationism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Immanuel Kant Determinism Theodicy Biblical inerrancy The nature of God in Western theology Epistemology Strong atheism Philosophy of science Science Truth Agnosticism Modal logic God Philosophy of language Natural deduction Scientific method Philosophical skepticism Antony Flew Origin belief History of philosophy Problem of evil Cosmology Kuzari A Course In Miracles Free will Miracle William A.
