as a christian i thank all of the atheists are you happy you did a good deed most of my life i had been one of those very uneducated christians that accepted what my parents had told me without question when i started to go onto forums i noticed that atheists were always talking about the flaws of the bible and bringing up many difficult questions that i did not have the answer to this led me to start doing a lot of research to figure out if what i had blindly believed was just a sham the more i found out the more i knew that christianity was the truth one example i had never studied bible prophecy much before but when i looked at it i realized that the bible is indeed the inspired word of god everything else looked less like the truth the more i actually took the time to study so i must say thank you to the atheists for leading me to test my faith and become educated about many different things if you all weren't around i might have not know all that i do now maybe you should research other religions and see that your christian faith is just a bunch of stolen ideas from other religions i'm all for people having their own beliefs but you should take your head out of your bible and read something else maybe something meaningful or logical at least Religion Atheism Fundamentalism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Existence of God Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Creationism Resurrection of Jesus Afterlife Intelligent design movement Soul Apologetics Meaning of life Creation-evolution controversy God Ten Commandments Christianity Theodicy Bible Biblical canon Supernatural Phillip E.
