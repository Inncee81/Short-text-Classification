a joke in bible exodus says and you may not approach my altar by steps if you do someone might look up under the skirts of your clothing and see your nakedness nlt did the author try to be funny first a little about versions some people commented on the translation nlt is now in a second edition that does seem a bit more literal than what you posted from the prior edition i reloaded the prior book version in my software and double checked this means that if you want to find one with the same reading as yours you'll have to compare information on the title pages and it may be difficult to find here is the reading from the second edition exodus and do not approach my altar by going up steps if you do someone might look up under your clothing and see your nakedness nlt second edition people who think of men as wearing slacks including most modern americans may not catch the obvious ok obvious to a theologian or historian anyway inference of the text to the view of someone wearing the flowing robe like garments of the time the nlt introductory materials state that the translators tried to strike a balance between formal equivalence literal and dynamic equivalence thought for thought with the goal being to produce in english the closest natural equivalent of the message expressed by the original language text both in meaning and in style the nlt is not a word for word translation but you don't want something that requires a degree in english and or biblical languages to understand their purpose was to create the same understanding of the message in the mind of nlt readers as existed in the mind of a jew reading this passage in hebrew years ago to meet this challenge would be impossible without explaining things which were part of common knowledge at that time even though they might not be in the text itself the open nature of their clothing as in this case is a good example of this common knowledge the result is a document which is a little longer but is much easier for a person with little or no prior study of the people and times of the scriptures to read and understand the message in the way it was intended to be understood while your nlt may not be the best choice for some settings if you enjoy reading it keep on using it the hebrew tigaleh erevateka or 'exposing your nakedness' was a euphemism for sexual relations as the definition of the word states would some modern politicians have had trouble with that definition back to the question at hand no this is not a joke that is not to say there are none to be found in the scriptures though most of them are not that obvious in english translations the intent here was quite serious the priests were even instructed to wear special clothing designed to make sure such exposure would not happen leviticus in the morning after the priest on duty has put on his official linen clothing and linen undergarments he must clean out the ashes of the burnt offering and put them beside the altar then he must take off these garments change back into his regular clothes and carry the ashes outside the camp to a place that is ceremonially clean nlt History of the English Bible Tetragrammaton Korban Sabbath Biblical inerrancy Bible Undergarment Ten Commandments Moses Biblical studies Names of God in Judaism God and gender Documentary hypothesis New Testament Homosexuality and Christianity Priestly Code Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Jewish principles of faith Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Biblical canon A Course In Miracles Predestination Creation according to Genesis God XML Exodus Miracle Tanakh Endowment (Mormonism) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Logic Jacob Neusner Book of Mormon Philosophy of language Philo 613 mitzvot Midrash Clothing Mass (liturgy) Psalms New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures Judaism Second Vatican Council Kimono Japanese tea ceremony Leviticus Scientology beliefs and practices Kuzari Kohen Qur'an Gospel of Mark Septuagint Programming language Prayer Belief revision Bible translations Christian eschatology Dispensationalism Linguistics and the Book of Mormon Translation Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Baptism Fundamentalism Infantilism Abrahamic religion John Wycliffe Day-Age Creationism Social rule CPU cache Evolutionary creationism Old Testament Repentance Discordianism Talmud Altar Soul Literacy Deconstruction German language Apocrypha Trinity The Bible and history Deuteronomy Debugging Compiler optimization Guide for the Perplexed Historical Jesus African American Vernacular English
