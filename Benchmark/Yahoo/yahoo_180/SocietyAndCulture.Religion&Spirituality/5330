should we be offended by every challege to our beliefs eleanor roosevelt once said no one can make you feel inferior without your permission i take that to include words like humiliate and offend if xians didn't have a belief in a specific imaginary and therefore invisibleskyguy and a disbelief in all the others with a son who 'was raised from the dead' we atheists wouldn't poke fun and laugh and 'offend' them just for fun here's a list of the top ten signs you're a xian fundamentalist you vigorously deny the existence of thousands of gods claimed by other religions but feel outraged when someone denies the existence of yours you feel insulted and dehumanized when scientists say that people evolved from other life forms but you have no problem with the biblical claim that we were created from dirt you laugh at polytheists but you have no problem believing in a triune god your face turns purple when you hear of the atrocities attributed to allah but you don't even flinch when hearing about how god jehovah slaughtered all the babies of egypt in exodus and ordered the elimination of entire ethnic groups in joshua including women children and trees you laugh at hindu beliefs that deify humans and greek claims about gods sleeping with women but you have no problem believing that the holy spirit impregnated mary who then gave birth to a man god who got killed came back to life and then ascended into the sky you are willing to spend your life looking for little loopholes in the scientifically established age of earth billion years but you find nothing wrong with believing dates recorded by bronze age tribesmen sitting in their tents and guessing that earth is a couple of generations old you believe that the entire population of this planet with the exception of those who share your beliefs though excluding those in all rival sects will spend eternity in an infinite hell of suffering and yet consider your religion the most tolerant and loving while modern science history geology biology and physics have failed to convince you otherwise some idiot rolling around on the floor speaking in tongues may be all the evidence you need to prove christianity you define as a high success rate when it comes to answered prayers you consider that to be evidence that prayer works and you think that the remaining failure was simply the will of god you actually know a lot less than many atheists and agnostics do about the bible christianity and church history but still call yourself a christian i sure hope no one was offended Atheism Evolutionary creationism Abrahamic religion Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Ten Commandments Creationism Supernatural Angel Jesus Reincarnation Judaism Eastern Orthodox Church Monotheism Afterlife Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Origin belief Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Soul Holy Spirit Young Earth creationism Existence of God Flood geology The nature of God in Western theology God and gender Christian eschatology Human Creation-evolution controversy Roman Catholic Church A Course In Miracles Moses Hell Jewish principles of faith Sabbath Intelligent design Religious conversion Fundamentalism Isa Religious pluralism Nation of Islam Deity Religious perspectives on Jesus Theodicy Hinduism Agnosticism Biblical inerrancy Evolutionism Islam Sin Charles Darwin's views on religion Urantia God the Father Muhammad Biblical canon Satan Resurrection of Jesus Jehovah's Witnesses Nontrinitarianism Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) New Testament Religious Society of Friends Qur'an Tetragrammaton Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Devil Spiritism Demon Salvation Separation of church and state Mary, the mother of Jesus Creation science Modern geocentrism Prophet Prayer Baptism Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Prophets of Islam Pharisees Heresy Galileo Galilei Christian views of Jesus Bible Henotheism Simone Weil Messianic Judaism
