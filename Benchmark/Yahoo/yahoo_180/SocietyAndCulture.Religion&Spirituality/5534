is the muslims' reponse but christianity did it even valid everytime someone asks a question here about the violence in the qur'an and muslim faith the first thing muslims say is but what about the crusades and the inquisition that was done by christians and then they go on to list only the quotes from the qur'an that promote peace which only applies to believers anyway can't they except the fact that islam and its teachings are at least partially to blame for the jihadists' holy war and if they aren't getting their justification from the qur'an then where is it coming from and for the record i'm not a follower of any christian belief i'm agnostic anytime someone justifies their own evil by saying that someone else was evil it is a cop out it is always possible to find some act of evil committed in the name of religion and that is true for all religions and isn't it convenient that acts committed years ago can be used to justify actions today like stds these are gifts that keep on giving Religion Christianity Islam Jihad Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Fundamentalism Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Atheism Apostasy Islam as a political movement Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Holy Spirit Nation of Islam Salvation Five Pillars of Islam Chosen people Existence of God Qur'an Evolutionary creationism Ten Commandments Criticism of Islam Religious conversion Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Abraham Islamist terrorism Yusuf al-Qaradawi Devil Religious perspectives on Jesus Creationism God Theodicy Evil Sharia Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Roman Catholic Church Baptism Sola fide Christianity and anti-Semitism Islamic philosophy Soul Justification (theology) Satanism Resurrection of Jesus The nature of God in Western theology Pacifism Separation of church and state Women in Islam Qiyamah History of creationism Historical persecution by Christians Shi'a Islam Ramadan Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi Apostasy in Islam Prophet French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Mary, the mother of Jesus Religious pluralism Messiah Islam and anti-Semitism Prophets of Islam Liberal movements within Islam Theology Exorcism Taqiyya Jesus Gospel of Barnabas Monotheism Ahmadiyya Muslim Community The relationship between religion and science Hadith Marriage Divine grace Theory of conduct Saint Fasting Zoroastrianism Charles Grandison Finney Historical persecution by Muslims Temple Mount Apologetics Criticisms of Christianity Paul of Tarsus Aqidah Crusade Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Just War theory Islamism Bosniaks Faith Christian anarchism Origin belief Discrimination
