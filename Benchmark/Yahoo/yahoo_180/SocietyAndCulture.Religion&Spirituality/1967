religion in general i have my own beliefs and i keep them to myself however i often wonder why so many folks feel the need to go to such extremes one way or the other examples you are uber religious and you believe strongly in something why do you feel the need to go with gusto and attempt to force others to conform to your beliefs if you're christian and you think that is a sin won't god judge that sinner in the end who are you to judge them in this life and why how do you feel yourself qualified to deliver judgment if you are an atheist why do you feel it necessary to belittle the belief of others you have your beliefs you are secure in them why antagonize let me add to my original question yes i do understand that there are people who will force upon you their beliefs let me also add that it is not acceptable it is absolutely acceptable for two people to intelligently discuss opposing beliefs and remain civil i know that people disagree especially when it comes to religion so what this isn't splitting the atom you believe i believe we disagree hence a discussion ensues yes i have heard of terrorists however i fail to see how terrorists factor into this bit sorry that your only working knowledge of religion is confined to that of terrorism sad for you i think and hold fast to the theory that we can all discuss independent thought and have opposing beliefs yet still remain amicable in the process call me a dreamer but shit i hope it's true i don't belittle others beliefs if they ask a question i will answer as truthfully as possible i have noticed tonight that many christians are belittling atheists but i guess that doesn't count does it Atheism Religion God Fundamentalism Intelligent design movement Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Christianity Evil Jewish principles of faith Salvation Existence of God Creation-evolution controversy Sola fide Theodicy Goodness and value theory Theory of conduct Supernatural Predestination Creationism Intelligent design Sin Epistemology The nature of God in Western theology Justification (theology) Teach the Controversy Religious conversion Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Strong atheism Evolutionary creationism Afterlife History of creationism Sexual orientation Phillip E.
