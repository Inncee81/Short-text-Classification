who is a ''prophet like moses'' and the lord said unto me they have well spoken that which they have spoken i will raise them up a prophet from among their brethren like unto thee and will put my words in his mouth and he shall speak unto them all that i shall command him deuteronomy three important elements are included in this prophecy a prophet will come from among the brethren of the israelites this prophet will be like unto moses god will put his words in the mouth of this prophet a prophet from among the brethren of the israelites when these words were spoken they were addressed to the israelites the most notable brethren of israelites descendants of abraham through his second son isaac are the ishmaelites descendants of abraham through his first son ishmael according to the hebrew dictionary of the bible brethren is the personification of a group of tribes who were regarded as near kinsmen of the israelites the bible refers to the israelites as the brethren of the ishmaelites e g gen and gen a prophet like unto moses it is sometimes contended that the prophet like unto moses was jesus after all both were israelites and spiritual teachers was this prophecy really about jesus to start off jesus himself was an israelite not of the brethren of the israelites this fact alone suffices to show that this particular prophecy is not about the coming of jesus but about another prophet like unto moses that prophet could have been none but prophet muhammad following is a comparison between a few crucial characteristics of moses muhammad and jesus which may clarify the identity of that prophet who was to come after moses area of comparison birth family life death career forced emigration in adulthood encounter with enemies results of encounter writing dawn of revelation nature of teachings acceptance of leadership by his people moses usual married children usual prophet statesman to median hot pursuit moral physical victory in his life time torah spiritual legal rejected muhammad usual married children usual prophet statesman to medinah hot pursuit battles moral physical victory in his life time al qur'an spiritual legal rejected then accepted jesus unusual no marriage or children unusual prophet none no similar encounter moral victory after him mainly spiritual rejected by most israelites this table is self evident it shows that not only were moses and muhammad very much alike in many respects but it shows also that prophet jesus does not fit this particular prophecy who was then the prophet like unto moses god will put his words in the mouth of that prophet generally speaking this description may apply to any messenger of god who is communicating god's message to mankind while that message may come in written tablets as is believed to have been the case with moses the specific wording of the above verse is a vivid description of the type of revelation received by muhammad angel gabriel used to come and dictate to him specific portions of the qur'an which were then repeated by prophet muhammad exactly as he had heard them muhammad's own thinking or authorship were not involved in any way in what he uttered the words of god the qur'an were put into his mouth as the qur'an itself described he muhammad does not speak of his own desire it is no less than a revelation sent down to him the holy qur'an chapter verses first of all let me respond to the jewish girl no the torah is not corrupted and it will never be g d had preserved it since the begining of time as a muslim this is what i believe the law that is revealed to moses which we called taurat is the truth and it will always be what we don't agree is with the books in the tanakh book of samuel genesis etc okay first you that say mikerev acheihem means from among their brothers mohammed was in no way an israelite by defintion my dear beautiful jewish girl you miss the point here you try your best desperately saving your prope by refuting christian missionaries by surfing to sites called jews for judaism i really appreciate what you are doing because we muslims and jews shra eone thing in common defending the oneness of g d but however it is sad to read what the website called jews for judaism wrote about deuteronomy now let's make it more controversial and a devils advoctae i want to quote what the jews for judaism wrote in an article passage concerning deuteronomy chapter verse in order to refute the claim of the christians without realising they the jews are refuting the christians claim for jesus and at the same time they are making muhammad s a w fit nicely in the prophecy let's look at what a rabbi have to write about it missionaries claim that jesus fulfilled the prophecy of being a prophet like moses g d says in the bible deuteronomy i will raise them up a prophet among their brethern like unto you moses what this verse means in context is that any prophet must be similar in qualifications to moses i e jewish a scholar righteous and of the highest personal character but john and the book of acts take this quote out ofcontext claiming that this verse refers to jesus and gives him the right to contradict the torah of moses however this is an obvious distortion since the bible openly states that there would never be another prophet like moses deuteronomy and there shall not arise a prophet in israel like unto moses the real messiah jewish response to christian missionary page you see balsam from the opinion of the jewish girl she said that the prophet in deuteronomy must be an israelite and muhammad is not an israelite the christian says that it is jesus because he is an israelite brotehr of moses but however balsam u read carefully what the counter missionary jews for judaism quote from deuteronomy chapter and there shall not arise a prophet in israel like unto moses so if there is no other prophet like unto moses in israel where as can we find a prophet similar to moses according to deuteronomy something smells fishy here can we find this prophet in the anglo saxon race the chinese the indians the moabites nay have they forgotten or not at their closest relative which is the ishamelites where god promise them to be a great nation now since the prophet in dueteronomy can't be an israelite since it is abbrogated by deuteronomy we must turn to the other close relative to the israelites which is the ishmaelite so that leaves no doubt that the prophet like unto moses is muhammad s a w not jesus yes i respect jesus as a prophet and a messiah but he don't fit that prophecy in deueteronomy by the way muhammad s a w is like moses die a natural death like moses a s who lead his people out egypt in the exodus to the land of midian muhammad s a w lead his persecuted people through hijrah to medinah like moses who give the law to the people concerning the fasting day of yom kippur muhammad s a w substitute it with the fast on the month of ramadhan so the conclusion is muhammad is indeed the prophet like unto moses based on the clear evidence and arguement and this refutes the christian claim that jesus is that prophet because there will be no prophet in israel like unto moses and as for the jews if they don't believe that it was muhammad s a w who is like unto moses then they have to wait for that prophet like unto moses which is not of israel probably to their closest relative and yet from their bitterist enemy the descedant of esau or another prophet from ishmael and he must be jewish according to them i still don't understand what the jews define something as jewish and what jews define something as israelites however we muslim know well that there will be no prophet after muhammad s a w so it is up to them to decide there i no compulsion in religion truth stands clear from falsehood
