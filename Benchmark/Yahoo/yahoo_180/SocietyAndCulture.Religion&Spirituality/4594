what is the difference between the bhakta and yogi read the description of a bhakta and a yogi from the following lines bhagavad gita as it is chapter knowledge of the absolute text yoginam api sarvesam mad gatenantar atmana sraddhavan bhajate yo mam sa me yuktatamo matah synonyms yoginam of all yogis api also sarvesam all types of mat gatena abiding in me antah atmana always thinking of me within sraddha van in full faith bhajate renders transcendental loving service yah one who mam me the supreme lord sah he me mine yukta tamah the greatest yogi matah is considered translation and of all yogis he who always abides in me with great faith worshiping me in transcendental loving service is most intimately united with me in yoga and is the highest of all purport the word bhajate is significant here bhajate has its root in the verb bhaj which is used when there is need of service the english word worship cannot be used in the same sense as bhaj worship means to adore or to show respect and honor to the worthy one but service with love and faith is especially meant for the supreme personality of godhead one can avoid worshiping a respectable man or a demigod and may be called discourteous but one cannot avoid serving the supreme lord without being thoroughly condemned every living entity is part and parcel of the supreme personality of godhead and thus every living entity is intended to serve the supreme lord by his own constitution failing to do this he falls down the bhagavatam confirms this as follows ya esam purusam saksad atma prabhavam isvaram na bhajanty avajananti sthanad bhrastah patanty adhah anyone who does not render service and neglects his duty unto the primeval lord who is the source of all living entities will certainly fall down from his constitutional position in this verse also the word bhajanti is used therefore bhajanti is applicable to the supreme lord only whereas the word worship can be applied to demigods or to any other common living entity the word avajananti used in this verse of srimad bhagavatam is also found in the bhagavad gita avajananti mam mudhah only the fools and rascals deride the supreme personality of godhead lord krsna such fools take it upon themselves to write commentaries on the bhagavad gita without an attitude of service to the lord consequently they cannot properly distinguish between the word bhajanti and the word worship the culmination of all kinds of yoga practices lies in bhakti yoga all other yogas are but means to come to the point of bhakti in bhakti yoga yoga actually means bhakti yoga all other yogas are progressions toward the destination of bhakti yoga from the beginning of karma yoga to the end of bhakti yoga is a long way to self realization karma yoga without fruitive results is the beginning of this path when karma yoga increases in knowledge and renunciation the stage is called jnana yoga when jnana yoga increases in meditation on the supersoul by different physical processes and the mind is on him it is called astanga yoga and when one surpasses the astanga yoga and comes to the point of the supreme personality of godhead krsna it is called bhakti yoga the culmination factually bhakti yoga is the ultimate goal but to analyze bhakti yoga minutely one has to understand these other yogas the yogi who is progressive is therefore on the true path of eternal good fortune one who sticks to a particular point and does not make further progress is called by that particular name karma yogi jnana yogi or dhyana yogi raja yogi hatha yogi etc if one is fortunate enough to come to the point of bhakti yoga it is to be understood that he has surpassed all the other yogas therefore to become krsna conscious is the highest stage of yoga just as when we speak of himalayan we refer to the world's highest mountains of which the highest peak mount everest is considered to be the culmination it is by great fortune that one comes to krsna consciousness on the path of bhakti yoga to become well situated according to the vedic direction the ideal yogi concentrates his attention on krsna who is called shyamasundara who is as beautifully colored as a cloud whose lotus like face is as effulgent as the sun whose dress is brilliant with jewels and whose body is flower garlanded illuminating all sides is his gorgeous luster which is called the brahmajyoti he incarnates in different forms such as rama nrsimha varaha and krsna the supreme personality of godhead and he descends like a human being as the son of mother yasoda and he is known as krsna govinda and vasudeva he is the perfect child husband friend and master and he is full with all opulences and transcendental qualities if one remains fully conscious of these features of the lord he is called the highest yogi this stage of highest perfection in yoga can be attained only by bhakti yoga as is confirmed in all vedic literature yasya deve para bhaktir yatha deve tatha gurau tasyaite kathita hy arthah prakasante mahatmanah only unto those great souls who have implicit faith in both the lord and the spiritual master are all the imports of vedic knowledge automatically revealed bhaktir asya bhajanam tad ihamutropadhi nairasyenamusmin manah kalpanam etad eva naiskarmyam bhakti means devotional service to the lord which is free from desire for material profit either in this life or in the next devoid of such inclinations one should fully absorb the mind in the supreme that is the purpose of naiskarmya gopala tapani upanisad these are some of the means for performance of bhakti or krsna consciousness the highest perfectional stage of the yoga system thus end the bhaktivedanta purports to the sixth chapter of the srimad bhagavad gita in the matter of sankhya yoga brahma vidya of all the yoga's bhakti yoga is the highest and a pure devotee is the greatest yogi even a practising bhakta is far far more superior to a great yogi provided the bhakti yoga is followed in a proper and authorised school of thought another excerpt from a lecture of srila prabhupada lecture wandering the planets getting out of this cycle recorded at bombay
