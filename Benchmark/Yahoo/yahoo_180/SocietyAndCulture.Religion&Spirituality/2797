in your opinion what is the most absurd part of christianity other than the fact that christianity is based completely around the idea of a human sacrifice i would have to say the idea of the trinity is the most obvious as far as moronic beliefs christians try to tell me well if you drop rocks into a bucket then they are separate but in the same vessel or the trinity is like aquafresh toothpaste flavors in one do they ever stop and think about what they are saying good hell if you wanna know my opinion the most absurd part is that christians say god allowed satan to stay and torment manipulate the human race rather than destroying him in the wake of his rebellion why to show satan that his people will stay loyal and not break their bond with him for the pleasures of materialism and sin okay that's great so he's gonna show satan that he's the universal sovereign then what's he gonna do kill him okay so god allows a demon to drive people to insanity murder temptation etc because he wants to prove a point to someone he's gonna slay in the end anyways when he has all the power in existence to end this bullcrap right off the bat the whole concept foundation of christianity is absurd to me i don't buy into it for a second Satan Hell Demon Devil Satanism God Christian eschatology Evil Sexuality in Christian demonology Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Urantia Religion Paradise Lost Freemasonry Angel Sanctuary Fallen angel Sin Demonology Heaven Trinity The Amber Spyglass A Course In Miracles Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Sacrifice Simone Weil Church of Christ LaVeyan Satanism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Origin belief Angel Great Apostasy Soul Tertullian Slow Train Coming Theodicy Justification (theology) Incarnations of Immortality Eastern Orthodox Church Exorcism Abrahamic religion Ten Commandments Predestination Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Messiahs in fiction and fantasy Liberal Christianity Immortality Opus Dei Monotheism YuYu Hakusho Demonic possession Christian anarchism Races in the Warcraft universe Pentagram Ontological argument Theology Tina Turner Book of Revelation Chick Publications Millennialism Cathar Days of our Lives The Pilgrim's Progress Pre-Adamite Christianity Religious pluralism Afterlife Bertrand Russell Christian Identity Zoroastrianism Purgatory Heresy Roman Catholic Church Holy Spirit Kabbalah The Last Temptation of Christ Vegeta Nihilism Divine grace Prophet Gnosticism Summa Theologiae Vampire Jewish views of religious pluralism Death (personification) Merit Judaism Human nature Christian Death End times Gospel of Thomas Reincarnation Theory of conduct Human sacrifice Hellraiser
