are there christians who believe in zeus that might sound insane at first however what i'm really wondering is if there are any christian denominations that teach that the pagan gods and demi gods actually existed but that they were the sons of god and the nephilim mentioned in genesis not that i know of but even the ancient greeks didn't believe in the gods most of them were monotheists long before christianity and believed that zeus was the supreme god the new testament and the early church followed the same convention the apostle paul quoted from a hymn to zeus saying in him zeus we live move and have our being for we are also his offspring several early church fathers referred to god as zeus or jupiter and affirmed that christianity was an extension of the older paganism of greece and rome Henotheism Trinity God Abrahamic religion New Testament Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Nontrinitarianism Icon Prophet History of Christianity Biblical canon Sabbath Paul of Tarsus God the Father Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Paganism Zeus Eastern Orthodox Church The Two Babylons Idolatry Christianity Christian Acts of the Apostles Great Apostasy Names of the Greeks Greek mythology Holy Spirit Binitarianism Monotheism God and gender Dionysus Justin Martyr Angel Heresy Homosexuality and Christianity Historicity of Jesus Tertullian Jesus Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Syncretism Michael (archangel) Book of Mormon Easter Origen Genesis El (god) Cultural and historical background of Jesus Catholicism Pharisees Names and titles of Jesus Hell Religious pluralism Thomas (Apostle) Authorship of the Pauline epistles Allah Council of Jerusalem Bible and reincarnation New Testament view on Jesus' life Roman Catholic Church Ten Commandments Gospel of John Historical persecution by Christians Ebionites Gnosticism Hades Bible Pentagram Salvation Religion Filioque clause Saint James the Just Nephilim Bishop Ancient Rome Hermes Catholic Apocrypha Augustine of Hippo Perpetual virginity of Mary Apostle Soul Titan (mythology) Dispensationalism Zoroastrianism Infant baptism Religious perspectives on Jesus Jews as a chosen people Hymn Mary, the mother of Jesus Christian apologetics Resurrection of Jesus
