what miracles have you seen or heard of in your life i have witnessed two supernatural life saving miracles one was in prayer and a voice said rub his feet and i did and my father opened his eyes from a nine day coma he was in from a stroke he had and lived well for more years and the other miracle was when an invisable hand held the steering wheel straught so my mother couldnt get in the middle lane where a truck would have ran into her i've heard of a family who was evacuated in a fire that was nearby there house who faxed a prayer to their own fax machine asking god to protect their house and when the fire came it skipped their house completely and the rest of the neighborhood was burned it was on the news during the fire in big bear ca a couple of years ago back when i was very little my family didn't have a lot of money because my mom quit her job to take care of me and my sister and we almost lost our house several times each time when we were on the brink of losing our home a random check or rebate was sent to us and was just enough to support the family now my mom doesn't worry about money because she knows god will help her and that problem has never reoccured since then this year i went to a church camp and there was a man who did mission trips throughout his life who was speaking to us in chapel ever since he was a baby satan was obviously working against him trying to kill him he stopped breathing in his crib and a voice commanded his mom to check on him and he was saved when he was about three he went into his dad's workshop and drank something poisonous and his sister walked in to see him on the floor knocked out he was taken to the hospital and was saved he also has had many strokes and he is still alive but is going deaf throughout his life he brought many people to christ it was amazing to hear his stories Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story Futurama (TV series - season 5) RuneScape quests Night (book) Miracle Kill Bill Mother Teresa Rocko's Modern Life Kyle Broflovski Sin City The Invisibles Cindy Sheehan Pitaten The Amber Spyglass Ten Commandments Holy Spirit Hansel und Gretel Knots Landing Daredevil Luther Vandross Characters of Lost Grandview, U.S.A.
