how do you feel about pope benedict and his actions as a catholic do you find his words hypocritical do you think he is really corrupt is one of the most boring pope's ever he doesn't do anything that is attention worthy do you find anyhting else that is good or wrong or bad or ugly about the man i used to call the leader of my faith just curious serious answers from real catholics please p s f y i i am a former catholic so don't feed me the you don't know what goes on in the rcc i have been to the vatican and i have seen both popes in person nothing to be amazed at sorry about the confusion i have seen both pope john paul ii and pope benedict my bad they were are the popes of my generation lite kynes benie has made several statements that are judgemental towards other christians especially when he says that anyone not of the catholic faith and claims to be a christian is false that is a lie just because he is the leader of the rcc doesnt mean he has the right to tell who is going to heaven or hell by way of their beliefs i dont care about his audiences i have seen him in person and i dont care for him he is overrated it is in my opinion that john paul ii was the better pope so far he never made such comments concerning other christians and when i say he is corrupt i mean the entire rcc is a corrupt organization dont try to tell me i am wrong i used to be catholic and i know what went down and since your grammar seems short spanned the qustion is how do you as a catholic feel about pope beni and his actions i don't think he's hypocritical in the sense you mean or corrupt i think he's getting a lot of flak for teaching the way the church beliefs are supposed to be taught and handling it about like you'd expect personally i don't agree with what he said about who is going to get to heaven and who won't but that's not that he isn't teaching catholicism i don't blame him for what he says it's part of what he has to do to lead the faithful teach without compromise i would hope that getting out of the church has brought me to a place where i don't blame and judge others like i did while i was in the church so don't ask me to say where he's wrong good bad or ugly i just don't care i think he was chosen because he wouldn't rock the boat start vatican iii or in any way reverse what jpii accomplished Roman Catholic Church Second Vatican Council Theory of conduct Traditionalist Catholic Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Pope Opus Dei Salvation Great Apostasy Pope John Paul II Pope Benedict XVI Catholicism Christianity Justification (theology) Pope John Paul I Pope Pius XII Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Christianity and anti-Semitism Evolutionary creationism Roman Catholic Diocese of Honolulu Sedevacantism Hell John Wycliffe Heaven Goodness and value theory Merit Theodicy Religion Papal Infallibility Divine grace Christian eschatology Religious pluralism Pacifism Biblical inerrancy Baptism New Testament Christian-Jewish reconciliation Canonization Filioque clause Purgatory Pope Paul VI Christian denomination Church of Christ Prophecy of the Popes Homosexuality and Christianity Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Eucharist Coptic Christianity Bible and reincarnation Gospel of Thomas Relations between Catholicism and Judaism Ten Commandments Ordination of women Biblical canon Antichrist Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Modern geocentrism Abrahamic religion Eastern Rite Separation of church and state Catholic Original sin Alan Campbell (pastor) Sin Atheism Chosen people George Cardinal Pell Messianic Judaism Mass (liturgy) Evil Paul of Tarsus Church of Christ, Scientist Christian right Christian anarchism Bishop Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Socrates Fundamentalism Christian ecumenism Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Dubuque Exorcism Eastern Orthodox Church Christian apologetics Liberal Christianity Jehovah's Witnesses Heresy Prophet Leviathan (book) Christian theological controversy Resurrection of Jesus Blessed Virgin Mary Sola fide
