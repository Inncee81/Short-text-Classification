book of job the most misread book of the bible http tinyurl com b gn the phrase the patience of job could not be further from the mark job is for all but of the chapters exasperated by his comforters reduced to abject misery by his afflictions and disillusioned and furious with god the defiance of job would have been a far more apposite figure of speech to have passed into the language most people don't have god talking to them either unless you went crazy which it seems job had by the end of the story the book of job is just a story but its lessons are easily misread if god is omnipotent we cannot blame anything on the devil and if god is no help we have to do his work for him we construe his absence either as non existence hubris apathy or an admission of guilt we miss him we would dearly like to see him going to and fro in the earth and walking up and down in it but we can admire tyranny no longer and we desire justice more than we are awed by vainglorious assertions of magnificence does it bother anyone that in this story god decided to murder all of job's children and his animals then curse his body with disease simply because he wanted to make a bet with the devil if god and the devil exist we have a problem they are either on equal footing or they're actually friends and religious people have got it all backwards about this god fellow being fair job's story is basically this the benevolent loving god decides to make a bet with satan and job pays for this bet by watching all of his kids wives and family die wealth disappear friends abandon him and accuse him of sinfulness and health deteriorate until job is so sad and beaten that he curses the very fact that he was ever born then the tribal misogonistic jealous wrathful immature god of the bible has the audacity to chastize job for being anguished the new testament refers to god as like a father to us puny humans i wonder what any christian would think of me as a father if i made a bet with one of my buddies from work that if he made my son's life absolutely miserable and could do anything to him short of killing him what kind of a father would i be a sad one that's what edit most people who haven't read job carefully make the mistake of thinking that god put all that misfortune on job actually god allowed satan to do all of those terrible things to him that is just as bad especially for a stand up guy as job supposedly was hey i'm god and i love my creation like a daddy but you know what just for the hell of it i'm going to make a little wager with my worst enemy satan and allow him to simply wreck the life of a guy who has kept my word believed in me and done everything i've asked of him then when job is depressed destitute friendless homeless broke in constant pain disabled from disease widowed childless and still hasn't cursed me i'll scold him anyway sound reasonable not to me of course i think it's just a fictional story if it's real then the god of the bible is heartless cruel and immature you who are christians can have him el chistoso Devil Satan Sin Book of Job Shaggy dog story Simone Weil Immortality Christian eschatology EastEnders Demon Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hell Knots Landing Theodicy Evil A Course In Miracles Paradise Lost Ten Commandments Angel Existence of God Pitaten Urantia Religion Fallen angel The Amber Spyglass Genesis Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Dispensationalism Church of Christ, Scientist Ranma __ characters Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Book of Isaiah Intelligent design Witchcraft Death (personification) Book of Mormon Satanism Euphemism Narcissism John Howard Yoder Justification (theology) Fitz Hugh Ludlow Resurrection of Jesus Summa Theologiae Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Supernatural Humphrey Bogart Trinity Christianity and anti-Semitism Sola fide Idolatry Sheikh Abdullah The Pilgrim's Progress Eastern Orthodox Church Sin City American Pie (song) Witch-hunt Futurama (TV series - season 5) Angel Sanctuary Anti-Semitism Recurring South Park characters Predestination Kodocha Creationism God and gender Exorcism LaVeyan Satanism Seven deadly sins Philo Babe Ruth Cain Qiyamah Demonic possession Friends Jewish principles of faith Church of Christ Incarnations of Immortality Sant Thakar Singh Prince Edmund (Blackadder) The nature of God in Western theology Freemasonry Jiddu Krishnamurti Catechism Christian views of Jesus Soul Gospel of John
