why do people have a big problem with jehovah witness we are discussing so many things about religions are main topic in my school are the jehovah witness they are a religion that has been threw a lot from nazi germany to the u s supreme courts and other countries high courts because of their rights to practice their religion they have actually shaped america s law medical and technology systems and take no credit what so ever for what they done their the only non political christian organization and don t participate in military service because of their beliefs i didn t know much about this religion and i thought that they were a sect but after learning so much about them i have a very different point of view towards them now so why all the hate against them their actually a very unique group in all of the worlds society it is true that jehovah's witnesses are not loved by everyone http jw media org newsroom human rights htm some people hate jehovah's witnesses out of ignorance or over some misunderstanding a few may have had a bad personal experience with an individual who claimed to be a jehovah's witness and prejudicially extended their animus to this entire christian religion however it seems that the majority of anti witness hatred is motivated by religious intolerance and bigotry a few may even be motivated against their christian worship by the unseen 'god of this system of things' satan the devil corinthians the god of this system of things has blinded the minds of the unbelievers interestingly such hatred should be expected by true christians in this time of the end and it actually helps identify jehovah's witnesses as christ's true disciples john if you were part of the world the world would be fond of what is its own now because you are no part of the world but i have chosen you out of the world on this account the world hates you luke happy are you whenever men hate you and whenever they exclude you and reproach you and cast out your name as wicked for the sake of the son of man peter because you do not continue running with them in this course to the same low sink of debauchery they are puzzled and go on speaking abusively of you timothy for there will be a period of time when they will not put up with the healthful teaching but in accord with their own desires they will accumulate teachers for themselves to have their ears tickled and they will turn their ears away from the truth whereas they will be turned aside to false stories you though keep your senses in all things suffer evil do the work of an evangelizer fully accomplish your ministry it seems signficant that the relatively small religion of jehovah's witnesses are the ones best known for their worldwide preaching work yet jesus commanded that all who would call themselves christian perform this public work matthew go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit teaching them to observe all the things i have commanded you and look i am with you all the days until the conclusion of the system of things learn more http watchtower co uk e jt index htm http watchtower co uk e article htm http watchtower co uk e article htm Organizational structure of Jehovah's Witnesses John Howard Yoder Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Opposition to cults and new religious movements Prophet Charles Grandison Finney Religion God Jesus Christianity and anti-Semitism Religious pluralism Christian eschatology Dispensationalism Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Eucharist Status of religious freedom in France Soul Religious Society of Friends Book of Mormon Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Satan Sabbath A Course In Miracles Gospel of Thomas Great Apostasy Cult Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Anti-Mormonism Christian denomination Christian views of Jesus Abrahamic religion Acts of the Apostles Missionary Evil Hell Separation of church and state History of Christianity Restorationism Apostle Christian views of women Summa Theologiae Herbert W.
