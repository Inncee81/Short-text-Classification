why are they called jehovah witnesses if gods name isnt jehovah and jw's have never seen god in person why are they jehovah witnesses shouldnt they be like creator gods believers or higher power think tank and so on and so forth btw for all concerned jehovah is the german word for yahweh so unless yhwh was definately gods spelled out name and god is german then jehovah isnt his name are they really witnessing for him does one who denies the trinity and deity of christ a good witness would they worship jesus if he walked into the room as the apostles did or say hi prophet only jesus if im wrong on any of these feel free to correct almighty god watchtower guards linedancer ive talked to many jw's about the trinity show them the verses and the reasoning and their response is simple denial you would be no different sparkle for someone that relies on holywood films for facts i will not be lectured you know less than nothing ray any other church that doesnt deny the deity of christ tha more of what random ranting apparently you dont understand my argument if you wrote all that gem men agree so that is his name what if i and my family decided to call you rupert while you visited does that become your name uh people when i go around saying that im a jesus christ witness promoting his true name then you can pan me for that thats your silly practice not mine in my own humble opinion god doesnt have a name jesus did but his earthly name isnt whats important they're called jehovah's witnesses because yahweh's endorsers doesn't have the same ring to it Trinity God Tetragrammaton Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Prophet Jehovah's Witnesses Ten Commandments Baptism Christianity Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Abrahamic religion Jesus Names of God in Judaism Nontrinitarianism Sabbath Holy Spirit Mormonism and Christianity New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures Salvation Mary, the mother of Jesus Great Apostasy Religion Persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses John Howard Yoder Church of Christ Idolatry A Course In Miracles Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Christian eschatology Jehovah Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Soul Missionary Religious conversion Eastern Orthodox Church Justification (theology) God and gender New Testament Creation according to Genesis Biblical inerrancy Creationism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Arianism Heresy Charles Taze Russell Christian denomination God the Father Acts of the Apostles Charles Grandison Finney Binitarianism Book of Mormon Devil Mormon History of Christianity Satan Paul of Tarsus Deity Sola fide Apostle Original sin Saint Religious pluralism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Organizational structure of Jehovah's Witnesses Church of Christ, Scientist Theodicy Homosexuality and Christianity Religious Society of Friends Divine grace Christianity and anti-Semitism Satanism Revelation Alan Campbell (pastor) Resurrection of Jesus Religious perspectives on Jesus Urantia Unitarianism Bible and reincarnation Elohim President of the Church (Mormonism) Apostasy in Islam Priesthood (Mormonism) Messianic Judaism Names of God The Da Vinci Code Community of Christ Christian views of Jesus End times Infant baptism Apostles' Creed
