if i where in african and i have a us money order is it possible for me to cash it i was just wondering cause its seem like you could cash it a woman i think was trying to scam me and i ain't falling for it someone i don't know that tells me they love me and starts talking to me about a money problem no way i just wanted to put this on here so maybe someoneelse would see it and maybe save them a lot of pain in most poor nations the usd and other major currencies are accepted without the need to exchange it would be better to cash your money order in the us this is because the black market for cash is rampant but that is not your problem you can often get things cheaper paying for them in usd than you would with local currency if you do want to exchange some small money do it it at the airport or a proper exchange centre United States dollar Asian financial crisis Euro Money Economy of Africa Charles Ponzi Financial markets Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Inflation MapleStory Bond Derivative (finance) Enron Corporation Monetary policy Currency Hyperinflation Credit card Exchange rate Gross domestic product Bretton Woods system Canadian dollar Debt Liberty Dollar Monopoly (game) Hong Kong dollar Anarchist economics Deflation (economics) Microeconomics Government debt Fiat money Arthur Laffer Internet fraud Cheque Money supply MMORPG Gold standard Banknote Arbitrage Foreign exchange market Argentine Currency Board Commodity markets Electronic money Confidence trick Keynesian economics Ja Rule Advance fee fraud National Football League Economy of Russia Ponzi scheme Johnny Cash Automatic teller machine Capital accumulation Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?
