if i start putting money in my savings instead of checking account at wamu do i get to withdrawal money i want to save up for a car apartment and daycare for when i decide to have kids in like years anyways can i withdrawal money from my savings just like my checking if i need to if i overdraw from my checking account will they just transfer money from my savings account and not charge me a fee for it also how can i get a credit card nobody ever approves me i make about per month and i'm years old thanks for your help yes you can w d money from savings there is a limit of transfers out of the savings account from anywhere except at an atm or at a branch in a statement cycle though so be careful or else you get hit with a fee if you haven't already done so you can open a savings account at your nearest branch and they will tell you this as well there is an overdraft protection that will transfer the funds from savings to checking provided the money is there depending on where you are at in the country depends on the fee amount but it is around per day so you can overdraft more than once in a day and only get one fee if there aren't any funds in the savings though your item might either get rejected or returned and you'll be charged an nsf fee which is much steeper as for the credit card you have a couple of options one is trying for a regular credit card of which wamu would be able to take care of that if you aren't can't get approved then wamu again has a secured card it's a little less glamorous and has an annual fee unlike the unsecured card but it'll save you a ton of money in the long run if you can use it to build your credit i would be happy to answer any other questions you may have about wamu or i would suggest going to your nearest branch and sitting down with a personal financial representative and they will be able to answer you questions in better detail than i can here good luck Credit card Debit card Identity theft Automatic teller machine Internet fraud Student loan United States Postal Service Bank fraud Money supply Mutual fund Insurance EFTPOS Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Life insurance 401(k) Personal finance Credit card fraud Monetary policy Education in the United States Article One of the United States Constitution Annuity Advance fee fraud Poker jargon United Kingdom corporation tax Octopus card Mortgage Short selling Citigroup Predatory lending The Joker's Wild Publicly funded medicine National Kidney Foundation Singapore Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation $ale of the Century Corporation CPU cache Password The Amazing Race Theory of conduct Tax Hedge fund Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Variable universal life insurance Corporate finance 2003 California recall Social Security (United States) Open access Gross domestic product Schabir Shaik Trial Baroque chess Certificate of deposit Trust (Law) USA Financial audit Let's Make a Deal Graduate school Education in Portugal Keynesian economics Surveillance Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Health insurance SmartRider Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Interest Betting (poker) Money Yield curve Canadian and American politics compared 2005 United States Grand Prix Government of Maryland Bob McEwen George W.
