how to cash a check ok well my cousin has a check of and hes only years old but theres problems hes doesnt have a bank account and his mom cant cash it for him the check is printed with a i think computer printer cuz it looks printed and the check says his first and his middle name but not his last name and theres no way we can cash it cuz he cant just put in his last name is there anyway to cash that check could it be a fake becuase my cousin received it from some guy saying he wanted to buy his zune from him so he sent him for it which i think is a really dumb thing to do so what can we do about it also the check is completly filled in signed and everything its that his name isnt hand writen its like printed thats the only problem it does sounds suspicious one other thing to try would be to see if you can tell what bank the check is drawn on that is the bank of that the person who wrote the check it should be written on the check call that bank or go see them and tell them you have a check from name the person who wrote it for give the amount and ask them if that check would clear today i doubt it will but if they say it would i would try to take the check to that bank or another branch of the same bank and see if they can help you get it cashed if it's good they should cash it for you even if you don't have an account there Money supply Cheque Bank fraud Automatic teller machine Internet fraud Poker jargon Money creation CPU cache Surveillance Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Life insurance Money Bond Charles Ponzi Wheel of Fortune Jerry Lee Lewis Medical prescription Betting (poker) System/36 Prolog Credit card Marilyn Monroe Bank Octopus card Money laundering Logic Ocean's Twelve Annuity Finance United States Postal Service Monopoly (game) Mergers and acquisitions Marshall Plan The Amazing Race Advance fee fraud Debit card Monetary policy PostScript Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Money order ZX Spectrum Personal finance Jon Secada Asset Financial audit United States dollar Year 2000 problem RuneScape cheats Chess strategy and tactics Frank Abagnale Theory of conduct MapleStory Let's Make a Deal Trust (Law) USA Citigroup Shit Slot machine Bank of America James Hanratty System/34 Winning Streak EFTPOS Inflation Dot matrix printer IBM PC compatible Presidential system Identity theft Cheating in Counter-Strike NCR Corporation Bart the Fink Mutual fund ALGOL 68 Draw poker Mortgage Double-entry book-keeping Married... with Children Security (finance) Debugging Deflation (economics) Nashville Skyline Inkjet printer The writing of Principia Mathematica Waylon Jennings The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Wall Street Australian dollar FairTax Playing card Trademark Fiat money Mac OS X Bank Secrecy Act Traveler's cheque Publication of Darwin's theory Xerox Star Accounts payable Computer printer Baseball Stars Modem
