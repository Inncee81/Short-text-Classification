what is bankruptcy like some friends of ours have about dollars in credit card debt that may seem like a lot but it's piled up over many years and they spent about half that money remodeling an old house they bought which they couldn't keep and had to do a short sale which i guess can be compared to one step above a foreclosure they want to file for bankruptcy because they make so little money and made a huge mistake obviously buying their home and then spending so much money on it they also loaned about dollars to the wife's brother that he never really paid back but it sounds so scary to me that big number if they file for bankruptcy will they have a chance to explain themselves or will that huge number send up a red flag that doesn't actually exist lol it's actually quite a sad situation as they went from living in a nice home on the hill to a dinky apartment in a crowded city happens i guess oh they've stopped borrowing money of course let's put it this way almost half their debt was for the remodeling which they ended up losing the house anyway of the k left over of that was a loan which was never paid back to her brother leaving k over the course of about years as her husband wasn't working a lot and neither was she long story disabilities and such no they won't get a chance to explain it they go to the lawyer and he has them fill out paperwork they put all of their debts that they want discharged and then there is a paper with all of their assets then the lawyer files with the court and they get a court date they go to court sit in front and talk to the judge and he discharges the debts then some time later they get a paper in the mail saying that the debts are discharged yes i agree with the stop borrowing and get on a good budget but sometimes in somecases bankruptcy is the only option tell them there is no shame in it they are not losers Deflation (economics) Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Mortgage Great Depression Debt Predatory lending Bond Poker jargon Article One of the United States Constitution Credit card Government debt Donald Trump Bank fraud Money Interest Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code Bank Schabir Shaik Trial Social Security (United States) Plame affair Enron Corporation Betting (poker) Charles Ponzi EastEnders Appeal Animal Crossing Money supply Asian financial crisis Security (finance) Knots Landing Debt consolidation Hyperinflation Piccolo Junior Saga Fiat money Bankruptcy in the United States Student loan The Contender (television series) Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code George W.
