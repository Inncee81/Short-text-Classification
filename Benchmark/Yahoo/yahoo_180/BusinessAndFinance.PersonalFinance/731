is it smarter to max out k and ira contributions rather than pay off student loans faster loan has interest first year and for the years following can take as long as years if necessary is it smarter to maybe max k to employer contribution and only put half of max amount in ira then use the money not put in the ira to pay off the loan much faster fennell i think it's sort of a judgment call on your part when you compare the low rate of interest on the student loan with potential tax deferred returns on your retirement investment it would seem you come out ahead in terms of total dollars on the other hand you have to consider that not paying more on your student loans means less cash flow in the future because you're paying longer on the loans i tend to like your idea of maxing the k contribution and put half or maybe even of max into an ira by the way you should probably do a roth ira as opposed to a traditional one because it's tax free retirement savings not just tax deferred double or triple up on the loan payments use some of the money for non retirement savings i e a rainy day fund and you'll probably be in better financial shape to really dig into retirement savings down the road as your income increases and your debt load shrinks good luck 401(k) Annuity Deflation (economics) Bond Student loan Mortgage Debt Money Social Security (United States) Economy of Russia Life insurance Pension Credit card FairTax Personal finance Social Security debate (United States) Bretton Woods system Ponzi scheme Roth IRA Monetary policy Mutual fund Inflation Gross domestic product Government debt Variable universal life insurance Individual Retirement Account Bank Tax Hyperinflation Money supply Deficit spending Islamic banking Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 Corporate finance Savings and loan association Taxation in the United States Interest Tertiary education fees in Australia Capitalism Primerica Financial Services Security (finance) Tuition Capital accumulation Economy of India Finance Income trust U.S. public debt Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 United Kingdom corporation tax Microeconomics Flat tax Education in the United States Retirement plan Financial markets Progressive tax Anarchism and capitalism Reaganomics Economy of El Salvador Economy of the United States Economy of Chile Economy of Africa Unemployment benefit Tax cut Federal Reserve Dividend Gold standard Economy of Pakistan Warren Buffett Collateralized debt obligation Asian financial crisis Municipal bond Economy of the Philippines Treasury security Derivative (finance) Free trade Marshall Plan Arthur Laffer Individual Savings Account Corporation Surplus value Yield curve PE ratio History of the United States (1918-1945) Citigroup Margin (finance) Great Depression Money creation Poker jargon Health savings account Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Bank fraud Publicly funded medicine Present value
