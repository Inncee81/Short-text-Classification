ebay question about listing hello does anyone know how to list a 'pick up only' item on ebay i've looked on the site and can't find how to do it when listing something up i'd like it to look like this postage costs pick up only see item description for details post to will arrange for local pick up only no postage but instead it looks like the only choice is to put postage as 'free' which is misleading can anyone help thank you thanks everyone i went back to edit it and the option came up it didn't come up the first time which is strange but anyway all sorted now there has always been an option to choose local pick up only on every listing that i've ever done if you don't find that as one of your choices just choose other and list that it's available for local pick up only it's not a bad idea to list it in the description of the items too just so there's no confusion about it later best of luck to you Postage stamp United States Postal Service Neopets Monty Hall problem MapleStory Wheel of Fortune Gaia Online Live 8 Animal Crossing Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Poker jargon The Apprentice 2 Quicksort Internet fraud Post office Legal research RuneScape Random Events Sheepshead Winning Streak Chrono Trigger Dodge Charger Axiom of choice RuneScape Let's Make a Deal Online auction business model Topps Press Your Luck Paul W.
