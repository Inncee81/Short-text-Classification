is it a good idea i really really need a loan of around pounds but because im just and have a minimum wage job its hard finding a loan so is it a good idea if i get credit cards and take thousand from each because you only pay back around each month surely thats a good idea if i cant get a loan any advice would be great thanks i would advise against it if there is any way you can possibly not borrow that money then it is definately worth considering alternatives if you need to borrow now you will end up paying a lot more than that back and in a few years you will be in even more trouble these things have a way of escalating it really depends on what the money is for if it really is a matter of life and death then i would speak to friends and family about whether they could possibly help you out they are likely to have much better terms of lending than a loan company who are out there just to make money i advise you to think very carefully before jumping into anything Deflation (economics) Life insurance Bank Hyperinflation Credit card Interest Gold standard Predatory lending Insurance Debt Bond Microcredit Inflation Monetary policy Finnish language Mortgage Minimum wage Social Credit Capitalism Government debt Capital accumulation Debt consolidation Bretton Woods system Schabir Shaik Trial Short selling Microeconomics Islamic banking Financial markets Finance School of Salamanca Marshall Plan Marcus Licinius Crassus Economy of Russia Sweatshop Stock Social Security (United States) Charles Ponzi Fiat money Variable universal life insurance Graduate school Money supply Poker jargon Free trade Savings and loan association 401(k) Yield curve The Merchant of Venice John Kerr Economy of the United States Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Keynesian economics Subsidy Security (finance) Money creation Fixed income History of the United States (1918-1945) Betting (poker) Theory of conduct Islamic economics Alcoholics Anonymous ACORN Edward Gibbon Wakefield Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Arbitrage Surplus value Federal Reserve Supply-side economics Financial services Mutual fund Primerica Financial Services Great Depression Savings and Loan crisis Advance fee fraud Annual percentage rate Mortgage-backed security Evan Montvel Cohen Public policy Bank fraud Currency Donald Trump Anarchism and capitalism Avenue Q Economics Refinancing Wal-Mart Payday loan Pitaten Credit history Trust (Law) USA Personal finance Education in the United States Social rule Debt levels and flows
