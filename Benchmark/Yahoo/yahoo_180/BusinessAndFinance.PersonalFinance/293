what is the difference between how amex cards work as compared to other credit cards i'm fairly new to this what do you think of the starwood preferred guest card specifically if i were to have another credit card that i might have a balance on for over days which card would be my best bet if i wanted a really low apr and wasn't concerned about rewards or alternately if i did want rewards either in cash or miles other is it worth signing up for the rewards program on my amex corporate green card which equates to the the same rewards as a gold card or is the starwood card better advantages disadvantages the basic difference between amex and other credit cards is that amex has no limit but you have to pay it off when the bill comes mastercard and visa have limits but you can carry a balance past month i have no personal experience with the starwood card so i can't comment on it i use the discover card for paying gas cash back a chase visa for grocery pharmacy purchases back and a chase mc for everything else back beware that if you do carry a balance these reward cards have high interest rates so you need to be sure to pay them off every month or the rewards won't come close to making up for the finance charges check out the site below to compare cards being offered now and pick whichever cards work best for you Credit card Debit card Octopus card Poker jargon Surveillance MasterCard Bank Loyalty program Betting (poker) Blackjack Wal-Mart Life insurance Sears Holdings Corporation The Amazing Race Inflation Money Credit score Arbitrage Predatory lending VISA (credit card) Internet fraud Cheque Gambling Discover Card Payday loan Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Explosive material Automatic teller machine Interest Corporate finance Mutual fund Money supply Electronic commerce Finance FairTax Bank fraud Consensus decision-making Bank of America Student loan Free trade Mortgage Tax Euro Pension Let's Make a Deal United Kingdom corporation tax Drug test Security (finance) Slot machine E-ZPass H-1B visa Redundant array of independent disks Frequent flyer program Smart card Citigroup PE ratio Baccarat The Contender (television series) Short selling MMORPG Craps Personal finance Draw poker Value added tax Derivative (finance) Supermarket Filling station Refinancing Gold standard Deflation (economics) Annuity Economics RFID Affirmative action Financial audit Gross domestic product ATI Technologies Walt Disney World Resort Passport Modern portfolio theory Primerica Financial Services IBM PC compatible Driver's license Hearts (game) 401(k) Target Corporation Immigration to the United States Skype
