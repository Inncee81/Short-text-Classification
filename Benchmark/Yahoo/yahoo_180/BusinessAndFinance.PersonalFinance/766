what are some smart effective ways to save money i put my cents worth in another question just asked it applies here also so here it is money will go a whole lot farther if you live off of a written budget and then have the discipline to stick with it each month before getting paid my wife and i decide how much we want to spend on each category when we have spent that much we are done eating out or whatever that keeps you from continually saying it's only another which adds up to hundreds throughout the month an excellent idea for grocery shopping is to plan out all of your meals for the next week or write down what you need for those meals and then only purchase items on your list many people get to the grocery store and buy everything that sounds good which adds up and much of it goes to waste stick with what you plan to purchase savings should be set out in your budget also i used to put whatever was left over at the end of the month in savings which meant i was putting nothing in savings because i spent everything i brought home with a budget i decide how much to put in savings prior to getting paid then i transfer the money as soon as i get paid without having to worry about it later the key is telling your money where to go before you get paid without a plan that you stick to you will end up wondering where all of your money went and why you have nothing to show for it Wal-Mart Warren Buffett Gross domestic product Hyperinflation Microeconomics FairTax Therion (band) Keynesian economics Inflation Wheel of Fortune Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Personal finance Risk management Bulk vending Electronic commerce $ale of the Century Let's Make a Deal Animal Crossing Wealth Money The Apprentice 2 Supermarket Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Economy of Russia EastEnders Supply-side economics Internet fraud Poker jargon Extreme Programming Make money fast Fiddler on the Roof Hiberno-English Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Avenue Q Enron Corporation The Inside Deficit spending Red Hot Chili Peppers Jean Schmidt Publicly funded medicine Paul Martin Boom Town (Doctor Who) The Apprentice 3 The Joker's Wild UK Singles Chart Octopus card United Kingdom corporation tax Baseball Stars Fasting Craps Live 8 CPU cache Economics Opportunity cost Knots Landing Ocean's Twelve History of the United States (1918-1945) Tesco Blood on the Tracks Food Stamp Program Neighbours Supply and demand Military unrest since the Fiji coup of 2000 Chopsticks Surveillance Social rule Bond Hurricane preparedness for New Orleans Capital accumulation Argos (retailer) Inventory Sam Walton Ethical consumerism Le Malade imaginaire Theory of conduct She Loves You Futurama (TV series - season 5) SCO-Linux controversies Religious Society of Friends Confidence trick Oil-for-Food Programme RuneScape economy Say's law Neopets Heinkel He 100 U.S. public debt 1995 Quebec referendum Married... with Children National Kidney Foundation Singapore Paul Hackett Anarchism and capitalism Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?
