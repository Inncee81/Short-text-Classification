what is the best way to start i've never filled taxes owned a credit card or anything i've always used cash i want to be in good standing with these things seeing as i have no status with it how do i start i'm thinking about hiring a financial advisor and tax agent or something to start this process of building my credit history but i don't think i have the money for that rigth now but i know i have to file taxes this year since i'm also starting my first job i don't want to end up like these people in debt and living paycheck to paycheck i also want to start a roth ira i'm young but i want to be secure can anyone point me in the right direction with these things taxes credit saving retirement this is what i want to get in order any advise good question as you will need some financial visibility i am assuming you have a social security number it will also help if you have an existing bank account if not you can ride on your parent's bank you can start with looking for a bank or credit union in your area that offer what is called a secured credit card this means that you give the bank some money say which they will put aside on a term investment e g a time deposit or a bank certificate this will be used by the bank as collateral on your credit card and this will be your credit limit using this secured credit card purchase items that are affordable and be sure to pay off the balance every month i suggest getting items that will ensure a monthly bill like a cellphone this will ensure that your name is on a credit database with a retailer that reports to your local credit union like your credit card pay the bills on time use your credit card and pay it off every month keep within your limit most banks will have on line banking and you can use this to track your purchases as well as your remaining credit do not max out and do not purchase what you cannot afford ideally buy things for which you already have the money but instead of using cash use the card and then in the evening use the cash to pay the card off the nice thing about credit cards is you can pay bit by bit within the month until the balance is paid off before due date too many people wait for the bill don't wait for the bill when you buy pay off secured credit cards are usually given a limit of year after the year is over the bank may give you the option of removing the security and subject to approval turn it into a non secured card by this time your security deposit will have also grown a bit mistakes people make do not start with mall cards interest is too high no on line payment facility apply to all the credit card companies you can find of these companies assume you have existing credit and will check with the credit bureaus if you have insufficient credit for their requirements they will deny you this is recorded in the bureau the more denials you have the lower your score gets so if you are starting out you may just have zeroed yourself out more talk to your bank or credit union about secured cards they will be happy to help you most financial institutions offer secured cards to help your credit along make your payments automatic if you have bills have them autodebited at your bank that way you never miss a payment now since you are starting a job you will be getting a paycheck if this is a permanent position arrange with your accounting department to have a portion of your paycheck contributed to a retirement plan if your company does not have one open one with your bank make small contributions regularly like or every paycheck this will increase the number of financial vehicles you own and will help improve your credit score depending on what you get usually this will also save you some taxes if you have some money left over set it aside in a second bank account for emergencies or future investments in summary start of by getting a secured card and paying it off getting monthly bills and paying them off increasing the number of investment vehicles and what you put in them making automatic payments and contributions good luck Life insurance Mortgage Money supply United Kingdom corporation tax Constitution of the Turkish
