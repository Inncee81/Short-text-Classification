need mortgage fico score advise my husband and i are getting ready to apply for a mortgage i checked our fico scores his is mine is should we apply together or should he apply by himself since his score is better also i've heard that if i apply for a mortgage with a number of companies over a two week period it would count as one application do you know if it is true or if each application will bring our scores down thank you both of your scores are excellent but the deciding factor on whether to apply together or separately depends on the type of loan you're looking for banks take the lowest credit score of the two and a difference in points could represent a higher or lower interest rate if you're basing your loan on scores and not income your best option would be to apply using him on the mortgage and title and you on title only that way you're ensured you have a claim on the property and not only him inquire thru mortgage bankers because they might give you more options give yourself a window of days for the credit hits and ask your morgage consultant to disclose everything before you commit to any loan program ask questions are they offering interest only or principal and interest is it a fixed rate for the duration of the loan or will it adjust is there a pre payment penalty involved the so called no closing cost loans charge the closing costs in the rate hidden no one works for free and this is not always the best route weigh all options carefully since it's a very important desicion that will affect or more years of your life best of luck Student loan Credit score Life insurance Bond Islamic banking Interest Bank Mortgage-backed security Annuity Insurance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Primerica Financial Services 401(k) United Kingdom corporation tax Microcredit Security (finance) Monetary policy Corporate finance Deflation (economics) FairTax Annual percentage rate Debt Certificate of deposit Gold standard Citigroup Federal National Mortgage Association Collateralized mortgage obligation Education in the United States Refinancing Predatory lending Appeal Mutual fund Personal finance Savings and loan association Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Allodial title Government National Mortgage Association Economy of Russia Bretton Woods system Flat tax Construction Title insurance Education in the People's Republic of China Money Unemployment benefit Interest rate Islamic economics Microeconomics Bank fraud Call centre Arbitrage Federal Reserve ELO rating system Municipal bond Subsidy Expert system Concurrent estate Toronto-Dominion Bank Derivative (finance) Economic inequality Virtual memory Credit rating agency World Bank Group Normal distribution Betting (poker) Inflation Schabir Shaik Trial 2005 United States Grand Prix GED History of the United States (1918-1945) Welding Compiler optimization NASDAQ Economy of the United States Prostate cancer Grade (education) Free trade Labour economics Yield curve Payday loan Central bank Real estate bubble Redundant array of independent disks Donald Trump Consumer finance Variable universal life insurance Tax Securitization
