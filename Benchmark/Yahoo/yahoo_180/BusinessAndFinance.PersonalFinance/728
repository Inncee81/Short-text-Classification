will a bank cash a check for you if you owe them money i only have an account with one bank i pay everything on time so that isn't my problem however just like anyone else sooner or later down the road you run into some financial difficulties and i was forced to borrow money from the bank it was about that i owe them however i have a check that i need to cash for other things i need it right now the bank i can pay by the end of the month without a problem but could they refuse to cash it if it is a check drawn on someone else's account go to their bank to cash it if you are not behind on what you owe the bank then they will cash it for you if you are delinquent on what you owe them they may not but i don't see how they can legallly not cash it any loans you have with them should be completely separate from your checking savings accounts and without your permission to draw from your checking to pay on the loan then they should not be linked just due to the fact they are at the same institution if they could simply take your money to cover the loan they could pull it directly from your account and they can not do this Credit card Mortgage Cheque Bank Money supply Monetary policy Finance Mergers and acquisitions Student loan Insurance Hyperinflation Money Bank fraud Interest Bond Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Security (finance) Inflation Charles Ponzi FairTax Deflation (economics) Financial markets Money creation Short selling Savings and loan association Life insurance Derivative (finance) Schabir Shaik Trial Government debt Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Gold standard Internet fraud Central bank Yield curve Betting (poker) Child support U.S. public debt Economy of Russia Credit union Automatic teller machine Annuity Mutual fund Citigroup Islamic banking Wall Street Corporate finance Reserve Bank of New Zealand Great Depression Islamic economics Enron Corporation Usury Liability Lender of last resort Year 2000 problem Fiat money Stock Money laundering Financial services Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Bank of America Personal finance World Bank Group Privatization Prolog Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Margin (finance) Predatory lending Repurchase agreement Capital accumulation Federal Reserve The Amazing Race Payday loan Model (economics) Debit card Bretton Woods system Poker jargon Tithe Microcredit Johnny Cash Primerica Financial Services Social Security (United States) Federal National Mortgage Association History of post-Soviet Russia Variable universal life insurance Asian financial crisis Currency Advance fee fraud Hercules Linton SCO-Linux controversies Ulster Bank Corporation Arthur Laffer Mensal__o scandal Economy of the United States Economy of Africa Construction Mortgage-backed security Fractional-reserve banking
