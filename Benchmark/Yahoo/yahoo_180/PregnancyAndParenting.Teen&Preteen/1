year old girl pregnant my year old daughter announced she had been bringing a boy back to the house in the lunch times from school and having sex and now she thinks shes pregnant mortified is not the word as we have brought her up better then that anyway we told her we'd sort it got a pregnancy test and it's negative thank god what upsets me is after the first cry she doesn't seem to care or see it as a bad thing what do i do do you think she does care and is covering it up i feel like i don't know her at all yes she has afather living with her we've been married nearly twenty years and yes she knew about contreception why on earth would i have the morning after pill hanging round the house thats just an odd reply hi nicola thanks god she isn't pregnant u say and its true it is fantastic she isnt at this fragile age this can be a disaster i personally think that you handelled the situation pretty good but few good lessons are to be learnt yes u did deal with the situation well and it is very good that you kept your calm and u did not scare her she did deverve a good shake up to reality but that'a dif story by you keeping calm means she knows she has u to count on and to come to when she needs you but u i suppose just realised that do not know your daughter very well and you will need to try and have more one to one conversation try and tell her more about the risks she is taking by having unprotected sex it is a wake up call for you may be to keep a closer eye on what she is doing may be spend more valuable time interract more with her go shopping together girly pampering a movie and so on it would be a very good idea to go and speak to a specialist who can have a chat with her as it is always different when it comes from someone else rather than mum who's saying things naggs all the time but no one's hearing her it is common for the teens to behave this way it is an age thing its time to think of getting her into birth control she needs to be made realise that a mistake of this kind is enough to be made once and her life will completely change our responsability as parents is to explain to our kids all aspects acording to age but at the end of the day the choice is theirs the education is for us to give even before school does it i feel that nobody is responsible for my child's education but me as a parent and based on this if something like this situation occures at least we do not beat ourselves up that we did not do what we were supposed to do at the right time we do get sometimes too busy with work and other stuff but our priority is one kids i would just go and speak with the boy's parents so they also save their boy from making a disastruos situation that they just narrowly escaped and also speak to the school and find out y is it that she's taking time off without anybody notifying you as a parent this way they both know they are watched last but not least be strict and set up rules together with your husband so she knows who the boss is About a Boy EastEnders Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pitaten Friends Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Miss Saigon Theory of conduct Kodocha Milton H.
