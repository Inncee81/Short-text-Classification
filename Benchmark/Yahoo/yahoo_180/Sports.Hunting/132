so what about taking apart a bolt i want to take apart the bolt on my mossberg is there a site that shows how what tools would i need well i know they say if its not broke dont fix it but i just wanna try for the experience and to say that i have i also want to try the trigger assembly next though this all probably voids the warranty since im not certified no major tools of any sort simple steel punches and a hammer a couple of nails would probably work though the locking lug pin can be a bitch there's only four main parts to that bolt the firing pin the bolt body the locking lug and the two extractors that main pin that goes crosswise holds the locking lug the square steel thingy in the middle of the bolt it's what locks into the barrel when you place the weapon in battery and it's not really meant to come out there's no reason why you'd ever take it out towards the back there's a tiny top to bottom pin that holds the firing pin in place pop that pin out pop out the firing pin and the firing pin spring pops out in your hand only take that out to change a broken firing pin it can be tough to get back in the spring the extractors have tiny pins on either side of the locking lug pop those out to change broken extractors not too tough to reinstall just takes one more hand than you always seem to have what part do you need to replace surely you're not just stripping it down for the fun of it Revolver Internal ballistics Krag-J__rgensen Heckler & Koch G3 Machine gun Drill bit M16 (rifle) Pump-action Steyr Mannlicher M1894 Cartridge (firearms) AK-47 Screw Lee-Enfield Professional wrestling holds Steyr Mannlicher M1901 Kammerlader CQBR Recoil operation Shotgun Lathe Airsoft Firearm action Paintball marker Mauser GLOCK Knife Saiga-12 Semi-automatic self-loading pistol Suplex Martini-Henry Rigging Handloading M1911 Wire wrap Lock picking M2 machine gun AK-74 Wrench Shawn Michaels M-209 Reamer SA80 Heckler & Koch USP Drill M249 Krag-Petersson Clinker (boat building) Naval mine Browning Hi-Power Blacksmith Bicycle frame Toyota Prius Pinball Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Firearm Winchester Model 70 Makarov PM Upholstery Rail tracks Seismic retrofit M4 Carbine M60 machine gun Ratchet & Clank: Going Commando Powerbomb Novelty (locomotive) Professional wrestling attacks Heckler & Koch G36 Terminal ballistics M242 Browning Model 1919 machine gun U.S. Marine Corps Squad Advanced Marksman Rifle Speedloader Kurt Angle Guitar Jarmann M1884 Heckler & Koch MP5 Hand grenade Professional wrestling slang Accuracy International AWM Geodesic dome Bofors 40 mm gun Floyd Rose Bubble Bobble Climbing equipment Unreal Tire Beretta 92F/FS Final Fantasy magic M82 (rifle) Mattress Ammunition Glossary of climbing terms
