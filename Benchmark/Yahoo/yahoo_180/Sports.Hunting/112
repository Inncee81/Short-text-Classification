shot gun for a women what would be a good shotgun for a women for just general shooting i am wanting a pump shotgun i know you have said you want a pump but shotgun recoil is excessive you haven't said what your body size is or the body size of the woman this shotgun is going to be for so i am going to recommend a lighter kicking shotgun a semi auto shotgun will absorb much of the recoil of the round you will need a good recoil pad from limbsaver and possibly something to cushion the top of the comb against the cheek also most women's collar bones are angled differently than men's and the normal cant to the stock does not fit well on a women's shoulder you can find stocks that can be fitted to a shotgun that are adjustable for cant drop comb height and so on that will fit her better if you want her to be truly happy shooting a shotgun consider these options have her go to a skeet and trap range with you or go yourself if you are the woman it is for and ask to try out some guns my wife tried an gauge and end up sorely bruised i warned her she pulled it in tight and still after rounds god i love her was severly bruised heavier guns will lessen recoil get a good recoil pad and consider a semi auto as it will reduce recoil gauge is a lighter round but in a light gun it can kick almost as badly as gauge you can get a gauge but make sure the gun is not light Shotgun M16 (rifle) Firearm Equine conformation Trap shooting Rifle Shotgun shell .22 Long Rifle Remington 870 M4 Carbine Cannon Gauge (bore diameter) Saiga-12 Artillery SOCOM II: U.S. Navy SEALs Franchi SPAS-12 Air gun Weight training Double-barreled shotgun Bicycle Breastfeeding Skeet shooting Suppressor Cartridge (firearms) Columbine High School massacre ISSF shooting events Trench warfare Archery M60 machine gun Armored Core Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Terminal ballistics Heckler & Koch G3 Diving Table saw Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Revolver M82 (rifle) Semi-automatic self-loading pistol Mouse (computing) Benelli M4 Super 90 Cowboy action shooting Long gun Rail terminology Marathon (computer game) Professional wrestling throws Upholstery Boxing Ammunition Body piercing Bong Corset Team Fortress Classic Handloading Recoilless rifle Beretta 92F/FS Sniper Thermal power station Day of Defeat Airsoft .357 SIG Combine (Half-Life 2) The Suffering (game) Coupling (railway) Brassiere Swingout Stryker Carburetor Railgun Lee-Enfield Donald Neilson Anchor Lewis Gun Glossary of American football GunZ The Duel Tank Siphon Recoil operation Strap-on dildo Spark plug FN FAL NASCAR Panzer I Mixed martial arts Bicycle frame Professional wrestling holds Manhunt (video game)
