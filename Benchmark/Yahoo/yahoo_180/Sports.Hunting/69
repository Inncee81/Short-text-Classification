why all the debate over what guns are better yes i know i love them too and can spend hours looking over the fine points of this or that but it seems that many of the questioners are more obsessed by a specific thing than the ability to shoot at something every and i mean every firearm i have owned has worked flawlessly not always as accuratly as i would prefer but certainly as well as to be expected so when someone asks what is the best this or the best that i have to wonder unless you need a very specific thing the main thing is how well you shoot it any gun in well practiced hands is deadly any round can kill the real question is back to basics can you put it in the ring when you need to anyone agree i think you make an excellent point i also think people on here don't want to research and decide for themselves they just want an answer that sums it all up so many guns and so many rounds along with all the countless options make for a lot of variables and therefore a lot of questions i think its the american way bigger means better etc what we are going to end up with is a bunch of tank owners shooting paper targets at yards Archery Ammunition Gun politics Columbine High School massacre Firearm Social rule Cartridge (firearms) Gun politics in the United States Bowling for Columbine Theory of conduct Sin City Shotgun Microeconomics Terminal ballistics Beltway sniper attacks Sexual orientation M16 (rifle) Heinkel He 112 Quake III Arena Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Gun control in the United States (by state) Terran (StarCraft) Paintball Knots Landing Handloading America's Army Krag-J__rgensen Tri-Stat dX EastEnders Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Tank Current teachings of Prem Rawat Sniper Gun safety Poker jargon Bad Wolf Counter-Strike The nature of God in Western theology Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Inside YuYu Hakusho M60 machine gun Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Battle of the Bulge Tag Economics T-72 American football strategy Second Amendment to the United States Constitution Machine gun Objective-C God Emperor of Dune Gunsmith Cats Transformation problem GLOCK Economic inequality Jennifer Lopez Bullet Escape from New York Carbine ALGOL 68 Betting (poker) Global Liberation Army American Psycho U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Surplus value Concealed carry (USA) Avenue Q 88 mm gun Armoured warfare The Amber Spyglass Contract Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold Prices of production Species The Apprentice 2 Science Epistemology Syphon Filter Time Out of Mind Cannon Software engineering Craps Human Normal distribution Gun barrel John Lott Seventh Sea (collectible card game) BZFlag Mathematics Taxi Driver M242 Grand Theft Auto (game) Fahrenheit 9/11 Extreme Championship Wrestling Friends The Usual Suspects Internal ballistics
