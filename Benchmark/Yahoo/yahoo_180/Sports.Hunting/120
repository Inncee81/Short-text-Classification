can you hunt coyote year round in minnesota and what is the supplies i will need for an all day hunting trip also will a rim fire automatic work for coyotes its actually a semi auto srry yes i believe you can hunt coyotes year round most states consider them pests and varmints so its open season if you are hutning all day rember to move at least a mile about every hour because once a coyote knows you are there you probly wont see one if you move you increase your chances of seeing shooting one because the ones in that area might not have heard previous calls and wont know what it is and will be curious for an all day trip you obviously need food and water and possibly bait if you can bait coyotes i suggest you wear full camo coyotes are very keen and can see a flick of a finger from yards and know somethings wrong and they will turn tail and flee if you hear a bunch of noise like birds and squirrels going crazy dont move theres a predator around it could be a coyote or bobcat or something else but if its there it can more than likely see you even if you dont think it can if you do see one try not to move at all but if you have to to say raise your gun do it as slow as possible id advise a decoy like a rabbit on a stick or other decoys you can get at about any outdoor store a dog will work too i take my dog and tie him up about yards away coyotes are very territorial and if they see another dog or coyote they will forget anything and cahse it off while its busy watching the decoy dog whatever you shoot it make sure the coyote doenst run full boar after the dog i ahd that happen adn it ruined my hunt'i had to chase off the coyote from chasing my dog my dog is prefectly capable of killing a coyote hes done it twice but him being tied up would have beena mess for him me and the coyote i would not use a no matter what type of action i shot a coyote at about yards with a lr and it ricocheted off its head it shook and ran off if you have a centerfire rifle use it i use a for coyote hunting and if need be i can hit one in the vitals at yards a lr might be good to yards but you are lucky if you get them into yards you can also use a shotgun with slugs they kill coyotes with ease remember shotguns arent as accurate and they are limited to around yards best guns for coyotes anything in that area or you could go bigger to say a with a littler bullet by the way watch the rabid ones they dont like humans i found out last year he ran at me but my shotgun slug met him halfway he died good luck Shotgun Rifle Firearm Internal ballistics .22 Long Rifle Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Fox hunting Varmint rifle Coyote Poker jargon Dog Characters of Lost Ammunition Hunting USS Trigger (SS-237) Bullet M16 (rifle) Archery Trench warfare Cat Kevin and Kell Unreal Cartridge (firearms) Terminal ballistics Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Sniper The Invisibles USS Tunny (SS-282) Carbine The Inside Shotgun shell Tag Turok: Rage Wars Airsoft GunZ The Duel Revolver Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Escape from New York USS Sea Dog (SS-401) Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening RuneScape quests Reservoir Dogs Blood (computer game) Captain Thunderbolt Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels Battles of Lexington and Concord Donald Neilson Team Fortress Classic Wyatt Earp Shaggy dog story Rabies Metal Slug Wile E.
