how does the gap compare to the acp the glock automatic pistol round was created to duplicate the performance of the acp in a mm pistol platform in other words a for smaller hands the gap is a higher pressure round than the acp it has to be to catch up to the acp some people believe it is actually a better stopper but that remains to be seen ballistically at least on paper they do compare favorably but the gap is harder to find it is more expensive only a few companies load it it doesn't interchange with the acp if you've got one cool if you have money to burn you might want to buy one of each and compare for yourself otherwise i'd stick with the acp unless i wanted something more powerful then i'd go with the mm or sig best h GLOCK .45 ACP .45 GAP Semi-automatic self-loading pistol Terminal ballistics 10 mm Auto Internal ballistics M1911 .357 SIG Carbine Firearm Jericho 941 Smith & Wesson Machine gun Pistol Wildcat cartridge Suppressor Submachine gun Airsoft Concealed carry (USA) Heckler & Koch USP Cartridge (firearms) Revolver Assault rifle Heckler & Koch MP5 Derringer Shotgun Bullet Rifle Poker jargon Colt Single Action Army handgun U.S. Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance Browning Hi-Power Makarov PM 401(k) Fountain pen Floppy disk M4 Carbine M16 (rifle) .22 Long Rifle Springfield 1903 rifle Punisher Thermal power station Hard disk Spark plug SOCOM II: U.S. Navy SEALs .40 S&W Webley-Fosbery Automatic Revolver Counter-Strike 5.56 x 45 mm NATO HK P7 Krag-J__rgensen Thompson submachine gun John Browning Carburetor M60 machine gun Five-seveN London Underground Heckler & Koch G3 Shotgun shell Bluetooth Blackjack Transformer Air gun Welrod Steyr Mannlicher M1894 Speedloader Hydrogen economy MAC-10 Webley and Scott Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory M1 Carbine Bulletproof vest IBM PC compatible Bulk vending Mutual fund Computer virus Welding Tank Drill bit Uzi submachine gun Parachute Metal Slug Battlefield 2 Game controller .30 Carbine Personal weapon Nambu pistol Rolling-element bearing Fuel injection Half-Life: Opposing Force Overclocking Abortion Automatic teller machine JPEG Money .38 Super Walther PPK Grand Theft Auto (game)
