has anyone hunted bear whats it like i've hunted black and brown bears for many years in central and northern canada i'm from maryland the group i go with hunts with bows and arrows as well as firearms modern rifles and black powder in canada the majority of hunters hunt over garbage piles that include renderings from meat processing plants animal organs fat bones stale bread regular household garbage the garbage is thrown onto the ground in a pile and then flattened cardboard boxes are laid down on top to cover the piles of garbage the guides usually have a number of these piles that they check on a regular basis to see if any bears have been eating the garbage the bears knock the cardboard off the tops of these piles to get to the stuff underneath it stinks pretty bad and the flies are horrible but it works all of the time we usually hunt from tree stands above these gut piles and wait for the bears to come into the baits to feed usually late afternoon bears have excellent hearing and sense of smell so you must be quiet and limit your movement in the tree stand bears are amazing creatures because they can run through the thickest brush you can imagine and not make a noise if it wasn't for their size and color it would be difficult to spot them i've had many experiences where i heard and saw nothing only to suddenly look up and a bear is there and only ' away on the bait pile you have to take your time and make the best shot possible bears are hundreds of pounds of freight train moving muscle and you have to hit them well to put them down quickly or be ready for a real hike trying to find it once wounded it's a real adrenneline rush to climb down from your stand to ground level knowing you are about to go looking for these creatures with big teeth and the obvious danger that you face just being there i have killed to date the biggest was a lb grizzley in british columbia in and i shot him with a smith wesson model magnum barrel handgun at yards away i remember that trip like it was yesterday just to let you know bear meat is quite good actually you must trime off all of the fat and slow cook it but it's delicious and i've eaten it many times still have some in my freezer here at home if you get the chance to go bear hunting go you will never forget the experience or the rush Internal ballistics Shotgun American Black Bear Terminal ballistics Gray Wolf Archery Poker jargon Sin City Punisher Mario series enemies Firearm Teen Girl Squad The Legend of Zelda series enemies .44 Magnum Blood (computer game) RuneScape skills Rifle Mountaineering RuneScape quests Combine (Half-Life 2) Equine conformation Tank Tag Comanche Revolver Dog English longbow Richard Chase Compost Happy Tree Friends Jackass: The Movie American Bison Tobacco Shotgun shell Battle of Gettysburg, Second Day Cleveland Browns Battleship 2000 Australian Grand Prix Trapping .22 Long Rifle Mach kernel Escape from New York Krag-J__rgensen Columbine High School massacre 1957 World Series Conker's Bad Fur Day Naruto jutsu Pistol One Piece minor characters Professional wrestling throws Horse Diseases of the honeybee Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Mixed martial arts Hamster Perfect Dark Vermicompost Professional wrestling slang Kakapo Ammunition Handloading New York Giants Lee-Enfield Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Unreal Battles of Lexington and Concord Drizzt Do'Urden Leopard Norway national football team Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Cuisine of Denmark P-38 Lightning Manhunt (video game) Trench warfare Guilty Gear Hey Jude Skunk Pittsburgh Steelers Syphon Filter M16 (rifle) Volleyball Piccolo Junior Saga Bread Kangaroo USS West Virginia (BB-48) Whaling Semi-automatic self-loading pistol RuneScape Random Events Pikmin Bow (weapon) Diablo II USS Tunny (SS-282)
