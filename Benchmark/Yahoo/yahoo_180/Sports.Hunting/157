hmr does anyone hunt coyotes with one whats the longest distance you have shot one i do hunt coyotes with the hmr and have killed thus far with this caliber the farthest i have ever killed one with it was around yds with a head shot using a grain bullet the rifle is very effective on body shots up to yds with the grain bullet but i wouldn't shoot one in the body much past that i have heard of people killing them with head shots up to yds but i personally think that distance is probably to far Sniper .22 Long Rifle Terminal ballistics Rimfire Rifle .17 HMR Shotgun Internal ballistics Carbine Suppressor John F.
