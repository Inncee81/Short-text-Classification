when shooting rifled deer slugs out of a smooth bore barrel should you use a choke if so what size full or do you just remove the choke altogether as a gunsmith you need to know that you can only shoot rifled slugs thru a modified or improved cylinder choke shotgun from your description you already made it clear that you have a choke on your barrel to be honest some slugs can cause barrel bulge as well as choke damage if fired thru a full choke too if your choke isn't adjustable for the modified or improved cylinder settings this is rarely the case i would avoid shooting slugs out of your adjustable choke gun all together if you wish to hunt with a full choke i reccomend you shoot sabot slugs thru your full choked gun these consist of a hardened lead or lead alloy slug that is molded inside a plastic piece sleeve as the projectile clears the muzzle of your shotgun barrel the plastic jacket sleeve falls away harmlessly and the smaller diameter projectile continues towards your intended target these are more expensive but at the same time they are more accurate than conventional rifled slugs and safer to shoot out of full choked shotguns i have had many customers who literally shot the choke completely off of the end of their shotgun barrels trying to shoot conventional regular slugs thru improperly choked shotguns if this is still a concern consider using another shotgun in place of the shotgun you want to use now better safe than sorry Shotgun shell Bullet Internal ballistics Firearm Rifle M16 (rifle) Terminal ballistics Gun barrel Shotgun slug Mossberg 500 Sabot Gauge (bore diameter) Shell (projectile) Cartridge (firearms) Air gun Drill bit .22 Long Rifle Revolver Carbine Tank Artillery .44 Magnum Krag-J__rgensen Suppressor Jarmann M1884 Machine gun Assault rifle M60 machine gun Springfield 1903 rifle Kinetic energy penetrator Double-barreled shotgun Gunsmith Sniper Combine (Half-Life 2) Cowboy action shooting Handloading Wildcat cartridge Sawn-off shotgun Bong Gun safety Stopping power 5.56 x 45 mm NATO Flintlock Combat shotgun Field Artillery in the American Civil War Lee-Enfield Long gun High explosive anti-tank Kammerlader Metal Slug AK-47 Railgun GunBound Quake III Arena Gramophone record Shooting sports Remington 870 ISSF shooting events Pellet Heckler & Koch G3 Saiga-12 M4 Carbine Trench warfare Doom enemies Caliber External ballistics Sniper rifle AK-74 Beretta 92F/FS Explosive material Paintball marker Rifling Directed-energy weapon Casting Fox hunting Team Fortress Classic Blood (computer game) Punisher Tank gun Carburetor M1 Carbine Jet Force Gemini Sturmgewehr 44 XM8 rifle Heckler & Koch USP Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Bofors 40 mm gun Blood II: The Chosen Gerald Bull Archery Advanced Combat Rifle Sten .45 ACP
