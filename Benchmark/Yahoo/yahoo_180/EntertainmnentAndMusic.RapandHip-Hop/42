what are your opinions on video girls i was just having a conversation with my friend and she said she felt sorry for the girls because they did it for money and exposure and most of the time they just end up being disrespected do they deserve the disrespect they recieve and also why is there such a double standard in hip hop between men and women when it comes to sex and promiscuity those who are promiscuous should either all be considered hoes or none of them should be i dont like it and im kinda tired of people talking about the it's all because of the rappers and they need to stop callin girl's bitch's and hoesz and what not that's half of the problem im really upset because these girl's they put themselves out there in those video's degrading themselves and there not helping at all they might as well call themselves hoez im so tired of it if i see another booty shakin im gonna go crazy Hip hop collaborations Aquemini Daz Dillinger True Crime: Streets of LA Hip hop music Hip hop rivalries Hip hop culture TLC Missy Elliott Namie Amuro Eminem Married... with Children Nas (rapper) Ol' Dirty Bastard Disc jockey The Notorious B.I.G.
