how can i get my boyfriend to open up with me ive been dating my bf for months now and i love him he's the most caring supportive kind person i have ever met we love just spending time with each other i've never known a guy who actually likes to cuddle with his girlfriend on the couch and no not naked anyway i've been open with him and he's been extremely supportive now i want him to be more open with me he told me that he had a rough life and he had to be strong and learned to suppress and completely bottle up his emotions he said he has never talked about his emotions with anyone before he doesnt remember the last time he cried he said he wants to be open with me he just doesnt kniw how when he tries he gets uncomfortable and fidgety and just cant say what he wants how can i help him its unhealthy to bottle up your emotions let alone your entire life ask him why he feels so unsure telling people he must really feel comfortable since he wants to tell you tell him that you will still love him no matter what he tells you and that he can tell you anything tell him that whatever he went throuht he is still an incredible person and you don't want him to feel like what he say will make him seem not as appealing give him some time it won't happen all at once but if he knows he can trust you he will begin to open up best wishes and good luck Social rule Friends About a Boy The Smoking Room The Amber Spyglass Emotions (album) One Tree Hill (TV series) Theory of conduct Transactional analysis Love Pitaten Galaxy Angel Little Britain The Ashlee Simpson Show Humphrey Bogart Kim Possible Kodocha She Loves You Jon Secada Undergrads Knots Landing Polyamory Avenue Q Strap-on dildo Ex-gay Maison Ikkoku Scenes from a Memory The Shining (film) Inception of Darwin's theory Storytelling St. Elmo's Fire (film) EastEnders Futurama (TV series - season 2) Atomic Kitten Friendship Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The Catcher in the Rye Sex and the City Grief Breastfeeding Phoebe Halliwell Something Positive Everwood Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dead Like Me The Marshall Mathers LP Love Hina main characters The Giver Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Piccolo Junior Saga Futurama (TV series - season 5) As Good as It Gets Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist W.I.T.C.H.
