sometimes i want to get anorexic i just don't know why i look at my stomach pouch and i want to just stop eating welcome to being a teenage girl i used to think the same thing sometimes but then the actual thought of not eating very much got old really quickly it may seem like the best solution in theory but if you do cut back too much the tiredness and grumpiness is just not worth it also did you know that scientists are discovering that true anorexics have some different sort of biological things going on than a normal person they respond differently to starvation than we would on a biochemical level so unless you are wired to be inclinded that way trying to be anorexic just won't work as your natural instincts will kick in i have found that when i feel the way you are feeling if i increase my exercise i feel better it gets my good hormones flowing and the added muscle tone makes me look better plus you can be proud that you are doing something that is helping your body instead of hurting it good luck Insulin Prostate cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Androgen insensitivity syndrome Autism Scientology beliefs and practices Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Urinary incontinence Clinical depression Stuttering Puberty Transactional analysis Stomach cancer Sexual differentiation EastEnders Fecal incontinence Hypoglycemia Protein Traumatic brain injury Theory of conduct RuneScape skills The Inside Aikido Omega-3 fatty acid Action potential Chronic fatigue syndrome Polycystic ovary syndrome Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Nutrition Social rule Breastfeeding Adjustable gastric band Testosterone Weight training Biology and sexual orientation Species Brain Diabetes mellitus Electrophysiology Aerial (dance move) Biology Inflation Infantilism Grumpy's Three Wishes Orgasm One Tree Hill (TV series) Shark Nicomachean Ethics K' Obesity Dieting Human height Transsexuality Water (molecule) Goodness and value theory Eye Altruism Milton H.
