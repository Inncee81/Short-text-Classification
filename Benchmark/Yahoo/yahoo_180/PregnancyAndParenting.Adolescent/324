has anyone experienced going to a co ed highschool and a single sex highschool which is better i heard single sex schools highschoool have better academics and students learn better there and more focus studies showed that girls and boys learn differently from eachother and learn better with the same gender teacher so whats better and dont say that go to a co ed school cuz u need to 'associate' with the opposite gender hello schools not the only place to socialize my husband was co ed through junior high and then transferred to an all boy's highschool he preferred the single sex school there was a girl's school nearby and the two schools worked together so that there was co ed interaction i'm pretty sure they bussed together dances etc the girl's even cheered at the football games i think that's the best of both worlds French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools High school Secondary education Education in the United States Education in Romania Transsexuality Homeschooling Hentai Girl Boston Public Caulfield Grammar School Education in Singapore Gender Sexual orientation Child sexuality Education in Malaysia Gender role Alfred Kinsey Community college Sex Graduate school Independent school (UK) Pedophilia Age of consent Secondary education in France College Anthropology Second language acquisition New Trier High School Tulane University Cross-dressing Transgender Sexual differentiation Sociology Bish__jo game David Reimer Human sexual behavior Farrington High School John Money Teen Girl Squad Sex and intelligence History of intersex surgery Trinity College (Connecticut) Education in Japan Infantilism Education in Taiwan Gender identity Reparative therapy The College of New Jersey Dog show Homophobia Feminism One Tree Hill (TV series) Sex assignment St. Joseph's College, Hong Kong Education Gender-neutral language Bilkent University Bah__'__ Faith and Education Gender of rearing Bisexuality Irish dance Lynbrook High School Mojave people Can't Hardly Wait Puberty Secondary education in Japan Ultimate (sport) Lowell High School (San Francisco) Childlove movement Professor University of Houston Sexual identity Music Melbourne High School Twin Sex and the City Esperanto as an international language Victoria School Asperger syndrome Glenbrook North High School Atomic Kitten Eton College Effeminacy Anglo-Chinese School Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Brown v.
