thoughts on young teens getting piercings my year old keeps talking to me about wanting to get her eyebrow pierced i have mixed feelings on it i personally think it is ugly but i have always encouraged her to be her own person and not worry about what others think she is a good kid gets great grades hates anything to do with alcohol gripes at me if i have one drink she has never been in trouble so if the worst thing she wants is to pierce her eyebrow should i stop her i was actually talking to my dad about this the other day and we both agreed that what is the point in perants getting upset about there teen having a percing i mean if it was a tatoo then maybe you could try and talk them out of it as they might regret it when they are older as it is there for life but with a percing they can just take it out when ever and the hole will heal up so it shouldnt really be a problam and at her age the brow percing will more likely grow out after a year or so as a few of my friends got theres done when they were that age and they just grew out Humphrey Bogart Knots Landing Franklin Pierce One Tree Hill (TV series) Body piercing Social rule Friends Nez Perc__ Earth Girl Arjuna Marilyn Monroe Kodocha Wallflower (comics) American Psycho About a Boy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sigmund Freud Rush Limbaugh The Smoking Room Shaggy dog story Moe Szyslak Recurring South Park characters Chief Joseph Michael Garibaldi Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Tattoo The Adventures of Pete & Pete The Human Stain The Catcher in the Rye Dead Like Me Kurt Cobain The Jim Rome Show Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Infantilism Mystique (comics) Virginia Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) Timmy Turner Breastfeeding The Contender (television series) YuYu Hakusho Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Pitaten Property and Environment Research Center Eddie Guerrero Garfield Scientology beliefs and practices Milton H.
