am i pregnant ladies only please okay this is the deal i had unprotected sex with my boyfriend but he didnt ejaculate inside me we had to stop because someone came in is it possible i could be pregnant i havent really had any sighns my period is suppose to happen next week do you think i should just wait before over reacting i wouldn't jump to conclusions just yet i mean there is a great possiblity that you could be because a man doesn't have to actually ejaculate for you to get pregnant they secrete sperm the entire time you are having sex so if you truly don't want a baby right now and you find out your not pregnant wrap it up next time or see your doctor about birth control as far as taking a pregnancy test for it to be most accurate you have to actually be late on your period so i would wait about a day or two after you've missed your period and then take one good luck either way Pregnancy Fertility awareness Prostate cancer Pornographic movie Menstrual cycle Oral sex Neighbours Friends Abortion debate Birth control Social rule Gonorrhoea Miscarriage Sexual intercourse EastEnders Infertility In vitro fertilisation Orgasm Safe sex Premature ejaculation Knots Landing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Prenatal diagnosis Jam (TV series) Obstetrics Sexual abstinence Androgen insensitivity syndrome Charmed Emergency contraception Sex and the City Puberty Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Humphrey Bogart Jon Secada Sexual reproduction Breastfeeding Niddah Condom Sharon Tate Abortion Maury Futurama (TV series - season 5) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Ejaculation Cytomegalovirus Characters of Lost Vernon Schillinger Ocean's Twelve Endometriosis Childbirth Drawn Together Gay slang Turner syndrome Psoriasis AIDS Sex education Strap-on dildo Big Brother UK series 6 Twin Masturbation History of sex Soap opera Spina bifida Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Coeliac disease Sterilization (surgical procedure) Stewie Griffin Semen The Sims 2 Breech birth Kodocha The Death Gate Cycle Piccolo Junior Saga The Children of Men The Inside Prolactinoma Crystal methamphetamine and sex Pregnancy fetishism Kurt Cobain Reservoir Dogs Penis Ben Johnson (athlete) Taken The Five Doctors Jennifer Lopez One Tree Hill (TV series) Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Premature birth Human sexual behavior Partial-birth abortion My Family (television) Boston Public Satanic ritual abuse Days of our Lives Roswell UFO incident Melanie Wilkes Survivor (novel)
