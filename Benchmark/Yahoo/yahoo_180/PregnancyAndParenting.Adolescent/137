a school guidance counselor i'm a junior in high school and i've been a little bit depressed lately one of my teachers noticed and she set up an appointment for me to go see the school guidance counselor i'm scared though cause i'm super super super shy and hate talking one on one i always freeze up and have no idea what to say to anything i'm one of those people who likes to keep everything to myself should i just not go if i do go what will the counselor do like what types of things will she ask me and talk to me about i'm so nervous used to be one most of us are sensitive to shy folks keep in mind at most schools if you can't get comfortable with the counselor you are assigned you can always go to another one a good one will give you the time to get to what is bothering you please try again with another if you don't succeed with the first one depression stinks it is pervasive and not unusual so keep in mind that it is normal talking things out may help you determine what is bothering you and allow you to deal with it most problems are soluble if you can get them out and take a look at them good luck Social rule School counselor FoxTrot Psychotherapy Autism Insomnia Milton H.
