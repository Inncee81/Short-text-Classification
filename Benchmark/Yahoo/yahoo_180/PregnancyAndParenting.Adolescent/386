why do year old girls have to be so mean i really dont get it they feel the need to diminish everyone elses self confidence and call them the b word etc any pyscologists out there why im not generalizing all yr old girls but i live in a very wealthy town think the beverly hills of another state so yeah everyone around here is they have issues up the wazoo i have a friend that lives in a town like yours in north carolina they have girls still in elementary school that come down on other girls about their hair where their clothes come from which town and or sub division they live in etc it's awful many of these girls are taught by their parents older sisters that because they have mega they don't have to follow the rules of society and that where you shop and live determine what type of person you are these girls are in for a rude awaking when they get into the real world and their boss could care less where they live or shop my advice is to never ever let them see that it bothers you they'll see this as a weakness and keep on and on at most girls are still trying to find out who they are and when these expectations are heaped on them they try to conform but it's not a good fit it could also be that their parents don't really care who their kid is on the inside where it counts they just care about appearences good luck and keep your chin up The Fairly OddParents Kyle Broflovski My Life as a Teenage Robot Timmy Turner Saved by the Bell Pitaten Gender role Humphrey Bogart The Critic The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Doug About a Boy One Tree Hill (TV series) Theory of conduct Teen Girl Squad Jon Secada The Devil Wears Prada John Howard Yoder The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland Religious Society of Friends W.I.T.C.H.
