help me understand my year old son he's a great kid and i love him very much it seems like in the last months he is only interested in his friends i'd be happy with minutes of conversation a day i understand that teens are supposed to be way more interested in their friends than their mom but i feel completely cut off its nothing personal teenagers just really enjoy freedom and want to go out and see what there is your son will settle down soon enough and want to spend time with you it just takes time to find the right balance i wouldn't personally attempt to engage your son through 'activities' as this can come across as patronizing even with the best intentions just be there for him and when things do go wrong you'll be appreciated i promise you if you weren't there he'd miss ya Shaggy dog story Infantilism Humphrey Bogart One Tree Hill (TV series) Kurt Cobain About a Boy The Catcher in the Rye Kodocha Adolescence Saved by the Bell Human sexual behavior Neighbours Nicomachean Ethics Hey Jude Friends Theory of conduct Happiness KaBlam!
