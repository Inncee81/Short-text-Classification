travel tips im and im flying by myself from san antonio to omaha i have a two hour layover in atlanta which is good in case my plane is late from san antonio and so i can find my gate and stuff im just kinda nervous becuase i have flown by myself before but that was when the airplane ppl helped me i mean if they ask they can help but not like im under there thumb my mom said after im not a minor so they wont help me i think i can do this by myself but im so nervous becuase i have never done something of this magnitude by myself before but im very organized and meticulous if anyone has some advice i would greatly appreciate it thanks so much i know exactly how you feel when i was i flew from houston to san diego by myself but the airline was there and they helped me since i was an 'unaccompanied minor' so things went well and i was fine then when i was i flew from houston to indianapolis by myself because i was over the airline didn't help me so i was on my own i was so nervous here's my advice to you go to the airport and have whoever is dropping you off come in with you and go up to the airline counter with you to check in your luggage ask them where to go say goodbye to your mom dad whoever then go through security then go straight to your gate and just sit in one of the seats until they start boarding your plane don't worry about getting on the wrong plan they scan your tickets and the airline people will make sure you are on the right flight bring a good book or a cards or something to do while you wait when you get to atlanta are you flying delta by any chance they always make everyone go through atlanta it's so dumb just go straight to the gate for your connecting flight and just wait there for your flight to take off don't worry about getting lost airports are good about having tons of signs and if you still can't figure out where you are going go up to any airline counter or gate counter and ask someone for directions to where you are going in my experience the airline people are always willing to help you out as long as you stay calm and don't get rude with them and while airport food tends to be a bit over priced it's usually not bad so if you get hungry during your layover pick up something just keep an eye on the time so that you make sure you are at your gate when they start boarding although they do make announcements but i sometimes find them hard to hear have fun in omaha and don't worry traveling by yourself isn't difficult i got all worried for nothing you'll be fine happy travels McCarran International Airport Airport Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport O'Hare International Airport John F.
