babysitting for hours from am to pm the kids i'll be watching are a year old girl thats into girly things and a year old boy thats into sports his video games and being all silly what are some things i can do with them to keep them both entertained the whole day i babysit my siblings a lot and they are always telling me how board they are i don't want these kids to get board then wreck the house like they have done before since i can not leave a messy house they get hyper easily so what do you do while babysitting for long periods of times any thing i should bring with me this is one of the first times watching kids other then my own siblings thanks yes i am getting paid and i am in nov i am the oldest of kids so i would say i am responsible enough know what i'm doing when it comes to babysitting and you don't have to be to babysit for longer periods of time i have known these kids since they were born for the boy if he is into sports i assume they have soccer balls basket balls exc then go outside and play that with him or do it inside but just use a nerf ball or something and if all else fails let him play his video games for the girl depending on what the family has in the house have her and maybe the boy help you bake cookies or something it could be cookies cupcakes or a cake if it is something dessert ey like that they will be more interested also you could just let the girl braid your hair or something like that if they like that since they get hyper easily then doing active things will be best such as making cookies playing sports stuff that involves using your hands and moving if they have kids that age they will more than likley have everything you will need and because they are older they will tell you what they want to do so just if they say i don't know then you will have to come up with something i hope i helped good luck Football (soccer) Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Game Nintendo Pitaten Cookie Volleyball Tag The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Aerial (dance move) Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Son Gohan Electrophysiology The Tracey Ullman Show shorts Electronic Arts Vegeta FoxTrot Westminster School Sesame Street About a Boy Recess (TV series) Fast bowling IGN Hun-Apu Wario Donald Rumsfeld Kodocha Cricket The Adventures of Pete & Pete Lacrosse Hey You, Pikachu!
