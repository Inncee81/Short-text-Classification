my year old sister is having a baby is this too young or too old in your opinion personally i think it's too young she has no job hardly no money and im worried for her she's going to be soon but still i can't believe this she was going to start like a part time job to do something with her life now she's toast right to the first commenter i dont appreciate you calling my sister that she thought she was protected she didn't do it on purpose either well yea i also think its a little too young but at least she's an adult its better than being a pregnant year old but she'll really need ur support now to help her out like she may need you to babysit for her occassionally so be there for her always she should definitely get a job its a shame now that she probably won't get to finish college but she should definitely get a job especially if she's not married her husband boyfriend should also get a job or a college education so they can afford to raise this baby EastEnders Knots Landing Phoebe Halliwell Baby Blues Neighbours Friends Avenue Q Kodocha Stewie Griffin Charmed Freeters Infantilism One Tree Hill (TV series) Amy Dumas Patrick Star Alois Hitler Rais massacre Paige Matthews Something Positive Joy (novel) Lex Luthor One Life to Live Abortion debate For Better or For Worse Past characters (Neighbours) Sex and the City Pregnancy Heartbeat (television) Honey and Clover History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Affirmative action Hillary Rodham Clinton Ocean's Twelve Roe v.
