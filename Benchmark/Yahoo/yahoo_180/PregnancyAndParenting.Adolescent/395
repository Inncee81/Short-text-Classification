watching porn at ok so im now but have been watching porn since i was i know that is waaaay to early but eh u cant change the past my dad found out when i was and wasnt to pleased to put it very nicely lol so im a lot more careful lol since its gay porn and if my dad found out i would end up with a back hand across the face but any way is this bad like i mean i know its bad but how bad i think im addicted is there a way i can become not addicted thanks for the help and yes i know porn isnt like real life and its morally wrong etc etc but eh at least im not having sex right wow this is tough well you're right you can't change the past but you are in control of your future you make the decisions for good or ill what do you want to do you think you're addicted so that should tell you something right there this might be difficult to think about but what if you were the adult and it was your child you yourself said you know you saw it at too early an age it's a pretty easily accessible thing after all but again you make your choices in life i know this may sound creepy and maybe because it is but it's almost like allowing yourself to be molested you know sex and children just don't go together you've cheated yourself out of a small part of your childhood it will be difficult but you should stop now before you find yourself lost and obsessed don't you want a better life for yourself sex will always be there but your youth won't spend your time more constructively you watch porn i bet partly because it's just so darn easy it's just there how can you not watch it and you've been doing it for so long it's become a regular part of your life you said you're now do you still want to be sitting in front of a screen at keep in mind that a lot of porn is portrayed in a very abusive way it's sick sex isn't don't warp your view stop wasting your time your youth you'll be very happy you did i promise there's more to life i really hope this helps Theory of conduct Pornography Avenue Q Social rule Shaggy dog story Sexual orientation Poker jargon Child pornography Male prostitute Friends Motion picture rating system Time Out of Mind Alcoholics Anonymous 2000 Australian Grand Prix Sexual abuse Procrastination John Holmes (actor) Pitaten Transsexuality Episodes of Lost (Season 1) About a Boy Humphrey Bogart Rocko's Modern Life EastEnders Pedophilia Boogie Nights Futurama (TV series - season 5) Kodocha Laura Schlessinger Sexual addiction Boston Public Sex Pistols Childlove movement 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Nine Inch Nails Microeconomics Serial killer Pornographic movie Divorce Sento Daredevil Knots Landing Sex and the City The Fairly OddParents Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Craps Goodness and value theory Kurt Cobain Wonderland (McFly album) Child sexual abuse Textile manufacturing Larry Flynt Infantilism Sydney Riot of 1879 Sinfest Abortion debate The Ashlee Simpson Show Incarnations of Immortality Polyamory Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Child sexuality Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses B3ta Health insurance Great Teacher Onizuka Domestic violence Utilitarianism Internet pornography Recurring South Park characters Current teachings of Prem Rawat The Catcher in the Rye Boba Fett Alfred Kinsey Philip J.
