how would you tell your parents im only and just recently found out im pregnant my parents hate the father just because he has been in juvy befor he actully wants to be part of the kids life he want to suport us and make me happy he is soo exited to be a daddy he is also im sooo scared to tell my parents im scared they will kick me out i dont want to listin to them yell i dont know what to do i need to tell them my boy wants me to move in w him his sisters house because she wants to help us out and stuff she is really nice i dont know what to do im sooo scared please help me all the people i know that are young and have babies dont have dads have parents its scary what if the kick me out and i cant bring my stuff it would be best for my baby to have both parents in his or her life i wouldnt ever give my baby up for adoption or have an abortion and his sister is like she and her husband both work and make good money me and my boy have minimum wage jobs so we can help out selfs alot but his sister is the only family he has his mom died a couple years ago and his dad just ran out and left after that congratulations on your pregnancy i know this is a difficult time for you but it helps to remember children are a blessing and maybey everything happens for a reason i was when i got pregnant with my daughter and now i'm i have been through so many things that i would tell you about but i'm going to stick to answering your question if you are scared your parents will hurt you you should find an adult to come with you to tell them they will probally be upset and yell at you no matter what you say just try to be respectful try to understand that they are upset because your life is about to become a lot harder than it had to be and they just want what is best for you just tell them you are pregnant you are sorry for being careless but they can't change the fact that you are pregnant and have made the decision to keep your baby with or without their blessing they may kick you out but i'm sure by the time the baby is born they will want to be a part of your life again it is good that your man wants to stay by your side and i don't want to sound to negative but just remember that mothers are forever and dads are just dads if they feel like it that is the way it has always been in this society sad but true i hope you feel strong enough that you would do this by yourself because it just might end up that way good luck to you EastEnders Kodocha Knots Landing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Fairly OddParents Friends Pitaten Baby Blues Kyle Broflovski Infantilism Adoption Theory of conduct Days of our Lives Virginia Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) The McGuire Sisters One Tree Hill (TV series) Charmed Neighbours Everwood Cliff Richard Shaggy dog story Recurring South Park characters Rocko's Modern Life Divorce The Inside Alois Hitler History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Fathers' rights Grandview, U.S.A.
