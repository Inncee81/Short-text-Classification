is this weird or does it happen to a lot of people my parents have never talked to me about sex drugs smoking drinking anything it has been my personal choice not to smoke or drink or do drugs they smoke and i have asthma so i think it's disgusting but i have found out most things about sex and a lot of other things through my older brother and sister they have pretty much talked to me about most of the things your parents would normally lecture you about my brother is the one who told me santa wasn't real and he made me understand what death was i'm now and i don't get along with my parents because it's like impossible for me to feel comfortable talking to them about anything anyone else's parents never talk to them about all that stuff i think what bothers me the most about it is i was molested by my mom's father until i was about years old they never tried to talk to me about it or help me understand what had happened to me of course i'm fine now i just don't feel accepted by my parents they kind of ignore me my sympathy goes out to you i can't say i ever really talked that much about those things with my mom but it's not like we avoided it altogether either my advice to you is to always stay close with your brother and sister it seems like they really care about you and look out for you maybe they can be like your surrogate parents as for your mom i can't believe she wouldn't do anything about that i wouldn't care if it was my dad you don't ever put your hands on my child in that way i would fight to have him put in jail honestly sweetie i'm wondering if your mom never talked about it with you because he did it to her and she has never told anyone About a Boy Theory of conduct Humphrey Bogart 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Social rule Milton H.
