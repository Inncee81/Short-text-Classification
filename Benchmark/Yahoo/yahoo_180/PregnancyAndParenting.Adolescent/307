what can i do there's this gal that i like and have told her how i felt last year but she said she just wanna be friends however now i feel that some things have changed recently she showed more interests and especially today there were more conversations between us and often she asked me about things she seemed more interested she also teased me more but there's this guy who likes her too this guy's friend started it first by asking her and her friends to play bowling next week on the government election day i think they've been planning it so far he even teased her about me i think is to eliminate any suspicion of him trying to unite them should i be worried if they agree does it mean that she likes that guy this is the first time though and in my case i've hanged out with her together in groups a couple of times we're involved in more activities though when he asked her about that she seemed rather clueless she did not seem to really look for him though they re in different class and i doubt if she realized he was absent today what should i do it shattered my heart into pieces i'm planning to ask her friend about it should i do you and a million other boys are at the age where you notice a girl and the emotional merry go round takes over and we all had a first girl that we wanted in the worst way you are in school and there are a few priorities to tend to home school your future girls will always be around you hardly have time for a serious relationship neither does she or that other guy this is no big deal you all should be having fun when you do get a date relax and take it easy remember that guys and gals are different emotionally she will be attracted to all sorts of guys simply because she is ready for a love and wants to have thatexperience you do too and it is still her choice to decide on you or him if it is him so what she is free to choose you must always be the good sport if she picked you i imagine you would be real happy so don't push it in this other guys face both of you should be courteous and allow the winner to move on and have some dates with her she may not even be ready for a steady relationship who knows just be a nice guy you will not explode over this remember you have your priorities to see to good luck Friends Avenue Q The Ashlee Simpson Show Social rule Jon Secada Humphrey Bogart Cliff Richard Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Teen Girl Squad The Emancipation of Mimi About a Boy The Fairly OddParents Dead Like Me EastEnders Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Rod Stewart Sex and the City Pok__mon Live!
