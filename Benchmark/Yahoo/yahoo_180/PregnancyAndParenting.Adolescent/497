alot of problems ok i'm around or not going to give anyone my age my mom got a divorce when i was seven years old and since i was so young i took that very hard and honestly i'm still not over it so then my mom got a boy friend when i was about or and from the beginning i did not like him or trust him so after my dad left my mom was sober for a year then this guy comes and she starts drinking again and she moves him into our home my mom has kids including me i had only met him once before and my moms boyfriend made both my sisters move to my dads because they couldnt stand the way he acted then my brother moves out to live with my dad so there was on'y me and my one brother left to suffer so years past and they stated drinking more and more and one day he hits my mom after that my mom let him stay then he kept doing horrible things and my mom would still keep him there then they tried to quit drinking and he screws up again so my mom called the cops and they arrested him so i thought that all my misery was done and god was working in my life but then my mom starts to blame herself for everything that happened and lets this horrible man my moms boy friend back into our home to live there again and by that point i had become suicidal and i don''t wat to be that way so my question is what do i do to handle this and i do believe that her boy friend is the reason my life and family is totally torn apart and i try to talk to her every day and yesterday i even told my mom that i was suicidal and she only said i'm gonna take you to a doctors what am i suppose to think and i when i do tell her straight up how i truly feel she turns the whole thing around and makes me feel sorry for her and blames me is that a good mother i know i love my mom and i do want to live with her but how can you live in a house where you hate someone in it and you feel trapt everything is always about her boyfriend she tells me that we are all me my brother my mom and her bf going to be a family but i hate him i can't help but to cry when i see him and i feel like i'm nothing to my mom and i don't want to live with my dad my dad is always gone he is a work aholic and i every day of my life i feel like i belong no where i have no where to go or hide and i dont want to feel sorry for myself sounds tough first write a list of how your mom family used to be before this man came into your life every little detail emotional economic etc then write another one of how your mom family changed after this man came into your life show it to your mom and tell her that this man has not only been hurting her physically but has also been hurting her in every other way since he has torn her family apart tell her that you need her and that you need the family you had but that with that man it's not going to be possible due to the fact that you've witness how he has hurt your family so much i believe she needs profesional help maybe after her divorce she feels like no one will ever love her and that's why he's with this idiot because she fears she will never be loved i have a friend who is yes she was dating this guy at first their relationship was almost perfect but then he got really possessive and he started hitting her she's a pretty girl but she's not like one of those drop dead georgeous supermodels so he would constantly tell her that he would hit her because she didn't agree with him or because she would do things that weren't proper as if beating the crap out of her was anyways they came to my house he used to be my brother friend and they got in an argument and he hit her in my house so i got really mad and she was mad too i found out that he was telling her that she was ugly and no body would ever love her as much as he loved her and that if a guy ever dated her it would be because he wanted to have sex with her she had a really low self esteem but i talked to her and kind of helped her learn how to love herself again she is no longer with him and he's currently in jail for a bunch of crimes he commited maybe that's the way your mom feels talk to her and make her see that someone who is capable of hitting her is not worth it and it's not someone who truthly loves her One Tree Hill (TV series) Humphrey Bogart Kodocha Sin City Knots Landing EastEnders Recurring South Park characters About a Boy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Inside Pitaten Megan Griffin Shaggy dog story Social rule W.I.T.C.H.
