how do i remove an old deck hello we recently started ripping out an old deck that was in our backyard it was rotting and falling apart and so we ripped off the top layer of wood well whoever installed it did a crazy good job there are huge bolts like they use on street lights holding these huge boards together on top of that they cemented posts into the ground not being the world's best at working in the yard should i hire someone to complete the removal if so how much will it cost if you think i can do it by myself where do i start thanks so much it will be hard work to do it yourself you can use a reciprocating saw with a metal blade to cut the bolts having a few metal blades is a good idea as they might break or wear out wear eye protection and gardening gloves for safety maybe a face shield too using saw horses or some other form of support would be a good idea to support the boards when cutting them so they won't move in an unpredictable manner and possibly injure someone be careful and take your time safety first for the cemented posts you can dig around them to loosen them out of the ground using a tractor or a couple people with some strong rope or chain you should be able to pull the posts and cement out in one piece to dispose of the decking i would burn it if it was allowed if that isn't possible you can rent a garbage bin and throw it away there might be a place associated with your local dump where you can take wood waste you could haul it out yourself or hire a guy with a truck to take it away for you to make it more portable you might need to take the reciprocating saw with a wood blade to the boards to make them more manageable in length i think you can probably do it the most important things are to make sure you do everything as safely as possible and that you take your time Construction Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Home improvement Solar power The Brady Bunch Coalition Provisional Authority Table saw Work of the United States Government Oil-for-Food Programme Elevator Fred A.
