sunflower seeds clogged sink i can not reach down the drain to pull them out and have tried a coat hanger to push them through but the sink won't drain and the water just sits there how do i get these out without a plumber is it your kitchen sink and has two sides to it and one side has the disposal on it if so the you will need to clean out the pipe under the sink that sends the disposed food and water over to the drain side this happens to me when i put to many potato peels down the sink at once it's not hard but you will need a bucket to catch the water that drains out when you disconnect the trap just unscrew the pipe that looks like a u and clean out the connecting pipe over to the disposal this is usually what is clogged you will recognize right away where your problem is after you get it cleaned out screw all your pipes back together you may need a pair of channel locks to tighten them problem solved if it's a different sink just clean out the u shaped trap and that should take care of it Voltmeter Volt Electronics Measuring instrument Sensor Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Potentiometer Electrical generator Electrometer Electromotive force Galvanometer Ammeter Likelihood principle Langmuir probe Antenna (radio) Mains electricity Output impedance Hall effect Circuit design Spark plug Action potential Galvanic cell Microphone Electrocardiogram Light-emitting diode Distribution board Ion selective electrode Thermal power station Conductor (material) Oxygen sensor Capacitor Audiophile Power (physics) Electrical resistance Root mean square Decibel Ventricular fibrillation Impedance X-ray Capillary electrophoresis Scientific method Electrical network Three-phase electric power Phase-locked loop Voltage source Resistor Alternating current Electrophysiology High-voltage hazards Spectroscopy Operational amplifier Transformer Circuit breaker Linear regulator Fan (implement) Time-domain reflectometer Membrane potential Diode Second law of thermodynamics Voltage drop Inductor MOSFET Series and parallel circuits Power factor Gender of connectors and fasteners Wheatstone bridge Oscilloscope Transistor Analog-to-digital converter Analog signal Three-phase Field effect transistor Ohm's law Ampere Electricity Power supply Mass spectrometry Fusor Nixie tube Analytical chemistry Static inverter plant Piezoelectricity Light switch Signal-to-noise ratio Peltier-Seebeck effect Nondimensionalization Transmitter Electrical element RLC circuit Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Current (electricity) Battery (electricity) Coulometry Liquid crystal display Capacitance Gibbs free energy Digital-to-analog converter Systematic error Variable Frequency Drive
