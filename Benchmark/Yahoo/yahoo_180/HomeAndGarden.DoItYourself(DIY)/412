installing new gas range we bought a new gas range and thought installation was included when delivered but no i have to do it is this ok i am terrified of gas appliances and i don't want to blow up my house and kill my family my friends family say it is not rocket science but i don't want to screw it up the owner's manual says qualified installer must do the work but everyone says it is super easy and i can do it myself practical advise is appreciated if you can thread a nut onto a bolt you will have no problem with this that is if your old range was also gas turn off the gas to the old range and remove the flex pipe from the back of the range move the old range out of the way on the new range wrap the threads where the flex pipe attaches with teflon tape i always use wraps not sure why but i do make sure you wrap it in the right direction when looking at the open end of the threads you need to go in the clockwise direction if you do it wrong the tape will just come back off again now put a very little amount of pipe dope on top of the tape and thread on the flex pipe end tighten it up do not overtighten a to crescent wrench will work just fine now make sure all burners etc on the new stove are off and turn on the gas using a strong solution of dishsoap and water pour a little bit over your new connection and over all conections just to make sure and watch for bubbles no bubbles move your new stove into position and fire it up to let it burn in for a bit it's very easy if you take your time i used to pipefit on gas pipelines where there was psi in your house you'll have maybe or have fun with your new stove Kitchen Stove Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Fire extinguisher Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Dishwasher Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets M16 (rifle) BS 1363 Dishwashing Fire Microwave oven National Electrical Code (US) Haloalkane Residual-current device Socket Fluorescent lamp Electrical wiring (UK) Thermal power station Oxyacetylene Bullet Spark plug Refrigerator Fuse (electrical) Domestic water system Screw Lighting Sewage treatment Incandescent light bulb Fuzzy logic Diving regulator Electrical wiring Shotgun Novelty (locomotive) Safety engineering Internal ballistics Common electrical adaptors in Hong Kong and the United Kingdom Shell (projectile) Gender Timer Glossary of firefighting equipment Portable stove Hydrogen peroxide Textile manufacturing Wire wrap Tire Slow cooker Spark gap Mortar (weapon) Central heating Bong Fireworks Nuclear reactor Firefighter Space Shuttle external tank Violet wand Elevator Hand grenade Automobile Restaurant Airbag Fire safety Jack plug Ford Crown Victoria Foodborne illness Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Gender of connectors and fasteners Getaway Special Coupling (railway) High-voltage hazards Major appliance USS Angler (SS-240) Diesel engine Frankfurt kitchen Kitchener, Ontario Carding Cookware and bakeware Schuko Stairway B-47 Stratojet Plastic M4 Carbine Renewable energy Two-stroke cycle Alcohol fuel Lighter M61 Vulcan Ceramics Commodore 64 Relay Double bass Toyota Prius Machine gun Suppressor D-subminiature Vacuum tube Steam engine Laboratory Vacuum
