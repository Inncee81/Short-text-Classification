i have an idea for an invention how would i go about making it real i just want it for my personal use i want a large dog to make me feel a little more protected when i'm home alone but i'm allergic so i want to make an invention to help me out when the doorbell rings or someone comes to the door i want to have a recording of a large dog barking loudly what material would i need to do this i don't care about price i'm guessing i'd need a motion detector maybe wow uh no i don't want to make money off of it i want to use it for personal protection this is old school' all you need to do is decide how you'll store your recording on computer aduo disk etc wire that to the motion sensor or pressure sensor so it turns the device on i may consider running my line from the motion sensor to a solenoid the sensor will only give an output if motion is detected this output can activate the solenoid the solenoid can complete the connections for my disk player mp ect now if you really want to get fancy you could use three sets of speakers on your downstairs for example one on the furthest point from the door the next midway and the last right behind the door now make the sound begin from the furthest point and approach the listener to create the illusion of a dog running toward the door i'll leave that project to you its not as hard as it sounds if you're into electronics like you should be if you're considering this project to begin with you would do wise looking at some circuits currently used in similar devices remember too use can use an opamp instead of the solenoid i described i'm old school so this is my way of doing business have fun with it Burglar alarm Diamond Door Fire alarm control panel Berkshire Hathaway Digital photography Sears Holdings Corporation Retailer Upholstery Illegal drug trade Price discrimination Mutual fund Wal-Mart European Installation Bus Bond Rational pricing Sam Walton Federal Reserve Citigroup Floppy disk Stock Glossary of firefighting equipment Council house Pricing Closed-end fund Tax Arbitrage pricing theory Microeconomics Capital asset pricing model Traffic light Finance Commodore 64 Hard disk Glossary of firefighting terms FairTax MTR Combine (Half-Life 2) Black-Scholes McDonnell Douglas DC-10 Modern portfolio theory Monetary policy Auto insurance Forward contract X10 (industry standard) Domotics Filling station The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money, and Power Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Big-box store Smoke detector Inferno (Doctor Who) Washroom Ice core Arbitrage Futures contract Mercedes-Benz A-Class Timeline of computing 1990-forward Eircom Japan-United States relations Enron Corporation Apollo 11 Tesco Electricity market Pizza delivery Video game crash of 1983 Kirby Corporation Grey market Sport utility vehicle Toronto-Dominion Bank Toyota Prius Southwest Airlines Anemometer Federal Standard 1037C E85 SS Morro Castle Diamond clarity Option Telecom New Zealand Day trading Steam (content delivery) Google Technical analysis Knight Rider INSTEON Kazaa Central bank Real estate broker Port Authority Trans-Hudson Market Sales promotion Landmarks of Hoboken, New Jersey Infrared homing Dodge Charger Security guard Al Gore controversies Wayne Corporation Pixel Sobeys
