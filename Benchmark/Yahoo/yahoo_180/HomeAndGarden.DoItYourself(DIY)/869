layers of cement stick together i'm wanting to make a cement 'cap' to put on top of a heavy black plastic pipe to make the cap i was going to pour about an inch of cement into a box and let it dry then i was going to set the pipe on top of that and pour a second layer which would go to the outside of the pipe my question is will the layers of cement stick to each other if not is there a better way to do it thanks i am not sure why you are doing this but no the layers of concrete will not bond together very well also a one inch layer of concrete will be very brittle and weak the best way to do this would be to make the cap in a single pour you may need to find a way to brace your plastic pipe duct tape may help with this lol can't imagine what you are doing i don't think it is going to turn out well goodluck anyway The Star Wars Holiday Special Domain Name System Red-black tree Public-key cryptography Floppy disk Yearbook My Little Pony Mail Direct marketing Fiberglass Time Inc.
